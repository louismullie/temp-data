## Question

Does lethicin help with metabolic syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether lecithin helps with metabolic syndrome and how to interpret the evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "lecithin" means in supplements versus food and its core biochemistry. Then, I should define metabolic syndrome and the outcomes that would matter clinically. Next, I will look for direct clinical trials of oral lecithin or phosphatidylcholine in people with metabolic syndrome. After that, I need to consider indirect evidence and potential mechanisms that could be favorable or unfavorable. Finally, I will weigh safety issues and synthesize a recommendation grounded in the available data and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because "lecithin" is not a single molecule. Wait, let me verify that most commercial lecithin is a phospholipid mixture dominated by phosphatidylcholine, with variable content and often other phospholipids mixed in, and that this heterogeneity complicates interpretation of "lecithin" studies and diet exposures, which is why some authors argue the "lecithin" on labels may not match the phosphatidylcholine used in research [^113MwUi9].

> I need to ensure we're precise about the target condition. Metabolic syndrome is defined by a cluster of risk factors such as central obesity, high triglycerides, low HDL-C, hypertension, and impaired fasting glucose; the dyslipidemia component is typically high TG, low HDL-C, and an increased proportion of small dense LDL particles, reflecting altered lipoprotein metabolism and insulin resistance [^112FSC3m].

> Next, I should review direct clinical evidence. Hold on, I should verify whether randomized trials have tested oral lecithin or phosphatidylcholine specifically in people with metabolic syndrome. I find a small crossover RCT in healthy postmenopausal women testing soy lecithin 20 g/day that showed an improved HDL/LDL ratio but no significant change in endothelial function, which is suggestive of a lipid effect but not definitive for MetS outcomes in the general population [^113DTic5]. Let me also check NAFLD studies because NAFLD often coexists with MetS; several studies of polyenylphosphatidylcholine (Essentiale/PPC) report improvements in ultrasound steatosis and liver enzymes, including the MANPOWER program and a real-world observational cohort, but these were not designed as MetS trials and are limited by small samples, heterogeneity, and lack of hard outcomes, so I should be cautious in extrapolating to MetS per se [^114ZK8F9] [^111PRM5Y] [^112D6jR8]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought these NAFLD data might count as MetS evidence; but on second thought, I should correct that: while NAFLD is the hepatic manifestation of MetS, these PPC trials enrolled patients with NAFLD and metabolic comorbidities rather than testing MetS diagnostic criteria as endpoints, so they remain indirect and hypothesis-generating for MetS rather than definitive [^113gb4M7].

> Now, I will examine mechanistic plausibility. Lecithin supplies phosphatidylcholine, a substrate for LCAT, the enzyme that esterifies free cholesterol on HDL and facilitates reverse cholesterol transport. Increasing LCAT activity could theoretically raise HDL-C and remodel HDL particles, which might mitigate atherogenic dyslipidemia seen in MetS, and short-term infusions of recombinant human LCAT in phase 2 trials did raise HDL-C and reduced small LDL particle number, supporting biological plausibility but not establishing efficacy of oral lecithin in MetS populations [^117EhAdC] [^113ErFSB] [^114yGmZv] [^113jf5Wt]. Let me consider the lipoprotein axis further: aerobic exercise increases LCAT activity and shifts lipoproteins toward a less atherogenic profile, reinforcing that LCAT is a relevant node, but again this does not validate oral lecithin as a therapy for MetS without dedicated trials [^114GhpML].

> But wait, what if oral phosphatidylcholine has off-target effects that worsen cardiometabolic risk? I should double-check the TMAO pathway. Microbial metabolism of dietary phosphatidylcholine produces trimethylamine-N-oxide, which has been associated with higher incident cardiovascular events in observational cohorts; while causality remains debated, this potential risk signal means I need to weigh oral lecithin supplementation cautiously, especially in people with established cardiovascular risk or persistent chylomicronemia where lipid handling is abnormal [^115p8akS]. Hold on, I should verify whether any guideline endorses raising HDL-C per se; the National Lipid Association emphasizes that HDL-C is not a therapeutic target and that HDL-raising agents have failed to improve outcomes, so I should not assume that lecithin-induced HDL changes would translate into clinical benefit even if they occur [^116da9qC].

> I will now examine safety and formulation issues. Let me reconsider the variability in "lecithin" products. Regulatory labeling allows a mix of phospholipids under the same name, so composition differs from the phosphatidylcholine used in research, complicating both efficacy inference and safety assessment, and high-dose oral lecithin may also function as an emulsifier, which in animal models has been linked to gut barrier effects and low-grade inflammation, though human clinical relevance remains uncertain [^113MwUi9]. I should confirm whether there are any specific contraindications. In patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia or chylomicronemia, the handling of exogenous lipid loads is impaired, so caution is prudent even if the fat content of lecithin is modest compared with triglyceride sources [^116xsn5N].

> Let me synthesize. Based on the available evidence, there are no adequately powered randomized trials demonstrating that oral lecithin or phosphatidylcholine improves metabolic syndrome outcomes or its components, and current guidelines do not recommend lecithin as therapy for MetS. Therefore, lecithin cannot be recommended for treating metabolic syndrome outside of a research setting [^notfound]. Small studies suggest possible lipid profile shifts, and mechanistic data support the concept that LCAT activation can remodel HDL, but these are insufficient to establish clinical efficacy or to outweigh the uncertain cardiovascular implications of chronic oral phosphatidylcholine exposure via the TMAO axis and the heterogeneity of over-the-counter products [^115p8akS] [^113MwUi9].

> Next, I should review evidence-based alternatives for MetS, because the user may be seeking practical steps. Lifestyle therapy remains first-line, with particular benefit from aerobic exercise that modulates HDL and LDL subfractions via LCAT and related pathways, and structured dietary patterns that reduce saturated fat and emphasize complex carbohydrates and fiber can improve multiple MetS components; low-carbohydrate interventions and omega-3 fatty acids have supportive randomized evidence for improving triglycerides and other markers, though effects vary by population and dose, and pharmacotherapy should be individualized to risk and phenotype rather than targeting HDL-C per se [^114GhpML] [^114miZsu] [^111EziJQ] [^116da9qC]. For patients with NAFLD and MetS comorbidities, polyenylphosphatidylcholine may be considered adjunctively for liver-related endpoints, but expectations should be modest and decisions individualized pending larger, high-quality trials [^114ZK8F9].

> Bottom line, I should conclude clearly. No, current evidence does not support using lecithin to treat metabolic syndrome; the data are too limited, heterogeneous, and indirect, and potential risks from microbial metabolites and product variability further temper enthusiasm. Management should focus on guideline-directed lifestyle and pharmacologic strategies tailored to MetS components, reserving investigational phospholipid approaches for specific contexts like NAFLD under clinical supervision [^116da9qC] [^114ZK8F9].

Lecithin (phosphatidylcholine) **does not have strong evidence** for treating metabolic syndrome [^notfound]. Small studies suggest modest improvements in lipid profiles [^113DTic5], but **no robust trials** show consistent benefits on insulin resistance, blood pressure, or waist circumference. Lecithin is **generally safe**, but concerns about TMAO [^115p8akS] and emulsifier effects [^113MwUi9] warrant caution. It is **not recommended as primary therapy**; prioritize lifestyle and evidence-based pharmacotherapy [^notfound].

## Evidence on lecithin and metabolic syndrome

### Clinical studies

- **Soy lecithin and endothelial function**: A small RCT in healthy postmenopausal women (25 participants) found no significant effect on endothelial function (FMD) but did show a modest improvement in the HDL/LDL ratio with soy lecithin (20 g/day) [^113DTic5].

- **Phosphatidylcholine and NAFLD**: Studies in NAFLD (a hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome) suggest phosphatidylcholine may improve liver enzymes and steatosis, but evidence is limited and not specific to metabolic syndrome [^114ZK8F9] [^112D6jR8].

- **LCAT and HDL metabolism**: Lecithin is a substrate for LCAT, which esterifies cholesterol and may theoretically improve HDL function; however, clinical trials of recombinant LCAT (MEDI6012) show HDL increases without proven cardiovascular benefit [^115QvZNq] [^113jf5Wt].

---

### Mechanistic considerations

- **LCAT activation**: Lecithin provides phosphatidylcholine, a substrate for LCAT, which esterifies cholesterol and may enhance HDL maturation and reverse cholesterol transport [^113ErFSB].

- **TMAO production**: Microbial metabolism of lecithin generates TMAO, a proatherogenic metabolite linked to increased cardiovascular risk, raising safety concerns [^115p8akS].

- **Emulsifier effects**: Lecithin, as an emulsifier, may alter gut microbiota and promote inflammation, potentially worsening metabolic syndrome features [^113MwUi9].

---

## Safety considerations

- **General safety**: Lecithin is generally well tolerated, with mild gastrointestinal symptoms reported.

- **TMAO concerns**: Elevated TMAO levels associated with lecithin metabolism may increase cardiovascular risk, particularly in susceptible individuals [^115p8akS].

- **Emulsifier risks**: Potential emulsifier-related effects on gut microbiota and inflammation require caution, especially with chronic high-dose use [^116odLw7].

## Comparison with established therapies

| **Therapy** | **Evidence level** | **Effect on metabolic syndrome components** |
|-|-|-|
| Lifestyle interventions (diet, exercise) | High | - Significant improvements in insulin resistance <br/> - Lipid profiles <br/> - Blood pressure <br/> - And weight [^114GhpML] [^114miZsu] |
| Pharmacotherapy (metformin, statins, fibrates, omega-3 fatty acids) | High | - Significant improvements in glucose metabolism <br/> - Lipid profiles <br/> - And cardiovascular risk [^116vsSKH] [^112qigJc] |
| Lecithin | Low | - Modest lipid improvements in small studies <br/> - No consistent effects on insulin resistance <br/> - Blood pressure <br/> - Or weight [^113DTic5] |

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert opinions

Current guidelines **do not recommend lecithin** for metabolic syndrome management; emphasis remains on lifestyle interventions and evidence-based pharmacotherapy [^116vsSKH].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Lecithin shows **limited and inconsistent evidence** for metabolic syndrome, with modest lipid effects and no proven impact on core components such as insulin resistance, blood pressure, or weight. Given TMAO and emulsifier concerns, lecithin is **not recommended as primary therapy**; prioritize lifestyle and pharmacologic treatments.

### Effect of soy isoflavone protein and soy lecithin on endothelial function in healthy postmenopausal women [^113DTic5]. Menopause (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the effects of soy isoflavone protein concentrate and soy lecithin on endothelial function, measured as flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery in healthy postmenopausal women.

Design

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial with 25 participants (mean age, 61 years; body mass index, 25.46 kg/m2). The women underwent endothelial function testing at baseline and after 4 weeks of randomly assigned treatment with intervening 4-week washout periods. Treatment assignments included soy isoflavone protein (25 g/day) and soy lecithin (20 g/day), soy isoflavone protein (25 g/day) and placebo lecithin, placebo protein and soy lecithin (20 g/day), and double placebo. FMD and serum lipid levels were assessed at baseline and the end of each 4-week treatment phase.

Results

Twenty-two women completed the trial. No statistically significant (P > 0.05) difference was seen in FMD between treatment groups. A trend was suggested with FMD highest after treatment with soy protein plus lecithin (7.50 ± 9.85), followed by soy protein (5.51 ± 10.11), soy lecithin (5.35 ± 6.13), and lowest after placebo (4.53 ± 7.84). Soy isoflavone protein and soy lecithin significantly increased the high-density lipoprotein/low-density lipoprotein ratio (soy isoflavone protein plus soy lecithin, 0.64 ± 0.19, P < 0.0001; soy isoflavone protein plus placebo lecithin, 0.58 ± 0.17, P = 0.0058; placebo protein plus soy lecithin, 0.65 ± 0.18, P < 0.0001) relative to the baseline value (0.49 ± 0.15).

Conclusions

In this sample of healthy postmenopausal women, soy isoflavone protein and soy lecithin significantly improved the lipid profile. A favorable influence on endothelial function could not be confirmed.

### Plasma cholesteryl ester transfer, but not cholesterol esterification, is related to lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2: possible contribution to an atherogenic lipoprotein profile [^115VLqJL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Plasma lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2) (Lp-PLA(2)) predicts incident cardiovascular disease and is associated preferentially with negatively charged apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins. The plasma cholesteryl ester transfer (CET) process, which contributes to low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and small, dense low-density lipoproteins, is affected by the composition and concentration of apolipoprotein B-containing cholesteryl ester acceptor lipoproteins.

Objective

We tested relationships of CET with Lp-PLA(2) in subjects with and without metabolic syndrome (MetS).

Design and Setting

In 68 subjects with MetS and 74 subjects without MetS, plasma Lp-PLA(2) mass, cholesterol esterification (EST), lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity level, CET, CET protein (CETP) mass, and lipoproteins were measured.

Results

EST, LCAT activity, CET (P < 0.001 for all), and CETP (P = 0.030) were increased, and Lp-PLA(2) was decreased (P = 0.043) in MetS. CET was correlated positively with Lp-PLA(2) in subjects with and without MetS (P < 0.05 for both). EST and LCAT activity were unrelated to Lp-PLA(2), despite a positive correlation between EST and CET (P < 0.001). After controlling for age, sex, and diabetes status, CET was determined by Lp-PLA(2) in the whole group (β = 0.245; P < 0.001), and in subjects with (β = 0.304; P = 0.001) and without MetS (β = 0.244; P = 0.006) separately, independently of triglycerides and CETP.

Conclusions

Plasma CET is related to Lp-PLA(2) in subjects with and without MetS. The process of CET, but not EST, may be influenced by Lp-PLA(2). These findings provide a rationale to evaluate whether maneuvers that inhibit Lp-PLA(2) will reduce CET, and vice versa to document effects of CETP inhibition on Lp-PLA(2).

### Novel therapies focused on the high-density lipoprotein particle [^114FThbY]. Circulation Research (2014). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a major burden for morbidity and mortality in the general population, despite current efficacious low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol-lowering therapies. Consequently, novel therapies are required to reduce this residual risk. Prospective epidemiological studies have shown that high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels are inversely correlated with cardiovascular disease risk, and this initiated the quest for HDL-C-increasing therapies. Consequently, several different targets in HDL metabolism have been identified. Initial studies addressing the effect of cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibition on cardiovascular disease outcome have been discontinued for reasons of futility or increased mortality. As of yet, 2 cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors are still in phase III studies. Other HDL-based interventions, such as apolipoprotein A1-based compounds, ABC-transporter upregulators, selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor modulators and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase-based therapy, hold great promise for the future. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of HDL-targeted pharmaceutical strategies in humans, both in early development as well as in late stage clinical trials.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^116da9qC]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and metabolic syndrome — low HDL-C is a component of metabolic syndrome, a direct mechanistic relationship between low HDL and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is not fully understood, and genetic and clinical trial evidence do not support targeting HDL-C levels themselves; single nucleotide polymorphisms that increase plasma HDL-C concentration in isolation were not associated with reduced risk of myocardial infarction, agents that markedly raise HDL-C including niacin and cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors have failed to demonstrate that they reduce all cause mortality, CHD mortality, myocardial infarction, or stroke in statin-treated patients, and "at this time, HDL-C is not recommended as a target of therapy per se". Available evidence from meta-analyses suggests that metabolic syndrome is independently associated with ASCVD risk, "essentially doubling the risk", and HDL-C level is often raised as a consequence of efforts to reduce atherogenic cholesterol through lifestyle and drug therapies.

### The 6th annual world congress on the insulin resistance syndrome [^111HqLXu]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

There are a number of mechanisms by which HDL may decrease atherosclerosis. HDL acts to mediate reverse cholesterol transport. Cholesterol derived from LDL is modified and binds to scavenger receptor SR-B1 in tissues, particularly the vasculature, activating macrophage ATP-binding cassette, subfamily A (ABCA1) and ABCG1 receptors, leading macrophage cholesterol to be taken up by lipid-poor apolipoprotein A1 after binding with the ABCA1 transporter. Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) leads to formation of pre–β-HDL, comprising 5% of circulating HDL. Further action of LCAT leads to formation of α-HDL, comprising 95% of circulating HDL, which binds to the SR-B1 receptor and ABCG1 transporter, then delivering cholesterol to LDL via cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). LDL cholesterol can return to the liver or can be delivered to tissues, or direct uptake of α-HDL to the liver can occur via SR-B1. HDL may also exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, the latter by blocking oxidized-LDL formation and taking up oxidized fatty acids. HDL can also decrease adhesion molecules, can increase NO synthase, can act to transport other molecules, can increase endothelial stem cells, may have role in binding endotoxin and acting as an anti-infectious agent, and may have antithrombotic effects.

### A lipid to treat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease-the dawn of' lipo-rehabilitation'? [^1116DJxA]. Journal of Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Nuclear hormone receptors regulate diverse metabolic pathways and the orphan nuclear receptor LRH-1 (also known as NR5A2) regulates bile acid biosynthesis. Structural studies have identified phospholipids as potential LRH-1 ligands, but their functional relevance is unclear. Here we show that an unusual phosphatidylcholine species with two saturated 12 carbon fatty acid acyl sidechains (dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine (DLPC)) is an LRH-1 agonist ligand in vitro. DLPC treatment induces bile acid biosynthetic enzymes in mouse liver, increases bile acid levels, and lowers hepatictriglycerides and serum glucose. DLPC treatment also decreases hepatic steatosis and improves glucose homeostasis in two mouse models of insulin resistance. Both the antidiabetic and lipotropic effects are lost in liver-specific Lrh-1 knockouts. These findings identify an LRH-1 dependent phosphatidylcholine signalling pathway that regulates bile acid metabolism and glucose homeostasis.

### Metabolic abnormalities: high-density lipoproteins [^117NPPZL]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The dyslipidemia typically found in subjects with the metabolic syndrome includes an elevated concentration of plasma triglyceride, a low-density lipoprotein fraction in which the particles are smaller and denser than normal, and a low concentration of highdensity lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. This article is concerned with the low HDL component. It provides an overview of HDL structure and metabolism and describes the functions of HDLs that may be cardioprotective. The article then outlines what is known about the concentration and subpopulation distribution of HDLs in the metabolic syndrome. Possible mechanisms responsible for the low HDL are discussed. The consequences of a low HDL concentration in this syndrome are addressed before the article concludes with a discussion of whether low HDL in the metabolic syndrome should be a therapeutic target.

### Unraveling the causal pathway between phosphatidylinositol, metabolites, and metabolic syndrome: a mendelian randomization study [^112pvVUY]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is characterized by a constellation of metabolic abnormalities, including dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, and insulin resistance, all of which synergistically increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). In recent years, the prevalence of MetS has persistently increased, posing a significant public health challenge on a global scale. Epidemiological studies reveal that MetS affects approximately 6–39% of adolescents globally, with prevalence rates in adults ranging from 20–25%. These findings underscore the profound impact of MetS as a widespread public health issue, placing a substantial burden on healthcare systems worldwide. Therefore, a comprehensive investigation into the pathological mechanisms underlying MetS, coupled with the development of potential therapeutic strategies, is of significant scientific and clinical importance.

Phosphatidylinositol (PI) is an essential phospholipid in the human body that produces seven distinct phosphorylated inositol lipids. It functions as a fundamental component of the cell membrane, significantly contributing to cell signaling and membrane transport. PI is intricately linked with insulin resistance, obesity, inflammation, and other critical aspects of MetS, affecting glucose-lipid metabolism through various pathways that facilitate the progression of MetS. Conversely, emerging studies propose that PI might also regulate lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis, potentially exerting an anti-obesity effect by modulating the expression of specific genes involved in hepatic lipid metabolism through diverse metabolic pathways. Derivatives of PI, such as PI3, may serve as insulin sensitizers, offering potential therapeutic benefits in ameliorating metabolic disorders. The complex mechanisms through which PI influences MetS underscore the intricate nature of their relationship, with the causal link between them remaining to be fully elucidated.

Adipocyte fatty acid and triglyceride sources — adipocytes undergo limited de novo synthesis of triglycerides and also receive lipids from circulation, including hepatically-secreted triglyceride-rich lipoproteins such as very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and their remnants, triglyceride-rich chylomicrons and their remnants, and fatty acids attached to albumin; lipoprotein lipase (LPL) on adipose tissue capillary endothelial cells hydrolyzes triglyceride-rich lipoproteins to generate fatty acids and glycerol, which enter adipocytes and may be re-esterified with glycerol to (re)form triglycerides.

### Intestinal microbial metabolism of phosphatidylcholine and cardiovascular risk [^115p8akS]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

Recent studies in animals have shown a mechanistic link between intestinal microbial metabolism of the choline moiety in dietary phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) and coronary artery disease through the production of a proatherosclerotic metabolite, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). We investigated the relationship among intestinal microbiota-dependent metabolism of dietary phosphatidylcholine, TMAO levels, and adverse cardiovascular events in humans.

Methods

We quantified plasma and urinary levels of TMAO and plasma choline and betaine levels by means of liquid chromatography and online tandem mass spectrometry after a phosphatidylcholine challenge (ingestion of two hard-boiled eggs and deuterium [d9]-labeled phosphatidylcholine) in healthy participants before and after the suppression of intestinal microbiota with oral broad-spectrum antibiotics. We further examined the relationship between fasting plasma levels of TMAO and incident major adverse cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) during 3 years of follow-up in 4007 patients undergoing elective coronary angiography.

Results

Time-dependent increases in levels of both TMAO and its d9 isotopologue, as well as other choline metabolites, were detected after the phosphatidylcholine challenge. Plasma levels of TMAO were markedly suppressed after the administration of antibiotics and then reappeared after withdrawal of antibiotics. Increased plasma levels of TMAO were associated with an increased risk of a major adverse cardiovascular event (hazard ratio for highest vs. lowest TMAO quartile, 2.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.96 to 3.28; P < 0.001). An elevated TMAO level predicted an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events after adjustment for traditional risk factors (P < 0.001), as well as in lower-risk subgroups.

Conclusions

The production of TMAO from dietary phosphatidylcholine is dependent on metabolism by the intestinal microbiota. Increased TMAO levels are associated with an increased risk of incident major adverse cardiovascular events. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others.).

### AHA and NHLBI review diagnosis and management of the… [^116vsSKH]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

If non-HDL cholesterol levels remain elevated after the LDL goal is reached, at least two therapeutic options are available. First, intensification of LDL-lowering therapy often reduces non-HDL cholesterol levels. For example, statins lower LDL and non-HDL levels by a similar percentage; moreover, statins reduce the risk for ASCVD events in patients with the metabolic syndrome. A triglyceride-lowering drug also can be added to LDL-lowering therapy. Fibrates and nicotinic acid reduce non-HDL cholesterol, triglyceride, and small LDL particle levels, and they increase HDL levels in patients with the metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes. For this reason, combining a fibrate or nicotinic acid with LDL-lowering treatment is an option. If a statin is being used as LDL-lowering therapy, fenofibrate is preferable to gemfibrozil because risk for severe myopathy appears to be lower in patients taking fenofibrate in combination with statins.

Patients with impaired fasting glucose levels, impaired glucose tolerance, or diabetes who are treated with nicotinic acid should be monitored for worsening of hyperglycemia. Lower doses of nicotinic acid lessen this risk. Some investigators support the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as first-line therapy for hypertension in patients with the metabolic syndrome, especially when type 2 diabetes or chronic renal disease is present. Angiotensin receptor blockers may be used in patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors or as an alternative to ACE inhibitors in patients who have left ventricular dysfunction. ELEVATED FASTING GLUCOSE Weight reduction, increased physical activity, or both may delay or prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes in patients with the metabolic syndrome and IFG. In addition, metformin, thiazolidinediones, and acarbose will lower the risk of type 2 diabetes in persons with IFG or IGT.

These agents are recommended in patients with established ASCVD. Their effectiveness in patients with type 2 diabetes without ASCVD has not been established conclusively, although they are widely recommended for these patients. In patients with the metabolic syndrome who are at moderately high risk of ASCVD events, aspirin prophylaxis is a reasonable therapeutic option.

### Familial chylomicronemia syndrome: an expert clinical review from the National Lipid Association [^11284BEj]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

APOC3 inhibitor therapies in FCS — while promising, current evidence is limited to short-term triglyceride lowering and key uncertainties remain about longer-term outcomes, safety, and practical access. While novel APOC3 inhibitors show promise, their long-term efficacy, safety, and impact on quality of life remain largely understudied. Current clinical trials report significant TG reductions over a 1-year period, but there are no data on long-term outcomes, adverse effects, and the management of concomitant conditions. It remains unclear whether these agents will enable patients with FCS to liberalize their fat intake, further data on these agents in children are needed, and practical considerations related to cost and accessibility must be addressed.

### Recognition and management of persistent chylomicronemia: a joint expert clinical consensus by the National Lipid Association and the American Society for Preventive Cardiology [^116EbgCD]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Persistent chylomicronemia — subtype classification and alarm features: Considering PC as encompassing varied complication risk, the authors suggest classification of PC into 4 subtypes, with the first being genetically confirmed familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) and the second being clinical FCS; most patients fall into subtypes 3 and 4. The third subtype, "PC with alarm features", requires chylomicronemia on at least 3 occasions plus at least 1 feature such as recurrent acute pancreatitis not due to cholelithiasis or ethanol, recurrent hospitalizations for severe abdominal pain without another cause, pancreatitis in childhood, family history of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis, or postheparin lipoprotein lipase activity < 20% of normal value. The fourth subtype, "PC with no alarm features", remains high risk and consists of individuals with recurrent TG ≥ 1000 mg/dL in more than half of multiple measurements after making lifestyle modifications and receiving medical interventions.

### MEDI6012: recombinant human lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein receptor-mediated reverse cholesterol transport [^112vWJF7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

LDL‐C, ApoB, and LDL Particle Number

We hypothesized that enhancement of LDL receptor–mediated RCT would result in the transfer of cholesterol and CE from HDL particles to LDL particles, resulting in an increase in LDL‐C content but no increase in LDL particle number. There was no change in baseline‐adjusted AUC 0–96h for LDL‐C in the 24‐ and 80‐mg IV or the 80‐mg SC dose groups (Figures 2E and 3E). However, at higher doses, LDL‐C increased in the 240‐mg IV group (P = 0.096) and the 800‐mg IV group (P = 0.002). The peak in LDL‐C occurred on day 4, following the peak in HDL‐CE on days 2 to 3 (Figure 2B). Baseline‐adjusted AUC 0–96h for apoB significantly decreased across all intravenous dose cohorts of MEDI6012 (Figures 2F and 3F) and was not dose dependent.

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to measure the effect of MEDI6012 on lipoprotein particle size and number. An increase in LDL particle size was observed at all dose levels except the 80‐mg SC group. A decrease in total LDL particle number was observed at the 80‐ and 240‐mg IV doses. Marked maximum decreases in small LDL particles of 41 ± 26%, 88 ± 7%, and 79 ± 21% were seen at the 80‐, 240‐, and 800‐mg IV dose levels, respectively (Figure 4A), and an increase in large LDL particles was seen in the 240‐ and 800‐mg IV dose groups (data not shown).

### Familial lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency: first-in-human treatment with enzyme replacement [^115BYg7B]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Humans with familial lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency (FLD) have extremely low or undetectable high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and by early adulthood develop many manifestations of the disorder, including corneal opacities, anemia, and renal disease.

Objective

To determine if infusions of recombinant human LCAT (rhLCAT) could reverse the anemia, halt progression of renal disease, and normalize HDL in FLD.

Methods

rhLCAT (ACP-501) was infused intravenously over 1 hour on 3 occasions in a dose optimization phase (0.3, 3.0, and 9.0 mg/kg), then 3.0 or 9.0 mg/kg every 1 to 2 weeks for 7 months in a maintenance phase. Plasma lipoproteins, lipids, LCAT levels, and several measures of renal function and other clinical labs were monitored.

Results

LCAT concentration peaked at the end of each infusion and decreased to near baseline over 7 days. Renal function generally stabilized or improved and the anemia improved. After infusion, HDL-C rapidly increased, peaking near normal in 8 to 12 hours; analysis of HDL particles by various methods all revealed rapid sequential disappearance of preβ-HDL and small α-4 HDL and appearance of normal α-HDL. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased more slowly than HDL-C. Of note, triglyceride routinely decreased after meals after infusion, in contrast to the usual postprandial increase in the absence of rhLCAT infusion.

Conclusions

rhLCAT infusions were well tolerated in this first-in-human study in FLD; the anemia improved, as did most parameters related to renal function in spite of advanced disease. Plasma lipids transiently normalized, and there was rapid sequential conversion of small preβ-HDL particles to mature spherical α-HDL particles.

### Structure and function of lysosomal phospholipase A2 and lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase [^117EhAdC]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Lysosomal phospholipase A2 (LPLA2) and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) belong to a structurally uncharacterized family of key lipid-metabolizing enzymes responsible for lung surfactant catabolism and for reverse cholesterol transport, respectively. Whereas LPLA2 is predicted to underlie the development of drug-induced phospholipidosis, somatic mutations in LCAT cause fish eye disease and familial LCAT deficiency. Here we describe several high-resolution crystal structures of human LPLA2 and a low-resolution structure of LCAT that confirms its close structural relationship to LPLA2. Insertions in the α/β hydrolase core of LPLA2 form domains that are responsible for membrane interaction and binding the acyl chains and head groups of phospholipid substrates. The LCAT structure suggests the molecular basis underlying human disease for most of the known LCAT missense mutations, and paves the way for rational development of new therapeutics to treat LCAT deficiency, atherosclerosis and acute coronary syndrome.

Acylation of ApoAI at Lysine 88 and HDL‐C/HDL Efflux

We suspect acylation at K88 is an enzymatically mediated process because incubation of canonical ApoAI with palmitic acid did not spontaneously produce acylated proteoforms. Furthermore, acylated proteoforms of ApoAII were not observed, which argues that acylation is not a random occurrence on abundant HDL‐associated proteins.

We also hypothesize that the abundance of K88acylApoAI may be a marker of the overall metabolic activity of ApoAI on HDL. ApoAI is known to exist in unbound and HDL‐bound forms. Interestingly, the fatty acids that are present on the acylated forms of ApoAI are the most prevalent fatty acids on HDL particles, implying that the fatty acids added to ApoAI are derived from fatty acids imbedded in HDL particles (Figure 7C). We hypothesize that ApoAI acylation may be a consequence of promiscuous activity of HDL‐maturation enzymes that use fatty acids as substrates (such as LCAT or PLTP, involved in cholesterol esterification and phospholipid formation, respectively). Thus, individuals with a larger percentage of K88acylApoAI may not only have more HDL‐active ApoAI, but also better HDL maturation (higher lecithin‐cholesterol acyltransferase or phospholipid transfer protein activity) and consequently more reverse cholesterol transport and TG exchange with apoB particles, and potentially lower risk for developing advanced or unstable atherosclerosis. Conversely, a higher percentage of canonical ApoAI may represent a larger relative amount of free, non‐metabolically active ApoAI, which may explain its inverse association with HDL‐C.

The lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) enzyme is responsible for the synthesis of cholesteryl esters in human plasma and plays a critical role in high density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism. Genetic LCAT deficiency is a rare metabolic disorder characterized by low HDL cholesterol levels. This paper reviews the genetic and biochemical features of LCAT deficiency, highlighting the absence of enhanced preclinical atherosclerosis in carriers, despite the remarkably low HDL cholesterol.

Results

Baseline Characteristics and Treatment Allocation

The study randomized 48 individuals to MEDI6012 (n = 36) or placebo (n = 12) at MEDI6012 doses of 24, 80, 240, or 800 mg IV (n = 24) or doses of 80 or 600 mg SC (n = 12).

Baseline characteristics were generally balanced and reflected a population with stable coronary heart disease on statin therapy (Table 1). The mean age of trial participants was 64 years, and 81.3% were men. Baseline mean levels of HDL‐C were 34.7 ± 7.4 mg/dL and 39.1 ± 9.2 mg/dL in the MEDI6012 intravenous and subcutaneous groups, and 35.0 ± 12.8 mg/dL and 33.8 ± 7.1 mg/dL in the placebo intravenous and subcutaneous groups. Baseline mean levels of LDL‐C (direct assay) were 77.9 ± 24.3 mg/dL and 79.2 ± 16.6 mg/dL in the MEDI6012 intravenous and subcutaneous groups, and 79.4 ± 23.2 mg/dL and 84.3 ± 21.5 mg/dL in the placebo intravenous and subcutaneous groups.

2.3 Data Extraction

Two independent collaborators extracted data (S. A. A. and A.N.) from included studies. If they could not reach agreement regarding an item, the third reviewer resolved the disagreement (S. A.S.).

The data extracted from articles were the first author's name, publication year, design of the study, location of the study, important inclusion and exclusion criteria, total case number, total control number, mean and SD of LAP index for case and control groups, and sensitivity/specificity, area under the curve (AUC), and cut‐off values if reported. Additionally, for performing meta‐analysis, the LAP index values reported in mg/dL were converted to mmol/L.

2.4 Quality Assessment

The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 (QUADAS‐2) tool. This tool assesses studies across four different domains: patient selection, index test, reference standard, and flow/timing. Each domain consists of three signalling questions, scored as yes/no/unclear, indicating low risk of bias, high risk of bias, or inability to assess bias due to insufficient information, respectively. Additionally, QUADAS‐2 addresses applicability concerns through three different domains: patient selection, index test, and reference standard, with each domain also receiving low/high/unclear scores based on studies' information. Any disagreements were resolved through discussions with other reviewers. The graphical display template from the University of Bristol was used to visually represent the QUADAS‐2 assessment.

2.5 Publication Bias

Funnel plot and Egger's test with a significance level of p < 0.05 were used to assess publication bias.

### Ethyl EPA and ethyl DHA cause similar and differential changes in plasma lipid concentrations and lipid metabolism in subjects with low-grade chronic inflammation [^111EziJQ]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have been shown to similarly lower plasma TG concentrations but differentially regulate plasma LDL-C and HDL-C concentrations.

Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate the common and differential effects of these ω-3 fatty acids on plasma lipids and lipoproteins and to assess the metabolic mechanisms of the effects.

Methods

In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, we assessed the effect of 10-week supplementation with 3 g/d pure EPA and pure DHA (both as ethyl ester, ≥ 97% purity) on plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations and activities of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and lecithin:cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) in 21 older (> 50 y) men and postmenopausal women with some characteristics of metabolic syndrome and low-grade chronic inflammation.

Results

Both EPA and DHA lowered plasma TG concentrations and increased LDL-C/apoB and HDL-C/apoA-I ratios, but only DHA increased LDL-C concentrations. The reductions in plasma TG were inversely associated with the changes in LPL activity after both EPA and DHA supplementation. EPA lowered CETP, while DHA lowered LCAT activity. EPA and DHA worked differently in men and women, with DHA increasing LPL activity and LDL-C concentrations in women, but not in men.

Conclusions

EPA and DHA exerted similar effects on plasma TG, but differences were observed in LDL-C concentrations and activities of some enzymes involved in lipoprotein metabolism. It was also noted that EPA and DHA worked differently in men and women, supporting sex-specific variations in lipoprotein metabolism.

### Lipidomic signatures in Colombian adults with metabolic syndrome [^114RPiWK]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

MetS is a complex disorder with a cluster of different factors that are not identical across individuals; however, our study has pinpointed pathways that significantly contribute to the elevation of triacylglycerol levels and increased waist circumference, particularly prevalent in our population (Fig. 3). A noteworthy discovery in our investigation is the identification of DG (34:2) and DG (38:5), two metabolites not only positively associated with MetS but also correlated with three key MetS components, higher insulin levels, HOMA-IR index, and BMI. These metabolites show potential as key molecules in understanding the pathways underlying MetS. Additionally, DG (42:6), positively associated with MetS and three of its components, represents a novel finding not previously reported as a significant lipid in individuals with MetS. This suggests that DG (42:6) could be a metabolite specifically relevant to the Latin-American population.

Fig. 3
Lipid metabolic pathways associated with metabolic syndrome — MetS. Abdominal obesity and insulin resistance are the main mechanisms related to the alteration in lipid metabolism in the body. Plasma glucose and fatty acid levels are directly associated with dietary intake and stimulate lipogenesis pathways through various mechanisms. The subjects with MetS in this study presented an increase in the synthesis and degradation pathways of TG and DG. The increases in the TG and DG synthesis intermediates contribute to an alteration in the glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids pathways, generating a decrease in the synthesis and/or intermediates of these compounds. Abbreviations: FFA: Free Fatty acids; TG: triglycerides; PI: phosphatidylinositol; PC: phosphatidylcholine; PE: phosphatidylethanolamine; G3P: glycerol 3-phosphate; LPA: lysophosphatidic acid; PA: phosphatidic acid; DG: diacylglycerol; VLDL: very low-density lipoprotein; SM: sphingomyelin; FA: fatty acid

Limitations and perspectives

The findings from this study highlight molecules such as TG, DG, and SM as potential markers for progression in individuals with MetS. Follow-up studies are essential to investigate whether this lipidomic profile is associated with the development of complications. A potential limitation of this study is the storage time of the samples. Although these samples were appropriately preserved, and other studies have demonstrated the stability of lipids in long-term storage. However, some less stable molecules may have degraded, limiting the presentation of a complete lipidomic profile. Longitudinal studies tracking patients and their lipidomic profiles, along with the development of complications, would provide valuable insights into the utility of these biomarkers for managing adults at risk.

### Unraveling the causal pathway between phosphatidylinositol, metabolites, and metabolic syndrome: a mendelian randomization study [^113YSskn]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Observational studies have increasingly acknowledged the influence of Phosphatidylinositol (PI) on metabolic syndrome (MetS). Nevertheless, the causal association between PI and MetS remains unclear due to the presence of confounding factors and the potential for reverse causation in observational settings. This study seeks to clarify the causal link between PI and MetS while investigating the role of mediating metabolites.

Methods

A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to examine the association between PI and MetS, utilizing aggregated data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Additionally, a two-step MR approach was applied to quantify the mediation effect of metabolites on the PI-MetS relationship. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method served as the primary analytical approach, complemented by various sensitivity analyses employing alternative techniques.

Results

A significant positive association was found between genetically predicted PI and a 17% increased risk of MetS. Genetically predicted metabolites, including 4-cholesten-3-one (IVW: OR 1.264, 95% CI 1.076–1.483, p = 0.004), N-acetylalliin (IVW: OR 1.189, 95% CI 1.008–1.402, p = 0.040), and the Adenosine 5'-diphosphate to 5-oxoproline ratio (IVW: OR 1.191, 95% CI 1.045–1.357, p = 0.009), were each significantly associated with an increased risks of MetS, accounting for 14.50, 11.41%, 11.87% and % of the total effect, respectively. Notably, the Retinol to oleoyl-linoleoyl-glycerol ratio (IVW: OR 0.643, 95% CI 0.466–0.887, p = 0.007) mediated 62.6% of the effect, highlighting its pivotal role in the causal pathway linking PI to MetS. Moreover, 1-palmitoyl-2-dihomo-linolenoyl-GPC (IVW: OR 0.865, 95% CI 0.752–0.995, p = 0.042) and the Creatine to carnitine ratio (IVW: OR 0.853, 95% CI 0.740–0.983, p = 0.028) were associated with a reduced risk of MetS, demonstrating inhibitory effects within their respective pathways that accounted to 35.03% and 8.45% reductions in risk, respectively.

Conclusions

Our MR analysis demonstrated a positive association between PI and an increased risk of MetS. Furthermore, the metabolite-mediated PI significantly influenced MetS risk. These findings may offer valuable insights into the pathogenesis of MetS and inform future clinical research.

There are limited data on the efficacy and safety of fibrates for patients with FCS, and studies in FCS showed reductions in triglyceride levels only when used in combination with other interventions, such as fat restricted diet and MCT oil. Fibrates could be helpful in certain patients with FCS who have secondary causes of hypertriglyceridemia that raise VLDL, including obesity. Concerns with fibrates include the potential for myopathy/rhabdomyolysis (especially when given with statins), elevations in liver enzymes, and reversible increases in serum creatinine.

Discussion

Cross-sectional and prospective assessment of mother and child plasma lipidomic profiles in our study provided novel insights into the antenatal and postnatal lipid species in circulation. It also identified similarities between child and adult lipidomic profiles, and the intergenerational overlap in the plasma lipids associated with adiposity. Characterization of plasma lipidomic profiles not only confirmed the previous reports on the substantial changes in the lipid levels in pregnancy, but also provided an in-depth profile of lipidomic changes covering 480 lipid species from 25 lipid classes. Around 36% of the profiled lipids increased in circulation in pregnancy, with phosphatidylethanolamine levels changing the most. Compared to the gestating mother, cord blood showed lower concentration of most lipids (79%), and higher concentration of lysophospholipids, indicating the specific developmental needs of the growing fetus. A substantial number of proteins involved in lipid metabolism are expressed in fetal tissues, but the fetus itself is unable to independently support and maintain the plasma lipid pools. Hence the maternal-fetal transport of lipids through placenta supports these needs of the growing fetus. A decrease in the levels of lysophospholipids but elevated levels of phospholipids in maternal circulation are suggestive of the decrease in the activity of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) enzymes in mid to late gestation to facilitate the placental uptake of intact phospholipids for further metabolism and transport of lyso-PL to fetus. Among the phospholipids we also observed a decrease in the PC to PE ratio, especially in the phospholipids containing PUFA, such as DHA, indicating the preference for accumulation of DHA-PE in maternal circulation. Correspondingly, we also observed higher levels of phospholipid products including DHA-LPE and DHA-LPC in cord blood. A probe into the percentage contribution of polyunsaturated fatty acid composition of lysophosphatidylcholine in cord blood plasma revealed a higher percentage of PUFA (27%) than maternal (antenatal and postnatal) and child 6-year plasma (Additional file 1: Fig. S4). Previous stable isotope labeling experiments have shown that majority of the labeled fatty acids were incorporated into phospholipids with a significant enrichment of labeled DHA in cord blood compared to maternal and placental samples. The PUFA in PE and PC are predominantly present at the sn2 position of the phospholipid backbone, and the placental endothelial lipases cleave the sn1 fatty acid allowing the fetal uptake and transport of lyso-PL containing PUFA. Recent studies have identified MFSD2A as the lyso-PL transporter in placenta as well as brain. Transporters like MFSD2A provide an insight into the maternal-fetal transfer of PUFA containing lyso-PL and their enrichment in cord blood plasma. As PUFA are particularly important for brain and retina development, an increase in their levels in cord blood indicates their specific requirements for the growing fetus. Overall, we demonstrate that PUFA containing phospholipids are enriched in maternal circulation, but their breakdown products (lyso-PL) are depleted in circulation, which corroborates with their placental uptake and transport to the fetus.

### Unraveling the complexities of diet induced obesity and glucolipid dysfunction in metabolic syndrome [^116wiTm5]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Glucose enters the TCA cycle via acetyl CoA, to form citrate which is exported back to cytosol via citrate carrier in cases of nutrient abundance. In the cytosol, citrate is acted upon by the enzyme ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) which generates acetyl CoA in cytosol. Acetyl CoA is then converted to malonyl CoA by the enzyme acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) which is stimulated by cytosolic citrate. Following this, acetyl CoA condenses with multiple molecules of malonyl CoA via the enzyme fatty acid synthase (FASN) complex to generate palmitic acid (C16). FASN activity requires NADPH which is supplied by HMP shunt pathways. Palmitic acid can be converted to other saturated fatty acids such as stearic acid (C18) via fatty acid elongase enzyme systems. Palmitic acid can also be converted into unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid (C18:1, n-9) by desaturase enzyme namely stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). Insulin-mediated glucose uptake and insulin receptor signalling also promote the activity of ACLY to promote lipogenesis. Glucose entry into adipocytes stimulates carbohydrate-response element-binding protein (ChREBP), which then stimulates de novo lipogenesis. Feeding stimulated insulin secretion also acts on adipocytes to stimulate sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c which stimulates lipogenic enzymes such as ACLY, FASN and SCD. The actions of ChREBP and SREBP1c are complementary to each other. Insulin also activates liver X receptor (LXR), which is stabilized by glucose levels, also promote lipogenesis. The fatty acids synthesized in adipocytes and fatty acids obtained via chylomicron increase FFA concentrations in adipocytes, which are converted into TAG to prevent lipotoxicity. TAG biosynthesis requires enzymes like glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), phosphatidate phosphatase lipin 1(LPIN1) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT). The synthesized TAG is then stored in the form of lipid droplets (LDs) that require participation of proteins called perilipins (PLIN). There are multiples variants of PLINs namely PLIN1‒PLIN5, with PLIN1 regulating fasting lipolysis, and PLIN3 participating in LD biogenesis. PLIN5 is associated with BATs where they regulate LD degradation to obtain energy. Given the fact that adipocytes can obtain TAGs from fatty acids derived via de novo lipogenesis or dietary chylomicrons, studies reveal that majority (around 80–90%) of TAGs that are in LDs are composed of fatty acids derived from CMs. This begs the question that what is the importance of de novo lipogenesis in adipocytes?

### Plasma lipidomic profiling reveals metabolic adaptations to pregnancy and signatures of cardiometabolic risk: a preconception and longitudinal cohort study [^111nJ6fx]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Longitudinal lipidomic analyses illustrated the modulation of plasma lipidomic profiles from preconception to postpartum. Around 56% of lipid species increased in concentration in pregnancy as compared to both preconception and postpartum. These plasma lipidomic data were supplemented by the observation of an increase in total triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations as well. The most significant increase was observed in phospholipid classes PE and PI followed by an overall increase in TG concentrations. Although there was an increase in the concentrations of all the lipid species from PI and PE classes in pregnancy, upon consideration of the distribution of lipid species within the class, ARA containing species PI(16:0_20:4) and PI(18:0_20:4) as well as PC(18:0_20:4) and PE(18:0_20:4) were present at lower percentage of their respective total class concentrations as compared to both preconception and postpartum (Additional file 1: Fig. S12). At the same time, saturated, monounsaturated and DHA-containing phospholipid species were present at a higher percentage in pregnancy. The PUFA-PC are preferentially synthesized via three successive methylation steps by phosphatidylethanolamine N -methyltransferase (PEMT) in the liver. We used the ratios of plasma concentration of 16:0-DHA PC to total PC as well as 18:0-DHA PC to total PC as surrogate markers for PEMT activity. Both of these ratios were significantly increased in pregnancy, indicating an increased activity of PEMT (Additional file 1: Fig. S13A). Further, the decreased concentration of lysophospholipids as well as the total cholesteryl ester concentration suggests a decrease in the activity of phospholipases including lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A 2 (Lp-PLA2) and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) in mid-late pregnancy. These observations were also supported by the decrease in LCAT and Lp-PLA2 enzyme indices derived from the lipidomics data. For these indices, CE/FC ratio was considered as proxy for LCAT activity (Additional file 1: Fig. S13B) whereas total LPC to PC and total LPE to PE ratios were used for PLA2 activity (Additional file 1: Fig. S13C). Together, these data provide insights into the modulation of phospholipid synthesis and metabolism leading to increased concentration of phospholipids in circulation for maternal-foetal transport. These phospholipids are hydrolysed by endothelial lipase (EL) of the placenta and support the transport of PUFA-containing lyso-PL via lysolipids transporters such as MFSD2a. EL is primarily a phospholipase with high levels of phospholipase A1 activity and releases lysophospholipids with sn2 fatty acid chain intact that is often occupied by PUFA. These data highlight the importance of increase in the concentration of phospholipids and decrease in lyso-PL in maternal circulation so that intact phospholipids can be metabolized further by placental lipases for placental transfer. We have previously shown that the concentration of lyso-PL particularly those with PUFA is higher in cord blood compared to maternal plasma. The data presented here further strengthen the potential mechanism of maternal-foetal transfer of esterified fatty acids apart from several other lipid species. The increase in sphingomyelin and sphingosine-1-phosphate and decrease in ceramide-1-phosphate and total ceramide indicate the possible regulation of LCAT activity by sphingolipids. Sphingomyelin and sphingosine-1-phosphate have an inhibitory effect on LCAT whereas ceramide and ceramide-1-phosphate are its potent activators, and by orchestration of the differential concentration of sphingolipid subclasses, LCAT may be kept under tight regulation.

These mediators initiate a localized and systemic inflammation that facilitates multiple processes, such as insulin insensitivity, oxidant stress, blood coagulation, and inflammatory responses, that in turn accelerate atherosclerosis. Researchers have experimented with various treatment options, such as lifestyle and diet modifications, pharmacologic therapy, weight reduction, behavioral therapy, and bariatric surgery, to reduce the syndrome's prevalence.

- **HDL-C**: men, < 1. 03 mmol/L; women, < 1. 29 mmol/L; or treatment for low HDL-C
- **Blood pressure**: systolic, ≥ 130 mm Hg; diastolic, ≥ 85 mm Hg; hypertension treatment; or previously diagnosed hypertension
- Fasting blood glucose: ≥ 5. 6 mmol/L, treatment for elevated blood glucose, or previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes. American Heart Association and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute: Three or more of the following:

- **HDL-C**: men, < 40 mg/per dL; women, < 50 mg per dL; or receiving pharmacologic therapy for low HDL-C
- **Blood pressure**: systolic, ≥ 130 mm Hg; diastolic, ≥ 85 mm Hg, or receiving pharmacologic therapy for hypertension
- **Fasting blood glucose**: ≥ 100 mg per dL or receiving pharmacologic therapy for elevated fasting blood glucose level. Whether activation of the sympathetic nervous system and insulin resistance are the causes or consequences of obesity is uncertain. However, our understanding about the link between overweight and obesity and metabolic syndrome has increased with the discovery of various products released from adipocytes, such as inflammatory cytokines, leptins, non-esterified fatty acids, adiponectin, and resistin. In obese people, these products are released from the adipocytes in abnormal amounts and have a direct or indirect influence on the development of many metabolic risk factors.

This mechanism averts the risk of metabolic syndrome and was supported by the Diabetes Prevention Program study. Physical activity is also reported to enhance the adipose fuel metabolism because abdominal fat and fat-derived mesenchymal stem cells are more responsive to physical activity, preventing adipogenesis. More such evidence-based intervention planning needs to be generated through large-scale longitudinal studies and genome-wide association studies.

### Genetically personalised organ-specific metabolic models in health and disease [^115QvZNq]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Fluxes of the hepatic triacylglycerol to cholesteryl ester pathway and blood lipoproteins

In the liver, we identified 555 associations between fluxes and lipoprotein fractions (Supplementary Data 2). Most of these associations were to reactions of glycerides and phospholipids metabolism, which were enriched in associations relative to all analysed liver fluxes (Methods; Fig. 3B). FWAS revealed that a major determinant of triacylglycerols (TAG), free cholesterol (FC), and cholesteryl esters (CE) fractions in lipoproteins was a sequential set of reactions which we term the TAG to cholesterol esterification (TAG-CE) pathway (Fig. 4). In the TAG-CE pathway, TAGs are hydrolysed to diglycerides and fatty acids in the liver, diacylglycerides are then used as a substrate to synthesise phospholipids (i.e. phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine) which are subsequently used as substrates to esterify FC. We found that fluxes through reactions of the TAG-CE pathway were strongly associated with an increased percentage of CE in HDL and decreased TAG levels in LDL and HDL (Table 1, Supplementary Data 3). The pathway was also strongly associated with reduced HDL size, likely driven by a reduction of TAG levels in HDL. While the associations were primarily found in the liver-specific flux map with mediation by liver-expressed enzymes, these pathways are not necessarily constrained to the liver. For example, the hepatic TAG lipase localises to both the liver and blood. Similarly, phospholipids synthesised in the liver may be transferred to HDL in circulation, where they can fuel cholesterol esterification catalysed by the liver-secreted lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT).

### Poly is more effective than monounsaturated fat for dietary management in the metabolic syndrome: the muffin study [^113DqiKL]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is highly prevalent and associated with an increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Lifestyle recommendations to treat MetS often include the replacement of saturated fats (SFAs) and monosaccharides with unsaturated fat. However, it is unclear whether metabolic parameters will improve more when the saturated fat in American Heart Association (AHA) diets is replaced with higher concentrations of monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids (MUFA or PUFA).

Objective

To test the hypothesis that an AHA diet enriched in MUFA improves lipoprotein lipids, insulin resistance, inflammation, and endothelial function to a greater extent than a diet enriched in PUFA in middle-aged men and women with MetS.

Methods

A prospective, open-label, parallel group design with randomization to a hypocaloric MUFA or PUFA-enriched diet after weight stabilization on an AHA step I diet. Participants consumed 3 MUFA-enriched or PUFA-enriched muffins daily with additional supplementation as required to ensure 25%-50% increases in dietary fat intake from these sources at the expense of SFA and the opposing unsaturated fat. Changes in MetS components were measured at baseline and after 6 months of dietary intervention.

Results

Thirty-nine participants (mean age, 60.8 years; 79% African-American, 60% women) with MetS completed the 6-month study. Compared to baseline, assignment to either MUFA (n = 23) or PUFA (n = 16) both were associated with weight loss (MUFA: -2.3 ± 1 kg, P = 0.06; PUFA: -4.6 ± 2 kg; p = 0.002), but PUFA was also associated with reductions in triglycerides (TG) (-30 ± 18 mg/dL, P = 0.02), systolic blood pressure (BP) (-7 ± 3 mm Hg, P = 0.01), diastolic BP (DBP) (-4 ± 2 mm Hg, P = 0.01) and improved flow mediated dilation (FMD) (7.1% ± 1.8% vs 13.6% ± 2%, absolute increase; p = 0.0001). When compared to MUFA treatment, PUFA intervention was associated with reduced TG (P = 0.04) and DBP (P = 0.07) as well as increased FMD (P = 0.04) even after adjustment for changes in weight. There was no effect on total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, glucose, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), or other inflammatory proteins. Overall, 25% (4 of 16) assigned to PUFA and 13% (3 of 23) to MUFA converted to non-MetS status.

Conclusion

Substitution of SFA with PUFA in patients with MetS is associated with greater reductions in TG and improvement in endothelial function than MUFA that is independent of weight loss. These preliminary findings raise the possibility that PUFA may be the unsaturated fat of choice to reduce cardiometabolic risk in patients with MetS.

### Recognition and management of persistent chylomicronemia: a joint expert clinical consensus by the National Lipid Association and the American Society for Preventive Cardiology [^113ATw48]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Persistent chylomicronemia (PC) — definition, subtypes, alarm features, risk, and treatment — are outlined as follows: Extreme hypertriglyceridemia, defined as triglyceride (TG) levels ≥ 1000 mg/dL, is almost always indicative of chylomicronemia. The authors endorse the term "persistent chylomicronemia (PC)" defined as TG ≥ 1000 mg/dL in more than half of the measurements and suggest classification of PC into 4 subtypes: genetic familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), clinical FCS, PC with "alarm" features, and PC without alarm features. Proposed alarm features include history of recurrent TG-induced acute pancreatitis, recurrent hospitalizations for severe abdominal pain without another identified cause, childhood pancreatitis, family history of TG-induced pancreatitis, and/or postheparin lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity < 20% of normal value. Alarm features constitute the strongest risk factors for acute pancreatitis, and patients with PC and alarm features have very high risk of pancreatitis, comparable to that in patients with FCS. Effective, innovative treatments for PC, like apolipoprotein C-III inhibitors, have been developed, and combined with lifestyle modifications these agents markedly lower TG levels and risk of pancreatitis in very-high-risk groups irrespective of monogenic etiology.

### Sex and hormonal status influence plasma lipid responses to psyllium [^114G5u4W]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The primary mechanisms by which soluble fiber lowers plasma cholesterol are well known. However, specific effects of fiber on lipoprotein metabolism and how sex and hormonal status influence these effects are not well defined.

Objective

The effects of a psyllium supplement in men, premenopausal women, and postmenopausal women were examined to determine the mechanisms by which psyllium lowers plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations and affects lipoprotein remodeling in the intravascular compartment.

Design

We designed a crossover trial in which 24 men, 23 premenopausal women, and 21 postmenopausal women were randomly assigned for 30 d to a fiber supplement (15 g psyllium/d) or a control. Plasma lipids and cholesteryl ester transfer protein and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (phosphatidylcholine-sterol O-acyltransferase) activities were measured after each treatment.

Results

When compared with the control, psyllium intake lowered plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations by 7–9% (P < 0.0001) without affecting plasma HDL-cholesterol concentrations. An interactive effect between fiber and sex and hormonal status was observed for plasma triacylglycerol. Psyllium supplementation significantly lowered plasma triacylglycerol concentrations in men by 17% and raised triacylglycerol concentrations in postmenopausal women by 16% (P < 0.01). The dietary treatment did not significantly affect plasma triacylglycerol in premenopausal women. Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase was unaffected by psyllium intake whereas cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity was 18% lower after psyllium supplementation than after the control treatment (P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

This trial showed that the psyllium-induced responses to plasma lipids were associated with sex and hormonal status and that psyllium, through its action in the intestinal lumen, indirectly affected the intravascular processing of lipoproteins.

### DYRK1A overexpression decreases plasma lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase activity and apolipoprotein A-I levels [^111ymTrM]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Down syndrome is caused by trisomy of all or part of human chromosome 21. Individuals with Down syndrome present some metabolic abnormalities involving lipoproteins, notably lower high-density lipoprotein levels associated with altered lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activity and apolipoprotein A-I levels. DYRK1A is a kinase overexpressed in Down syndrome that can activate the STAT3 pathway, which is involved in lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase expression. Therefore, we characterized the role of DYRK1A overexpression on lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activity and expression in mouse models.

Methods

Effects of Dyrk1a overexpression were examined in mice overexpressing Dyrk1a by ELISA, chemical analyses and Western blotting.

Results

Overexpression of DYRK1A decreased plasma lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activity and hepatic STAT3 activation, which was associated with activation of SHP2, a tyrosine phosphatase. Although hepatic apolipoprotein E and D levels were increased in mice overexpressing DYRK1A, decreased plasma lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activity was associated with decreased hepatic and plasma apolipoprotein A-I levels. High-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels were also decreased in plasma despite similar total cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels.

Conclusions

We identified the role of DYRK1A overexpression on altered lipoprotein metabolism.

HDL‐C and Other Key Pharmacodynamic End Points

Single doses of MEDI6012 resulted in dose‐dependent increases in the primary pharmacodynamic end point: the baseline‐adjusted AUC 0–96h for HDL‐C across all dose levels, with peak concentrations occurring between days 2 and 4 (Figures 2A and 3A). Consistent with the mechanism of action of MEDI6012, the baseline‐adjusted AUC 0–96h for HDL‐CE and CE increased in a dose‐dependent manner across all intravenous and subcutaneous treatment groups (Figures 2B, 2C, 3B, and 3C), reaching statistical significance at the 80‐, 240‐, and 800‐mg IV doses and 600‐mg SC doses. Baseline‐adjusted area under the curve from time 0 to 168 hours demonstrated similar increases (data not shown). Percent change from baseline in peak mean HDL‐C was 31.4%, 71.4%, 125%, and 178% in the 24‐, 80‐, 240‐, and 800‐mg IV dose groups, respectively, and 18.3% and 111% in the 80‐ and 600‐mg SC dose groups, respectively. Percent CE increased in a dose‐dependent manner when referenced to HDL‐C, total cholesterol, and non–HDL‐C (Figure S1). In addition, the baseline‐adjusted AUC 0–96h of endogenous apoA1 increased significantly across all intravenous doses and with the 600‐mg SC dose (Figures 2D and 3D). AUC 0–96h for select lipid parameters can be found in Table S2.

### The HDL mimetic CER-001 remodels plasma lipoproteins and reduces kidney lipid deposits in inherited lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency [^113PkHv3]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

CER‐001 reduces kidney lipid deposits

After 12 weeks of treatment, kidney biopsy was repeated. Histological analysis proved a modest reduction of the glomerular lipid deposition, despite the presence of fibrosis and atrophy, suggesting a partial amelioration of kidney disease and an overall stabilization (Fig. 1i–l). In addition, immunofluorescence was negative for complement deposition (Fig. 1i–l), which has been previously reported as a marker of fast disease progression. Although no striking improvement could be appreciated with CER‐001 treatment, the worsening of kidney function was somehow slowed by the treatment. In fact, whilst estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decreased from 38.3 to 18.3 ml/min/1.73 m² in the 12 months before the beginning of CER‐001 treatment (1.65 ml/min/1.73 m² per month), eGFR declined to 13 ml/min/1.73 m² in 3.4 months of treatment (1.54 ml/min/1.73 m² per month) (Fig. S1). Both albumin‐to‐creatinine and protein‐to‐creatinine ratios increased in the first 3 weeks of treatment, then dropped in the following weeks (Table S1). The same trend was observed for proteinuria (Table S1). The effect of a more prolonged administration could not be evaluated due to CER‐001 unavailability but would have likely led to a better result as shown in the French case. eGFR decline resumed and haemodialysis was consequently restarted. Treatment was well‐tolerated, and no adverse events were observed.

### Effectiveness of phosphatidylcholine as adjunctive therapy in improving liver function tests in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and metabolic comorbidities: real-life observational study from russia [^113gb4M7]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an increasingly common chronic liver disease characterised by significant lipid deposition in the hepatocytes of the liver parenchyma and persistent abnormalities in liver enzymes. The spectrum of NAFLD is a continuum ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and finally cirrhosis.NAFLD is recognised as the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, which includes obesity, dyslipidaemia, hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Obesity, in particular, is often associated with NAFLD, as the degree of steatosis was found to be correlated with body mass index (BMI).

The World Gastroenterology Organisation recommends a hierarchical resource-sensitive approach to the diagnosis of NAFLD. Even though liver biopsy remains the gold standard, it is impractical as a diagnostic tool because it is invasive and expensive. Thus, non-invasive and more affordable tools, based on a biological approach (such as serum biomarkers and liver enzymes), have been proposed for the diagnosis and staging of NAFLD. Indeed, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) have been shown to be useful surrogate measures of NAFLD.

As a result of increasing rates of obesity worldwide, NAFLD is currently the most common cause of abnormal results of liver function tests. The usual observed biochemical pattern in hepatic steatosis due to NAFLD is of increased levels of transaminases, with ALT levels exceeding those of AST. However, with the progression of hepatic steatosis to NASH and associated hepatic fibrosis, AST levels increase with a resultant rise in the AST to ALT ratio.GGT levels may also be modestly increased. At the same time, however, it has been shown that liver enzyme levels do not correlate with the histological severity of NAFLD. Of note, up to 80% of patients with NAFLD have no liver enzyme abnormalities, implying that normal transaminase levels do not exclude steatosis. Nevertheless, ALT, AST, the AST/ALT ratio and GGT are included in different multibiomarker panels aimed to optimise the diagnostic accuracy of NAFLD. The AST to ALT ratio, in particular, can provide important diagnostic clues. The normal AST to ALT ratio is approximately 0.8, and it is usually < 1.0 in NAFLD, although it may be > 1.0 with the development of cirrhosis.

### Folate, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 status in association with metabolic syndrome incidence… [^114wpwTw]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Data directly linking these B vitamins to incident MetS are sparse. A few randomized clinical trials found that B vitamin supplementation alleviated MetS-associated components. FA supplementation alone or with vitamin B6 and/or vitamin B12 reduced blood pressure, 8, 9 improved insulin resistance, 10 and had favorable outcomes on lipid metabolic profiles. 11, 12 However, these studies did not examine MetS risk directly and concentrated on an elderly cohort or populations at high risk for cardiovascular diseases. In addition, a meta-analysis including 12 RCTs reported that high-dose FA supplementation for 2 to 16 weeks significantly reduced systolic BP. 8 Another RCT found that Hcy-lowering treatment with FA plus vitamin B6 reduced BP in a clinically healthy population.

9 Likewise, other RCTs demonstrated that FA supplementation alone or with vitamin B12 and vitamin B6 improved insulin resistance12 and had beneficial outcomes on lipid metabolic profiles. 11, 12. Our findings are biologically plausible. Emerging evidence suggests that folate, vitamin B6, and B12 are essential for facilitating energy, lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism in rodents and humans, 3, 29–31 mainly by counteracting hyperhomocysteinemia. 3, 6 Our exploratory analysis showed inverse association between serum B vitamin and serum Hcy concentrations, and positive association of serum Hcy with MetS incidence. However, when we adjusted for serum Hcy in Model 2, the observed B vitamins-MetS associations were slightly attenuated but remained significant, suggesting that it is likely to be a multifactorial mechanism.

For example, low status of these B vitamins may lead to dyslipidemia, 3 vascular endothelial dysfunction, 4, 5 glucose intolerance, 6 and insulin resistance7 through oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and impairment of nitric oxide synthesis, 3, 6, 32–34 which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of MetS. In addition, folate donates the methyl group in the one-carbon cycle with vitamin B6 and B12 acting as cofactors, which modifies methylation status of genetic loci signals related to cellular insulin resistance, elevated BP, and adiposity. 30, 31 However, whether the association between these B vitamins and incident MetS in humans can be attributed to the specific DNA methylation modification involved in lipid and glucose metabolism warrants future investigation.

### Apolipoprotein A1 (CSL112) increases lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase levels in HDL particles and promotes reverse cholesterol transport [^111Uzy5a]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2025). Medium credibility.

CSL112 enhances CEC and subsequent hepatocyte cholesterol uptake

To examine the effects of CSL112 infusion on plasma HDL function, ex vivo cell-based studies were performed. CSL112 infusion resulted in a dose-dependent increase in macrophage CEC (Figure 5A, Supplemental Tables 4 and 5) and subsequent uptake of radioactive-labeled cholesterol by hepatocytes (Figure 5B, Supplemental Table 4). The 6 g dose of CSL112 induced a > 2-fold increase in cholesterol uptake at the end of infusion, and sustained elevation above baseline at 24–48 hours (P < 0.001) (Figure 5B). CEC (P < 0.001) (Figure 5A) showed very similar changes to hepatocyte cholesterol uptake in terms of magnitude over time at both doses of CSL112. Regression analyses demonstrated that cholesterol uptake by hepatic cells strongly correlated with total CEC (r = 0.95; P < 0.001) and plasma ApoA1 (r = 0.75; P < 0.001) across all dose groups and time points.

### Are low carbohydrate diet interventions beneficial for metabolic syndrome and its components? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114miZsu]. International Journal of Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Diet plays a crucial role in metabolic syndrome (MetS) which might develop into diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease.

Objective

We aimed to evaluate the effects of low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) interventions on MetS and its components.

Methods

Four electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Medline were selected from database inception until March 2024. Randomized clinical trials in adults with MetS evaluated LCD interventions (50–130g of carbohydrates/day or 10–40% of total dietary energy at 2000kcal/day) and a control intervention for at least 12 weeks. Four reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias using Cochrane tool. Meta-analyses used a random-effects model to calculate mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) and analyzed heterogeneity, sensitivity, and publication bias.

Results

A total of 41 articles satisfied the study's inclusion criteria. Thirty articles were incorporated in the meta-analysis, of which 25 were high-quality studies and 5 were of moderate quality. In total, 3806 adults were assessed. Pooled analysis of mean differences (MD) indicated that compared to the control dietary intervention, the LCD intervention reduced BMI (MD -0.43kg/m 2, 95% CI -0.75, -0.11), waist circumference (MD -0.77cm, 95% CI -1.43, -0.12), systolic blood pressure (MD -1.19mmHg, 95% CI -2.36, -0.02), diastolic blood pressure (MD -1.49mmHg, 95% CI -2.36, -0.02), HbA1c (MD -0.62%, 95% CI -0.91, -0.32) and triglycerides (MD -0.24mmol/L, 95% CI -0.42, -0.05), and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD 0.06mmol/l, 95% CI 0.03, 0.09). The subgroup analysis results indicated that the source of high heterogeneity might come from the dosage of intervention.

Conclusion

In summary, LCD interventions improved MetS-related biomarkers in adults with MetS. Moreover, further research is needed to determine the optimal intervention period of LCD on MetS.

### Familial chylomicronemia syndrome: an expert clinical review from the National Lipid Association [^1161vemc]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Familial chylomicronemia syndrome — Pediatric considerations note that a multidisciplinary approach to care is recommended; team members should include lipidologists, endocrinologists, dietitians, geneticists, and gastroenterologists, and that the cornerstone of managing children with FCS is a very low-fat diet; in infancy, breastfeeding poses challenges due to the fat content in breast milk and a low-fat, high-MCT formula with added micronutrients may help meet the infant's nutritional needs; during weaning, < 10% to 15% of total daily caloric intake, approximately 5 to 10 g of fat per day, should come from fat, with some recommendations including α-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid (LA) supplementation comprising 2% to 4% of daily caloric intake; consultation with a pediatric dietitian and lipidologist is critical, and regular developmental screenings are essential, with tracking of height, weight, head circumference, and regular lipid profiles and fat-soluble vitamin levels being essential.

### Effects of recombinant human lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase on lipoprotein metabolism in humans [^113ErFSB]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

LCAT (lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase) catalyzes the conversion of unesterified, or free cholesterol, to cholesteryl ester, which moves from the surface of HDL (high-density lipoprotein) into the neutral lipid core. As this iterative process continues, nascent lipid-poor HDL is converted to a series of larger, spherical cholesteryl ester-enriched HDL particles that can be cleared by the liver in a process that has been termed reverse cholesterol transport.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, placebocontrolled, crossover study in 5 volunteers with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, to examine the effects of an acute increase of recombinant human (rh) LCAT via intravenous administration (300-mg loading dose followed by 150 mg at 48 hours) on the in vivo metabolism of HDL APO (apolipoprotein)A1 and APOA2, and the APOB100-lipoproteins, very low density, intermediate density, and low-density lipoproteins.

Results

As expected, recombinant human LCAT treatment significantly increased HDL-cholesterol (34.9 mg/dL; P ≤ 0.001), and this was mostly due to the increase in cholesteryl ester content (33.0 mg/dL; P = 0.014). This change did not affect the fractional clearance or production rates of HDL-APOA1 and HDL-APOA2. There were also no significant changes in the metabolism of APOB100-lipoproteins.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that an acute increase in LCAT activity drives greater flux of cholesteryl ester through the reverse cholesterol transport pathway without significantly altering the clearance and production of the main HDL proteins and without affecting the metabolism of APOB100-lipoproteins. Long-term elevations of LCAT might, therefore, have beneficial effects on total body cholesterol balance and atherogenesis.

### Metabolic abnormalities: triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein [^112FSC3m]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Increased plasma triglyceride and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol are key features of the metabolic syndrome. Although elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is not an integral characteristic of this syndrome, there is commonly an increase in the proportion of small, dense low-density lipoprotein particles. Together, these abnormalities constitute the atherogenic dyslipidemia of the metabolic syndrome. This article reviews the pathophysiology of altered triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein metabolism in the metabolic syndrome, outlines the relationship of these lipoprotein abnormalities to increased risk of coronary heart disease, and highlights the application of this information to clinical practice. The role of reduced high-density lipoprotein in the metabolic syndrome is discussed elsewhere in this issue.

Lipids not only are fundamental nutrients but also serve as basic structural components of cells and as multifunctional signaling molecules. Lipid metabolism pathways underlie basic processes in health and disease and are the targets of novel therapeutics. In this review, we explore the molecular control of lipid synthesis, trafficking, and storage, with a focus on clinically relevant pathways. To illustrate the clinical relevance of molecular lipid regulation, we highlight how these biochemical processes contribute to the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a component of the metabolic syndrome and a paradigmatic example of lipid dysregulation.

### Insulin resistance-associated cardiovascular disease: potential benefits of conjugated linoleic acid [^117Q9goX]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes and associated cardiovascular disease have reached global epidemic proportions. Recent data from the World Health Organization Multinational Study of Vascular Disease in Diabetes indicate that cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality (52% of deaths) in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Although insulin resistance plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes-related cardiovascular disease, other related risk factors often cluster in a single patient; the combination of insulin resistance and these risk factors is known as the metabolic syndrome. According to the World Health Organization definition, this constellation of risk factors includes hypertension, elevated plasma triacylglycerol, reduced HDL cholesterol, central obesity, and microalbuminuria. The Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial showed that, although diabetes or insulin resistance is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease mortality, these other components of the metabolic syndrome confer additive risk. Thus, to effectively address cardiovascular disease in persons with diabetes, intervention would ideally target all these factors. Conjugated linoleic acid could represent a candidate agent. The therapeutic potential of conjugated linoleic acid against insulin resistance-associated cardiovascular disease is discussed on the basis of the reported effects of conjugated linoleic acid on individual components of the metabolic syndrome.

### MEDI6012: recombinant human lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein receptor-mediated reverse cholesterol transport [^114yGmZv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background MEDI6012 is recombinant human lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase, the rate-limiting enzyme in reverse cholesterol transport. Infusions of lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase have the potential to enhance reverse cholesterol transport and benefit patients with coronary heart disease. The purpose of this study was to test the safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profile of MEDI6012. Methods and Results This phase 2a double-blind study randomized 48 subjects with stable coronary heart disease on a statin to a single dose of MEDI6012 or placebo (6:2) (NCT02601560) with ascending doses administered intravenously (24, 80, 240, and 800 mg) and subcutaneously (80 and 600 mg). MEDI6012 demonstrated rates of treatment-emergent adverse events that were similar to those of placebo. Dose-dependent increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were observed with area under the concentration-time curves from 0 to 96 hours of 728, 1640, 3035, and 5318 should be: mg·h/mL in the intravenous dose groups and 422 and 2845 mg·h/mL in the subcutaneous dose groups. Peak mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol percent change was 31.4%, 71.4%, 125%, and 177.8% in the intravenous dose groups and 18.3% and 111.2% in the subcutaneous dose groups, and was accompanied by increases in endogenous apoA1 (apolipoprotein A1) and non-ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 cholesterol efflux capacity. Decreases in apoB (apolipoprotein B) were observed across all dose levels and decreases in atherogenic small low-density lipoprotein particles by 41%, 88%, and 79% at the 80-, 240-, and 800-mg IV doses, respectively. Conclusions MEDI6012 demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, endogenous apoA1, and non-ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 cholesterol efflux capacity while reducing the number of atherogenic low-density lipoprotein particles. These findings are supportive of enhanced reverse cholesterol transport and a functional high-density lipoprotein phenotype.

### Low-grade metabolic acidosis as a driver of chronic disease: a 21st century public health crisis [^116ugNN1]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Where does dietary acid come from?

Animal protein is the largest source of dietary acid as it is high in the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine, which leads to the formation of sulfuric acid and hydrogen ions in the body. As mentioned previously, hydrogen ions, which are technically bound to water as H₃O⁺ and are called hydronium ions, is the acid in the body. Hydrogen ions are also provided in the diet from the metabolism of dietary phosphate. Animal meat and eggs are also high phosphoproteins and phospholipids that contain high amounts of phosphoserine, lecithin and ammonium, which also form hydrogen ions in the body. Thus, animal protein, particularly, meat, eggs and cheese, is what leads to the formation of large amounts of acid in the body. Fruits and vegetables are high in organic anions like citrate, malate and gluconate, which get converted to bicarbonate in the body. Bicarbonate is the base in our body that neutralises the acid. Thus, animal foods are a positive potential renal acid load (PRAL), whereas plant foods have a negative PRAL. A list of PRAL of various foods is listed in table 1.

### HDL phospholipids, but not cholesterol distinguish acute coronary syndrome from stable coronary artery disease [^1175BXpz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study has revealed new lipid classes, subclasses, and species within HDL (apoA fraction), which are associated with ACS presentation and potentially related to plaque rupture/erosion. The majority of the relationships were inverse associations between ACS and lipid species within HDL and, in particular, phospholipids, but not cholesterol (including free cholesterol and cholesteryl esters). The multiple lysophospholipids, including lysoplasmalogens, present at low levels within HDL may be mechanistically linked to coronary plaque disruption/erosion through modulation of HDL function. Such effects may either be an antecedent to the coronary event or occur during the acute phase or both (either cause or consequence).

In multivariate modeling, a lipidomic approach was superior in discriminating ACS from stable CAD compared with conventional clinical risk factors. Both phospholipid (including lyso and plasmalogen species) and sphingolipid (including glycosylated) species were foremost among those lipids incorporated into these models. Models utilizing lipid species from lipidomics in either plasma or within lipoprotein fractions were similar in their ability to distinguish groups, though plasma yielded the highest C‐statistic (0.80) and accuracy (75%). These discoveries were only possible through examination of an expanded lipidomic profile than previously reported and through analysis of lipoprotein fractions in addition to whole plasma. 2, 3, 13, 14, 15

ACS Is Characterized by a Distinct HDL Phospholipid Profile

Both the plasma and HDL fraction in ACS were characterized by low phosphatidylcholine and high phosphatidylethanolamine, with the ratio between these phospholipids known to play a critical role in lipoprotein metabolism. The striking relationship between seven phospholipid classes in HDL and ACS included associations with 3 plasmalogen subclasses (alkenylphosphatidylethanolamine, lysoalkenylphosphatidylethanolamine, and lysoalkenylphosphatidylcholine), all of which were lower in the ACS group. These findings may have specific implications for HDL‐associated enzymes. For example, reduced abundance of HDL particle surface phospholipids promotes dissociation of apoA‐I through a cholesteryl ester transfer protein‐mediated mechanism, 16 and reduction in the activity of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase is associated with reduced lysophosphatidylcholine. 17 Such actions would be expected to co‐associate with a reduction in reverse cholesterol transport. 18

### The HDL mimetic CER-001 remodels plasma lipoproteins and reduces kidney lipid deposits in inherited lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency [^11388dMh]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Kidney failure is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in familial lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency (FLD), a rare inherited lipid disorder with no cure. Lipoprotein X (LpX), an abnormal lipoprotein, is primarily accountable for nephrotoxicity.

Methods

CER‐001 was tested in an FLD patient with dramatic kidney disease for 12 weeks.

Results

Infusions of CER‐001 normalized the lipoprotein profile, with a disappearance of the abnormal LpX in favour of normal‐sized LDL. The worsening of kidney function was slowed by the treatment, and kidney biopsy showed a slight reduction of lipid deposits and a stabilization of the disease. In vitro experiments demonstrate that CER‐001 progressively reverts lipid accumulation in podocytes by a dual effect: remodelling plasma lipoproteins and removing LpX‐induced lipid deposit.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that CER‐001 may represent a therapeutic option in FLD patients. It also has the potential to be beneficial in other renal diseases characterized by kidney lipid deposits.

### Lipidomic signatures in Colombian adults with metabolic syndrome [^115Xifsh]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Alterations in the metabolism of glycerophospholipids in various tissues have been documented in metabolic disorders such as obesity, insulin resistance, and atherosclerosis. Variability in phosphatidylcholines (PCs), coupled with a reduction in lysophosphatidylcholines, has been linked to obesity, insulin resistance, and the development of type 2 diabetes. In our study, we noted fluctuations in the levels of certain PCs. PC (33:2) and PC (33:1) exhibited higher concentrations in subjects with Metabolic Syndrome, showing associations with triglycerides and waist circumference and positive correlations with insulin and HOMA-IR. PC (33:1) also positively correlated with BMI, while PC (33:0), a discriminative factor between patient groups, displayed lower concentration.

Consistent with our findings, increased PC synthesis has been correlated with elevated diacylglycerol (DG) levels. Additionally, PC plays a vital role in the formation and secretion of very low-density lipoproteins and chylomicrons. The observed increase in PC levels in subjects with MetS might be associated with heightened synthesis of very low-density lipoprotein particles; this aligns with the proposed notion that increased hepatic synthesis of PC stimulates the production of very low-density lipoprotein particles. Furthermore, the elevated plasma concentration of PCs has been linked to an unfavorable metabolic risk profile involving increased cholesterol and TG levels, given that around 65% of hepatic TG content appears to originate from hepatic PC. However, some studies have correlated lower PC levels with cardiovascular risk factors, potentially linked to the fatty acid composition of PCs.

Hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis — clinical severity and treatment aim: It is associated with 2- to 3-fold increased rates of mortality, renal failure, respiratory failure, and cardiogenic shock compared with pancreatitis of other etiologies, and mortality can approach 30% in those who develop pancreatic necrosis, infected abscesses, or multiple organ system failure. Thus, the principal goal of treatment for individuals with FCS is to reduce pancreatitis risk.

### Lipidomic signatures in Colombian adults with metabolic syndrome [^111qHQrQ]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

LPCs are derived from the hydrolysis of PC by phospholipase A2 and can exert their biological functions by inducing cell division, releasing inflammatory factors, and promoting oxidative stress. Alterations in plasma LPC levels have been reported in conditions like obesity and type 2 diabetes, with reduced LPC levels observed in healthy obese individuals and those with type 2 diabetes compared to their healthy counterparts. In this study, we observed lower levels of LPC (20:4), LPC (18:1), and LPC (18:2) in the Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) group. However, when considering covariates such as sex and age, these differences lost statistical significance, suggesting that age and sex may play important roles in determining circulating LPC levels. Other studies have also identified differential LPC levels associated with age and sex.

Elevated phosphatidylinositols (PI) levels were also noted in our study, showing a correlation with triglyceride concentration. The relationship between PI levels and metabolic diseases has yielded varied findings in the existing literature. Animal models in experimental studies have suggested that inositol deficiency is linked to increased hepatic triglyceride accumulation while supplementation with PI has been associated with improved insulin sensitivity, reduced TG concentration, and elevated high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. A study involving intraperitoneal streptozotocin found increased serum inositol and decreased hepatic inositol in rats with acute diabetes. Meikle et al. reported a positive association between PI and phosphatidylserine levels in individuals with diabetes and prediabetes, and increases in myo-inositol levels have been documented in patients with severe heart failure. We observed a positive correlation of PI (32:1) with insulin and HOMA-IR, and PI (40:6) showed a positive correlation with insulin.

### Effectiveness of phosphatidylcholine in alleviating steatosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and cardiometabolic comorbidities (MANPOWER study) [^114aejSj]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

In general, liver echogenicity increases with the severity of NAFLD. The high echogenicity of NAFLD is correlated not only with the total lipid content but even more strongly with the histomorphological distribution of fat deposits. Thus, NAFLD detection by ultrasonography appears to be very useful for the diagnosis and evaluation of metabolic syndrome. Although clinical guidelines still consider liver biopsy as the gold standard for NAFLD diagnosis and evaluation, performing a liver biopsy is invasive and can cause severe complications (eg, pain, hypotension, infection, bleeding and bile leakage). Thus, liver biopsy is neither routinely feasible nor cost-effective in the diagnosis and monitoring of NAFLD. Even though liver ultrasonography is associated with some limitations (eg, lack of quantification of hepatic TG deposit, highly operator dependent), the potential role of liver ultrasonography in clinical settings and in population research is very important. In the current obesity epidemic, the prevalence of NAFLD is likely to increase, making it necessary to use practical tools for measuring the burden of disease and tracking time trends. In the clinical context, the number of patients at risk for NAFLD is also increasing. There is thus a pressing need to have readily available, accurate methods to assess the presence of fatty liver, and ultrasound compares favourably to alternative non-invasive techniques. In a meta-analysis of 49 studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography compared with histology, the overall sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography for the detection of moderate to severe fatty liver were 84.8% and 93.6%, respectively. Liver enzymes, indirect markers of liver injury, have lower sensitivity and specificity than ultrasound. Other imaging techniques (ie, CT or MRI) have similar operating characteristics, but are more expensive, and CT involves radiation, and therefore, their widespread usefulness is limited. In our study, liver ultrasonography reflected the trend of change in radiographic patterns in every patient, and was beneficial in highlighting the improvement in the pathological findings of NAFLD.

### Nutrition interventions for adults with dyslipidemia: a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^114TSqNG]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2023). High credibility.

Chylomicronemia — etiologies and pancreatitis risk are outlined: The three main causes are multifactorial chylomicronemia syndrome (MCS), familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), and familial or acquired lipodystrophies, with FCS a rare disorder due to homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in LPL pathway genes — most commonly LPL (60–80% of cases), APOC2, GPIHBP1, APOA5, and LMF1 — and severe impairment of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity that prolongs chylomicron and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particle residence times. Pancreatitis risk increases with triglyceride (TG) elevation in chylomicronemia; at TG levels > 1770 mg/dL the risk of acute pancreatitis is ~4% per year, and pancreatitis is potentially life-threatening and can lead to pancreatic insufficiency or chronic pancreatitis.

### Short and long term effect of treatment non-pharmacological and lifestyle in patients with metabolic syndrome [^114GhpML]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

Some authors report that the exercise can reduce total and fractionated cholesterol as well as contribute to blood pressure control Similar to the results found in this study. Most studies have shown beneficial changes in the levels and chemical composition of fractions and subfractions of HDL-cholesterol (HDL2-cholesterol, the main anti-atherogenic subfraction and HDL3-cholesterol) and LDL-cholesterol (small and dense LDL-cholesterol transformation considered more atherogenic, in large and less dense), after a program of aerobic exercises with different intensities, durations and frequencies, performed by individuals of different age groups and levels of cardiorespiratory fitness. Few were those who did not find significant changes in HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels with aerobic exercise.

In a systematic review on the effects of physical rehabilitation on the relationship between HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol changes and aerobic training seems to be well defined. The acute or chronic effect of aerobic exercise, both low and high intensity and duration, can improve lipoprotein profile, stimulating the better functioning of enzymatic processes involved in lipid metabolism (increased lipoprotein lipase and lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase; decrease in hepatic lipase), favoring, mainly, increases in HDL-cholesterol and HDL2-cholesterol subfraction, as well as modifying the chemical composition of LDL-cholesterol, making them less atherogenic. These may be the mechanisms by which patients with metabolic syndrome improved their lipid profile during the rehabilitation program, and maintained during 1-year follow-up.

### Effectiveness of phosphatidylcholine in alleviating steatosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and cardiometabolic comorbidities (MANPOWER study) [^114ZK8F9]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

A recent review of 25 clinical studies evaluating EPL in fatty liver disease confirmed that EPL accelerate the improvement or normalisation of ultrasonographic features of NAFLD. According to Gundermann et al, this is due to the positive effects of phospholipids on membrane composition and functions. The therapeutic activity of EPL in liver diseases is not only attributed to the ability of PPC to be incorporated into damaged sections of cellular membranes, which improves hepatic regeneration and replaces endogenous, less unsaturated hepatic PC molecules, but also to its ability to increase membrane fluidity and functioning.

Although several randomised controlled trials and single-arm studies from different countries showed the positive effects of EPL on ultrasonographic as well as histological outcomes, most published studies on EPL in NAFLD have their shortcomings, such as low number of enrolled patients and varying dosages of EPL. Thus, further randomised, double-blind trials with a higher number of patients who have comparable histology or imaging status, and understanding the reasons for not responding to PPC therapy could optimise the therapeutic utility of EPL in liver diseases of various origins.

### Lipid remodeling of adipose tissue in metabolic health and disease [^115Whk5y]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

It is noteworthy that ceramide is strongly associated with metabolic disorders, while SM, PC, and LPC are also correlated with obesity and insulin resistance. Therefore, these differences in lipid composition between the sexes are consistent with the sex-specific differences in susceptibility to metabolic disorders. Additionally, the sex dimorphism of phospholipids may also be attributed to the differential expression and activity of phospholipid metabolic enzymes between the sexes, along with the sex-dependent variations in mitochondrial size and cristae density. This can serve as evidence for the higher thermogenic capacity in adipose tissue and subsequent protection against obesity-related metabolic diseases in female mice.

Among patients who underwent any form of lipid-lowering therapy in addition to PPC, 96.6% had higher than normal TC levels at baseline vs 62.7% at the end of the study. Similarly, among those who did not undergo lipid-lowering therapy, 79.6% and 59.7% had elevated TC levels at baseline and at study end, respectively. The proportions of patients with normal TC levels at 24 weeks of the study were comparable in both subgroups (table 5).

### Dietary choline and betaine intake, cardio-metabolic risk factors and prevalence of metabolic syndrome among overweight and obese adults [^113hm8V5]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

In our study, increased dietary choline and betaine intakes were also associated with reduced TC, TG and LDL concentrations. Although, reduced TG and TC were not statistically significant, but the reduction was clinically meaningful. Choline supplementation normalizes cholesterol metabolism and the expression of genes involved in cholesterol transport and esterification. Similar to our study, in the study by Roe J et al. serum betaine but not choline was associated with favorable cardio-metabolic risk factors (e.g. lower LDL and TG) among older adults. In another study choline supplementation reduced serum cholesterol and LDL concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). While several other studies found a positive association between dietary choline intake or choline supplementation and serum lipids; in the study by Pary AV et al. a weak positive association between dietary choline intake and serum LDL was reported only up to an intake of ± 250 mg/day. In an experimental model, choline deficiency reduced all kinds of serum lipids among female rats. In one study, three eggs intake per day for four weeks, as the main dietary choline source, increased total cholesterol, HDL, and LDL cholesterol in healthy volunteers, while in another study, phosphatidylcholine supplementation in healthy humans did not alter serum cholesterol but increased TG levels. These findings indicate that choline form (e.g. its biochemical structure, and dietary or supplemented choline) and dosage are important determinants of its health effects.

Concerning the limitations of the current study, the study's cross-sectional design makes it challenging to draw conclusions about causality; longitudinal investigations are required to clarify the cause-effect relationships between dietary choline and betaine intake, and cardio-metabolic risk factors. Also, we used semi-quantitative FFQ for dietary assessment that because of its subjective nature, it might stem for recall bias; however, the FFQ's validity and reliability was confirmed in the previous studies. The multiple variables investigated as well as the relatively high number of samples are other strengths of this study.

In conclusion, dietary choline and betaine intakes in obese individuals were associated with lower levels of blood pressure and low density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations. The summarized beneficial effects of choline and betaine is presented as graphical abstract in Fig. 2. Due to great between-study heterogeneity about the health effects of dietary choline and betaine in different populations, further studies are warranted to expand these findings to different geographical distributions.

### Biochemical and nutritional overview of diet-induced metabolic syndrome models in rats: what is the best choice? [^115tYSUk]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

The influence of HFD on energy metabolism is dependent on the fat type added to the diet, for the HFD the most commonly type of added fat is composed of equal proportions of saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids, which are usually contained within lard. This type of fatty acids has been reported to lead to the most pronounced manifestations of obesity and IR, when compared with diets rich in the other types of FA, such as coconut oil or fish oil, while oils rich in polyunsaturated ω-3 fatty acids have beneficial effects on body composition and insulin sensitivity. Considering this, the data analyzed in this review mostly included articles using HFD rich in saturated fatty acids (usually diets containing lard).

Once ingested, TG from HFD are broken down into FFA by pancreatic enzymes and bile salts and are absorbed by the enteric cells of the small intestine, there they are then packed with cholesterol into phospholipid vesicles called chylomicrons that travel through the lymphatic system and then reach the circulatory system, increasing the serum concentrations of these lipoproteins. By means of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) these different fats are hydrolyzed into FFA that are taken by the adipose tissue cells, re-esterified into TG and stored as lipid droplets leading to obesity (Fig. 2). At the same time, the liver can take the FFA and accumulate them in fat droplets which lead to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and also induce hepatic lipogenesis, increasing the serum FFA even further, and promoting the formation of cholesterol. FFA are substrate for the formation of Acetyl CoA that feeds the Krebs cycle and the respiratory chain and consequently, altering the cellular redox state, (See Fig. 4). High levels of serum FFA induce IR in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle which in turn, fail to regulate serum glucose and FFA levels. Briefly, these are the mechanisms by which the HFD may directly increases adiposity, along with the other abnormalities of the MS.

### Emulsifiers and intestinal health: an introduction [^113MwUi9]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Food additives in general, and emulsifiers in particular, are considered to be important dietary components with a potential to harm the intestine, in part by promoting intestinal inflammation. There is inadequate objective information about the specific nature and the magnitude of the problem. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recognized approximately 450 items added to our foods as being generally regarded as safe and has placed them on a generally regarded as safe (GRAS) list. Additionally, it has also approved approximately 3000 "food additives". There is a general lack of transparency as to how either of these selections were and continue to be made. Once items are officially designated by the FDA as "food additives" or placed on the GRAS list, there is no regulatory mechanism for the ongoing monitoring of their safety. The most widely used emulsifier is "lecithin", which is biochemically identified as phosphatidylcholine (PC). Regulatory guidelines allow manufacturers to use the label "lecithin" to be applied to emulsifiers that contain PC plus other phospholipids in a variety of unspecified concentrations. The PC used in experiments cited in the literature, is unlikely to be the same thing as the "lecithin" in our diets. The objective of this introduction to emulsifiers is to raise awareness of the current state of food additives in the USA and to encourage thoughtful approaches to the study of all additives found in our diets. The overriding goal should be to assure the safety of what we eat. As examples we discuss eight widely distributed food additives; four "natural" emulsifiers that are classified as GRAS as well as an additional emulsifier-associated food additive that is also on the GRAS list, and three synthetic emulsifying agents that are FDA approved as "food additives".

Patient education and access to care in FCS — awareness is limited and education/resources and support networks should be strengthened to reduce delays and misdiagnosis. There is often a lack of awareness among both healthcare professionals and patients regarding FCS, which can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment. Surveys indicate that many clinicians are not familiar with FCS, resulting in misdiagnosis or inadequate management. Increased education and resources are essential to improve recognition and care for individuals with this condition, and support networks such as the FCS Foundation should be nurtured and expanded nationally and internationally.

### Targeting metabolic disorders by natural products [^115pE9YB]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Metabolic syndrome

According to National Cholesterol Education Program Third Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP ATP III), metabolic syndrome (MetS) is characterized by a cluster of three or more features; hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, low level of HDL-C, and central obesity. The prevalence of MetS has reached epidemic due to increase in its components. Culminate MetS components together could result in 5, and 3 fold increase in the risk of T2DM and CVD, respectively. In addition, MetS is associated with major cardiovascular events and a high mortality rate.

Pathophysiology of MetS

Most subjects with MetS are obese. Increase in adipose tissue results in elevation of serum FFA and other adipokines. Increase in FFA induces the insulin resistance, elevates the plasma glucose, and in long term impairs the β-cell function. Elevated FFA also lead to increase in hepatic glucose output, worsening of hyperglycemia, elevation of TGs, and attenuation of HDL-C. Obesity is also associated with an increase in blood pressure with an unknown mechanism. Moreover, MetS, as a proinflammatory and prothrombotic state, is associated with an increase in CRP, interleukin-6, and PAI-1 levels that results in insulin resistance predisposition. In addition to genetic susceptibility, and systemic inflammation, oxidative stress has an important role in pathogenesis of MetS, similar to its role in pathogenesis of each component of MetS. Moreover, all MetS components have adverse effects on endothelium, and endothelial dysfunction is prevalent in MetS patients, an event thatis responsiblefor increased risk of T2DM and cardiovascular disease in MetS subjects. So it is expected that subjects with more components of MetS have a higher level of oxidative stress biomarkers.

Pharmacological treatment of MetS

MetS is a multifaceted health problem that can not be treated with a single agent. Although, the first step is to have a healthy lifestyle, due to difficulty in initiating and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, a targeted approach for intensive management of all components of MetS is required. Since, in previous sections pharmacotherapy of each component was discussed, here we briefly introduce the remaining medications.

### Familial chylomicronemia syndrome: an expert clinical review from the National Lipid Association [^1157Ybit]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Familial chylomicronemia syndrome vs multifactorial chylomicronemia syndrome — laboratory phenotype and lipid markers: In familial chylomicronemia syndrome, serum triglycerides are extremely high (20 to 40 mmol/L; 1770 to 3540 mg/dL), are rarely < 10 mmol/L or < 885 mg/dL, and never < 2 mmol/L or < 170 mg/dL. In multifactorial chylomicronemia syndrome, serum triglycerides can be extremely high, but typically 10 to 20 mmol/L (885 to 1770 mg/dL), often can reach < 5 mmol/L or < 440 mg/dL and often < 2 mmol/L or < 170 mg/dL; ~5%-8% of patients are refractory with persistent TG > 10 mmol/L (> 885 mg/dL). A TG: TC ratio > 3.5 in mmol/L or > 8 in mg/dL occurs in 70%-90% of individuals with familial chylomicronemia syndrome and 0%-10% of individuals with multifactorial chylomicronemia syndrome. Apolipoprotein B < 0.7 g/L is present in 60%-80% of individuals with familial chylomicronemia syndrome and 10%-20% of individuals with multifactorial chylomicronemia syndrome.

Secondary factors and treatment responsiveness distinguish familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) from multifactorial chylomicronemia syndrome (MCS): FCS is typically not caused by or associated with secondary factors, many patients have a normal body mass index, and it is notoriously refractory to conventional therapies; conversely, MCS is usually associated with at least 1 or more secondary factors such as obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, alcohol use, or certain medications, and triglyceride levels typically decrease with management of these factors plus fibrates, O3FAs, and dietary fat restriction, though 5% to 8% of patients with MCS remain refractory and may require more intensive management similar to FCS.

### Lipoprotein X-pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management [^1166SybJ]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Lipoprotein X (LpX) was first discovered in the 1960s in patients with severe cholestatic diseases as an abnormal lipoprotein that is distinct from other lipoproteins because it is not produced through regulated pathways, contains albumin as the primary protein, and is rich in free cholesterol (FC) and phospholipids. Over the next few decades, its biochemical properties and composition were characterized.

Sources Of Material

Elevated blood levels of LpX are now also known to occur in various other conditions, such as lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency, graft versus host disease, and after lipid infusions for nutritional support. LpX cannot be measured by conventional testing with a standard lipid panel. The cholesterol content of LpX is included in total cholesterol (TC) and misreported as elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) - this is due to similar densities of LpX and LDL on ultracentrifugation. Typically, the elevations are severe in magnitude, to the extent that the standard lipid panel can look similar to a patient with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

Abstract Of Findings

When LpX is clinically suspected, laboratory testing with measurements of apolipoprotein B, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, lipoprotein gel electrophoresis, or measurement of FC is required to distinguish elevated levels of LpX from other forms of hypercholesterolemia, such as familial hypercholesterolemia. Being an uncommon disorder with an estimated prevalence of 0.02% to 0.09%, if LpX is not considered in the differential diagnosis, the presence of falsely reported levels of elevated LDL-C and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) may mimic an atherogenic phenotype, leading to treatment with lipid-lowering therapy (LLT).

Conclusion

Rather than atherosclerosis, patients with increased blood LpX levels are at risk of other complications, including hyperviscosity syndrome and xanthomatosis. The usual lipid-lowering drugs do not effectively lower elevated LpX levels; thus, treatment is primarily directed at the underlying disease, with plasma exchange being reserved for hyperviscosity syndrome. This review discusses the biology, pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of elevated LpX levels.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^114WM5aR]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Low HDL–C disorders — risk association and etiologies — are described as follows: HDL–C varies inversely with the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and low HDL–C is an independent predictor of increased risk. In childhood, low HDL–C is usually expressed as part of combined dyslipidemia accompanied by obesity, but it can also be reduced significantly due to sedentary lifestyle, cigarette smoke exposure, inherited defects of low HDL–C production, or increased catabolism. Rare genetic forms of low HDL–C include familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia, apoA–I mutations, Tangier disease, and lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency; low HDL–C can be seen with low LDL–C in familial hypobetalipoproteinemia and abetalipoproteinemia. Finally, not all forms of low HDL–C disorders are associated with premature CVD.

### Disorders of lipid metabolism in nephrotic syndrome: mechanisms and consequences [^112vMJYQ]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

Nephrotic syndrome results in hyperlipidemia and profound alterations in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. Serum cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing lipoproteins (very low-density lipoprotein [VLDL], immediate-density lipoprotein [IDL], and low-density lipoprotein [LDL]), lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]), and the total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio are increased in nephrotic syndrome. This is accompanied by significant changes in the composition of various lipoproteins including their cholesterol-to-triglyceride, free cholesterol-to-cholesterol ester, and phospholipid-to-protein ratios. These abnormalities are mediated by changes in the expression and activities of the key proteins involved in the biosynthesis, transport, remodeling, and catabolism of lipids and lipoproteins including apoproteins A, B, C, and E; 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase; fatty acid synthase; LDL receptor; lecithin cholesteryl ester acyltransferase; acyl coenzyme A cholesterol acyltransferase; HDL docking receptor (scavenger receptor class B, type 1 [SR-B1]); HDL endocytic receptor; lipoprotein lipase; and hepatic lipase, among others. The disorders of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in nephrotic syndrome contribute to the development and progression of cardiovascular and kidney disease. In addition, by limiting delivery of lipid fuel to the muscles for generation of energy and to the adipose tissues for storage of energy, changes in lipid metabolism contribute to the reduction of body mass and impaired exercise capacity. This article provides an overview of the mechanisms, consequences, and treatment of lipid disorders in nephrotic syndrome.

### Effectiveness of phosphatidylcholine in alleviating steatosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and cardiometabolic comorbidities (MANPOWER study) [^112D6jR8]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

The findings of this study suggest that PPC administered as adjunctive therapy in patients with NAFLD with metabolic comorbidities has a favourable effect on the ultrasonographic features of NAFLD, with improvement in diffuse liver hyperechogenicity reported in 81.4% of subjects treated with PPC. The analysis of liver function tests by nature and number of comorbidities also showed that PPC adjunctive therapy is associated with notable improvements in aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase. However, details on liver function test results are described in a separate paper.

Liver ultrasonography is becoming a common imaging modality to assess hepatic structural changes that are related to the metabolic abnormalities affecting the liver. In this study, patients had features of the metabolic syndrome including an unfavourable lipid and glycaemic profile, as well as a high range of BMI at baseline. The pathogenesis of NAFLD and metabolic syndrome seems to have common pathophysiological mechanisms, with insulin resistance being a key factor. In adipose tissue, insulin resistance decreases the inhibitory action of insulin on hormone sensitive lipase, thus enhancing triglyceride (TG) lipolysis and free fatty acid (FFA) release. This results in increased circulating levels of FFAs, which are then taken up by the liver. Subsequently, increased hepatocyte FFA content drives hepatic TG synthesis which is also favoured by insulin-mediated upregulation of lipogenic enzymes, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) and sterol regulatory element binding protein 1. The large pool of FFAs activates mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation by activation of PPAR-alpha and enhanced carnitine palmitoyltranferase. When FFA delivery to the liver or hepatic de novo synthesis exceeds TG export or oxidation, NAFLD may occur.NAFLD is also strongly associated with obesity characterised by an excess of intra-abdominal fat, which may be a key determinant in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, because of its strong association with insulin resistance and possibly as a source of FFAs. This is in line with the findings of our study in which overweight/obesity was the most common comorbid condition, reported in approximately 81% of the overall study population.

### Milk polar lipids reduce lipid cardiovascular risk factors in overweight postmenopausal women: towards a gut sphingomyelin-cholesterol interplay [^116odLw7]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dietary synthetic emulsifiers were reported to alter drastically gut microbiota, thereby promoting both systemic and gut inflammation and metabolic syndrome in rodents. Dietary polar lipids (PL) are widely used as natural emulsifiers and texture-promoters in food formulation and represent 1%–10% of daily lipid intake (about 2–8 g/day), mainly provided by soybean lecithin (90% of world PL market). However, dietary lecithin recently raised concerns of sustainable development. On the other hand, milk and dairy products are consumed by > 6 billion people worldwideand represent another natural source of emulsifiers. Indeed, milk fat globules comprise a core of triacylglycerols (TAG) surrounded by a specific biological membrane called the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) that is rich in PL and cholesterol.MFGM extracts have gained much interest as a potential nutraceutical, notably for their natural PL compositionwith a large proportion of sphingomyelin (SM) (> 25% of milk PL)compared with other animal sourced PL with < 5% of SM or to vegetal PL devoid of SM. With longer and more saturated fatty acids than egg or soy PL, milk PL have also been shown to be more efficacious in reducing intestinal absorption of cholesterol in both preclinical and in vitro models. Up to date, several rodent studies have shown that milk PL impact postprandial lipid metabolism, lower intestinal absorption and hepatic accumulation of cholesterol and increase faecal excretion of cholesterol, leading to speculate that dietary supplementation with milk PL might be of therapeutic value in humans. However, strong evidence in humans is still lacking since most of the available clinical studies have been performed in healthy subjects with increased energy intake due to PL supplementation and were rather inconclusive regarding the beneficial impact on lipid metabolism. Considering the intestinal microbial conversion of cholesterol to coprostanol and increasing evidence that the gut microbiota is influenced by dietary factors and may impact host lipid metabolism, a putative effect of milk PL on human gut microbiome may exist but was so far not investigated. A clinical study shows recently that the efficiency of cholesterol conversion would be related to microbial density, as a coprostanol/cholesterol ratio > 15 was associated with high level of coprostanoligenic bacteria (10⁸ cells/g) in postmenopausal women. However, no human intervention has yet thoroughly explored the dynamic postprandial response of blood lipid cardiovascular risk factors to milk PL intervention or even their dose-response as part of benefits/risk assessment to foresee their wider use as a natural ingredient or dietary supplement. Furthermore, women are at higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) as age advances and the loss of oestrogen during menopause leads to an alteration of the blood lipid profile with an increase of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. Metabolic syndrome of which dyslipidaemia is a core component is also more prevalent among postmenopausal women than among premenopausal women. Menopause is thus a major risk factor for CVD that is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in postmenopausal women.

### Sphingolipids and phospholipids in insulin resistance and related metabolic disorders [^112aVQzx]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2017). Medium credibility.

Obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease form a metabolic disease continuum that has seen a dramatic increase in prevalence in developed and developing countries over the past two decades. Dyslipidaemia resulting from hypercaloric diets is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of metabolic disease, and lipid-lowering therapies are the main therapeutic option for this group of disorders. However, the fact that dysfunctional lipid metabolism extends far beyond cholesterol and triglycerides is becoming increasingly clear. Lipidomic studies and mouse models are helping to explain the complex interactions between diet, lipid metabolism and metabolic disease. These studies are not only improving our understanding of this complex biology, but are also identifying potential therapeutic avenues to combat this growing epidemic. This Review examines what is currently known about phospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism in the setting of obesity and how metabolic pathways are being modulated for therapeutic effect.

### Dose-dependent effect of rosuvastatin on VLDL-apolipoprotein C-III kinetics in the metabolic syndrome [^111fHTyo]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

In conclusion, elevated plasma triglycerides are powerful predictors of cardiovascular disease in the metabolic syndrome. ApoC-III may account for this association. Rosuvastatin effectively reduces plasma triglycerides by improving VLDL apoC-III transport in subjects with the metabolic syndrome. Our findings further suggest that these subjects may derive incremental benefit from higher-dose rosuvastatin therapy. Future studies should explore whether lifestyle changes and other pharmacotherapies can further reduce apoC-III concentrations against the background of rosuvastatin in the metabolic syndrome.

### Role of pancreatic lipase inhibition in obesity treatment: mechanisms and challenges towards current insights and future directions [^115rfFw3]. International Journal of Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug discovery

The fundamental strategy to combat obesity includes the adoption of healthier eating patterns and engaging in consistent to moderate physical activity. However, despite initial significant weight loss, many individuals find it challenging to adhere to these lifestyle modifications, often experiencing a rebound in weight within 2 years.

Although pharmacological treatments have progressed, effectively integrating them with sustainable lifestyle changes remains a major hurdle in the successful management of obesity. Drug discovery can be related to the lipid pathways and molecular mechanisms due to its roles in various biological processes. Basically, lipids play crucial roles in energy storage, cell membrane structure, and signaling. By targeting specific enzymes, transport proteins, and regulatory pathways, new drugs can be developed to modulate lipid metabolism in a way that is both effective and tailored to individual patient needs. The initial stage of lipid metabolism begins with the digestion of dietary fats. Pancreatic lipase plays a pivotal role in this process by hydrolyzing triglycerides (TG) into free fatty acids (FA), and monoglycerides (MG) in the small intestine. While bile salts, secreted by the liver, emulsify dietary fats, enhancing the action of pancreatic lipase. They also form micelles that incorporate lipid digestion products, facilitating their transport to the intestinal mucosa for absorption. The process of lipid digestion and absorption is crucial for the bioavailability of lipophilic drugs. Drugs designed to exploit these pathways, such as lipophilic prodrugs, can be incorporated into micelles for enhanced solubilization and absorption. This approach is particularly valuable for drugs that require high fat-solubility for efficacy, such as certain anti-cancer agents or drugs targeting metabolic disorders. Furthermore, lipogenesis refers to the synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA and subsequent conversion into triglycerides, where excess glucose and other carbohydrates are converted into fatty acids for storage. This pathway is regulated by insulin, which promotes the activation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS), the key enzymes in fatty acid synthesis. Excessive lipogenesis can lead to the accumulation of fat in the liver (hepatic steatosis) and other tissues, contributing to obesity and metabolic syndrome. Thus, targeting the enzymes involved in lipogenesis is a promising strategy for the development of anti-obesity and anti-diabetic drugs. For example, ACC inhibitors are being explored for their potential to reduce lipogenesis and thus decrease fat accumulation in the liver and other tissues.

### Recognition and management of persistent chylomicronemia: a joint expert clinical consensus by the National Lipid Association and the American Society for Preventive Cardiology [^112CAj1H]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Persistent chylomicronemia — First-line and adjunctive agents: Any omega-3 intake (eg, 2 g twice daily) must be considered within the daily fat limit, statins are indicated to reduce cardiovascular risk and may modestly lower triglycerides (TG) in those without familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), orlistat and niacin may also be considered, and large placebo-controlled trials with glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) receptor agonists have not demonstrated an increased risk of pancreatitis compared with placebo.

Therefore, it is recommended to adjust the consumption of saturated fat to less than 10% of TEI, with an additional reduction (less than 7% of TEI) for individuals with increased cardiovascular risk, replacing calories from saturated fat with unsaturated fat or complex carbohydrates.

Another promise attributed by the media to coconut fat is its use as a strategy for weight loss and increased satiety. It is possible that such statements are erroneously supported by the actions of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), formed mainly by caproic (6:0), caprylic (8:0) and capric (10:0) acids, which are, almost in their totality, absorbed via the portal system linked to albumin and, as they do not require transport via chylomicrons, they do not increase triglyceridemia. It should be clear that MCT differs enormously from coconut fat, which contains more than 60% of its composition in the form of lauric and myristic acids (12:0 and 14:0). Unlike MCTs, lauric acid is mainly absorbed (70–75%) via chylomicrons, especially when found in large concentrations.

A study conducted with 15 women with overweight tested the effect of the consumption of a meal with 25 mL of extra-virgin coconut oil (EVCO) or OO on energy expenditure, lipid oxidation, satiety and markers of cardiometabolic risk. EVCO consumption induced less fullness, total satiety and hunger suppression, compared to OO. There was no difference between EVCO and OO in relation to energy expenditure, lipid oxidation and postprandial effect on the metabolic parameters. In addition, the consumption of meals enriched with coconut oil did not increase thermogenesis or satiety when compared to corn oil or soybean oil.

An experimental study in Wistar rats compared the effect of EVCO, copra (refined coconut oil), olive, and sunflower oil on lipid metabolism. There was no difference in diet consumption or weight gain of the animals. However, compared to the other oils, consumption of EVCO reduced plasma and hepatic concentrations of total cholesterol, triglycerides and phospholipids, as well as the activity of hepatic lipogenic enzymes, and increased the activity of enzymes linked to lipid oxidation (assessed in cardiac tissue). It is worth mentioning that EVCO and copra had the same fatty acid profile, varying only in the concentration of polyphenols.

### Lipid accumulation product index as a marker of metabolic syndrome in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114pyDyf]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

6 Conclusion

This study supports the use of the LAP index as a pragmatic marker of MetS in PCOS. Increased detection of MetS in the PCOS population can potentially identify patients at higher risk for cardiovascular disease, prompting early preventive care that can lead to decreased cardiometabolic complications and clinical burdens. Finally, further studies evaluating the association of MetS and PCOS based on PCOS phenotypes are recommended.

### Nutrition interventions for youth with dyslipidemia: a National Lipid Association clinical perspective [^113brLhz]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) and multifactorial chylomicronemia syndrome (MCS) — treatment notes that individuals with FCS have impaired or absent lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity caused by a monogenic variant, and MCS, which is 50–100 times more common, occurs with co-existence of genetic and secondary causes; both FCS and MCS lead to severe elevations in triglycerides (TG) (> 1000 mg/dL), and the mainstay of treatment is a specialized dietary pattern including very-low-fat < 15–20 g per day (< 10%–15% of total daily caloric intake) while meeting EFA needs (2–4% daily caloric intake), medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil to increase overall caloric intake and balance macronutrients in the dietary pattern as needed, emphasis on complex carbohydrate foods while limiting simple and refined carbohydrate foods, avoidance of alcohol, and fat-soluble vitamin and mineral supplementation, as needed.

### The HDL mimetic CER-001 remodels plasma lipoproteins and reduces kidney lipid deposits in inherited lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency [^114aCv8n]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Kidney failure is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in familial lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency (FLD), a rare inherited lipid disorder with no cure. Lipoprotein X (LpX), an abnormal lipoprotein, is primarily accountable for nephrotoxicity.

Methods

CER-001 was tested in an FLD patient with dramatic kidney disease for 12 weeks.

Results

Infusions of CER-001 normalized the lipoprotein profile, with a disappearance of the abnormal LpX in favour of normal-sized LDL. The worsening of kidney function was slowed by the treatment, and kidney biopsy showed a slight reduction of lipid deposits and a stabilization of the disease. In vitro experiments demonstrate that CER-001 progressively reverts lipid accumulation in podocytes by a dual effect: remodelling plasma lipoproteins and removing LpX-induced lipid deposit.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that CER-001 may represent a therapeutic option in FLD patients. It also has the potential to be beneficial in other renal diseases characterized by kidney lipid deposits.

### Apolipoprotein A1 (CSL112) increases lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase levels in HDL particles and promotes reverse cholesterol transport [^1151bABo]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2025). Medium credibility.

CSL112 infusion induces transient changes in HDL protein composition and increases LCAT levels

To identify proteins specifically within HDL, an immuno-affinity method was developed to isolate ApoA1-containing HDL from plasma. Although a minority of HDL particles do not contain ApoA1, and ApoA1 can be present on non-HDL particles, the scalability of an immuno-affinity–based method compared with ultracentrifugation was essential. Thus, a highly reproducible and specific ApoA1-enriched HDL proteome (Supplemental Figures 2A and 2B) was collected and examined. A total of 97 proteins were identified and quantified across time points, and 18/97 proteins displayed a significant change in abundance at 4 hours after infusion of 6 g CSL112 (Figure 2A, Supplemental Table 2). Similar trends were observed in patients administered the 2 g dose (Figure 2B, Supplemental Table 2). For example, a small cluster of proteins were consistently depleted from HDL in patients given 6 g CSL112 (Figure 2C) including ApoB, which was dramatically reduced, and structural HDL proteins ApoA2, and ApoE (Figure 2D). Similarly, acute-phase proteins serum amyloids A1 and A4 were also diminished, as were the 4 apolipoproteins C1, C2, C3, and C4 (Supplemental Figure 2C). In contrast, ApoA1 and ApoM had increased abundance (Figures 2A and 2B), consistent with total plasma analyses. Most saliently, elevated HDL-associated LCAT was observed at 4 hours after 6 g CSL112 infusion (Figures 2A and 2D). By the 24-hour time point, the extensive protein depletion in HDL had been largely restored, with only ApoL1 maintaining significant reduction, whereas ApoA1 and ApoM remained elevated (Supplemental Figure 2D). No significant changes were detected in patients 24 hours after administration of 2 g CSL112 (Supplemental Figure 2E).
