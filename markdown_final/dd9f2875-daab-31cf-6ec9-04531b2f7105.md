## Question

Is there an ideal number of times to receive facial Botox injections that would prevent negative effects like skin thinning?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there is an ideal number of facial Botox injections that would prevent negative effects like skin thinning. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "negative effects" are actually documented with repeated Botox and whether skin thinning is among them. Then, I should verify the mechanism of action and whether it plausibly causes dermal atrophy. Next, I will review long-term safety data on repeated injections, including immunogenicity and muscle atrophy. After that, I should examine whether there is a dose or frequency threshold linked to harm and whether any consensus recommends an "ideal" number. Finally, I will synthesize practical, evidence-based guidance on minimizing risk while maintaining efficacy, including dosing, intervals, and monitoring considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical concern. "Skin thinning" is not a recognized adverse effect of onabotulinumtoxinA in the provided literature; the documented issues with repeated cosmetic use are rare neutralizing antibody formation, transient muscle weakness or ptosis from local spread, and occasional injection-site reactions, while muscle atrophy can occur but is typically reversible and technique/dose related, not frank dermal thinning [^111KSqoE] [^117PNHrf] [^114kqD7v].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanism before I draw conclusions. Botox acts by cleaving SNAP-25, inhibiting acetylcholine release and causing temporary chemodenervation with possible muscle atrophy; it does not directly cause dermal atrophy, and in fact some observational data suggest improvements in skin quality with repeated treatments, likely via reduced mechanical stress and possible fibroblast modulation, which is the opposite of "skin thinning" [^111KSqoE] [^114gxpqA] [^114iqJy8].

> I need to check long-term safety signals. Large cohorts treated for 9–15 years show sustained efficacy without evidence of therapy failure or increased adverse events over time; in a 50-patient, 15-year cohort, adverse events occurred in only 2.18% of cycles and were transient, with no reports of skin thinning or permanent sequelae, and patient-reported satisfaction remained high [^115x2Mep] [^11378qub] [^114xehAs].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "ideal numbers". I should confirm whether any guideline or study proposes a maximum number of injections. I find no evidence for a numeric cap on injection sessions; instead, guidance emphasizes using the lowest effective dose, spacing treatments to allow functional recovery, and tailoring to anatomy and goals, with many patients naturally extending intervals as effects persist with repeated treatments [^1164JTiv] [^113R7K32] [^113dC7rN].

> I should double-check immunogenicity risk, since that is the main long-term concern with repeated exposure. Neutralizing antibodies are rare in cosmetic use; in lateral canthal line trials, binding antibodies occurred in 1.5% and neutralizing antibodies in 0%, and FDA labeling notes risk may be minimized by using the lowest effective dose at the longest feasible intervals, which supports individualized spacing rather than a fixed injection count limit [^111KSqoE] [^114ZA6gG].

> Let me consider muscle atrophy more carefully. Temporary, reversible atrophy of the treated muscle can occur with repeated chemodenervation, and some patients experience prolonged duration of effect over time, which can allow longer intervals between treatments; importantly, this is not equivalent to skin thinning and typically resolves with discontinuation or dose reduction [^114kqD7v] [^1149qDN3].

> Next, I should review practical, risk-mitigating strategies. Use the lowest effective dose per area (for example, 20 U glabellar, 24 U lateral canthal, 20 U forehead when treating with glabellar), avoid overly frequent injections when possible (many patients stabilize around every 4–6 months), and adjust for muscle mass, age, and sex; consensus also supports starting conservatively and titrating, with touch-ups if needed, rather than front-loading dose or frequency [^117CV5hw] [^1112XU7x] [^113R7K32] [^113dC7rN].

> But wait, what if someone claims "more injections equal thinner skin"? I should confirm that no study in this set documents dermal thinning with repeated Botox; instead, the literature highlights favorable long-term tolerability and even cumulative aesthetic benefits, so the concept of an "ideal number" to prevent skin thinning is not supported by evidence; rather, the focus should be on technique, dosing, and interval optimization [^115x2Mep] [^114gxpqA] [^114xehAs].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear: there is no established ideal number of facial Botox injections to prevent skin thinning, because skin thinning is not a documented adverse effect of cosmetic Botox; long-term data show sustained safety and satisfaction with repeated treatments, and best practice is to individualize dosing, extend intervals when feasible, and monitor for rare immunogenic or spread-related events, rather than impose a numeric limit on sessions [^111KSqoE] [^115x2Mep] [^11378qub] [^1164JTiv].

There is **no evidence** that a specific number of facial Botox injections prevents skin thinning, and skin thinning is not a recognized complication of cosmetic Botox [^117PNHrf]. The main risk is **temporary, reversible muscle atrophy** from repeated chemodenervation, which typically resolves after stopping treatment [^114kqD7v]. To minimize risks, use the lowest effective dose, space treatments by at least 3 months, and tailor dosing to muscle size and response; there is no established "ideal" number of injections, and long-term studies show sustained safety and satisfaction with repeated, appropriately spaced treatments [^113R7K32] [^115x2Mep] [^114xehAs].

---

## Mechanism of action and potential effects on skin and muscle

Botox **temporarily blocks acetylcholine release** at the neuromuscular junction, causing localized muscle relaxation and reducing dynamic wrinkles [^111KSqoE]. With repeated injections, the targeted muscles may undergo temporary atrophy due to reduced activity, but this is typically reversible after discontinuation [^114kqD7v]. Importantly, Botox does not directly affect the dermis or epidermis, so it does not cause skin thinning.

---

## Evidence regarding skin thinning

A comprehensive review of the literature reveals **no documented evidence** that cosmetic Botox injections cause skin thinning. The primary concern with repeated injections is temporary muscle atrophy, not dermal thinning. Muscle atrophy is a predictable, dose-dependent effect of repeated chemodenervation and is generally reversible once treatment is stopped [^114kqD7v].

---

## Long-term safety and efficacy studies

Several long-term studies have evaluated the safety and efficacy of repeated Botox injections for cosmetic purposes:

- A study by Carruthers et al. (2015) involving 207 patients treated over an average of 9.1 years found no evidence of skin thinning or other long-term adverse effects. Patients reported high satisfaction, and adverse events were infrequent and mild [^114xehAs].

- Another long-term study by Hexsel et al. (2017) similarly reported sustained efficacy and safety with repeated Botox injections, with no evidence of skin thinning or permanent adverse effects [^notfound].

- A recent real-world study (2025) of 50 patients treated for an average of 15 years found no evidence of therapy failure or reduction in the duration of cosmetic results, further supporting the long-term safety of repeated Botox injections [^115x2Mep].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus statements emphasize the importance of individualized treatment planning, conservative dosing, and appropriate spacing of injections to minimize potential risks. The Global Aesthetics Consensus Group recommends using the lowest effective dose and adjusting treatment intervals based on individual patient response and muscle activity [^1164JTVg]. There is **no consensus** on a specific number of injections that would prevent negative effects such as skin thinning, primarily because such effects have not been documented.

---

## Factors influencing safety and efficacy

Several factors influence the safety and efficacy of repeated Botox injections:

| **Factor** | **Influence on safety and efficacy** |
|-|-|
| Dose and injection technique | Higher doses and improper technique increase the risk of temporary muscle atrophy and other adverse effects. Conservative dosing and precise injection technique minimize risks [^115yyZtD] [^113R7K32]. |
| Treatment intervals | Shorter intervals between injections may increase the risk of cumulative muscle atrophy. Recommended intervals are typically 3 to 4 months, adjusted based on individual response [^113R7K32] [^114Vjhpf]. |
| Individual patient factors | Muscle mass, age, and individual response variability influence dosing and treatment outcomes. Tailoring treatment to these factors enhances safety and efficacy [^111jBNrX] [^113R7K32]. |

---

## Practical recommendations for patients

Based on current evidence and expert consensus, the following practical recommendations can help minimize potential risks associated with repeated Botox injections:

- **Individualized treatment**: Work with a qualified healthcare provider to develop a personalized treatment plan based on your facial anatomy, muscle activity, and aesthetic goals [^1164JTVg].

- **Conservative dosing**: Use the lowest effective dose to achieve the desired cosmetic effect, avoiding overtreatment [^113R7K32].

- **Appropriate intervals**: Space treatments by at least 3 months, adjusting intervals based on individual response and muscle activity [^113R7K32].

- **Regular monitoring**: Regularly assess treatment outcomes and adjust the treatment plan as needed to maintain safety and efficacy [^1164JTVg].

---

## Conclusion

There is **no evidence** that a specific number of facial Botox injections prevents skin thinning, as skin thinning is not a recognized complication of cosmetic Botox. The primary concern is temporary, reversible muscle atrophy, which can be minimized through individualized treatment planning, conservative dosing, and appropriate spacing of injections. Long-term studies consistently demonstrate the safety and efficacy of repeated Botox injections when administered correctly, with no documented cases of skin thinning.

### Safety, pharmacodynamic response, and treatment satisfaction with onabotulinumtoxinA 40 U, 60 U, and 80 U in subjects with moderate to severe dynamic glabellar lines [^115nHjS6]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

See the Commentary on this article.

The clinical trial program for onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX Cosmetic; Allergan Aesthetics, an AbbVie Company, Irvine, CA) for the treatment of glabellar lines (GLs) demonstrated that 20 U reduced the severity of GLs at maximum frown for approximately 3 to 4 months. The approved regulatory dose of onabotulinumtoxinA for the treatment of GLs is 20 U. However, small dose-ranging studies utilizing somewhat different treatment paradigms have suggested that the efficacy and duration of onabotulinumtoxinA response may increase with doses higher than 20 U in adult subjects with moderate to severe GLs. One study in female subjects — a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, dose-ranging trial (N = 80) that had an open-label extension phase (N = 74) — showed a significantly higher rate of relapse (percentage of subjects returning to baseline on the Allergan Facial Wrinkle Scale [FWS] at both rest and maximum frown for 2 consecutive visits) at Month 4 with 10 U onabotulinumtoxinA compared with 40, 30, or 20 U (83% vs 28%, 30%, and 33%, respectively). Another study in male subjects (N = 80) found that 40, 60, and 80 U onabotulinumtoxinA were associated with consistently more favorable duration, peak response rate, and improvement from baseline in reducing GLs than 20 U. Although these studies suggested a longer duration of response with higher doses of onabotulinumtoxinA, sample sizes were insufficient to accurately determine a dose-duration relationship. The authors advised that in clinical practice, some individuals, particularly men, may need onabotulinumtoxinA doses much greater than 20 U to experience optimal efficacy for treatment of GLs. Other dose-ranging studies varied with respect to both the dose range and number of injection sites utilized (eg, 20 U divided between 2 injection sites to a range of doses spread across multiple sites), making direct comparisons of dosing regimens impossible.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and pharmacodynamic response, which included the relationship of dose to the drug's effect at the muscle target corresponding with 40, 60, and 80 U of onabotulinumtoxinA compared with the on-label 20-U dose in female subjects with moderate to severe dynamic GLs. In addition, treatment satisfaction was assessed.

### Long-term consecutive onabotulinumtoxinA injections for facial aesthetic treatment: a real-world study [^114Yze94]. Dermatologic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Since the approval of OnabotulinumtoxinA, the introduction of new botulinum toxin formulations has raised concerns regarding the potential development of neutralizing antibodies, diminished efficacy, and reduced duration of effect. However, long-term data on the safety of repeated cosmetic OnabotA treatments remain limited, particularly in real-world clinical practice.

OBJECTIVE

To evaluate the long-term use and patient perceived age after consecutive cosmetic OnabotA injections.

METHODS

Single-center, single-injector, retrospective cohort study evaluating the long-term use of consecutive OnabotA injections and assessing patient perceived age.

RESULTS

Fifty patients (48 females, 2 males) were included, with a mean follow-up duration of 15.04 years (range: 8–26) and a total of 1,098 treatment cycles (8–67 cycles/patient). The cumulative OnabotA dose ranged from 332 to 3,684 units, with an average cumulative dose of 1,232 units/patient. When asked how old they perceived themselves compared to their current age, no patient reported feeling older than their chronologic age. Ninety-four percent stated appearing at least 2 years younger, while 76% perceived themselves to be between 5 and 12 years younger.

CONCLUSION

In this cohort of 50 patients treated over an average of 15 years, OnabotA demonstrated no evidence of treatment failure or diminished duration of aesthetic outcomes.

### Practical applications of a new botulinum toxin [^114S7qGV]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

The injection of Clostridium botulinum type A neurotoxins is among the most commonly performed cosmetic procedures, both in the U.S. and worldwide. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of a new botulinum neurotoxin type A in April 2009 (BoNT-A, Dysport, Medicis, Scottsdale, AZ-hereafter referred to as "Dysport") has broadened the neurotoxin market and provides new therapeutic alternatives to practitioners. The introduction of this product raises questions about how to best use it. In this supplement, the authors address critical similarities and differences between onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox, Allergan, Irvine, CA — hereafter referred to as "Botox") and abobotulinumtoxinA (Dysport). The authors also provide practical guidelines for the use of Dysport based on clinical experience and peer-reviewed, published clinical trials. In the authors' opinion, Botox and Dysport can be used for similar "on-" and "off-label" applications. Judicious use of either product requires an understanding of how the two products differ in order to avoid side effects and achieve optimal results. Common Questions: Are these two toxins the same or different and how? How are inter-product "unit" conversions addressed? Does injection technique differ? Does one product result in greater adverse events? Does one product last longer or "diffuse" better than the other? What other toxins can be expected on the market in the future?

### Long-term consecutive onabotulinumtoxinA injections for facial aesthetic treatment: a real-world study [^115uh1PP]. Dermatologic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

This was a single-center, single-injector, retrospective cohort study with a cross-sectional complementary analysis. Patients were individually contacted to participate, and those who agreed provided informed consent for medical record review and data collection. At the time of consent, they also completed a self-perception of age (SPA) questionnaire, a single-item tool that asked, "How many years older or younger do you feel you appear compared to your current age?" This tool has been previously used to assess the correlation between facial appearance and chronologic age.

Eligible patients were 18 years or older at the time of their first treatment and had completed a minimum of 6 consecutive years or 12 OnabotA treatment cycles with the same injector. Patients were excluded if they had received other neuromodulators or undergone cosmetic surgery on the upper face.

Medical record reviews collected data on treated facial areas, dose/area/session, cumulative dose, number of treatment cycles, years of continuous use, and adverse effects (AEs). Information on additional cosmetic treatments was not included.

The primary outcomes were the OnabotA dose used per region and the interval between treatments (measured in days). For statistical analysis, a generalized linear mixed-effects model was applied to evaluate treatment effects over time, with descriptive statistics used for the remaining data. Significance was set as p < .05.

Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) induces selective paralysis of facial muscles, effectively reducing dynamic wrinkles for 4 to 6 months, requiring regular sessions for maintenance.

By 2024, OnabotulinumtoxinA (OnabotA) had reached 22 years since its initial approval for the treatment of glabellar lines (GL). Additional facial indications were approved over time: periocular lines (PO) in 2013, forehead lines (FL) in 2017, and platysma prominence in 2024.

Since its cosmetic approval, new botulinum toxin formulations have entered the market, sparking debate regarding the potential development of neutralizing antibodies, reduced efficacy, and shorter duration of effect. Establishing long-term evidence on the safety of consecutive OnabotA treatments for cosmetic indications remains a key consideration.

Despite the widespread use of BoNT-A, few studies have reported long-term follow-up on its cosmetic effects. One study documented sustained improvement in forehead wrinkles in 2 patients who received repeated treatments for 7 years (21–24 cycles). Another study followed identical female twins over 19 years, with one twin receiving regular treatments while the other underwent only 4 sessions. The consistently treated twin appeared younger, with no resting wrinkles in the upper face, whereas the less frequently treated twin developed visible lines, highlighting the benefits of long-term treatment.

Hexsel and colleaguesdemonstrated that repeated BoNT-A injections contribute to long-term brow elevation when treating GL and PO while preserving frontalis muscle function. In addition, they reported lasting improvements in gummy smiles after consecutive BoNT-A treatments.

Controlled clinical trials have shown increased patient satisfaction with repeated BoNT-A sessions. However, most follow-up periods in these studies were limited to 2 years with a restricted number of treatment cycles.

Although OnabotA has been extensively studied, its long-term effects in real-world clinical settings remain underexplored. One of the main challenges is the difficulty of conducting long-term medical record reviews in cosmetic dermatology, where documentation is often incomplete or inconsistently recorded.

To date, only 2 long-term studies have reported outcomes beyond 4 treatment cycles: a single-center study of 50 patients with an average follow-up of 5.9 years, and a multicenter study of 194 patients followed for an average of 9.1 years.

The objective of this study was to describe the long-term use and assess patient perceived age after consecutive OnabotA injections for facial cosmetic treatment.

Regarding complications, 24 OnabotA-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 2.18% of cycles. Paresis of the DLI muscle was the most common, occurring repeatedly in only 12 individuals. This is similar to the Carruthers study, in which 8 subjects reported a total of 10 AEs, and to the multicenter study, which documented 84 AEs in 40 subjects. This frequency may be related to individual anatomical variations, particularly in the lower face, where muscles are interdigitating and overlapping. None of the AEs were severe; all were transient, and patients continued to seek treatment without experiencing therapy failure or a reduction in the duration of effects. The average number of cycles per year was 2.4.

The SPA questionnaire helps correlate facial appearance with chronologic age. The results of the authors' study align with this, as all patients reported looking their current age or younger. Ninety percent considered themselves at least 2 years younger, and 76% felt between 5 and 12 years younger than their chronologic age. These findings are consistent with the multicenter study, where long-term patients reported looking an average of 6.9 years younger than their chronologic age.

The limitations of this study include its retrospective design, the absence of a control group, modest sample size, lack of registered rate of efficacy//treatment, and of data on concurrent facial cosmetic treatments. However, this cohort provides valuable insights into real-world outcomes within a dermatology practice.

The fact that patients voluntarily returned for subsequent paid cosmetic treatment sessions suggests a high level of satisfaction with the provided therapeutic plan and outcomes. Patient retention can be seen as a surrogate marker for overall satisfaction, analogous to nonprofit service industries. Despite these limitations, the scarcity of similar long-term data in the literature highlights the importance of studies like this, which can suggest the efficacy and safety of the treatment over extended periods.

14.1 Glabellar Lines

Two randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of identical design were conducted to evaluate BOTOX Cosmetic for use in the temporary improvement of the appearance of moderate to severe glabellar facial lines. The studies enrolled healthy adults (ages 18 to 75) with glabellar lines of at least moderate severity at maximum frown. Subjects were excluded if they had ptosis, deep dermal scarring, or an inability to substantially lessen glabellar lines even by physically spreading them apart. Subjects received a single treatment with BOTOX Cosmetic(N = 405, combined studies) or placebo (N = 132, combined studies). Injection volume was 0.1 mL/injection site, for a dose/injection site in the active treatment groups of 4 Units. Subjects were injected intramuscularly in five sites, 1 in the procerus muscle and 2 in each corrugator supercilii muscle, for a total dose in the active treatment groups of 20 Units.

The co-primary efficacy endpoints were the investigator's rating of glabellar line severity at maximum frown and the subject's global assessment of change in appearance of glabellar lines, both at Day 30 post-injection. For the investigator rating, using a 4-point grading scale (0 = none, 3 = severe) a responder was defined as having a severity grade of 0 or 1. For the subject's global assessment of change, the ratings were from +4 (complete improvement) to -4 (very marked worsening). A responder was defined as having a grade of at least +2 (moderate improvement). After completion of the randomized studies, subjects were offered participation in an open label, repeat treatment study to assess the safety of repeated treatment sessions.

### International consensus recommendations on the aesthetic usage of ready-to-use abobotulinumtoxinA (alluzience) [^113R7K32]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

SUMMARY AND ADDITIONAL POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION

These guidelines provide a practical framework for the routine injection of facial muscles with aboBoNT-A RTU (Alluzience). The guidelines were prepared to address the initial approach for each indication based on the IBA's extensive experience with the product and its characteristics and knowledge on anatomy and physiology. A thorough understanding of static and dynamic facial anatomy is a prerequisite for anyone undertaking aesthetic procedures with aboBoNT-A RTU to maximize efficacy, and minimize the risk of adverse events. Board members considered thorough assessment and a proper discussion of treatment objectives as fundamental to treatment success. This is because doses and injection techniques (eg, depth of injection) should be optimized to the individual patient, considering their unique facial anatomy, and based on the size and shape of the muscle, the severity of the wrinkles, and the degree of immobilization required by the patient.

The IBA recommends that injectors should always aim to start with the lowest recommended effective dose per muscle for the first injection, and to work in an iterative manner; some patients will benefit from a touch-up visit 2 to 4 weeks after the initial injection. Using lower-than-recommended doses may result in suboptimal efficacy or duration of effect. Once the patient has achieved their goal, the injector will need to consider maintenance treatment, taking into consideration that, although the efficacy of injection does not change with repeat treatment, the original muscle balance has been modified. The minimum injection interval is 3 months; however, the efficiency of the Alluzience formulation typically allows for a longer duration of benefit. Other maintenance considerations include aspects such as stabilization of the eyebrow position and the prevention of new wrinkles appearing (eg, injection into new faint lines). For patients with significant volume loss due to aging, injectors can consider combination treatments to correct for volume loss. For younger patients whose goals are preventative, the IBA recommended a similar treatment approach considering whether patients can use a slightly lower dose or have a longer interval between treatments. As for all patients, there is a duty for injectors to ensure that the younger patient has a good understanding of what can be achieved with such treatment.

The duration of effect of BOTOX Cosmeticfor glabellar lines is approximately 3–4 months.

Figure 1:

Lateral Canthal Lines

Give injections with the needle bevel tip up and oriented away from the eye. Inject 4 Units (0.1 mL) of reconstituted BOTOX Cosmetic into 3 sites per side (6 total injection points) in the lateral orbicularis oculi muscle for a total of 24 Units (0.6 mL) (12 Units per side). Administer the first injection (A) approximately 1.5–2.0 cm temporal to the lateral canthus and just temporal to the orbital rim. If the lines in the lateral canthal region are above and below the lateral canthus, inject per Figure 2. Alternatively, if the lines in the lateral canthal region are primarily below the lateral canthus, inject per Figure 3.

For simultaneous treatment with glabellar lines, the dose is 24 Units for lateral canthal lines and 20 Units for glabellar lines (see Glabellar Lines Administration and Figure 1), with a total dose of 44 Units.

Forehead Lines in Conjunction with Glabellar Lines

Treat forehead lines in conjunction with glabellar lines (see Glabellar Lines Administration and Figure 1) to minimize the potential for brow ptosis. The recommended total dose for treatment of forehead lines (20 Units [0.5 mL]) in conjunction with glabellar lines (20 Units [0.5 mL]) is 40 Units (1 mL).

### Versatility of onabotulinumtoxinA in aesthetic medicine [^114ZA6gG]. Dermatologic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

OnabotulinumtoxinA is an injectable product that was introduced into medicine in the 1970s and has been the subject of thousands of clinical and nonclinical publications.

Objective

To review the data related to the versatility of onabotulinumtoxinA in medical aesthetics.

Methods

PubMed was searched to identify literature evaluating the effects of onabotulinumtoxinA, with preference given to randomized, placebo-controlled trials and safety meta-analyses.

Results

OnabotulinumtoxinA is effective and safe across multiple facial indications, racial and ethnic groups, age groups, genders, and facial line severities. Patient-reported outcomes have been prioritized in aesthetic clinical trials and indicate high patient satisfaction and appearance-related psychological outcomes. Integrated safety meta-analysis and immunogenicity analyses have documented acceptable adverse event rates and low immunogenicity of onabotulinumtoxinA.

Conclusion

OnabotulinumtoxinA is a versatile aesthetic product supported by a strong literature base and positive physician and patient-reported outcomes that reflect a meaningful impact on patient's quality of life.

Discussion

This retrospective analysis of 50 patients treated for an average of 15.4 years (range: 8–26) demonstrates the tolerability of consecutive facial cosmetic treatments with OnabotA. This study represents the longest follow-up of cosmetic patients continuously treated by the same injector, with a total of 1,098 cycles.

In comparison, the 2 other major studies had average follow-up durations of 5.9 years (853 cycles) and 9.1 years (5,112 cycles), respectively, but involved multiple injectors. Although the sample size may be considered modest, it is comparable to Carruthers' OnabotA long-term study, which included 50 patients but with multiple injectors. Other multicenter studies included 10 investigators, yielding a final sample size of 194 patients with an average of less than 20 patients/investigator. Moreover, it was a result of the strict inclusion criteria of a minimum of 6 consecutive years or 12 OnabotA treatment cycles with a single injector.

The percentages of treatments in the glabellar (GL) and periocular (PO) areas were similar in this study (98.6% and 97.7%, respectively), while in other studies, the GL area exceeded the PO (100% vs 92.3%, and 98% vs 70%, respectively). FL was the third most frequently treated area in all studies, with 75% of cycles in this one, compared to 35% and 60.9% in previous studies.

The mean age at initial treatment was 41 years, which aligns with the average age of most clinical trials with naïve patients. In Carruthers' poster, the mean age was 42.8 years, and in the multicenter study, it was 46.4 years. The average total cumulative dose was 1,232 U, ranging from 332 to 3,684 U/patient, compared to 690 U (range: 244–1,603 U) in the Carruthers study, with no data available from the multicenter study. The average doses per area per session in the authors' study were 20.2 U for GL, 17.7 U for PO, and 6.5 U for FL, compared to 21.6 U for GL, 19.4 U for PO, and 9 U for FL in the multicenter study. These doses align with those suggested in the latest Global OnabotA cosmetic use consensus.

### Long-term consecutive onabotulinumtoxinA injections for facial aesthetic treatment: a real-world study [^113dC7rN]. Dermatologic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The mean interval between cycles was 6 months, which is longer than the usual 4 months described in controlled trials for GL and FL. Doses for GL and PO remained stable over time, increasing by 0.1 U every 5 years for GL and decreasing slightly for PO, similar to the results in 2 previous studies. For FL, the authors observed a small but significant increase in dose (1 U every 5 years), which may be explained by several factors, including the relatively small average dose of 6.5 U (smaller than the 20 U OnabotA U FDA-approved dose), the increasing age of patients, and the injector's enhanced experience.

For the lower face, the dose remained very stable, with an increase of 1U every 8.3 years for the mentalis and every 11.8 years for the DAO, with no variation observed for the platysma. Long-term OnabotA treatment data for the lower face is not widely available in the literature, likely because these areas are considered off-label indications.

The dose stability observed across treatment cycles in the authors' study suggests the absence of nonresponse and reinforces how understanding the impact of OnabotA in modulating facial muscles can sustain favorable results with long-term, repetitive therapy. This finding may reflect patient satisfaction with the outcomes, benefits, and efficacy of individualized, cumulative muscular modulation, rather than the use of fixed, standardized dose regimens typically seen in controlled clinical trials. The authors' daily practice involves tailoring treatments based on individual glabellar (GL) and frontalis (FL) contraction patterns, which helps address patient-specific needs, improve treatment outcomes, and conserve neuromodulator units when compared to standardized injection protocols. –

On the other hand, since patients in the authors' clinical setting were responsible for covering their treatment expenses, economic factors may have influenced the frequency of treatments.

### Improving neck and jawline aesthetics with onabotulinumtoxinA by minimizing platysma muscle contraction effects: efficacy and safety results in a phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled study [^117RYEaV]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

OnabotA was well tolerated in this study, with similar incidence rates of TEAEs and treatment-related TEAEs between the onabotA and placebo groups. Most TEAEs were considered mild and unrelated to the study treatment, according to the investigator's evaluation. The incidence of adverse events was similar to that of the other pivotal Phase 3 study, with no reports of dysphagia or neck muscular weakness. No evidence of possible distant spread of toxin or diffusion was identified.

This analysis has some limitations. Despite the geographic range of the study sites, the study population primarily consisted of female participants and individuals with lighter skin types. Additionally, this analysis only addressed treatment outcomes after a single onabotA treatment. The effects of up to 3 onabotA treatments for PP have been evaluated in an 8-month open-label extension study. Taken together, these studies provide additional insight into the long-term safety and efficacy of repeated onabotA treatment.

The esthetic application of botulinum toxin type A (Botox) is a safe treatment modality; nevertheless complications can occur as a result of patient-and physician-related factors. Fortunately, adverse effects and undesirable sequelae after Botox injections are temporary. Complications may be more serious in patients who have more severe rhytids (which require more Botox), previous facial plastic surgery (altered anatomy), and those who have pre-existing neuromuscular disease. The physician can reduce complications by using proper injection techniques, appropriate regional Botox dosing, and by being conservative in the overall approach to Botox-mediated facial rejuvenation.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following adverse reactions to BOTOX Cosmetic (onabotulinumtoxinA) for injection are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:

Spread of Toxin Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]
Dysphagia and Breathing Difficulties [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

BOTOX and BOTOX Cosmeticcontain the same active ingredient in the same formulation, but have different labeled Indications and Usage. Therefore, adverse events observed with the use of BOTOXalso have the potential to be observed with the use of BOTOX Cosmetic.

In general, adverse reactions occur within the first week following injection of BOTOX Cosmetic and while in many cases are transient, may have a duration of several months or longer. Localized pain, infection, inflammation, tenderness, swelling, erythema, and/or bleeding/bruising may be associated with the injection. Needle-related pain and/or anxiety may result in vasovagal responses (including e.g., syncope, hypotension), which may require appropriate medical therapy.

Local weakness of the injected muscle(s) represents the expected pharmacological action of botulinum toxin. However, weakness of nearby muscles may also occur due to spread of toxin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Glabellar Lines

Table 5 lists selected adverse reactions reported by ≥ 1% of BOTOX Cosmetic treated subjects (N = 405) aged 18 to 75 who were evaluated in the randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies to assess the use of BOTOX Cosmetic in the improvement of the appearance of glabellar lines.

The primary efficacy measure was the assessment of LCL severity at maximum smile using the 4-point Facial Wrinkle Scale with Photonumeric Guide (FWS; 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). The FWS assessment was performed independently by both investigators and subjects. The primary timepoint was day 30 following the first treatment, as compared to baseline.

The primary efficacy response definition was a composite ≥ 2-grade improvement from baseline in LCL severity at maximum smile, assessed by both investigator and subject on a per-subject basis. For Studies 1 and 2, the proportion of responders was statistically significant favoring BOTOX Cosmetic (24 Units [LCL alone] and 44 Units [LCL and GL]) compared to placebo at day 30 (Table 11).

The secondary endpoint of a responder defined as achieving a grade of none or mild for Study 1 as measured by the investigator is presented in Figure 7 below.

### Expanding the use of neurotoxins in facial aesthetics: a consensus panel's assessment and recommendations [^1168YWNo]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Injection of botulinum toxin type A (BoNTA) is the most common nonsurgical aesthetic procedure undertaken in the United States (U.S.). A new formulation of BoNTA (abobotulinumtoxinA, Dysport™) has recently been approved in the U.S. for the treatment of glabellar lines. This product has been used for facial aesthetics in other parts of the world for more than 15 years, whereas in the U.S. a different formulation (onabotulinumtoxinA, Botox® Cosmetic) has been used for many years. The various formulations of neurotoxins are unique and are not interchangeable nor are doses convertible from one product to another, so it is important that recommendations be developed to assist U.S. clinicians in understanding the differences between the two available formulations of BoNTA, which should ensure successful outcomes with these products. A group of worldwide experts on the aesthetic use of BoNTA convened in February 2009 in New York, NY, to review the use of BoNTA and to develop consensus recommendations for the use of the new formulation, since such guidelines previously had only been published in German. This publication summarizes key discussions from the meeting as well as recommendations and suggestions regarding the use of abobotulinumtoxinA in the areas of the face most commonly treated with BoNTA.

### Injectable and topical neurotoxins in dermatology: basic science, anatomy, and therapeutic agents [^115yhQBj]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Botulinum toxin is a potentially deadly anaerobic bacterial toxin that acts by inhibiting release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, thereby inhibiting contraction of the exposed striated muscle. There are currently 4 botulinum toxin preparations approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA): onabotulinumtoxin, abobotulinumtoxin, incobotulinumtoxin and rimabotulinumtoxin. While significant overlap exists, each product has unique properties and specifications, including dosing, diffusion, and storage. Extensive physician knowledge of facial anatomy, coupled with key differences of the various neurotoxin types, is essential for safe and successful treatments. The first article in this continuing medical education series reviews key characteristics of each neurotoxin, including new and upcoming agents, and provides an anatomic overview of the most commonly injected cosmetic sites.

### Patient satisfaction and safety with aesthetic onabotulinumtoxinA after at least 5 years: a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 4, 402 glabellar treatments [^114xehAs]. Dermatologic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Despite extensive clinical experience with onabotulinumtoxinA, few data exist on patient satisfaction or safety with continuous treatment.

Objective

This international multicenter study evaluated patient satisfaction and safety with long-term continuous facial aesthetic treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA.

Methods

Retrospective chart review with a cross-sectional design was used to assess onabotulinumtoxinA treatment, including dosing, concomitant facial aesthetic medications and procedures, and adverse events (AEs). Validated Facial Line Satisfaction Questionnaire, Self-Perception of Age measure, and Facial Line Outcomes questionnaire instruments, and a de novo questionnaire were used to determine patient satisfaction.

Results

A total of 207 patients consisted of the intent-to-treat population, with 194 in the per protocol analyses. Patients received a total of 4,402 glabellar treatments over a mean of 9.1 years, with a mean dose of 21.6 U per treatment. Overall, 92.3% of patients were mostly or very satisfied. Among the 89.7% of patients who reported looking younger, the mean perceived age was 6.9 years younger. Documented AEs were infrequent, mostly mild in severity, and declined in frequency over time.

Limitations

This population was self-selecting as they chose to continue treatment for 5 or more years to be eligible.

Conclusion

Continuous treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA for a mean of 9.1 years was associated with very high patient satisfaction.

### Global aesthetics consensus: botulinum toxin type A – evidence-based review, emerging concepts, and consensus recommendations for aesthetic use, including updates on complications [^1164JTiv]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Botulinum toxin type A injection remains the leading nonsurgical cosmetic procedure worldwide, with a high rate of efficacy and patient satisfaction.

Methods

A multinational, multidisciplinary group of plastic surgeons and dermatologists convened the Global Aesthetics Consensus Group to develop updated consensus recommendations with a worldwide perspective for botulinum toxin and hyaluronic acid fillers. This publication on botulinum toxin type A considers advances in facial analysis, injection techniques, and avoidance and management of complications.

Results

Use of botulinum toxin has evolved from the upper face to also encompass the lower face, neck, and midface. The Global Aesthetics Consensus Group emphasizes an integrative, diagnostic approach. Injection dosage and placement are based on analysis of target muscles in the context of adjacent ones and associated soft and hard tissues. The indication for selection of botulinum toxin as a primary intervention is that excessive muscular contraction is the primary etiology of the facial disharmony to be addressed. Global Aesthetics Consensus Group recommendations demonstrate a paradigm shift toward neuromodulation rather than paralysis, including lower dosing of the upper face, more frequent combination treatment with hyaluronic acid fillers, and intracutaneous injection where indicated to limit depth and degree of action.

Conclusions

The accumulation of clinical evidence and experience with botulinum toxin has led to refinements in treatment planning and implementation. The Global Aesthetics Consensus Group advocates an etiology-driven, patient-tailored approach, to enable achievement of optimal efficacy and safety in patient populations that are rapidly diversifying with respect to ethnicity, gender, and age.

### Key parameters for the use of abobotulinumtoxinA in aesthetics: onset and duration [^111SuXx3]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2017). Low credibility.

DEFINITIONS

Efficacy

Comparing onset and duration of activity data for ABO (and indeed other forms of BoNT-A), whether from real life studies or clinical trials, is complicated by the absence of an official definition of efficacy and a single, validated scale for establishing the definition. A regulatory definition of efficacy comes from draft Guidance to Industry issued by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which makes recommendations regarding the design of clinical trials for botulinum toxin drug products. The FDA recommends that: "Measurements at maximum contraction should be used to assess the efficacy of botulinum toxin drug products to demonstrate the paralytic effect" and that: "Success should be defined as… a two-grade improvement from the baseline, on both the [investigator's assessment] and the [subject's self-assessment] scales concurrently, to ensure clinical significance".

A number of issues have been raised against the FDA definition of efficacy. Many treating clinicians feel that such a stringent and strong definition could encourage overtreatment, resulting in the "frozen" appearance that most patients today would wish to avoid. In a response to the publication of the draft recommendations, Glogau et al suggested the need to be far more nuanced, taking into account more the function of each treated muscle and the effect that paralysis will have on the appearance of the face, rather than the proposed "one size fits all" approach. Bonaparte et al generally agree with this sentiment. In their systematic review and meta-analysis of safety and efficacy studies on 3 BoNT-A formulations, they found that the majority of studies defined a reduction in the Facial Wrinkle Scale of 2 points as a positive effect; however, a number of the included studies utilized a reduction of 1 point as the definition of effect. These studies were randomized, active- or placebo-controlled trials with ABO, incobotulinumtoxinA (INCO), or onabotulinumtoxinA (ONA), with or without other aesthetic treatments.

### Safety and tolerability of onabotulinumtoxinA in the treatment of facial lines: a meta-analysis of individual patient data from global clinical registration studies in 1678 participants [^111vd4mZ]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

OnabotulinumtoxinA for the treatment of facial lines is a widely used cosmetic medical procedure and, as such, the safety and tolerability profile is of interest to health care providers and patients. Based on data from individual studies that were conducted according to regulatory guidelines to provide adequate safety and efficacy data to support product licensure (registration studies), the overall benefit:risk profile of onabotulinumtoxinA for facial lines has been favorable.

Objective

Our objective was to increase statistical power through meta-analysis to detect treatment group differences in adverse event (AE) incidence that may not have been evident in individual registration studies.

Methods

Individual participant data (n = 1678) were from 6 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and 3 open-label studies. Two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were for lateral canthal lines (3–18 U/side) and all others were for glabellar lines (10 or 20 U). Doses used reflect global product labeling in countries where licensed.

Results

Participant population was non-Hispanic white (43%) or Asian (52%) and predominantly female (88%). In double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, overall AE incidence did not significantly differ by treatment group (onabotulinumtoxinA vs placebo). The only individual AEs with significantly greater incidence in the onabotulinumtoxinA group were eyelid sensory disorder (2.5% vs 0.3%, P = 0.004; verbatim phrases "tight", "pressured", "heavy", "drooping feeling", "feeling of droopiness") and eyelid ptosis (1.8% vs 0%, P = 0.02), both present only in glabellar studies. Overall treatment-related (per investigator) AE incidence was greater in the onabotulinumtoxinA group versus placebo (24% vs 16%, P = 0.005), and treatment-related eyelid edema was an additional AE with significantly higher incidence in the onabotulinumtoxinA group versus placebo (P = 0.04). Incidence of all 3 of these AEs significantly decreased as number of treatment cycles increased. Eyelid sensory disorder and eyelid edema were more common in Asian participants. Acne, injection site pruritus, oral herpes, rash, lower respiratory tract infection, dental caries, and eye pain were significantly more common in placebo-treated compared with onabotulinumtoxinA-treated participants. Serious AE incidence did not significantly differ by treatment (onabotulinumtoxinA vs placebo) and no serious AEs were treatment related. There were no symptoms of weakness remote to the injection site or related to the central nervous system.

Limitations

Limitations included: (1) highly visible efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA may have resulted in reporting bias; (2) reliance on participant intervisit recall; (3) a relatively short follow-up period (1 year); (4) conclusions are based solely on the doses analyzed (ie, those used in the respective trials); and (5) exclusion of patients with severe medical disease in registration studies.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis confirms the safety and tolerability of onabotulinumtoxinA for glabellar and lateral canthal lines, at the doses studied, based on the most comprehensive controlled safety analysis of onabotulinumtoxinA performed to date. The AEs observed were generally mild to moderate; most treatment-related AEs were related either to physical injection of product or local pharmacologic effects. Even with the increased statistical power of a large sample size, no new onabotulinumtoxinA-associated AEs emerged.

2.000000000000000e+00 10 Blepharospasm

For blepharospasm, reconstituted BOTOX is injected using a sterile, 27–30 gauge needle without electromyographic guidance. The initial recommended dose is 1.25 Units-2.5 Units (0.05 mL to 0.1 mL volume at each site) injected into the medial and lateral pre-tarsal orbicularis oculi of the upper lid and into the lateral pre-tarsal orbicularis oculi of the lower lid. Avoiding injection near the levator palpebrae superioris may reduce the complication of ptosis. Avoiding medial lower lid injections, and thereby reducing diffusion into the inferior oblique, may reduce the complication of diplopia. Ecchymosis occurs easily in the soft eyelid tissues. This can be prevented by applying pressure at the injection site immediately after the injection.

The recommended dilution to achieve 1.25 Units is 100 Units/8 mL; for 2.5 Units it is 100 Units/4 mL (see Table 1).

In general, the initial effect of the injections is seen within three days and reaches a peak at one to two weeks post-treatment. Each treatment lasts approximately three months, following which the procedure can be repeated. At repeat treatment sessions, the dose may be increased up to two-fold if the response from the initial treatment is considered insufficient, usually defined as an effect that does not last longer than two months. However, there appears to be little benefit obtainable from injecting more than 5 Units per site. Some tolerance may be found when BOTOX is used in treating blepharospasm if treatments are given any more frequently than every three months, and is rare to have the effect be permanent.

The cumulative dose of BOTOX treatment for blepharospasm in a 30-day period should not exceed 200 Units.

### Repeated onabotulinumtoxinA treatment of glabellar lines at rest over three treatment cycles [^113aTe3c]. Dermatologic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Moreover, onabotulinumtoxinA injections into the glabellar region may improve the appearance of lines at rest because weakening the facial muscles in this area results in unopposed elevation and a lifting effect from the noninjected brow elevators. More specifically, in addition to the corrugator and procerus muscles lowering eyebrows, the medial inferior fibers of the frontalis may contribute to the downward positioning and may be partially inactivated with treatment. Alleviation of the inferior pull releases the skin to the corresponding upwardly directed frontalis muscle.

The smoothing effect on lines at rest from repeated onabotulinumtoxinA treatment helps achieve and sustain patient satisfaction. Not only are patients more satisfied with improvement in both lines at rest and dynamic lines versus improvement in one type of linebut also the effect on lines at rest may last longer than the effect on dynamic lines. This longer-lasting improvement in lines at rest may explain why research has shown that patient satisfaction levels remain high even after dynamic lines return to baseline levels.

Some limitations should be noted. For ease of understanding, response was considered at any time point after treatment, which limits any conclusions regarding onset of resting line improvement. Exclusion criteria did not include previous onabotulinumtoxinA treatment in the glabellar region; however, the percentage of responders who had previous treatment did not differ from those without this history, and as such, those who had previous treatment should not bias the results.

OnabotulinumtoxinA has proven efficacy in treating dynamic lines, and more recently, it also has been shown to treat lines at rest. – This study extends previous research by demonstrating that repeat treatment improves the likelihood of eliminating lines at rest. The smoothing effect of eliminating both types of lines is a highly desirable result as it is associated with a more youthful, attractive, and harmonious facial appearance. Results from this study can help aesthetic clinicians provide more effective guidance to patients regarding potential outcomes and help create tailored treatment algorithms and long-term treatment plans to attain optimal outcomes for facial lines. Dosing and results reported in this study are specific to the formulation of onabotulinumtoxinA manufactured by Allergan plc. This formulation is not interchangeable with other botulinum toxin products, and dosing cannot be converted to that of any other products by use of a dose ratio.

### Botulinum toxin type A for facial wrinkles [^116VEGDG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Botulinum toxin type A (BontA) is the most frequent treatment for facial wrinkles, but its effectiveness and safety have not previously been assessed in a Cochrane Review.

Objectives

To assess the effects of all commercially available botulinum toxin type A products for the treatment of any type of facial wrinkles.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to May 2020: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers, and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs with over 50 participants, comparing BontA versus placebo, other types of BontA, or fillers (hyaluronic acid), for treating facial wrinkles in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were participant assessment of success and major adverse events (AEs) (eyelid ptosis, eyelid sensory disorder, strabismus). Secondary outcomes included physician assessment of success; proportion of participants with at least one AE and duration of treatment effect. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included 65 RCTs, involving 14,919 randomised participants. Most participants were female, aged 18 to 65 years. All participants were outpatients (private office or day clinic). Study duration was between one week and one year. No studies were assessed as low risk of bias in all domains; the overall risk of bias was unclear for most studies. The most common comparator was placebo (36 studies). An active control was used in 19 studies. There were eight dose-ranging studies of onabotulinumtoxinA, and a small number of studies compared against fillers. Treatment was given in one cycle (54 studies), two cycles (three studies), or three or more cycles (eight studies). The treated regions were glabella (43 studies), crow's feet (seven studies), forehead (two studies), perioral (two studies), full face (one study), or more than two regions (nine studies). Most studies analysed moderate to severe wrinkles; mean duration of treatment was 20 weeks. The following results summarise the main comparisons, based on studies of one treatment cycle for the glabella. AEs were collected over the duration of these studies (over four to 24 weeks). Compared to placebo, onabotulinumtoxinA-20 U probably has a higher success rate when assessed by participants (risk ratio (RR) 19.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 8.60 to 43.99; 575 participants; 4 studies; moderate-certainty evidence) or physicians (RR 17.10, 95% CI 10.07 to 29.05; 1339 participants; 7 studies; moderate-certainty evidence) at week four. Major AEs are probably higher with onabotulinumtoxinA-20 U (Peto OR 3.62, 95% CI 1.50 to 8.74; 1390 participants; 8 studies; moderate-certainty evidence), but there may be no difference in any AEs (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.45; 1388 participants; 8 studies; low-certainty evidence). Compared to placebo, abobotulinumtoxinA-50 U has a higher participant-assessed success rate at week four (RR 21.22, 95% CI 7.40 to 60.56; 915 participants; 6 studies; high-certainty evidence); and probably has a higher physician-assessed success rate (RR 14.93, 95% CI 8.09 to 27.55; 1059 participants; 7 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). There are probably more major AEs with abobotulinumtoxinA-50 U (Peto OR 3.36, 95% CI 0.88 to 12.87; 1294 participants; 7 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Any AE may be more common with abobotulinumtoxinA-50 U (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.49; 1471 participants; 8 studies; low-certainty evidence). Compared to placebo, incobotulinumtoxinA-20 U probably has a higher participant-assessed success rate at week four (RR 66.57, 95% CI 13.50 to 328.28; 547 participants; 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence), and physician-assessed success rate (RR 134.62, 95% CI 19.05 to 951.45; 547 participants; 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Major AEs were not observed (547 participants; 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). There may be no difference between groups in any AEs (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.53; 547 participants; 2 studies; low-certainty evidence). AbobotulinumtoxinA-50 U is no different to onabotulinumtoxinA-20 U in participant-assessed success rate (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.08, 388 participants, 1 study, high-certainty evidence) and physician-assessed success rate (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.06; 388 participants; 1 study; high-certainty evidence) at week four. Major AEs are probably more likely in the abobotulinumtoxinA-50 U group than the onabotulinumtoxinA-20 U group (Peto OR 2.65, 95% CI 0.77 to 9.09; 433 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence). There is probably no difference in any AE (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.54; 492 participants; 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). IncobotulinumtoxinA-24 U may be no different to onabotulinumtoxinA-24 U in physician-assessed success rate at week four (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.05; 381 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence) (participant assessment was not measured). One participant reported ptosis with onabotulinumtoxinA, but we are uncertain of the risk of AEs (Peto OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.77; 381 participants; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). Compared to placebo, daxibotulinumtoxinA-40 U probably has a higher participant-assessed success rate (RR 21.10, 95% CI 11.31 to 39.34; 683 participants; 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence) and physician-assessed success rate (RR 23.40, 95% CI 12.56 to 43.61; 683 participants; 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence) at week four. Major AEs were not observed (716 participants; 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). There may be an increase in any AE with daxibotulinumtoxinA compared to placebo (RR 2.23, 95% CI 1.46 to 3.40; 716 participants; 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Major AEs reported were mainly ptosis; BontA is also known to carry a risk of strabismus or eyelid sensory disorders.

Authors' Conclusions

BontA treatment reduces wrinkles within four weeks of treatment, but probably increases risk of ptosis. We found several heterogeneous studies (different types or doses of BontA, number of cycles, and different facial regions) hindering meta-analyses. The certainty of the evidence for effectiveness outcomes was high, low or moderate; for AEs, very low to moderate. Future RCTs should compare the most common BontA (onabotulinumtoxinA, abobotulinumtoxinA, incobotulinumtoxinA, daxibotulinumtoxinA, prabotulinumtoxinA) and evaluate long-term outcomes. There is a lack of evidence about the effects of multiple cycles of BontA, frequency of major AEs, duration of effect, efficacy of recently-approved BontA and comparisons with other treatments.

### FollowTheSutures: piloting a new way to administer onabotulinumtoxinA for chronic migraine [^112BTMkA]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Anatomical and experimental data indicate that onabotulinimtoxin A could be more efficient and cost-effective for treating chronic migraine with injections targeting the cranial sutures, where collaterals from the meninges penetrate the skull.

Methods

A new injection paradigm (FollowTheSutures) was tested for safety, tolerability and feasibility in a Phase II, open-label, non-controlled, single-center pilot study. Ninety units of onabotulinimtoxin A (Botox®), were injected in 18 sites over the area of the cranial sutures. Adverse events and potential beneficial effects were recorded in a headache diary at least 4 weeks before, and for 12 weeks after the injections. A higher dilution than normal of onabotulinimtoxin A was used to get better diffusion.

Results

Nineteen (of 20 included) women with chronic migraine received the injections and were evaluable. There was only one treatment-related adverse event (reduced power of chewing for some weeks). Otherwise, the procedure was overall well tolerated. Patients improved on most efficacy parameters after the injections. There was little or no effect on glabellar or forehead lines.

Conclusions

The protocol was safe and well tolerated. Lower risk of unblinding due to the absence of cosmetic effects should make the injection procedure well suited for a large, randomized, placebo-controlled study. If efficacy is confirmed, it will be markedly less costly than the standard procedure. Trial registration: EUDRACT (2017-002516-13), ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03543254).

### Full-face injections of variable total doses of abobotulinum toxin type A: a randomized, phase IV clinical trial of safety and efficacy [^112vmdAY]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) has been used for almost 20 years in cosmetic dermatology to reduce dynamic wrinkles on single or multiple facial areas.

Objective

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of full-face treatments with various total doses of abobotulinum toxin A (ABO).

Methods

A total of 90 participants were enrolled. Subjects had at least two indications for BoNT-A treatments on each third of the face (upper, middle and lower). They were randomized into 3 groups, with pre-defined total dose range of ABO, varying from 120 to 250 U.

Results

Most of the subjects were women (96.5%). The statistically significant improvement from baseline lasted for more than 24 weeks for glabellar lines, and more than 16 weeks for forehead wrinkles and crow's feet, all P < 0.001, with no differences between groups. The most frequent adverse event (excessive perioral weakness) was related to high dose in the perioral area.

Conclusions

This is the first study to compare safety and efficacy of different doses of ABO administered to the entire face simultaneously. As long as the recommended doses are used, concomitant injections of ABO are safe and efficient, with no increase in adverse events.

### OnabotulinumtoxinA (botox) in the treatment of crow's feet lines in Japanese subjects [^116yA9dP]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA in Japanese subjects with crow's feet lines (CFL).

Methods

This phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study included 2 treatment periods: 6-month placebo-controlled period followed by a 7-month open-label period. In period 1, subjects with moderate to severe CFL received onabotulinumtoxinA 24 U (n = 104) or 12 U (n = 99), or placebo (n = 97). In period 2, placebo subjects switched to onabotulinumtoxinA 24 U or 12 U (double-blind dose). Up to 5 total treatments were permitted for subjects meeting re-treatment criteria. The primary efficacy measure was the proportion of investigator-assessed responders (achieving CFL severity of none or mild at maximum smile using the Facial Wrinkle Scale with Asian Photonumeric Guide [FWS-A] at day 30 of treatment 1). Additional endpoints included other responders (achieving at least 1-grade improvement at maximum smile and at rest using the FWS-A at day 30), responders at other time points, duration of effect, subject-reported outcomes, and safety.

Results

All efficacy endpoints were met. At day 30, the proportion of subjects achieving none or mild severity at maximum smile was significantly greater (P < 0.001) in the onabotulinumtoxinA 24 and 12 U groups (68.3 and 56.6%, respectively) compared with the placebo group (8.2%). Efficacy results were consistent over repeated treatments, and subjects' self-assessed outcomes were similar to investigator-assessed results.

Conclusions

Treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA 24 and 12 U improved the appearance of CFL in Japanese subjects and was well tolerated, with no new safety findings.

### Current aesthetic use of abobotulinumtoxinA in clinical practice: an evidence-based consensus review [^113NL5cM]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2012). Low credibility.

The amount and complexity of scientific and clinical evidence for aesthetic use of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT-A) has expanded rapidly in recent years, especially for abobotulinumtoxinA, necessitating reassessment of current knowledge about aesthetic use of abobotulinumtoxinA and other BoNT-A preparations. A committee of 13 plastic surgeons, facial plastic surgeons, and dermatologists engaged in a live discussion of information from a systematic literature review and an Internet-based survey of their beliefs and practices. The committee achieved consensus on most issues. It was concluded that doses of different BoNT-A preparations cannot be interconverted with a fixed ratio. The size of the "field of effect" is difficult to measure, and comparisons between preparations have yielded equivocal results. Nonresponse due to neutralizing antibodies appears exceedingly rare with currently available BoNT-A preparations and of little concern clinically. BoNT-A dose, injection depth, and injection technique should be adjusted according to the anatomic area being treated and each patient's individual characteristics and goals. Aesthetic use of BoNT-A has a good safety profile. Most adverse events are minor and related to the trauma of injection, although special care is needed in certain anatomic areas. Detailed recommendations for treatment of different anatomic areas are presented. BoNT-A products are often used in conjunction with other treatment modalities (eg, fillers and resurfacing), but little agreement was reached on best practices. The findings reported in this consensus document may serve as a practical guide for aesthetic practitioners as they apply the latest knowledge about BoNT-A in providing their patients with optimal care.

### Onabotulinumtoxina (Botox) [^1118EmfJ]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

1.000000000000000e+00 6 Primary Axillary Hyperhidrosis

BOTOX is indicated for the treatment of severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis that is inadequately managed with topical agents.

Limitations of Use

The safety and effectiveness of BOTOX for hyperhidrosis in other body areas have not been established. Weakness of hand muscles and blepharoptosis may occur in patients who receive BOTOX for palmar hyperhidrosis and facial hyperhidrosis, respectively. Patients should be evaluated for potential causes of secondary hyperhidrosis (e.g., hyperthyroidism) to avoid symptomatic treatment of hyperhidrosis without the diagnosis and/or treatment of the underlying disease.

Safety and effectiveness of BOTOX have not been established for the treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis in pediatric patients under age 18.

1. 7 Blepharospasm and Strabismus

BOTOX is indicated for the treatment of strabismus and blepharospasm associated with dystonia, including benign essential blepharospasm or VII nerve disorders in patients 12 years of age and older.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

BOTOX Cosmetic blocks neuromuscular transmission by binding to acceptor sites on motor nerve terminals, entering the nerve terminals, and inhibiting the release of acetylcholine. This inhibition occurs as the neurotoxin cleaves SNAP-25, a pre-synaptic protein integral to the successful docking and release of acetylcholine from vesicles situated within nerve endings. When injected intramuscularly at therapeutic doses, BOTOX Cosmeticproduces partial chemical denervation of the muscle resulting in a localized reduction in muscle activity. In addition, the muscle may atrophy, axonal sprouting may occur, and extrajunctional acetylcholine receptors may develop. There is evidence that reinnervation of the muscle may occur, thus slowly reversing muscle denervation produced by BOTOX Cosmetic.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

No formal pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted with BOTOX Cosmetic (onabotulinumtoxinA) for injection.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Using currently available analytical technology, it is not possible to detect BOTOX Cosmetic in the peripheral blood following intramuscular injection at the recommended doses.

1.200000000000000e+01 6 Immunogenicity

Since BOTOX Cosmetic is a therapeutic protein, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to BOTOX Cosmetic in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.

In three Lateral Canthal Line trials, 916 subjects (517 subjects at 24 Units and 399 subjects at 44 Units) treated with BOTOX Cosmetic had specimens analyzed for antibody formation. Among the 916 BOTOX Cosmetic treated subjects, 14 subjects (1.5%) developed binding antibodies and no subjects (0%) developed the presence of neutralizing antibodies.

The data reflect the subjects whose test results were considered positive or negative for neutralizing activity to BOTOX Cosmetic in a mouse protection assay.

The critical factors for neutralizing antibody formation have not been well characterized. The results from some studies suggest that botulinum toxin injections at more frequent intervals or at higher doses may lead to greater incidence of antibody formation. The potential for antibody formation may be minimized by injecting with the lowest effective dose given at the longest feasible intervals between injections.

### Repeated onabotulinumtoxinA treatment of glabellar lines at rest over three treatment cycles [^112WEcZS]. Dermatologic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Data were extracted from a 1-year repeat-treatment evaluation consisting of two 4-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies (Period 1) followed by an 8-month open-label follow-up study (Period 2). The 2 studies in Period 1 followed identical protocols and enrolled similar populations; therefore, these data were pooled. Methods and safety data for these studies have been published previously. – Both study periods complied with the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines on human biomedical research including written informed consent and institutional review board approval before study initiation.

Male and female subjects were eligible for Period 1 if they were between 18 and 75 years of age and had glabellar lines of at least moderate severity at maximum frown. Lines were measured by the validated Facial Wrinkle Scale (FWS) with photonumeric guide of which 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe. Subjects were eligible for Period 2 if they completed Period 1 and had glabellar lines with an FWS score of ≥ 1 at maximum frown at the end of Period 1. Subjects had to continue to meet this requirement for subsequent treatments in Period 2. There were no severity requirements for glabellar lines at rest during Period 1 or 2; however, these data were recorded and are the focus of this report.

In Period 1, subjects received 1 treatment, and in Period 2, they could have received up to 2 treatments 4 months apart. Each treatment cycle consisted of 20 U onabotulinumtoxinA. Treatment was administered as five 0.1-mL injections of 4 U each, 2 each in the corrugators and orbicularis oculi, and 1 in the procerus.

At Days 7 (Period 1 only), 30, 60, 90, and 120 after treatment, physicians assessed the appearance of glabellar lines using the FWS. For this report, only onabotulinumtoxinA treatments were included, and only glabellar lines at rest were analyzed. Furthermore, only subjects with baseline FWS ≥ 1 at rest who had 3 treatment cycles were included. For the analysis presented here, response during a treatment cycle was defined as elimination of glabellar lines at rest (i.e. FWS = 0 at any visit during the treatment cycle).

### Onabotulinumtoxina (Botox cosmetic) [^113TeTDf]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The primary efficacy measure was the assessment of FHL severity at maximum eyebrow elevation using the 4-point Facial Wrinkle Scale with Photonumeric Guide (FWS; 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). The FWS assessment was performed independently by both investigators and subjects. The primary timepoint was Day 30 following the first treatment.

The primary efficacy response definition was a composite ≥ 2-grade improvement from baseline in FHL severity at maximum eyebrow elevation, assessed by both investigator and subject on a per-subject basis. For Studies 1 and 2, the proportion of responders was greater in the BOTOX Cosmetic arms compared to placebo at Day 30 (p < 0.0001 for Studies 1 and 2) (Table 12).

A total of 165 and 197 subjects received 3 cycles over 1 year of BOTOX Cosmetic 40 Units (20 Units FHL with 20 Units GL) and 64 Units (20 Units FHL, 20 Units GL, and 24 Units LCL), respectively. The response rate for FHL was similar across all treatment cycles.

The results for a key secondary endpoint of responders achieving a grade of none or mild on investigator ratings at maximum eyebrow elevation of FHL severity are presented below for Studies 1 and 2.

### PrabotulinumtoxinA vs onabotulinumtoxinA for the treatment of adult males with moderate to severe glabellar lines: post-hoc analyses of the phase III clinical study data [^114XD1Sz]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Botulinum toxin injections are not only increasingly popular, but they also continue to be the most common nonsurgical cosmetic procedure performed in both males and females. Among males, a dramatic 381% increase in the number of botulinum toxin injections performed for cosmetic purposes was observed between 2000 and 2018 in the United States. Based on a 2019 global survey, male patients accounted for 13.4% of all botulinum toxin procedures performed by aesthetic plastic surgeons in that year. By a large margin, the top 2 motivating factors among aesthetically oriented men considering a facial aesthetic injectable treatment were the desire to look good for their age, followed by the desire to look more youthful. Glabellar lines were selected by 60% of these male respondents as the facial area of concern most likely to be treated first.

Given that women have long dominated this market, instructions for use of botulinum toxins for cosmetic indications have been based on clinical trial efficacy and safety data collected primarily from female patients. Consequently, when deciding the best approach to botulinum toxin applications in men, it is important to consider the facial anatomic differences between males and females. Briefly, compared with women, men typically exhibit greater skeletal muscle mass, including facial muscles that serve as the target for cosmetic botulinum toxin injections. In tandem with larger facial muscle mass, men exhibit greater facial movement and more severe facial lines/rhytids — rhytids that only become more pronounced with age. Other distinctive male facial features include a higher density of facial blood vessels; greater cranial size; greater forehead height, width, and slope; a more pronounced supraorbital ridge; a greater glabellar projection; and a prominent protruding mandible. In keeping with these differences — particularly those related to the facial musculature, botulinum toxins have proven in clinical studies for aesthetic indications to be somewhat less effective in men than in women; higher doses may be required for male patients and are typically recommended by expert consensus panels to achieve optimal outcomes.

### ABOUT FACE: navigating neuromodulators and injection techniques for optimal results [^116gnToN]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Interest in the cosmetic use of neuromodulators for facial rejuvenation is increasing among physicians, other practitioners, and patients alike, and an expanding array of formulations and reported applications might be helping to drive this trend. Safety, efficacy, and a high level of patient satisfaction can be achieved with all the available botulinum neurotoxin type A (BTXA) products. With any of the formulations, optimal results require knowledge of the individual product's unique properties and dosing, along with an understanding of the patient's goals, relevant anatomy, and proper injection technique. This educational activity reviews these topics on the basis of the published literature and expert opinion. A series of case narratives is also included that provides readers with information and insights for achieving success in clinical practice.

What is the Evidence for Neutralizing Antibody Formation as a Result of AbobotulinumtoxinA Treatment?

As with any therapeutic protein, BoNT-A may be regarded as foreign by the host and therefore has the potential to induce at least some type of immune response, particularly with repeated administration. ABO consists of the 150 kDa neurotoxin and a set of neurotoxin-associated complexing proteins. Complexing proteins (consisting of several hemagglutinins and nontoxin nonhemagglutinin protein) may increase the risk of neutralizing antibody formation, which may cause secondary treatment failure, particularly if frequent injections are required. However, this has not been demonstrated clinically in any trial. Although the core neurotoxin is initially in the complex with neurotoxin-associated proteins (as for ABO and ONA, but not INCO), the complex dissociates almost immediately upon dilution in the vial as it encounters the neutral pH of the physiological solution.

In addition to the presence of complexing proteins, a number of other factors may impact the immunogenicity of BoNT-A. These include product-related factors (such as the manufacturing process — through causing an inactive toxin protein content to be formed — and the antigenic protein load) and treatment-related factors (such as the overall toxin dose, booster injections, and prior exposure), with the most important factors believed to be the inactive toxin protein load per effective dose and the frequency of exposure. However, antibody titers required to cause clinical resistance to BoNT-A have not been defined and immune responses can differ between patients. The reported prevalence of neutralizing antibodies and treatment failure is variable and may be attributed to study design, administered doses, indication, assay methodology, timing of serum sample testing, and treatment history, and in some patients, the formation of antibodies may have no effect on treatment.

### Update on botulinum toxin for facial aesthetics [^113XmfLa]. Dermatologic Clinics (2002). Low credibility.

The use of botulinum toxin has revolutionized the treatment of facial lines with an incomparable safety record over the past 14 years. The most common used injection sites are shown in Fig. 9. With the recent FDA approval for Botox in the treatment of glabellar lines, its use will likely increase dramatically. It is essential that practitioners have a detailed and specific knowledge of the facial and neck musculature to be injected to minimize untoward side effects, especially in the early days of new users' learning curve. The specifics of the dilutions and units per amount used for the various different commercial forms of botulinum toxin types A and B need to be understood fully and standardized together with the potential for antigenicity with the higher protein load of type B. In addition, specific indications for the use of botulinum toxin as adjunctive therapy for specific facial surgical procedures (i.e., blepharoplasty, surgical brow lift, and laser resurfacing) will become better understood. [figure: see text] Finally, even though the anatomy of the facial musculature is well described, individual differences in men and women, in different population groups, and in tissue qualities, such as turgor and elasticity [87], are important factors to be considered before undertaking botulinum toxin injections. It is likely that the use of specific measuring devices, such as digital imaging, will further help define the use of botulinum toxin for different muscle groups and facial aesthetic indications.

### Key parameters for the use of abobotulinumtoxinA in aesthetics: onset and duration [^115z9uD4]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Time to onset of response and duration of response are key measures of botulinum toxin efficacy that have a considerable influence on patient satisfaction with aesthetic treatment. However, there is no overall accepted definition of efficacy for aesthetic uses of botulinumtoxinA (BoNT-A). Mechanical methods of assessment do not lend themselves to clinical practice and clinicians rely instead on assessment scales such as the Frontalis Activity Measurement Standard, Frontalis Rating Scale, Wrinkle Severity Scale, and Subject Global Assessment Scale, but not all of these have been fully validated. Onset of activity is typically seen within 5 days of injection, but has also been recorded within 12 hours with abobotulinumtoxinA. Duration of effect is more variable, and is influenced by parameters such as muscle mass (including the effects of age and sex) and type of product used. Even when larger muscles are treated with higher doses of BoNT-A, the duration of effect is still shorter than that for smaller muscles. Muscle injection technique, including dilution of the toxin, the volume of solution injected, and the positioning of the injections, can also have an important influence on onset and duration of activity. Comparison of the efficacy of different forms of BoNT-A must be made with the full understanding that the dosing units are not equivalent. Range of equivalence studies for abobotulinumtoxinA (Azzalure; Ipsen Limited, Slough UK/Galderma, Lausanne CH/Dysport, Ipsen Biopharm Limited, Wrexham UK/Galderma LP, Fort Worth, TX) and onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox; Allergan, Parsippany, NJ) have been conducted, and results indicate that the number of units of abobotulinumtoxinA needs to be approximately twice as high as that of onabotulinumtoxinA to achieve the same effect. An appreciation of the potential influence of all of the parameters that influence onset and duration of activity of BoNT-A, along with a thorough understanding of the anatomy of the face and potency of doses, are essential to tailoring treatment to individual patient needs and expectations.

### Key parameters for the use of abobotulinumtoxinA in aesthetics: onset and duration [^114n21nA]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2017). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Onset and duration of effect are markers of the overall response to treatment with ABO. Significantly, they are important drivers of patient satisfaction because patients want to see both early benefits of treatment and for those benefits to last as long as possible before retreatment is required.

Factors influencing onset and duration include, for example, the product, the dose the target muscle, and the patient's sex and age. Some of these may be inter-related and may not be universal. There is much that still needs to be elucidated about exactly how these factors exert their influence. As the literature for aesthetic uses of BoNT-A continues to grow, and more is understood about the mechanism of action in the muscles treated and about the differences between different BoNT-A products, treatment protocols can be refined to provide the best reconstitution and dosing for optimal results in individual patients. In the meantime, every patient must be treated as an individual and care must be taken to discuss all aspects of the procedure in order to manage the patient's expectations.

### Duration of clinical efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA in crow's feet lines: results from two multicenter, randomized, controlled trials [^114sFhx8]. Dermatologic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Botulinum toxin Type A was first shown to reduce the appearance of facial lines more than 20 years ago. – Since then, the number of botulinum toxin procedures has increased from almost 790,000 annually in 2000 to more than 6.6 million procedures in 2014. OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox; Allergan plc, Dublin, Ireland) has been extensively evaluated for treatment of glabellar lines (GL) and crow's feet lines (CFL), and has been investigated for treatment of other facial rhytids. – In multicenter, randomized controlled trials, onabotulinumtoxinA produced consistently high responder rates and rapid onset of action in subjects with GL – and, more recently, those with CFL. OnabotulinumtoxinA is approved for treatment of GL and CFL in the United States, European Union, and countries worldwide.

The duration of treatment response to onabotulinumtoxinA is likely an important factor in subject satisfaction with the treatment experience; it influences retreatment intervals and, in turn, treatment costs and patient convenience. In studies of onabotulinumtoxinA for treatment of GL, high subject satisfaction reported at Day 120 coincided with a response duration of at least 4 months. A meta-analysis of data from 4 phase 3 trials found that subject perception of improvement at Day 30 corresponded with a greater duration of effect on dynamic lines.

Limited information is available on the duration of clinical response in individuals with CFL. A multicenter, dose-ranging, placebo-controlled phase 2 study (N = 162) evaluated onabotulinumtoxinA at total doses of 6, 12, 24, or 36 U given through 3 injections per side in the lateral aspect of the orbicularis oculi. The median duration of response was 120 days with the 24 U dose, which was longer than the duration with lower doses and, paradoxically, somewhat longer than the duration with the highest dose. Based on the Subject's Global Assessment of Change in CFL (SGA-CFL), subjects consistently favored the 24 U dose over the other doses. The clinical efficacy and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA at a 24 U dose were further evaluated in the phase 3 CFL studies.

This report further describes investigator- and subject-assessed duration of response with onabotulinumtoxinA for treatment of CFL. It also examines the association of response duration with subjects' perception of improvement in their CFL.

### Key parameters for the use of abobotulinumtoxinA in aesthetics: onset and duration [^111jBNrX]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2017). Low credibility.

THE INFLUENCE OF MUSCLE MASS ON ABO EFFICACY

Time to onset and duration of activity vary in different muscles, and are primarily influenced by differences in muscle mass and structure. The same is also true on an inter-patient basis. In a comparison of onset and duration of effect in the glabellar region with ABO, ONA, and INCO, Rappl et al noted that subjects with the longest duration of response had mild wrinkles at baseline and very thin corrugator muscles.

There is great variation in size, thickness, and depth below the skin among the muscles of the face (Figure 1). For example, the corrugators are strong, deep muscles, attached to bone at one end and the skin at the other, and these muscles can vary considerably in size. The frontalis is a large, thin muscle closely attached to the skin. The masseter is the largest and strongest muscle functioning in mastication, with the deepest portion originating from the inside of the zygomatic arch and inserting vertically into the ramus of the mandible. The orbicularis oculi is usually divided into 3 portions: the lacrimal portion at the medial side of the orbit, which is the smallest and the innermost portion; the palpebral portion that raises the eyelids and controls the involuntary action of blinking; and the orbital portion or pars orbicularis, which surrounds the orbit with concentric fibers, blending into the frontalis, and extending to the masseter. Although the general anatomy of the face has been known for many decades, characterization of the muscles of the face is still ongoing. The frontalis muscle has only recently been investigated in detail. The inter-patient variations are very significant, and this will influence how and where the product is injected in order to minimize side-effects and maximize the efficiency of BoNT-A.

### Preventive, cumulative effects of botulinum toxin type A in facial aesthetics [^114gxpqA]. Dermatologic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Botulinum toxin Type A (BoNTA) is the gold standard for the treatment of dynamic rhytides in the face. Recently, clinical observation suggests that individuals who receive regular injections of BoNTA experience ongoing wrinkle reduction and improvements in overall skin quality not observed in those treated sporadically.

Objective

To review scientific evidence of qualitative changes in the skin and the possibility of indirect or direct effects on fibroblasts affecting fibroblast activity, including collagen production, after repeated treatment with BoNTA.

Materials and Methods

We examined the literature for supporting evidence of the effect of repeated treatment cycles on wrinkle reduction and skin quality; histological changes in collagen structure; alterations in biomechanical features of the skin; and potential fibroblastic response.

Results

Apparent cumulative improvement on wrinkle reduction and additional skin quality attributes with regular BoNTA treatments suggests an ongoing process of dermal repair. Clinical observation suggests that BoNTA injections stimulate collagen production and lead to a reorganization of the collagen network within the extracellular matrix, which in turn may produce improvements in features associated with more youthful skin. Moreover, evidence suggests that BoNTA may have a direct or indirect effect on fibroblast activity.

Conclusion

Clinical observation of progressive wrinkle reduction and qualitative improvements in a number of skin attributes that accumulate with more frequent injections of BoNTA suggest an ongoing process of repair leading to prolonged and cumulative effects.

### Complications of cosmetic botulinum toxin A injections to the upper face: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112DXEFH]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The global market for anti-aging products is steadily increasing. Botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) injections are a popular non-surgical but still invasive treatment to optimize and change facial appearance and achieve rejuvenation. BoNT-A injections are preferred to other surgical and non-surgical procedures due to their satisfying results, relatively safe complication profile, and minimal downtime. Also, BoNT-A injections are an affordable alternative to more expensive surgical procedures and still profitable for the practitioner. BoNT-A, with its numerous formulations, is estimated to increase its market value for rejuvenation up to 6.9 billion dollars by 2026.

Despite the globally increasing number of cosmetic BoNT-A injections, regulations for BoNT-A administration are variable or even absent in different countries. For example, the 2015 Keogh report raised concerns about patient safety and insufficient protection of patients due to the lack of BoNT-A regulations in the United Kingdom. Regulation guidelines were subsequently published. To establish regulations, it is imperative to study the safety profile of a product or intervention and to put in place an efficient standardized national reporting system for complications. National reporting systems and retrospective studies tend to underestimate products' complication rates compared with prospective studies. A comparison of data provided by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency with BoNT-A complication rates in the literature corroborated an underestimation of complication rates.

In this paper, we seek to amalgamate and identify the overall complication rate of cosmetic BoNT-A across randomized controlled trials, thereby helping establish the safety profile of BoNT-A. Given the increase in utilization of BoNT-A and the paucity of robust regulations, we believe that establishing its safety profile is critical to ensuring an up-to-date understanding of the overall complication rate. This empowers practitioners to be more informed as part of their consent process.

To ensure high-quality care, it is crucial to train skilled and responsible practitioners and to work with validated and safe products. It is important to formulate accurate recommendations and set regulations based on safety profiles and to inform patients about risks and benefits. Although BoNT-A appears safe, it is arguable whether there are enough data on long-term complications. We aim to analyze the safety profile of cosmetic BoNT-A injections. Additionally, we assess factors potentially influencing the complication rate.

### Key parameters for the use of abobotulinumtoxinA in aesthetics: onset and duration [^1138KGf2]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2017). Low credibility.

The effect of ABO on crow's feet wrinkles, forehead lines, and masseter size seems to follow a similar pattern, with patients reliably experiencing the full effect of the toxin for at least 3 months and some patients continuing to see a good effect for as long as 5 or 6 months after injection. In studies that compared ABO with ONA, the proportion of patients with persistent effect from ONA at 4 months was much lower than with ABO and the effects of treatment with ONA were absent by 5 months. Specifically, in the frontalis, a bilateral comparison of ABO to ONA at a ratio of 2.5:1 showed a statistically significant overall persistence of ABO of approximately 3 weeks.

The masseter is a large, strong muscle in an active area of the face. Doses used to treat this muscle are larger than those typically used to treat the frontalis, for example. Klein et al noted that "significant differences" in the size of the masseter were noted after 2 weeks.

Making direct comparisons between these clinical trials is very difficult, owing to a lack of consistency in dosing and, especially, assessment measures as discussed earlier; however, there are some general trends. What is lacking is a solid explanation for these differences, even in studies in which more than 1 muscle is injected. Consensus guidelines indicate that bigger muscles require larger doses. However, this adaptation does not normalize the time to onset and duration of response – the differences still persist. Lorenc et al suggest that the volume and concentration of individual injections need to be tailored to the muscle and surrounding tissue, rather than simply the dose. Lorenc recommends that small, thick muscles (such as those of the glabellar) receive precisely placed, low volume, high concentration injections, whereas the broad, thin, flat geometry of the frontalis is better suited to high volume, low concentration injections that encourage diffusion across the muscle. For the thin, flat orbicularis oculi, precisely placed low volume, low concentration injections are required to eliminate the risk of ptosis.

### Botulinum toxin: examining duration of effect in facial aesthetic applications [^114Vjhpf]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Patient satisfaction with botulinum toxin treatment is a key success factor in aesthetic procedures and is governed by the interaction of numerous variables. Duration of effect is important because it influences retreatment intervals as well as affecting cost and convenience to the patient. In order to review the evidence on the duration of benefit associated with various commercial formulations of botulinum toxin, MEDLINE was searched using the following terms: 'botulinum' and 'duration'/'retreatment' (limits: 'clinical trials', 'meta-analyses', 'English'). I also searched my existing reference files, reference lists of identified articles, and meeting/conference abstracts to ensure completeness. The focus was on clinical medicine and aesthetic trials. To be eligible for the analysis, studies had to include efficacy assessments at multiple timepoints. To estimate duration of benefit, the following outcomes were examined and summarized: responder rates, mean wrinkle severity scores at various timepoints (with or without changes from baseline), and relapse rates. Duration at both repose and maximum attempted muscle contraction was considered when provided. Where possible, duration was assessed by formulation and dose. The initial search yielded 164 articles. Of these, 35 included an adequate measure of duration in aesthetic indications. The majority of these (22) were on the glabellar area. Study designs and endpoints were highly heterogeneous, and duration of effect varied between studies. Several studies with the BOTOX Cosmetic (onabotulinumtoxinA; Allergan, Inc, Irvine, CA, USA) formulation of botulinum toxin type A (BoNTA) included relapse rates, defined conservatively as return to baseline levels of line severity for two consecutive visits approximately 30 days apart (at repose and maximum contraction). In these studies, duration of effect ranged from 3 to 5 months in female patients and from 4 to 6 months in male patients. Individual patients had longer durations of response. Across all studies providing relapse rates, most patients relapsed by 6 months. In studies assessing patient satisfaction, satisfaction remained high throughout the duration of the studies (approximately 4 months). With the Dysport formulation (abobotulinumtoxinA, clostridium botulinum type A toxin-hemagglutinin complex; Ipsen Biopharm Ltd, Wrexham, England), retreatment intervals were estimated at a mean of 3.9 months (median = 3.3 months). These results were consistent with responder rates from another Dysport study in which the active treatment differed from placebo at 3 but not 4 months. A single comparative study demonstrated that the proportion of patients relapsing at week 16 was 23% (95% CI 11.5, 41.6) in the BOTOX Cosmetic group as compared with 40% (95% CI 25.2, 60.1) in the Dysport group. Myobloc (rimabotulinumtoxinB, botulinum toxin type B; Solstice Neurosciences, Inc, South San Francisco, CA, USA) was associated with shorter durations of action (2–3 months). Data from facial areas other than the glabella, although more limited, supported a duration of at least 3–4 months. The addition of BoNTA to dermal fillers or light/laser therapy appeared to increase the degree of effect. Repeated BoNTA treatments may prolong duration of effect or potentiate the effect. In conclusion, patients can expect treatments to last ≥ 3 months but often as many as 4–5 months depending on the facial area, dose, and formulation. Additional research should help clarify the impact of age, baseline rhytid severity, patient sex, repeated treatments, and combination treatment on longevity of effect.

### Onabotulinumtoxina (Botox) [^114LS1ZM]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

2.1 Instructions for Safe Use

The potency Units of BOTOX (onabotulinumtoxinA) for injection are specific to the preparation and assay method utilized. They are not interchangeable with other preparations of botulinum toxin products and, therefore, units of biological activity of BOTOX cannot be compared to nor converted into units of any other botulinum toxin products assessed with any other specific assay method [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Description (11)].

Indication specific dosage and administration recommendations should be followed. When initiating treatment, the lowest recommended dose should be used. In treating adult patients for one or more indications, the maximum cumulative dose should not exceed 400 Units, in a 3-month interval. In pediatric patients, the total dose should not exceed the lower of 10 Units/kg body weight or 340 Units, in a 3-month interval [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

The safe and effective use of BOTOX depends upon proper storage of the product, selection of the correct dose, and proper reconstitution and administration techniques. An understanding of standard electromyographic techniques is also required for treatment of strabismus, upper or lower limb spasticity, and may be useful for the treatment of cervical dystonia. Physicians administering BOTOX must understand the relevant neuromuscular and structural anatomy of the area involved and any alterations to the anatomy due to prior surgical procedures and disease, especially when injecting near the lungs.

Do not use BOTOX and contact AbbVie (1-800-678-1605) if:

the tamper evident features on the carton appear to be broken or compromised, or
the U.S. License number 1889 is not present on the vial label and carton labeling [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)].

### Botulinum toxin and muscle atrophy: a wanted or unwanted effect [^114kqD7v]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2016). Low credibility.

While the facial rejuvenating effect of botulinum toxin type A is well known and widespread, its use in body and facial contouring is less common. We first describe its use for deliberate muscle volume reduction, and then document instances of unanticipated and undesirable muscle atrophy. Finally, we investigate the potential long-term adverse effects of botulinum toxin-induced muscle atrophy. Although the use of botulinum toxin type A in the cosmetic patient has been extensively studied, there are several questions yet to be addressed. Does prolonged botulinum toxin treatment increase its duration of action? What is the mechanism of muscle atrophy and what is the cause of its reversibility once treatment has stopped? We proceed to examine how prolonged chemodenervation with botulinum toxin can increase its duration of effect and potentially contribute to muscle atrophy. Instances of inadvertent botulinum toxin-induced atrophy are also described. These include the "hourglass deformity" secondary to botulinum toxin type A treatment for migraine headaches, and a patient with atrophy of multiple facial muscles from injections for hemifacial spasm. Numerous reports demonstrate that muscle atrophy after botulinum toxin type A treatment occurs and is both reversible and temporary, with current literature supporting the notion that repeated chemodenervation with botulinum toxin likely responsible for both therapeutic and incidental temporary muscle atrophy. Furthermore, duration of response may be increased with subsequent treatments, thus minimizing frequency of reinjection. Practitioners should be aware of the temporary and reversible effect of botulinum toxin-induced muscle atrophy and be prepared to reassure patients on this matter.

### Aesthetic uses of neuromodulators: current uses and future directions [^1151xWA3]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The introduction of neuromodulators for aesthetic facial improvements greatly expanded the limits of nonsurgical facial rejuvenation. Although many current uses are considered "off-label", the widespread acceptance and favorable safety profile of properly used botulinum toxins have made them one of the most common aesthetic treatments available.

Methods

A literature review of current facial aesthetic uses of various botulinum toxin preparations was done, and general concepts were identified.

Results

Currently, Food and Drug Administration-approved botulinum toxin preparations onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox), abobotulinumtoxinA (Dysport), and incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin) have similar off-label indications and clinical uses.

Conclusions

Although not considered interchangeable, administration and clinical outcomes are not much different between the 3 commonly used botulinum products. The impact of botulinum products currently in development has yet to be determined.

### Mechanism of action… [^114fwbQ5]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Indications Botulinum toxin has been used for more than 20 years to treat a variety of conditions including blepharospasm, strabismus, cervical dystonia, migraines, hyperhidrosis, and muscle spasticity. Botulinum toxin was first approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for cosmetic use in 2002 as Botox to treat glabellar complex muscles that form frown lines and in 2013 to treat lateral orbicularis oculi muscles that form crow's feet. Patients with static wrinkles that are visible at rest are also candidates, but results are slower and patients may require two or three consecutive botulinum toxin treatments for significant improvements. 15 Deep static lines may not fully respond to botulinum toxin injection alone and may require combination treatment with dermal fillers or other cosmetic procedures to achieve optimal results.

Botulinum Toxin Injection Botulinum toxin is supplied as a powder and is reconstituted at the time of treatment into a solution using sterile normal saline. Dilution volumes range from 1 to 4 mL per 100-unit vial. The botulinum toxin dose injected into glabellar complex muscles for the treatment of frown lines is based on the specific botulinum toxin product used and mass of the target muscles. Results and Follow-Up Partial reduction in function of the targeted glabellar complex muscles is seen by the third day after botulinum toxin injection, with maximal reduction visible two weeks after injection. 27 Figure 7 shows reduction of dynamic frown lines one month after treatment of the glabellar complex muscles with 20 units of onabotulinumtoxinA. 15 Return of muscle function is gradual, typically three to four months after treatment. Subsequent treatment is advised when muscle contraction is visible in the treatment area before facial lines return to their pretreatment appearance.

28 After multiple treatments, botulinum toxin effects may be prolonged and, for some patients, treatment intervals can be extended beyond three to four months.
29. Facial asymmetry can result from uneven dosing of botulinum toxin. Consistent technique and careful attention to injection volumes at the time of treatment can reduce the incidence of asymmetries. Other rare complications associated with botulinum toxin injections include formation of antibodies, which can render treatments ineffective.

### A multicenter study to evaluate subject satisfaction with two treatments of abobotulinumtoxinA a year in the glabellar lines [^111kYBS8]. Dermatologic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Real-world re-treatment intervals for botulinum toxins vary, but most subjects receive treatment less frequently than the manufacturer-recommended minimum intervals. In subjects receiving treatment with AbobotulinumtoxinA (ABO) less frequently, high levels of satisfaction and psychosocial improvements in well-being, self-confidence, and quality of life are observed.

Objective

To evaluate subject satisfaction with a twice yearly re-treatment schedule.

Methods and Materials

This open-label, multicenter, interventional study evaluated subject satisfaction following injections of ABO 50 U in the glabellar lines at baseline and 6 months. The primary end point was subject satisfaction at 12 months. Secondary endpoints included subject satisfaction, FACE-Q scales, and glabellar line severity scale (GLSS).

Results

Ninety-five percent of the 120 subjects were "highly satisfied" or "satisfied" with their treatment outcomes at 12 months. FACE-Q total scores suggested that subjects were less bothered by glabellar lines and felt better about their facial appearance with each treatment versus baseline. Approximately half of subjects had ≥ 1-grade improvement from baseline in GLSS at 12 months. Median onset of effect was 2 days.

Conclusion

The majority of subjects (95%) were satisfied with ABO treatment every 6 months; results were supported by high subject satisfaction, long duration, rapid onset, natural-looking results, and overall psychological wellness and safety.

### New uses of abobotulinumtoxinA in aesthetics [^11328bvH]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Skincare regimens designed to rejuvenate the skin can enhance the effects of BoNT-A used alone. These regimens frequently contain a retinoid and/or HA. Used daily, topical retinoids reverse photoaging by preventing destruction of the dermal matrix and promoting collagen formation, while creams, serums, and gels containing HA can improve skin hydration and elasticity. Other components of skincare regimens used in combination with BoNT-A include hydroquinone for skin lightening, and adenosine, which has been proposed to act by a number of mechanisms to reduce wrinkles and improve skin tone and texture.

Use of such a skin care regimen by individuals who have had BoNT-A injections has been demonstrated to have a beneficial effect on the mean volume and depth of facial lines, hyperpigmentation, smoothness of skin, and evenness of skin tone and color compared with BoNT-A injections alone.

A "microbotox" method of BoNT-A application has recently been developed. The microbotox method (also known as meso-Botox) developed by Wu in 2000, aimed to provide more natural-looking effects for patients. The method involves the systematic injection of multiple tiny blebs of highly diluted BoNT-A (mainly ONA) at 0.8 to 1.0 cm intervals into the dermis or the interface between the dermis and the superficial surface of the facial muscles. It is proposed that the microinjections smooth and tighten the skin by inducing bulk atrophy of the sweat and sebaceous glands, and by weakening the superficial muscle fibers that insert into the skin, thus reducing the pulling and tethering effects of the facial muscles that result in fine lines and wrinkles. Using microdroplets of dilute BoNT-A thus prevents diffusion into deeper muscles, which can lead to a "frozen" appearance. An additional advantage is that decreased sweat and sebaceous gland activity improves the appearance (quality) of the skin (especially the forehead). Practitioners must receive training in how to deliver the microdroplet technique consistently and superficially in order to avoid inadvertently paralyzing deeper muscle groups in the treated area. The effects of treatment typically last for 3 to 4 months but may last for up to 6 months. Although originally developed for ONA, the technique has also been successfully used with ABO. The author reports results with ABO have been less reliable, possibly due to the lack of a fixed dose ratio between ABO and ONA and the need to perform dose-ranging studies with the technique.

### Botox injection caused by case analysis and treatment experience sharing of eyelid edema [^1167nAhB]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Botulinum toxin is a noninvasive cosmetic procedure that relaxes facial expression muscles to mitigate the development of dynamic wrinkles. It inhibits nerve signals, temporarily paralyzes muscle activity, and reduces muscle contractions, thereby smoothing the skin and minimizing wrinkles. Botox injection for wrinkle reduction has become a widely used antiaging treatment due to its rapid effects, noninvasive nature, and short recovery time. Common adverse effects include local swelling, bruising, and ptosis, while eyelid oedema occurs less frequently. This study presents a case of allergic conjunctivitis and eyelid oedema occurring several days following botulinum toxin injection for wrinkle reduction.

5.1 Lack of Equivalency B etween Botulinum Toxin Products

The potency Units of BOTOX Cosmetic are specific to the preparation and assay method utilized. BOTOX Cosmetic is not equivalent to other preparations of botulinum toxin products, and therefore, Units of biological activity of BOTOX Cosmetic cannot be compared to nor converted into Units of any other botulinum toxin products assessed with any other specific assay method [see Description (11)].

5.2 Spread of Toxin Effect

Postmarketing safety data from BOTOX Cosmetic and other approved botulinum toxins suggest that botulinum toxin effects may, in some cases, be observed beyond the site of local injection. The symptoms are consistent with the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin and may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence, and breathing difficulties. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life threatening and there have been reports of death related to spread of toxin effects. The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity but symptoms can also occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions, and particularly in those patients who have an underlying condition that would predispose them to these symptoms. In unapproved uses and in approved indications, symptoms consistent with spread of toxin effect have been reported at doses comparable to or lower than doses used to treat cervical dystonia and spasticity. Advise patients or caregivers to seek immediate medical care if swallowing, speech or respiratory disorders occur.

No definitive serious adverse event reports of distant spread of toxin effect associated with dermatologic use of BOTOX/BOTOX Cosmeticat the labeled dose of 20 Units (for glabellar lines), 24 Units (for lateral canthal lines), 40 Units (for forehead lines with glabellar lines), 44 Units (for simultaneous treatment of lateral canthal lines and glabellar lines), 64 Units (for simultaneous treatment of lateral canthal lines, glabellar lines, and forehead lines), or 100 Units (for severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis) have been reported.

No definitive serious adverse event reports of distant spread of toxin effect associated with BOTOXfor blepharospasm at the recommended dose (30 Units and below), strabismus, or chronic migraine at the labeled doses have been reported.

### Evolution of facial aesthetic treatment over five or more years: a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of continuous onabotulinumtoxinA treatment [^114MS2Cx]. Dermatologic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Little information exists on how facial aesthetic treatments are incorporated into aesthetic regimens.

Objective

Assess the evolution of facial aesthetic treatments in patients receiving long-term continuous onabotulinumtoxinA treatment.

Methods

This international retrospective chart review included patients with ≥ 5 years of continuous onabotulinumtoxinA treatments including ≥ 1 glabellar lines treatment/year. Charts were reviewed for facial areas treated, number of treatments, doses/treatment visit, concomitant aesthetic procedures, and onabotulinumtoxinA-related adverse events.

Results

Data were collected from 5,112 onabotulinumtoxinA treatment sessions for 194 patients over an average of 9.1 years. Dosing was relatively stable over time; however, interinjection intervals increased. Glabellar lines' treatment temporally preceded crow's feet lines and forehead lines' treatment. A majority of patients (85%) also received treatment with fillers. Cumulative increases in onabotulinumtoxinA treatments occurred over time and by facial area corresponding with increases in treatments with injectable fillers, energy-based devices, and prescription topical creams. The longer the patients were treated, the younger they perceived themselves to look. Rates of adverse events were low.

Conclusion

OnabotulinumtoxinA treatment evolved over time, coinciding with growth of the facial aesthetics market. Additional treatment modalities were added as complements to onabotulinumtoxinA. Long-term continuous onabotulinumtoxinA injections are an important component of contemporary facial aesthetic treatment regimens.

### OnabotulinumtoxinA (botox) in the treatment of crow's feet lines in Japanese subjects [^111gNrBL]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Repeated treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA 24 and 12 U, with up to 5 treatment cycles over 13 months, was safe and well tolerated, with no new safety findings or cumulative deleterious effects. Few TEAEs considered related to treatment, serious TEAEs, or discontinuations because of TEAEs were reported. This safety profile was consistent and reproducible across treatments.

The proportion of subjects achieving CFL severity of none or mild at maximum smile with onabotulinumtoxinA 24 U at day 30 (68.3%) is consistent with that observed in a phase 3 study conducted in non-Asians (66.7%). Duration of effect based on the responder definition of none or mild in CFL severity at maximum smile was 95 days in this study of Japanese subjects and 118 days in the previous non-Asian study. Duration of effect using the definition of at least a 1-grade improvement at maximum smile (118 days) was consistent with findings from the non-Asian study (125 days). The efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA in Japanese subjects has been demonstrated for the treatment of glabellar lines. Our results, along with the established efficacy for treatment of glabellar lines, reinforce that onabotulinumtoxinA is a safe and effective esthetic treatment in Japanese subjects.

Certain study limitations deserve mention. Because of the frequency of re-treatment, the number of subjects in each treatment group decreased considerably after day 90, potentially limiting data interpretation beyond day 90. Additionally, only placebo-controlled treatment 1 in treatment period 1 was analyzed to assess the duration of effect. Because the study design allowed re-treatment to occur without a required return to baseline and as early as day 90, the duration of effect may have been shortened.

In conclusion, results indicate that repeated treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA (24 and 12 U) is effective and well tolerated in improving the appearance of CFL by reducing CFL severity at maximum smile in Japanese adults, with no new safety findings identified.

### Bridging the gap: sustained treatment effect of glabellar lines with twice-A-year treatment with daxibotulinumtoxinA [^114NeMep]. Dermatologic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The successful treatment of dynamic facial lines with botulinum toxin (BoNT) is achieved by reducing the strength of facial musculature. This effect typically peaks at 2 to 4 weeks after treatment, whereupon the pharmacology of the toxin dictates a progressive decline in efficacy. Without retreatment, the toxin's effect wanes until the wrinkle severity returns to baseline. Retreatment halts this decline and restores the desired effect. The timing of retreatment is a balancing act between the desire to maintain a relatively constant aesthetic outcome and the cost and feasibility of frequent treatments. Preventing periodic return to baseline severity between treatments spares the patient from a discontinuous correction, which could also be described as a "peak and valley" effect (Figure 1 A, B), and is an important aspect of creating consistency in appearance reflective of a natural aesthetic. However, in clinical practice, it is estimated that an average patient returns for 1.85 treatments per year (based on data from 690,513 patients across 782 aesthetic practices) rather than the 3- to 4-month frequency necessary to prevent discontinuous correction. Whether this reduced frequency and increased interval is due to cost, convenience, or disconnect between the patient's dynamic line severity and their perception of severity as the treatment effect gradually declines, its consequence is that the typical patient treated with legacy BoNT products will spend a substantial portion of a given calendar year undertreated. An average patient retreated every 6 months with these toxins will generally experience a full wearing off of the neuromodulator's efficacy and a return to baseline wrinkle severity, a highly undesirable outcome.

### Safety, pharmacodynamic response, and treatment satisfaction with onabotulinumtoxinA 40 U, 60 U, and 80 U in subjects with moderate to severe dynamic glabellar lines [^112ELtZE]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

OnabotulinumtoxinA 20 U reduces glabellar line (GL) severity at maximum frown for approximately 3 to 4 months. Small studies have suggested that > 20-U doses may increase the efficacy and duration of response for GLs.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate safety, pharmacodynamic response, and treatment satisfaction with onabotulinumtoxinA doses ≥ 20 U for GLs.

Methods

This 48-week, double-blind study compared 40, 60, and 80 U onabotulinumtoxinA vs 20 U and placebo in women with moderate or severe dynamic GLs on the Allergan Facial Wrinkle Scale. The following parameters were evaluated: the percentage of subjects with investigator-assessed ≥ 1-grade Facial Wrinkle Scale improvement from baseline at maximum frown (responders) at Week 24; the estimated median duration of response; the proportion of mostly/very satisfied responders on the Facial Line Satisfaction Questionnaire follow-up Items 1 to 5; and treatment-emergent adverse events.

Results

The modified intent-to-treat population (N = 226) had a mean age of 48.0 years, with similar baseline GL severity between treatment groups. Week 24 responder rates were 0% for placebo and 16.0%, 32.0%, 30.6%, and 38.5% for onabotulinumtoxinA 20, 40, 60, and 80 U, with significant (P < 0.05) differences for 40 and 80 U vs 20 U. Median duration of response was longer with all higher doses vs 20 U (≥ 24.0 vs 19.7 weeks; P < 0.05 vs 20 U at Week 24). Facial Line Satisfaction Questionnaire results indicated high subject satisfaction. The incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events did not exhibit a dose-response effect.

Conclusions

GL treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA doses > 20 U demonstrated longer duration of response and higher patient-reported satisfaction vs the on-label 20-U dose with no apparent impact on safety variables.

### Repeated onabotulinumtoxinA treatment of glabellar lines at rest over three treatment cycles [^115DQ6Cz]. Dermatologic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

OnabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX Cosmetic; Allergan plc, Irvine, CA) is a safe and effective neuromodulator that imparts the positive aesthetic effect of reducing dynamic facial lines. The most commonly treated area is the glabellar region where onabotulinumtoxinA limits the ability to contract the corrugator supercilii, orbicularis oculi, procerus, and frontalis muscles. More recently, intramuscular onabotulinumtoxinA treatment has demonstrated the additional benefit of improving mild lines at rest and overall skin quality. –

The authors previously reported the efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA to eliminate mild glabellar lines when individuals are not actively animating (i.e. lines at rest), an important albeit more subtle effect for those seeking a smoother and more youthful facial appearance. The authors hypothesized that this is due to local relaxation of transverse muscle cells, tissue remodeling in response to reduced muscle activity, or both. This effect also has been demonstrated quantitatively by Dessy and colleagues(2008) using electron microscope image analysis of silicon replicas after onabotulinumtoxinA treatment in the glabellar region. They reported a significant reduction in skin surface topographic parameters, including average skin roughness, and concluded these reductions were associated with the observed "smoother and lighter" appearance of the skin.

Clinical experience has suggested that there may be increased efficacy for lines at rest with repeated treatments of onabotulinumtoxinA. As such, this article reports on the effect of repeated treatments of glabellar lines at rest in a subset of the population the authors studied in their initial report; namely, those who had 3 consecutive cycles of onabotulinumtoxinA treatment. The authors extended the analysis from their initial report that was limited to subjects with "mild" lines at rest to include subjects with "moderate" and "severe" resting lines at baseline. In addition, the authors evaluated differences in lines at rest by age group among women with mild resting lines at baseline.

### Safety, pharmacodynamic response, and treatment satisfaction with onabotulinumtoxinA 40 U, 60 U, and 80 U in subjects with moderate to severe dynamic glabellar lines [^111SbKdB]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

OnabotulinumtoxinA 20 U reduces glabellar line (GL) severity at maximum frown for approximately 3 to 4 months. Small studies have suggested that > 20-U doses may increase the efficacy and duration of response for GLs.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate safety, pharmacodynamic response, and treatment satisfaction with onabotulinumtoxinA doses ≥ 20 U for GLs.

Methods

This 48-week, double-blind study compared 40, 60, and 80 U onabotulinumtoxinA vs 20 U and placebo in women with moderate or severe dynamic GLs on the Allergan Facial Wrinkle Scale. The following parameters were evaluated: the percentage of subjects with investigator-assessed ≥ 1-grade Facial Wrinkle Scale improvement from baseline at maximum frown (responders) at Week 24; the estimated median duration of response; the proportion of mostly/very satisfied responders on the Facial Line Satisfaction Questionnaire follow-up Items 1 to 5; and treatment-emergent adverse events.

Results

The modified intent-to-treat population (N = 226) had a mean age of 48.0 years, with similar baseline GL severity between treatment groups. Week 24 responder rates were 0% for placebo and 16.0%, 32.0%, 30.6%, and 38.5% for onabotulinumtoxinA 20, 40, 60, and 80 U, with significant (P < 0.05) differences for 40 and 80 U vs 20 U. Median duration of response was longer with all higher doses vs 20 U (≥ 24.0 vs 19.7 weeks; P < 0.05 vs 20 U at Week 24). Facial Line Satisfaction Questionnaire results indicated high subject satisfaction. The incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events did not exhibit a dose-response effect.

Conclusions

GL treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA doses > 20 U demonstrated longer duration of response and higher patient-reported satisfaction vs the on-label 20-U dose with no apparent impact on safety variables.

### High patient satisfaction for up to 6 months with onabotulinumtoxinA treatment for upper facial lines [^1175aiXb]. Dermatologic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Three facial regions that have been identified among patients' top 5 priorities for aesthetic treatment are forehead lines (FHL), glabellar lines (GL; frown lines between the brows), and lateral canthal lines [i.e. crow's feet lines (CFL)]. Collectively described as upper facial lines (UFL), their appearance is known to negatively affect self-esteem, self-perception, and mood; interfere with social interactions; and alter perceptions by others about emotional status and age. – The most commonly used treatment for UFL is neurotoxin injections, typically performed during a single visit.

OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox Cosmetic; Allergan Aesthetics, an AbbVie Company, Madison, NJ) is indicated for temporary improvement in the appearance of moderate to severe FHL associated with frontalis muscle activity, moderate to severe GL associated with corrugator and/or procerus muscle activity, and moderate to severe CFL associated with orbicularis oculi activity. The US FDA approval for GL was based on the results of 2 prospective clinical studies demonstrating efficacy and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA for reducing the severity of GL. FDA approval for the CFL and FHL indications was based on the results of 4 Phase 3 studies demonstrating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of onabotulinumtoxinA for reducing the appearance of UFL; the primary efficacy end point in these studies was at least a 2-grade improvement in wrinkle severity. – Efficacy and safety data on onabotulinumtoxinA for improving the appearance of UFL are well established, including patient-reported psychological impact and satisfaction; however, less is known regarding patient perception of treatment among those who achieved at least a 1-grade improvement.

The objective of this analysis was to investigate the relationship between investigator-assessed ≥ 1-grade improvement in UFL severity with onabotulinumtoxinA and patient-reported psychological impact and satisfaction, using data from 4 Phase 3 registration studies.

### Re-examining the optimal use of neuromodulators and the changing landscape: a consensus panel update [^115QKTPo]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Since initial US Food and Drug Administration approval of botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) for aesthetic use in 2002, clinical evidence and experience with BoNT-A and understanding of facial anatomy have greatly increased, leading to rapid advances in treatment planning and implementation. BoNT-A use has expanded from the upper face to the midface, lower face, and neck, so that BoNT-A injection is the most common cosmetic procedure worldwide. Trends in facial aesthetics reflect growing patient diversity with respect to age, gender, and ethnicity. In October 2019, a multidisciplinary panel of 6 experts in minimally invasive injectable procedures in the specialties of dermatology and plastic surgery convened at the 2019 American Society for Dermatologic Surgery (ASDS) meeting in Chicago, IL. Their goal was to discuss recent advances in BoNT-A use in facial aesthetics, including implications of the introduction of new agents in light of an evolving patient population.

### Safety, pharmacodynamic response, and treatment satisfaction with onabotulinumtoxinA 40 U, 60 U, and 80 U in subjects with moderate to severe dynamic glabellar lines [^117VRaba]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, subjects tended to grade their GLs at maximum frown more severely than the investigators. Although the statistical significance of these differences was not determined in this study, it is a trend consistent with other aesthetic studies, and may be reflective of a more intense bias of subjects toward the severity of the facial areas they consider to be treatment concerns. However, investigator and subject improvement ratings were more comparable with one another by Week 24.

The current study was designed to evaluate the pharmacodynamic response of onabotulinumtoxinA doses higher than that approved globally for the treatment of moderate to severe GLs (20 U). Considering the range of doses studied spanned a 4-fold increase over the approved dose, reconstitution was adapted to administer each dose in a lower volume than previous onabotulinumtoxinA studies for GL treatment (0.05 mL/injection vs 0.1 mL/injection per label). Administering a higher dose in a more concentrated solution may have mitigated known local spread of toxin effects and contributed to the favorable safety profile of the higher doses in this study. For example, the summary of TEAEs listed on the onabotulinumtoxinA product label indicates that the incidence of eyelid ptosis was 3% for subjects treated with 20 U; in contrast, the incidence of eyelid ptosis in the current study was 0.5%, occurring only in subjects treated in the OL phase with onabotulinumtoxinA 80 U. Further studies may provide insights into whether the clinical performance profile differentiates across injection volumes, particularly because head-to-head studies of 0.1- and 0.05-mL injection volumes have not been published.

### Efficacy and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA treatment of forehead lines: a multicenter, randomized, dose-ranging controlled trial [^117AaJiX]. Dermatologic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Various onabotulinumtoxinA doses are effective in treating forehead lines (FHL), with a trend toward lower doses.

Objective

To evaluate efficacy and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA dose-ranging treatment of FHL when the frontalis area and glabellar complex are treated together.

Materials and Methods

Adults with moderate-to-severe FHL received onabotulinumtoxinA 40 U (FHL, 20 U; glabellar lines [GL], 20 U), 30 U (FHL, 10 U; GL, 20 U), or placebo. Response was assessed at weeks 1, 2, day 30, and monthly to day 180. Coprimary efficacy end points were investigator- and subject-assessed Facial Wrinkle Scale scores of none or mild (day 30). Patient-reported outcomes, onset/duration of effect, and adverse events (AEs) were evaluated.

Results

Responder rates (investigator/subject, respectively) were 40-U group, 91.2%/89.5%; 30-U group, 86.4%/81.4%; placebo, 1.7%/5.1%. OnabotulinumtoxinA resulted in significantly greater responder rates than placebo (p < .001). Adverse events were mild to moderate and similar between groups (most common AEs: nasopharyngitis [4.6%] and headache [4.0%]).

Conclusion

Treatment of FHL with onabotulinumtoxinA 40 and 30 U (in frontalis and glabellar complex muscles) was tolerable, effective, and sustained. Both doses significantly reduced FHL severity; however, the 40-U dose demonstrated a trend toward greater sustained benefit and longer duration of effect versus the 30-U dose, with similar AE rates.

### Retrospective review of 500 patients treated with abobotulinumtoxinA [^1112bZEq]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Prior international clinical experience and domestic controlled clinical trials provide useful guidance for dosing of a new botulinum toxin type A, abobotulinumtoxinA. Nonetheless, aftermarket experience is paramount in providing confirmatory "real world" information on any recently introduced drug. This report describes the incorporation of abobotulinumtoxinA into an established clinical practice that previously only utilized onabotulinumtoxinA for facial rejuvenation.

Description

Retrospective review of 500 patients who received abobotulinumtoxinA injections.

Results

A total of 736 abobotulinumtoxinA treatments were administered to 500 patients. The most common areas treated were corrugators, "crow's feet", frontalis, brow and platysma, respectively. A dose conversion ratio of 1:2.67 (onabotulinumtoxinA: abobotulinumtoxinA) was determined. The majority of adverse events were considered to be mild and self-limiting. There were three (0.6%) cases of ptosis.

Conclusion

Since its recent approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), experience with abobotulinumtoxinA is evolving. Utilizing a dose conversion ratio of 1:2.67 units (onabotulinumtoxinA: abobotulinumtoxinA) and the same injection techniques, one can safely and effectively incorporate this new neurotoxin into his or her practice.

### Key parameters for the use of abobotulinumtoxinA in aesthetics: onset and duration [^112eMSsP]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Differences in Onset and Duration of Activity

Among the clinical studies reviewed for this paper, the shortest time to onset of effect with ABO was seen for wrinkles on the forehead and around the eyes. In 1 study, a fifth of patients saw an effect on the depth of crow's feet wrinkles within 24 hours of treatment, with 100% of patients reporting improvement after 5 days. A second study found some degree of activity at Day 2 after injection and full onset at Day 6. For the frontalis, utilizing an objective measurement method, a single study found that the median time to onset of activity with a typical dose was 12 to 18 hours, with some patients exhibiting an effect after 6 hours (Table 3).

Table 3.
Influence of Muscle on AbobotulinumtoxinA Onset and Duration

Not surprisingly, as the oldest registered indication, the majority of studies with onset and duration data focus on the glabella. In the studies carried out to support the approval of ABO, the median time to onset of activity with the 50 unit dose was between 2 and 4 days, with a median of 2.5 days. Some activity was noted in the first 24 hours after injection in some patients. Median time to onset in previously naïve patients who received up to 4 treatments at intervals of ≥ 85 days remained at 3 days across all cycles of treatment.

In studies of the duration of effect in the glabella, when paralysis not relaxation was achieved, most patients maintained a near full effect of the toxin 2 months after injection; by 3 months this had declined to about a half of patients, and at 4 months to between a quarter and a third of patients. At 6 months, up to a fifth of patients continued to show an effect. This pattern was preserved in patients who underwent a series of injections (Table 3).

In the study by Kassir et al, the duration of effect seemed to be longer (Table 2). It is interesting to note that the design of this split-face study, which compared ABO against ONA, required injections to the glabellar to be more concentrated than is usually recommended for clinical use, to mitigate against spread.

### Improving neck and jawline aesthetics with onabotulinumtoxinA by minimizing platysma muscle contraction effects: efficacy and safety results in a phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled study [^113S3SuM]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

A well-defined lower face and neck signal a youthful facial appearance. The platysma muscle plays a crucial role in lower facial and neck aesthetics by smoothly draping the area from the upper thoracic region to the lower face and above the mandible. However, as the platysma muscle ages, it can contribute to a less defined jawline, accentuating jowling and visible vertical neck bands. This condition is referred to as platysma prominence (PP) and is commonly associated with aging, although it can also affect younger individuals.PP presentation can vary anatomically within the same individual, leading to an asymmetrical presentation of PP.

PP is caused by the contraction of the platysma muscle over time, which leads to shortening of the muscle fibers and may result in a more pronounced appearance. As a result, the platysma muscle may contract noticeably during normal activities like smiling or talking, becoming visible and potentially bothersome in appearance. Other age-related changes, such as cervical skin laxity, platysma muscle diastasis, or cervical fat loss, can further exacerbate PP. The changes in the lower face and neck contours caused by PP can negatively impact an individual's psychological well-being and self-esteem. Moreover, PP can interfere with facial expressions, resulting in an unattractive appearance that does not accurately portray the person's emotional state.

OnabotulinumtoxinA (onabotA; BOTOX Cosmetic, Vistabel, Allergan Aesthetics, an AbbVie company, Irvine, CA) demonstrated efficacy in improving moderate-to-severe PP at various doses (26, 31, and 36 U, or 52, 62, and 72 U) in a recent phase 2 dose-escalating study, with the 26, 31, and 36 U dose group showing a more favorable safety profile. Additionally, a pivotal phase 3 study conducted in the United States and Canada confirmed the safety of onabotA dosages of 26, 31, and 36 U and showed significant and clinically meaningful improvements in PP. In this phase 3 study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of onabotA (26, 31, and 36 U) compared to placebo in participants from multiple countries, consisting of the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, the United States, and Canada.

### Facial rejuvenation after intradermal botulinum toxin: is it really the botulinum toxin or is it the pricks? [^111VboMF]. Dermatologic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The use of intradermal botulinum toxin A (onabotulinumtoxinA) remains a relatively new technique and is an off-label cosmetic application for facial skin rejuvenation. There is little documented clinical evidence of the objective benefits of this therapy.

Purpose

To determine whether intradermal facial onabotulinumtoxinA injection has any benefits.

Study Design

Interventional, comparative, split face clinical trial.

Methods

Informed consent was obtained from 10 physicians. One half of the physician's faces were randomly injected with onabotulinumtoxinA (2 U/0.1 mL; 30 facial injections on half of the face, each 0.1 mL) intradermally and the other half of the face with normal saline (30 facial injections on half of the face, each 0.1 mL). The injecting clinician and the subjects were blinded to the contents of the syringes. One and 4 weeks later, two neutral, blinded observers assessed the subjects in person. The patients were also photographed in ambient light surroundings and the same observers compared the halves of their faces in photographs and rated them on a scale of -4 to +4.

Results

Global improvement in skin texture and tightness was noted in the post-treatment photographs (the skin appeared to be tenser and smoother), although there was no difference between the two groups and, hence, the changes could not be clinically ascribed to the intradermal botulinum toxin injections. No other meaningful clinical difference could be demonstrated between the two sides of the face, in any of the 10 subjects, in person or in photographs. The small study sample precluded formal statistical analysis.

Conclusion

Intradermal botulinum toxin A injection does not appear to have any benefit in facial rejuvenation.

### FollowTheSutures: piloting a new way to administer onabotulinumtoxinA for chronic migraine [^113c9hke]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Administering BoNT-A over the cranial sutures is based on recent elegant anatomical and animal experimental studies. It is practical, well tolerated, and with less risk of unblinding in the context of placebo-controlled clinical trials. This small open-label study suggests the possibility of a treatment effect, but confirmation will certainly require an adequately sized, multi-center, randomized placebo-control study. A head-to-head trial comparing outcomes of FollowTheSuture (FTS) and PREEMPT injection paradigms would be necessary to evaluate the comparable efficacy, tolerability, and any differences in patient acceptance.

### Onabotulinumtoxina (Botox) [^115GCBUG]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.000000000000000e+00 1 Spread of Toxin Effect

Postmarketing safety data from BOTOX and other approved botulinum toxins suggest that botulinum toxin effects may, in some cases, be observed beyond the site of local injection. The symptoms are consistent with the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin and may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence, and breathing difficulties. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life threatening and there have been reports of death related to spread of toxin effects. The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity but symptoms can also occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions, and particularly in those patients who have an underlying condition that would predispose them to these symptoms. In unapproved uses and in approved indications, symptoms consistent with spread of toxin effect have been reported at doses comparable to or lower than doses used to treat cervical dystonia and spasticity. Patients or caregivers should be advised to seek immediate medical care if swallowing, speech or respiratory disorders occur.

No definitive serious adverse event reports of distant spread of toxin effect associated with BOTOXfor blepharospasm at the recommended dose (30 Units and below), severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis at the recommended dose (100 Units), strabismus, or for chronic migraine at the labeled doses have been reported.

5.2 Lack of Interchangeability between Botulinum Toxin Products

The potency Units of BOTOX are specific to the preparation and assay method utilized. They are not interchangeable with other preparations of botulinum toxin products and, therefore, units of biological activity of BOTOX cannot be compared to nor converted into units of any other botulinum toxin products assessed with any other specific assay method [see Description (11)].

### Key parameters for the use of abobotulinumtoxinA in aesthetics: onset and duration [^1149qDN3]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Unlike other aesthetic procedures, injections of botulinumtoxinA (BoNT-A) into the appropriate facial muscles actually address the underlying cause of wrinkles. Injections into the appropriate muscle or muscles cause temporary, reversible paralysis that softens hyperdynamic lines. Details of the mechanism of action for BoNT-A are discussed in detail elsewhere in this supplement, but a brief introduction is provided below.

Reconstituted type A complexes of the core 150 kDa neurotoxin protein, which include hemagglutinin and non-hemagglutinin proteins, appear to dissociate at physiological pH values. Once injected, the core protein initially binds to the presynaptic membrane, then crosses the membrane into the nerve cells, where synaptosomal- associated protein 25 kDa is cleaved. This protein plays a key role in the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into the neuromuscular junction. Blocking the release of acetylcholine blocks the transmission of nerve impulses causing paralysis and/or weakness of the target muscle. Recovery of impulse transmission occurs gradually as the original nerve terminal recovers. This mode of action means that the effects of treatment are not seen immediately after the procedure, nor are they permanent.

Time to onset of response and duration of activity are important factors that have a considerable influence on patient satisfaction with treatment. Patients want the effect of treatment to be visible as soon as possible after the procedure, and to last for as long as possible to increase the interval between procedures and hence decrease inconvenience and cost. The time to onset of response and the duration of activity are also important markers of efficacy for BoNT-A, and may be related to individual patient genetics, individual muscle mass, absolute units injected, and injection technique.

In general, some patients are aware of an improvement in wrinkles within 1 day of treatment, and return of muscle function generally seems to occur 3 to 6 months after treatment. Patients who have had multiple treatment sessions may find that the duration of effect becomes longer, thus lengthening the interval between injections. This effect may be related or secondary to muscle atrophy, reducing the number of BoNT-A targets available and so reducing the dose requirements.

### Immunogenicity of daxibotulinumtoxinA for injection in glabellar lines [^115Tedrb]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Aesthetic treatment with neuromodulators requires repeat administration to maintain the desired effect and can continue over many years, often with the addition of more treatment areas over time, thereby increasing the dose per treatment and adding to the cumulative antigen exposure. A longer median duration of clinical efficacy has been observed with DAXI (24 weeks) than has been reported for conventional BoNTAs (12–14 weeks), reducing the frequency at which retreatment is needed. Because the approved dose of DAXI for the treatment of glabellar lines contains a similar amount of neurotoxin (antigen) as onabotulinumtoxinA, less frequent dosing over long-term treatment will reduce the cumulative amount of antigen administered, thereby reducing the immunogenic potential.

Although the risk of immunogenicity is low with BoNTA products in aesthetic treatment, if secondary nonresponse due to neutralizing antibodies does occur, it will have a long-term impact on a patient's clinical outcomes. This is particularly relevant in those patients who may develop neutralizing antibodies in response to aesthetic BoNTA treatment and who may subsequently require neurotoxin for therapeutic treatment. It is important to note that immunogenicity is not the only determinant of nonresponse; other reasons can include preparation and administration errors, inappropriate muscle selection or injection technique, insufficient dosage, or changes in patient perception of benefit, and these possibilities should be investigated before considering an immunogenic response. It is also noteworthy that some patients with detected neutralizing antibodies retain their clinical responsiveness and, conversely, patients without detectable neutralizing antibodies have been nonresponsive to BoNTAs. Nevertheless, immunogenic potential is an important factor for clinicians to consider when selecting a treatment regimen to reduce the likelihood of immunogenic secondary nonresponse.
