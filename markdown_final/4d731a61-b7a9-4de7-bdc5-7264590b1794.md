## Question

Management of small cell lung cancer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of small cell lung cancer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about initial evaluation and staging. Then, I should stratify by limited versus extensive stage. Next, I will outline first-line therapy for limited-stage disease, including surgery, chemoradiation, and PCI. After that, I will detail first-line therapy for extensive-stage disease, including immunotherapy and consolidative thoracic radiotherapy. Then, I should address relapsed or refractory disease and special populations. Finally, I will integrate supportive care, surveillance, and a concise summary of key principles, making sure I verify each claim against guidelines as I go.

> Let me first confirm the initial evaluation and staging principles, because delays in SCLC can be catastrophic. I need to ensure a rapid, parallel workup with brain imaging and comprehensive staging using both VA limited/extensive classification and TNM, and I should not let staging delay treatment beyond about a week given disease aggressiveness; PET is suggested in limited-stage disease and can obviate a bone scan, while brain MRI is preferred over CT for detection of occult metastases and for surveillance when PCI is deferred [^114CrNkB] [^116y7oh9] [^113TGtQA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stage assignment. I should double-check that limited-stage is typically stage I–III disease confined to a single radiation field, whereas extensive-stage is stage IV or disease too widespread for a single field, and I must remember that early integration of palliative care and smoking cessation counseling are recommended during initial evaluation to align goals and mitigate harm [^114CrNkB].

> Next, I will examine limited-stage disease management, where the intent is curative. Wait, let me verify the backbone: concurrent platinum–etoposide with early thoracic radiotherapy is standard, with cisplatin preferred when feasible and carboplatin acceptable if cisplatin is contraindicated. Radiotherapy should start by cycle 1 or 2, and twice-daily regimens have historical support though once-daily regimens are also used in practice [^111V9Q3r] [^113rWvPP] [^115pxa4z].

> I should confirm PCI indications in limited-stage disease. PCI at 25 Gy in 10 fractions is recommended after complete or partial response to initial therapy, but I need to ensure I counsel on neurocognitive risks, especially in older adults, and consider MRI surveillance if PCI is declined; importantly, the benefit of PCI is less clear in pathologic stage I disease after definitive therapy, so shared decision-making is essential [^115uVNAP] [^113TGtQA] [^11484zZX].

> But wait, what if the patient has very early, node-negative disease amenable to surgery? I need to check that surgery is reserved for carefully selected clinical stage I (T1–2N0) patients after invasive mediastinal staging and extrathoracic imaging, with the operative goal of anatomic lobectomy and mediastinal nodal dissection aiming for R0 resection; sublobar resection should be avoided, and adjuvant platinum–etoposide is recommended postoperatively, with the caveat that contemporary randomized data are limited and multidisciplinary review is mandatory [^115kT1pm] [^113LfFtc] [^114mxVGE].

> Let me consider alternatives for medically inoperable stage I–IIA patients or those declining surgery. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy followed by systemic therapy is an option, and I should confirm that when SBRT is used, chemotherapy should still be delivered if tolerated to address micrometastatic disease; advanced planning and motion management are recommended to safely deliver ablative doses [^1154mMwi] [^114aUW56] [^1175yvxG].

> Now, I will review extensive-stage disease, where the paradigm shifted with immunotherapy. I should confirm that first-line therapy is carboplatin–etoposide plus atezolizumab or durvalumab for four cycles, followed by maintenance immunotherapy until progression or unacceptable toxicity; cisplatin can be substituted in selected patients, but carboplatin is often preferred for tolerability, and I must screen for autoimmune disease and immunosuppression before initiating ICIs [^114ACxnu] [^113obMs4] [^116LKG9U].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to cite the CASPIAN regimen as cisplatin–etoposide–durvalumab every 21 days, but I should correct myself. CASPIAN used durvalumab on day 1 every 3 weeks during chemo and then every 4 weeks during maintenance, so the maintenance schedule is 28 days, not 21 days, and I need to ensure I document that accurately in the plan [^114ACxnu].

> Next, I should review consolidative thoracic radiotherapy in extensive-stage disease. I need to check that ASTRO recommends considering thoracic radiotherapy, typically 30 Gy in 10 fractions, for patients with any response after chemotherapy, especially with residual intrathoracic disease, while ESMO notes insufficient evidence to mandate consolidation TRT in the immunotherapy era and advises shared decision-making. Thus, I should individualize based on performance status, pulmonary function, and response [^115rCZeF] [^113jRpbu] [^116nXbDs].

> I will now examine PCI in extensive-stage disease, and I should confirm that guidance is evolving. Historically, PCI improved survival after response, but modern MRI surveillance has challenged routine PCI; ESMO suggests insufficient evidence and emphasizes shared decision-making, whereas ACCP still supports offering PCI after response, so I must balance neurocognitive risks against brain metastasis prevention and align with patient preferences [^115AZtnw] [^117Kfgmc].

> Let me think about relapsed or refractory disease categorization, because it drives therapy. Sensitive relapse is generally more than 90 days after completing frontline therapy, whereas resistant disease is within 90 days; in sensitive relapse, rechallenge with platinum–etoposide is reasonable, while in all relapses, single-agent topotecan, lurbinectedin, or tarlatamab are preferred options, and I should avoid continuing maintenance immunotherapy after progression on immunotherapy given insufficient evidence [^112or93e] [^1163zEcf] [^115vhGfn].

> Hold on, I should verify supportive care and special situations. For poor performance status due to SCLC, chemotherapy can be offered with dose adjustments, and sequential radiotherapy can be considered if performance improves. For elderly patients, carboplatin-based regimens are often better tolerated, and in transformed SCLC from EGFR-mutant NSCLC, I should avoid concurrent TKI and ICI due to toxicity and rely on cytotoxic chemotherapy with consideration of referral to experienced centers [^115YdoK7] [^1147ZAst] [^115wwjK8].

> Next, I should review symptom-directed radiotherapy because SCLC frequently causes compressive syndromes. Early radiotherapy is indicated for spinal cord compression, palliative thoracic or bone radiotherapy improves quality of life, and endobronchial interventions or stents can palliate airway obstruction. I need to ensure timely integration of these modalities alongside systemic therapy when appropriate [^112V9ids] [^111sRycC] [^116Vk4Ds].

> I need to ensure surveillance is structured and risk-adapted. Brain MRI every 3–4 months is reasonable in extensive-stage disease, especially if PCI was not given, and after limited-stage therapy, surveillance should include history, exam, and chest imaging every 3–6 months for 2 years, then every 6–12 months thereafter. I should also reinforce smoking cessation at every visit given its impact on outcomes and toxicity [^112k3JXT].

> Let me reconsider the overarching principles to close the loop. SCLC is highly chemosensitive but prone to rapid relapse, so curative-intent multimodality therapy in limited-stage disease and timely systemic therapy in extensive-stage disease are critical. Immunotherapy has modestly extended survival in extensive-stage disease, and clinical trial participation should be encouraged at every stage to access evolving targeted and immunotherapeutic strategies [^1154mMwi] [^117Utrry] [^114CZAZY].

---

The cornerstone of SCLC management is **stage-directed therapy** [^117FBCtD] with curative-intent concurrent chemoradiation for limited-stage disease [^116L5jA7] and platinum–etoposide plus immunotherapy for extensive-stage disease [^117Utrry], with **PCI offered after response** [^117Kfgmc] [^115jR6NA] and early palliative care integrated throughout [^114CrNkB]. Surgery is reserved for **stage I disease** after meticulous staging [^117JJioU] [^116E9mBJ], with adjuvant chemotherapy and consideration of PCI [^11484zZX] [^114mxVGE]. For relapsed disease, **topotecan or lurbinectedin** are preferred options [^112or93e], and clinical trials should be prioritized to address the limited efficacy of current therapies [^1154mMwi].

---

## Staging and initial evaluation

Staging uses a **two-stage system** — limited-stage (LS) disease is confined to one hemithorax and can be encompassed in a single radiation field, whereas extensive-stage (ES) disease extends beyond or includes distant metastases [^1154mMwi]. The initial workup should be expedited and, when possible, performed in parallel, including a history and physical, laboratory tests, contrast-enhanced chest/abdomen CT, brain MRI or CT, bone scan or PET-CT, and PET-CT for LS disease [^1164H8Hu] [^116y7oh9] [^1154mMwi]. Given the aggressive biology, **treatment should not be delayed by more than one week** [^114CrNkB].

---

## Limited-stage SCLC (LS-SCLC)

### Standard treatment

- **Concurrent chemoradiation**: Cisplatin–etoposide with early thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) starting by cycle 1–2 [^113rWvPP]; twice-daily TRT (45 Gy in 30 fractions) is preferred if tolerated [^115uVNAP] [^116L5jA7].
- **PCI**: 25 Gy in 10 fractions after response to reduce brain metastases and improve survival [^115jR6NA] [^113G49Ui].
- **LS-SCLC without PCI**: Use MRI brain surveillance every 3–4 months [^notfound].

---

### Surgical considerations

Surgery is reserved for **clinical stage I (T1–2N0)** disease after invasive mediastinal staging and extrathoracic imaging [^116E9mBJ] [^1164H8Hu]. Operative management should aim for **lobectomy with mediastinal nodal dissection** to achieve an R0 resection; sublobar resection is not recommended [^113LfFtc]. Adjuvant **chemotherapy** (platinum–etoposide) is required after resection [^114mxVGE].

---

## Extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC)

### First-line systemic therapy

- **Standard regimen**: Platinum (carboplatin preferred)–etoposide plus a PD-L1 inhibitor (atezolizumab or durvalumab) for four cycles, followed by maintenance immunotherapy until progression or intolerance [^117Utrry] [^113obMs4] [^114ACxnu].
- **Immunotherapy-ineligible patients**: Platinum–etoposide alone for 4–6 cycles [^1178AiuP].
- **Carboplatin substitution**: Consider carboplatin for patients unable to tolerate cisplatin [^115BYzZR].

---

### Consolidative thoracic radiotherapy (TRT)

Consolidative **TRT** (30 Gy in 10 fractions) should be considered after chemotherapy response in patients with adequate performance status and limited thoracic disease [^117E8o68] [^115rCZeF].

---

### Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI)

PCI at **25 Gy in 10 fractions** is recommended after chemotherapy response in ES-SCLC [^115uVNAP]. However, **shared decision-making** is essential, especially in older adults or those with impaired cognition, given potential neurocognitive risks [^113TGtQA].

---

## Relapsed or refractory SCLC

Sensitive relapse (** > 90 days** after therapy) can be managed with rechallenge with the first-line platinum–etoposide regimen or single-agent topotecan or lurbinectedin [^112or93e] [^1163zEcf]. Resistant relapse (** ≤ 90 days**) is treated with topotecan or lurbinectedin, with consideration of clinical trials and immunotherapy only in selected contexts [^115vhGfn]. For all subsequent lines, enrollment in **clinical trials** is strongly encouraged [^1154mMwi].

---

## Special populations and considerations

In older or frail patients, **carboplatin–etoposide** with dose adjustments is reasonable, and sequential chemoradiation may be used if performance status improves [^112QHYk7] [^115YdoK7]. For poor performance status, **initial chemotherapy followed by sequential radiotherapy** or best supportive care is appropriate [^115YdoK7]. In transformed SCLC, **systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy** per SCLC guidelines is recommended, and immunotherapy should be avoided if a TKI is continued [^115wwjK8] [^117ACspq].

---

## Supportive care and symptom management

Early integration of **palliative care** should occur from diagnosis to address symptoms, quality of life, and goals of care [^114CrNkB]. Symptom control includes radiotherapy for bone pain, dyspnea, or superior vena cava syndrome; management of paraneoplastic syndromes; and psychological support [^111sRycC].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

Follow-up consists of visits every 3–4 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years, and annually thereafter, with chest imaging and brain MRI at each visit. Given the high risk of recurrence, **vigilant surveillance** is essential [^notfound].

---

## Emerging therapies and clinical trials

Clinical trials should be prioritized to evaluate **novel agents** (e.g. DLL3-targeted therapies, PARP inhibitors, Aurora kinase inhibitors) and combinations, and participation is critical given limited efficacy of current standards [^1154mMwi] [^1136xjXr].

---

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Stage** | **Primary treatment** | **Adjunctive therapy** | **Special considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| LS-SCLC | Concurrent chemoradiation (cisplatin–etoposide + TRT) | PCI (25 Gy/10 fx) | Surgery for stage I; MRI surveillance if PCI deferred |
| ES-SCLC | Platinum–etoposide + PD-L1 inhibitor | PCI (25 Gy/10 fx) | Consolidative TRT (30 Gy/10 fx) if response |
| Relapsed | Topotecan or lurbinectedin | Clinical trials | Rechallenge if sensitive relapse |

---

SCLC management hinges on **stage-directed therapy**, with concurrent chemoradiation for LS-SCLC and platinum–etoposide plus immunotherapy for ES-SCLC, plus PCI after response and early palliative care. Surgery is reserved for stage I disease, and clinical trials are essential to advance outcomes [^111V9Q3r] [^115uVNAP] [^114CrNkB] [^112X37sy] [^1154mMwi].

Stage I small cell lung cancer — surgical staging, resection, and adjuvant therapy: In patients with clinical stage I SCLC being considered for curative intent surgical resection, invasive mediastinal staging and extrathoracic imaging (head MRI/CT and PET or abdominal CT plus bone scan) is recommended (Grade 1B). After a thorough distant and invasive mediastinal stage evaluation, surgical resection is suggested over non-surgical treatment (Grade 2C). In patients with stage I SCLC who have undergone curative-intent surgical resection, platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended (Grade 2C).

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) epidemiology and historical management — SCLC represents approximately 13% of newly diagnosed lung cancers, with about one-third of patients diagnosed with localized or locoregional disease (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] stage I-III, limited-stage [LS]) and the remaining two-thirds presenting with distant metastatic disease (AJCC stage IV, extensive-stage [ES]). For LS-SCLC, the standard treatment has consisted of chemotherapy with early administration of concurrent twice-daily thoracic radiation therapy (RT) and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI), whereas in ES disease treatment typically involves chemotherapy alone with or without PCI. These approaches were established over the past 30 years, and recent phase III reports include: in 2015 the Chest Radiotherapy Extensive-Stage Trial (CREST) reporting a long-term survival benefit with thoracic consolidative RT for ES-SCLC; in 2017 the Concurrent Once-Daily Versus Twice-Daily Radiotherapy (CONVERT) trial reporting on survival and toxicity differences between the 2 schedules in LS-SCLC; a 2017 Japanese PCI trial calling into question the role of PCI when modern imaging surveillance is performed in ES-SCLC; and in 2018 IMpower133 reporting that adding immunotherapy to cytotoxic chemotherapy improved survival for ES-SCLC.

### Clinical insights into small cell lung cancer: tumor heterogeneity, diagnosis, therapy, and future directions [^1147DmXq]. CA (2023). Medium credibility.

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by rapid growth and high metastatic capacity. It has strong epidemiologic and biologic links to tobacco carcinogens. Although the majority of SCLCs exhibit neuroendocrine features, an important subset of tumors lacks these properties. Genomic profiling of SCLC reveals genetic instability, almost universal inactivation of the tumor suppressor genes TP53 and RB1, and a high mutation burden. Because of early metastasis, only a small fraction of patients are amenable to curative-intent lung resection, and these individuals require adjuvant platinum-etoposide chemotherapy. Therefore, the vast majority of patients are currently being treated with chemoradiation with or without immunotherapy. In patients with disease confined to the chest, standard therapy includes thoracic radiotherapy and concurrent platinum-etoposide chemotherapy. Patients with metastatic (extensive-stage) disease are treated with a combination of platinum-etoposide chemotherapy plus immunotherapy with an anti-programmed death-ligand 1 monoclonal antibody. Although SCLC is initially very responsive to platinum-based chemotherapy, these responses are transient because of the development of drug resistance. In recent years, the authors have witnessed an accelerating pace of biologic insights into the disease, leading to the redefinition of the SCLC classification scheme. This emerging knowledge of SCLC molecular subtypes has the potential to define unique therapeutic vulnerabilities. Synthesizing these new discoveries with the current knowledge of SCLC biology and clinical management may lead to unprecedented advances in SCLC patient care. Here, the authors present an overview of multimodal clinical approaches in SCLC, with a special focus on illuminating how recent advancements in SCLC research could accelerate clinical development.

### Big decisions on small cell lung cancer: a focus on clinical care updates and patient perspectives… [^112jwJnS]. ASCO (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract Small cell lung cancer is an uncommon, aggressive high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, associated with tobacco use. It is a highly chemosensitive disease that initially responds quickly to systemic therapy, although patients with SCLC tend to develop relapse. Although the landscape of SCLC treatment has remained stagnant for many decades, the field has seen notable advances in the past few years, including the use of immunotherapy, the development of further lines of systemic therapy, the refinement of thoracic and intracranial radiotherapy, and — most recently — the promise of more targeted therapies. 12However, in the past 6 years, there have been significant advances in SCLC treatment, with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, targeted therapies, cellular therapies, and improved supportive care coming to the forefront.

3The standard of care for LS-SCLC is concurrent chemoradiotherapy, with platinum agent and etoposide, followed by prophylactic cranial irradiation. 4However, recent advances in the use of ICIs in ES-SCLC have inspired efforts in examining the use of ICIs in the LS setting as well. Two single-center, single-arm phase II studies investigating ICI use in LS-SCLC both reported outcomes that compared favorably with historical controls. The first examined the use of pembrolizumab in combination with CCRT, with a median overall survival of 39. 5 months; notably, 10% of patients in this trial had non-SCLC neuroendocrine carcinomas. As with LS-SCLC, the foundation of treatment is with chemotherapy, with a combination of platinum agent with etoposide. Finally, the use of later lines of therapy is unclear, with a number of proposed treatment targets but with mixed clinical response.

Significant efforts have focused on cell surface proteins, as SCLC is known to be a largely immunologically cold tumor, with low levels of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Suffice it to say, treatment options for relapsed or refractory SCLC can be confusing for patients, families, and clinicians alike, as many promising treatments have come and gone. The addition of lurbinectedin as a line of treatment is notable, even with its short-lived response, as are increasing data regarding the sequencing of reinduction platinum doublet, immunotherapy, and topotecan.

Standard chemotherapy regimens in small cell lung cancer — EP has been shown to have efficacy equivalent to alkylator-based regimens with a more favorable toxicity profile, and although other platinum-based regimens have been evaluated, none have proven superior to EP or EC and they frequently carry added toxicity; therefore, EP and EC remain the standard chemotherapy regimens for patients with both LS- and ES-SCLC.

### Systemic therapy for small-cell lung cancer: ASCO-Ontario health (cancer care Ontario) guideline… [^113ZM3vq]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

8there have now been significant advances in the systemic treatment of ES-SCLC with the incorporation of immune checkpoint inhibitors into first-line therapy, 9, 10and additional options for subsequent treatment of recurrent disease. 11, 12 13–17The purpose of this ASCO and Ontario Health updated guideline is to summarize recommendations for systemic therapy in the management of patients with SCLC in light of recent advances.
18. Literature review and clinical interpretation. 121Patients were randomly assigned to receive six cycles of either PE or CE. Most of those with LS-SCLC also underwent concurrent thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation. For LS-SCLC, RRs were 76% for PE and 86% for CE. Comparative survival data were only reported for patients with all stages combined, with no clinically relevant differences between PE and CE: time to progression were significantly improved by the addition of atezolizumab.

In subset analyses, patients with brain metastases had no apparent benefit and those younger than 65 had greater benefit than older patients. An update continued to support an improvement in OS with chemoimmunotherapy with a total of 1, 553 patients, and found strong evidence for an improvement in both PFS and OS with the addition of immunotherapy, with no significant difference between anti–PD-L1 and anti–PD-1 agents. Based on the available evidence, the panel suggests that patients with ES-SCLC should be treated with first-line platinum and etoposide plus either durvalumab or atezolizumab for four cycles followed by maintenance immunotherapy.

### Treatment of small cell lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^115uVNAP]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Radiation therapy and PCI recommendations (section 4.3) — In patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC), early chemoradiotherapy, with accelerated hyper-fractionated radiation therapy (twice-daily treatment) concurrently with platinum-based chemotherapy, is recommended (Grade 1B). In patients with LS- or extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC) who achieve a complete or partial response to initial therapy, PCI is recommended (Grade 1B), and the regimen of 25 Gy in 10 daily fractions has the greatest supporting data for safety and efficacy. In ES-SCLC patients who have completed chemotherapy and achieved a CR outside the chest and a complete or partial response in the chest, a course of consolidative TRT is suggested (Grade 2C). Regarding the optimal timing of PCI, it is likely best given after all planned chemotherapy has been administered.

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) initial evaluation — workflow and timing — states that the workup for SCLC should be expedited with studies done in parallel whenever possible, and staging primarily provides a therapeutic guideline for thoracic RT for patients with limited-stage SCLC. However, staging should not delay the onset of treatment for > 1 week because of the aggressive nature of SCLC, and the Panel recommends early integration of palliative care so that management of cancer-related symptoms and goals of care are discussed during initial evaluation.

Regarding medical management for small cell lung cancer - NCCN, more specifically with respect to management of extensive-stage disease (subsequent therapy), NCCN 2021 guidelines recommend to do not offer prophylactic cranial irradiation in patients with poor performance status or impaired neurocognitive function. Recognize that increased cognitive decline after prophylactic cranial irradiation has been observed in older adults (≥ 60 years) in prospective trials; the risks and benefits of prophylactic cranial irradiation versus close brain surveillance, MRI (preferred) or CT with contrast, should be carefully discussed with these patients.

### Evidence for management of small cell lung cancer: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition) [^113G49Ui]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Purposes

This systematic review addressed the following key questions on managing small cell lung cancer (SCLC): the sequence, timing, and dosing characteristics of primary thoracic radiotherapy (TRTx) for limited-stage disease; primary TRTx for extensive-stage disease; effect of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI); positron emission tomography (PET) for staging; treatment of mixed histology tumors; surgery; and second-line and subsequent-line treatment for relapsed/progressive disease.

Methods

The review methods were defined prospectively in a written protocol. We primarily sought randomized controlled trials that compared the interventions of interest.

Results

Robust evidence was lacking for all questions except PCI, for which a patient-level metaanalysis showed that PCI improves survival of SCLC patients who achieved complete response after primary therapy from 15.3 to 20.7% (p = 0.01). The case for concurrent over sequential radiation delivery rests largely on a single multicenter trial. Support for early concurrent therapy comes from one multicenter trial, but two other multicenter trials found no advantage. Metaanalysis did not find significant reductions in 2-year and 3-year mortality rates for early TRTx. Favorable results from a single-center trial on TRTx for extensive stage disease need replication in a multicenter setting. Relevant comparative studies were nonexistent for management of mixed histology disease and surgery for early limited SCLC. PET may be more sensitive in detecting extracranial disease than conventional staging modalities, but studies were of poor quality.

Conclusions

PCI improves survival among those with a complete remission to primary therapy. A research agenda is needed to optimize the effectiveness of TRTx and its components.

### Treatment of small cell lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112X37sy]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

American College of Chest Physicians small cell lung cancer (SCLC) staging and treatment overview: The staging classification should include both the old Veterans Administration staging classification of limited stage (LS) and extensive stage (ES), as well as the new seventh edition American Joint Committee on Cancer/International Union Against Cancer staging by TNM, and the use of PET scanning is likely to improve the accuracy of staging. Surgery is indicated for carefully selected stage I SCLC. LS disease should be treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with good performance status, and thoracic radiotherapy should be administered early in the course of treatment, preferably beginning with cycle 1 or 2 of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy should consist of four cycles of a platinum agent and etoposide. ES disease should be treated primarily with chemotherapy consisting of a platinum agent plus etoposide or irinotecan, and prophylactic cranial irradiation improves survival in those individuals with both LS and ES disease who achieve a complete or partial response to initial therapy. To date, no molecularly targeted therapy agent has demonstrated proven efficacy against SCLC. Prognosis statements note LS-SCLC is treated with curative intent with 20% to 25% 5-year survival, while ES-SCLC is initially responsive to standard treatment, but almost always relapses, with virtually no patients surviving for 5 years.

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) — relapsed/refractory second-line therapy: In patients with relapsed or refractory SCLC, the administration of second-line, single-agent chemotherapy is recommended (Grade 1B). Reinitiation of the previously administered first-line chemotherapy regimen is recommended in patients who relapse ≥ 6 months from completion of initial chemotherapy, and enrollment in a clinical trial is encouraged. Several older, nonrandomized trials reported that retreatment with the initial chemotherapy regimen in sensitive relapse, particularly with longer initial response duration, resulted in response rates of 50% to 60%, and based on these findings, retreatment with the initial chemotherapy regimen has been recommended for patients relapsing ≥ 6 months from initial therapy.

### Lung cancer: diagnosis and management [^113myAfc]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States, with an average five-year survival rate of 15 percent. Smoking remains the predominant risk factor for lung cancer. Lung cancers are categorized as small cell carcinoma or non-small cell carcinoma (e.g., adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma). These categories are used for treatment decisions and determining prognosis. Signs and symptoms may vary depending on tumor type and extent of metastases. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected lung cancer includes tissue diagnosis; a complete staging work-up, including evaluation of metastases; and a functional patient evaluation. Histologic diagnosis may be obtained with sputum cytology, thoracentesis, accessible lymph node biopsy, bronchoscopy, transthoracic needle aspiration, video-assisted thoracoscopy, or thoracotomy. Initial evaluation for metastatic disease relies on patient history and physical examination, laboratory tests, chest computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and tissue confirmation of mediastinal involvement. Further evaluation for metastases depends on the clinical presentation. Treatment and prognosis are closely tied to the type and stage of the tumor identified. For stages I through IIIA non-small cell carcinoma, surgical resection is preferred. Advanced non-small cell carcinoma is treated with a multimodality approach that may include radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and palliative care. Chemotherapy (combined with radiotherapy for limited disease) is the mainstay of treatment for small cell carcinoma. No major organization recommends screening for early detection of lung cancer, although screening has interested researchers and physicians. Smoking cessation remains the critical component of preventive primary care.

Background

Current treatment guidelines for limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) recommend concomitant platinum-based chemo-radiotherapy plus prophylactic cranial irradiation, based on the premise that SCLC disseminates early, and is chemosensitive. However, although there is usually a favourable initial response, relapse is common and the cure rate for limited-stage SCLC remains relatively poor. Some recent clinical practice guidelines have recommended surgery for stage 1 (limited) SCLC followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, but this recommendation is largely based on the findings of observational studies.

Objectives

To determine whether, in patients with limited-stage SCLC, surgical resection of cancer improves overall survival and treatment-related deaths compared with radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, or best supportive care.

Search Methods

We performed searches on CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science up to 11 January 2017. We handsearched review articles, clinical trial registries, and reference lists of retrieved articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with adults diagnosed with limited-stage SCLC, confirmed by cytology or histology, and radiological assessment, considered medically suitable for resection and radical radiotherapy, which randomised participants to surgery versus any other intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

We imported studies identified by the search into a reference manager database. We retrieved the full-text version of relevant studies, and two review authors independently extracted data. The primary outcome measures were overall survival and treatment-related deaths; and secondary outcome measures included loco-regional progression, quality of life, and adverse events.

Main Results

We included three trials with 330 participants. We judged the quality of the evidence as very low for all the outcomes. The quality of the data was limited by the lack of complete outcome reporting, unclear risk of bias in the methods in which the studies were conducted, and the age of the studies (> 20 years). The methods of cancer staging and types of surgical procedures, which do not reflect current practice, reduced our confidence in the estimation of the effect. Two studies compared surgery to radiation therapy, and in one study chemotherapy was administered to both arms. One study administered initial chemotherapy, then responders were randomised to surgery versus control; following, both groups underwent chest and whole brain irradiation. Due to the clinical heterogeneity of the trials, we were unable to pool results for meta-analysis. All three studies reported overall survival. One study reported a mean overall survival of 199 days in the surgical arm, compared to 300 days in the radiotherapy arm (P = 0.04). One study reported overall survival as 4% in the surgical arm, compared to 10% in the radiotherapy arm at two years. Conversely, one study reported overall survival at two years as 52% in the surgical arm, compared to 18% in the radiotherapy arm. However this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.12). One study reported early postoperative mortality as 7% for the surgical arm, compared to 0% mortality in the radiotherapy arm. One study reported the difference in mean degree of dyspnoea as -1.2 comparing surgical intervention to radiotherapy, indicating that participants undergoing radiotherapy are likely to experience more dyspnoea. This was measured using a non-validated scale.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence from currently available RCTs does not support a role for surgical resection in the management of limited-stage small-cell lung cancer; however our conclusions are limited by the quality of the available evidence and the lack of contemporary data. The results of the trials included in this review may not be generalisable to patients with clinical stage 1 small-cell lung cancer carefully staged using contemporary staging methods. Although some guidelines currently recommend surgical resection in clinical stage 1 small-cell lung cancer, prospective randomised controlled trials are needed to determine if there is any benefit in terms of short- and long-term mortality and quality of life compared with chemo-radiotherapy alone.

The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) provide recommended management for patients with SCLC, including diagnosis, primary treatment, surveillance for relapse, and subsequent treatment. This selection for the journal focuses on metastatic (known as extensive-stage) SCLC, which is more common than limited-stage SCLC. Systemic therapy alone can palliate symptoms and prolong survival in most patients with extensive-stage disease. Smoking cessation counseling and intervention should be strongly promoted in patients with SCLC and other high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. The "Summary of the Guidelines Updates" section in the SCLC algorithm outlines the most recent revisions for the 2022 update, which are described in greater detail in this revised Discussion text.

Transformed SCLC from NSCLC with an oncogenic driver — referral, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy cautions: The Panel recognizes that transformed SCLC from NSCLC is a rare population of patients with limited data including treatment options and recommends considering referral to a center with expertise in managing transformed SCLC with an oncogenic driver. The Panel recommends systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy using the NCCN Guidelines for Small Cell Lung Cancer due to lack of data for transformed SCLC. The role of immunotherapy in transformed SCLC is unclear and should be avoided if tyrosine kinase inhibitors are being used, and in patients who develop SCLC as a resistance mechanism to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, ICIs should be avoided if tyrosine kinase inhibitors are continued due to known toxicity that is primarily driven by the long half-life of ICIs.

Small cell lung cancer remains one of the more frustrating malignancies for oncologists to treat. Although responses to initial platinum-based chemotherapy are high, most are not durable, and many patients are candidates for further palliative chemotherapy. Therapeutic options include reinduction or single-agent chemotherapy, depending on the duration of response to front-line treatment. Topotecan is the only approved agent for patients with relapsed disease. Several phase II studies have shown a modest benefit with other agents used today, although combination chemotherapy should be avoided because of increased toxicity. Palliative care should always be the focus, especially in patients with recurrent or chemorefractory small cell lung cancer and a poor performance status.

### Management of small cell lung cancer: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition) [^113fUf7o]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Purposes

This guideline is for the management of patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and is based on currently available information. As part of the guideline, an evidence-based review of the literature was commissioned that enables the reader to assess the evidence as we have attempted to put the clinical implications into perspective.

Methods

We conducted a comprehensive review of the available literature and the previous American College of Chest Physicians guidelines of SCLC. Controversial and less understood areas of the management of SCLC were then subject to an exhaustive review of the literature and detail analyses. Experts in evidence-based analyses compiled the accompanying systematic review titled "Evidence for Management of SCLC". The evidence was then assessed by a panel of experts to incorporate "clinical relevance". The resultant guidelines were then scored according to the grading system outlined by the American College of Chest Physicians grading system task force.

Results

SCLC accounts for 13 to 20% of all lung cancers. Highly smoking related and initially responsive to treatment, it leads to death rapidly in 2 to 4 months without treatment. SCLC is staged as limited-stage and extensive-stage disease. Limited-stage disease is treated with curative intent with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, with approximately 20% of patients achieving a cure. For all patients with limited-stage disease, median survival is 16 to 22 months. Extensive-stage disease is primarily treated with chemotherapy with a high initial response rate of 60 to 70% but with a median survival of 10 months. All patients achieving a complete remission should be offered prophylactic cranial irradiation. Relapsed or refractory SCLC has a uniformly poor prognosis.

Conclusion

In this section, evidence-based guidelines for the staging and treatment of SCLC are outlined. Limited-stage SCLC is treated with curative intent. Extensive-stage SCLC has high initial responses to chemotherapy but with an ultimately dismal prognosis with few survivors beyond 2 years.

### Small cell lung cancer in elderly patients: a review [^114sEzgD]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2008). Low credibility.

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for approximately 13% of all lung cancer cases. Approximately 40% of those cases are diagnosed in patients older than 70 years, and this proportion continues to rise in contrast to the continued decline in incidence of SCLC among the general population. The optimal strategy to manage limited-stage SCLC involves a combined modality approach with platinum-based chemotherapy and external-beam thoracic radiation therapy. For extensive-stage disease, platinum-based combination chemotherapy is a mainstay of therapy. Elderly patients present unique challenges in terms of drug metabolism and organ reserve, which impact the outcome of therapeutic interventions. However, limited data are available to guide management decisions for SCLC in elderly patients, and therefore this article discusses recommendations for treatment.

### Advancing therapeutics in small-cell lung cancer [^114CZAZY]. Nature Cancer (2025). High credibility.

Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 10–15% of lung cancers and is characterized by early metastasis, treatment resistance and rapid progression. Treatment advancements have been stagnant for decades, with chemotherapy as the mainstay and immune checkpoint inhibitors offering only modest survival extensions. However, new insights into tumor heterogeneity and recent practice-changing observations such as the identification of targetable cell surface proteins could effectively transform SCLC therapy. In this Review, we highlight key advances in SCLC biology, therapeutic innovation and biomarker development. Finally, we discuss the role of reverse translation in optimizing treatments, approaches to overcoming resistance and ensuring equitable access to care.

Treatment Option Overview Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for patients with small cell lung cancer.
- The following types of treatment are used:

- Surgery
- Chemotherapy
- Radiation therapy
- Immunotherapy
- Laser therapy
- Endoscopic stent placement
- New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
- Treatment for small cell lung cancer may cause side effects.
- Follow-up care may be needed. The following types of treatment are used: Surgery Surgery may be used if the cancer is found in one lung and in nearby lymph nodes only. Because this type of lung cancer is usually found in both lungs, surgery alone is not often used. During surgery, the doctor will also remove lymph nodes to find out if they have cancer in them. Sometimes, surgery may be used to remove a sample of lung tissue to find out the exact type of lung cancer. Treatment for small cell lung cancer may cause side effects.

For information about side effects caused by treatment for cancer, visit our Side Effects page. Treatment of Limited-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment of limited-stage small cell lung cancer may include:

- combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the chest
- immunotherapy after chemoradiation therapy
- combination chemotherapy alone, for patients who cannot receive radiation therapy
- surgery followed by chemotherapy
- surgery followed by chemoradiation therapy
- radiation therapy to the brain, for patients who have had a complete response to chemotherapy, to prevent the spread of cancer to the brain.

Treatment of Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer may include:

- immunotherapy and combination chemotherapy
- combination chemotherapy
- radiation therapy to the brain, spine, bone, or other parts of the body where the cancer has spread, as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life
- radiation therapy to the chest if the cancer responded to chemotherapy
- radiation therapy to the brain after a complete response to chemotherapy, to prevent the spread of cancer to the brain. Treatment of Recurrent Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment of recurrent small cell lung cancer may include:

- chemotherapy
- immunotherapy
- radiation therapy as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life
- laser therapy, stent placement to keep airways open, and/or internal radiation therapy as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.

### Multidisciplinary management of small cell lung cancer [^117LkQQN]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The standard treatment of limited-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is concurrent cisplatin and etoposide with thoracic radiation therapy, whereas treatment of extensive-stage disease is typically chemotherapy alone with a platinum compound plus etoposide. Surgical resection of early disease is generally reserved for patients with small, node-negative disease. Prophylactic cranial irradiation reduces the development of brain metastases and prolongs survival in patients with both limited-stage and extensive-stage disease who have responded to chemotherapy. Further understanding of the molecular underpinnings of SCLC is necessary to develop better treatment options and improve outcomes for patients.

Small cell lung cancer — number of chemotherapy cycles and role of maintenance/consolidation: The use of maintenance or consolidation chemotherapy beyond the recommended 4 to 6 cycles results in a minor increase in the duration of response without improving survival and carries a greater risk of cumulative toxicity, and this approach has not improved progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) in randomized trials. Therefore, the Panel recommends 4 cycles of systemic cytotoxic therapy for patients with limited-stage (with concurrent radiation) and extensive-stage (with concurrent immunotherapy) SCLC.

### Current status of second-line treatment and novel therapies for small cell lung cancer [^116cENiR]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Despite high response rates to first-line standard treatment, the great majority of patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) will relapse and succumb to their disease rather quickly. In the context of salvage therapy, symptom palliation and quality-of-life improvements, besides survival prolongation, are primary treatment endpoints. A variety of single-agent and multi-agent chemotherapy regimens have been tested with limited success in patients with recurrent SCLC. A number of combination regimens have demonstrated high response rates in second-line settings, but these can be considered only for patients with good performance status. Treatment outcome depends on many factors, including type of response to first-line therapy, treatment-free interval, and performance status. Currently, topotecan represents an effective, tolerable therapeutic option and is the only agent approved for this indication. The management of patients with recurrent disease remains an area of active research. This review provides an update of clinical research on second-line chemotherapy of SCLC and of recent results obtained with novel molecular targeted approaches in both first- and second-line therapy.

### Small cell lung cancer, version 2.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1154mMwi]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Small cell lung cancer — staging and initial management principles: The definitions for limited-stage and extensive-stage SCLC incorporate tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging, and the Panel recommends that the workup for SCLC should be expedited and if possible, studies should be performed in parallel. In limited-stage disease, the goal of treatment is cure using chemotherapy plus thoracic radiation therapy (RT); some patients with resectable tumors (stage I–IIA) are eligible for curative surgery followed by systemic therapy with or without mediastinal RT, and the Panel recommends multidisciplinary evaluation before any surgery. In other patients with stage I–IIA SCLC, including medically inoperable circumstances or when the decision not to pursue surgical resection is made, stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) followed by systemic therapy is an option. The benefits of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) are unclear in patients with stage I SCLC (T1–2a, N0, M0) who have received definitive therapy, and the NCCN Panel recommends that MRI brain surveillance be considered for all patients with limited-stage SCLC who do not receive PCI. In most extensive-stage cases, systemic therapy with or without RT can palliate symptoms and prolong survival, but long-term survival is rare; while SCLC is highly sensitive to initial chemotherapy and RT, most patients eventually die of recurrent disease, and participation in clinical trials is strongly encouraged.

Background

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a lethal disease for which there have been only small advances in diagnosis and treatment in the past decade. Our goal was to revise the evidence-based guidelines on staging and best available treatment options.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search covering 2004 to 2011 was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and five Cochrane databases using SCLC terms. This was cross-checked with the authors' own literature searches and knowledge of the literature. Results were limited to research in humans and articles written in English.

Results

The staging classification should include both the old Veterans Administration staging classification of limited stage (LS) and extensive stage (ES), as well as the new seventh edition American Joint Committee on Cancer/International Union Against Cancer staging by TNM. The use of PET scanning is likely to improve the accuracy of staging. Surgery is indicated for carefully selected stage I SCLC. LS disease should be treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with good performance status. Thoracic radiotherapy should be administered early in the course of treatment, preferably beginning with cycle 1 or 2 of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy should consist of four cycles of a platinum agent and etoposide. ES disease should be treated primarily with chemotherapy consisting of a platinum agent plus etoposide or irinotecan. Prophylactic cranial irradiation prolongs survival in those individuals with both LS and ES disease who achieve a complete or partial response to initial therapy. To date, no molecularly targeted therapy agent has demonstrated proven efficacy against SCLC.

Conclusion

Evidence-based guidelines are provided for the staging and treatment of SCLC. LS-SCLC is treated with curative intent with 20% to 25% 5-year survival. ES-SCLC is initially responsive to standard treatment, but almost always relapses, with virtually no patients surviving for 5 years. Targeted therapies have no proven efficacy against SCLC.
