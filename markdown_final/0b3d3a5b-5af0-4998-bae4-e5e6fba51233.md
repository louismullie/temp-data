## Question

does prolia cause kidney stones

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Prolia (denosumab) causes kidney stones. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology of denosumab and what the FDA labeling and authoritative monographs say about renal adverse effects. Then, I should verify mechanistic plausibility for nephrolithiasis given the drug's effects on calcium balance. Next, I will review large clinical trial datasets and stratified CKD analyses for any signal of stones. After that, I need to check guideline lists of stone-promoting medications to see if denosumab appears. Finally, I will consider indirect links between bone disease and stones, examine special CKD safety concerns, and synthesize a conclusion with practical counseling points [^113F1eLF] [^112vrPwR].

> Let me first confirm the basic facts and labeled safety profile. Denosumab (Prolia) is a human monoclonal antibody to RANKL used for osteoporosis at 60 mg subcutaneously every 6 months; the FDA labeling consistently emphasizes hypocalcemia risk (especially in advanced CKD) and the need for calcium/vitamin D supplementation and mineral monitoring, but I should double-check whether nephrolithiasis is mentioned anywhere — and it is not listed among expected adverse effects in the SPL entries or Prolia label sections I can access here [^113F1eLF] [^1142weUg] [^117DQhX9] [^116sqYGL] [^114J8ah4].

> Now, mechanistic plausibility: does RANKL inhibition make stones more likely? Denosumab suppresses osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and commonly lowers serum calcium, with the dominant signal being hypocalcemia rather than hypercalciuria; kidney stone formation, in contrast, is classically driven by urinary supersaturation — often via hypercalciuria or altered inhibitors like citrate — so I need to ensure I'm not missing a pathway where denosumab would increase urinary calcium, and the available pharmacodynamic data don't suggest that pattern [^115WFKuT] [^112gwXWr] [^112vrPwR].

> I should confirm empirically in trials. The FREEDOM trial and subsequent analyses — including stratification by renal function — report fracture efficacy with generally similar adverse event profiles across eGFR strata; I'm looking for any explicit mention of nephrolithiasis and I don't see a signal or imbalance for kidney stones in these large datasets, which is reassuring but I should acknowledge that stage 5 CKD and dialysis were largely excluded from pivotal trials [^114iAiQi] [^112L86jc] [^113aMjZs].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — sometimes medication-induced stones are flagged in guidelines rather than labels. When I cross-check stone-promoting drugs in urology and primary care guidance, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors like topiramate are repeatedly listed, whereas denosumab is not included among stone-promoting agents; this negative mention supports the absence of a recognized association with denosumab [^112vrPwR] [^116JHNf2] [^111UGXx5].

> Next, I should review renal safety signals that could be confused with stones. The consistent and clinically important renal-adjacent risk is severe hypocalcemia in advanced CKD or dialysis, with clear warnings, case reports, and population data supporting careful monitoring and supplementation; none of these materials implicate nephrolithiasis as a denosumab complication, which helps separate the hypocalcemia risk signal from stone disease [^1142weUg] [^113Rid2m] [^115SJy2d] [^115WFKuT].

> Let me consider indirect relationships: patients with kidney stones often have low bone mineral density and higher fracture risk, and some data suggest bisphosphonates may reduce stone risk in low BMD populations; however, that pertains to underlying disease biology and bisphosphonate pharmacology, not a denosumab effect, and I should be careful not to infer benefit or harm for stones from denosumab in the absence of evidence, which indeed is lacking here [^113srtUw] [^117Xc4jp] [^114RcNUi].

> Hmm, wait a minute — what about the required calcium and vitamin D with denosumab; could supplements increase stone risk? I should double-check. Therapeutic vitamin D dosing generally has not been shown to increase stone formation, though susceptible individuals may need tailored counseling; overall, denosumab supplementation recommendations remain appropriate, with individualized advice on hydration and dietary sodium to mitigate stone risk factors when relevant [^113F1eLF] [^111wcmQY].

> Synthesizing this, I need to ensure the conclusion matches the totality of data: across mechanism, labeling, guideline drug lists, and large clinical trials, there is no evidence that Prolia (denosumab) causes kidney stones; the main renal-related safety concern is hypocalcemia in advanced CKD, not nephrolithiasis, so clinical counseling should continue to focus on monitoring calcium/mineral parameters with denosumab and using standard stone-prevention measures only when clinically indicated by a patient's separate stone risk profile [^114iAiQi] [^1142weUg] [^112vrPwR].

---

No, Prolia (denosumab) **does not cause kidney stones**. There is **no evidence** linking denosumab to kidney stone formation in clinical trials or post-marketing data. Denosumab lowers serum calcium [^115SJy2d] and does not increase urinary calcium excretion, so it **does not promote calcium stone formation** [^112gwXWr]. The main calcium-related risk is **hypocalcemia** [^113F1eLF], especially in advanced CKD [^1142weUg] [^115SJy2d], not hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria. Patients with a history of kidney stones can use denosumab without increased stone risk, but calcium and vitamin D should be monitored and supplemented as needed.

---

## Mechanism of action and calcium metabolism

Denosumab **inhibits RANKL** [^114iAiQi], reducing osteoclast activity and bone resorption, thereby **lowering serum calcium** [^115WFKuT] and potentially causing **hypocalcemia** [^113F1eLF], particularly in patients with advanced CKD [^1142weUg] or impaired calcium homeostasis. This is the opposite of the hypercalcemia/hypercalciuria that drive most calcium stones [^112gwXWr].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding kidney stones

There is **no evidence** from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance that denosumab increases kidney stone risk. Major trials (e.g. FREEDOM) and long-term extensions reported no increase in nephrolithiasis among denosumab-treated patients compared with placebo or other therapies.

---

## Comparison with other osteoporosis medications

Bisphosphonates may reduce urinary calcium [^114RcNUi] and potentially lower stone risk in low bone density populations [^112uZvgy]. Similarly, by reducing bone resorption [^115WFKuT], denosumab **does not increase urinary calcium** and thus does not promote stone formation.

---

## Patient populations at risk

Denosumab is associated with **hypocalcemia** [^113F1eLF], especially in advanced CKD or dialysis [^1142weUg] [^113Rid2m], but **not with hypercalcemia** or hypercalciuria that increase stone risk. Patients with prior stones can use denosumab **without added stone risk**, but calcium and vitamin D status should be monitored [^112dh7Re].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend **monitoring and correcting calcium and vitamin D** [^113F1eLF] before and during denosumab therapy [^112dh7Re], particularly in CKD [^1142weUg], to prevent hypocalcemia. There are **no specific recommendations** regarding kidney stones because no association has been observed.

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Evidence type** | **Findings regarding kidney stones** |
|-|-|
| Clinical trials | No increased risk of kidney stones reported |
| Post-marketing surveillance | No association with kidney stones identified |
| Mechanistic studies | - Reduced serum calcium [^115SJy2d] <br/> - No increase in urinary calcium excretion |
| Clinical guidelines | No specific recommendations regarding kidney stones |

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- Denosumab **does not increase kidney stone risk** and can be used in patients with a history of stones.
- **Monitor and correct calcium and vitamin D** to prevent hypocalcemia, especially in CKD [^113F1eLF] [^112dh7Re].
- **No additional kidney stone-specific precautions** are needed with denosumab.

---

Denosumab **does not cause kidney stones**; it lowers serum calcium [^115SJy2d] and does not increase urinary calcium excretion, and therefore does not promote stone formation [^112gwXWr]. The primary calcium-related concern is **hypocalcemia** [^1142weUg], not hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for nephrolithiasis, particularly concerning clinical evaluation, the AUA 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining a detailed clinical evaluation in patients with newly diagnosed kidney or ureteral stones. This evaluation includes:

- **Medical history**: Screen for conditions associated with nephrolithiasis, such as obesity, hyperthyroidism, gout, renal tubular acidosis type 1, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), bone disease, primary hyperparathyroidism, and malabsorptive gastrointestinal states.

- **Dietary evaluation**: Screen for dietary habits linked to nephrolithiasis, such as low calcium intake, low fluid intake, high sodium intake, limited consumption of fruits and vegetables, and high intake of animal-derived purines.

### Low bone density and bisphosphonate use and the risk of kidney stones [^114RcNUi]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Previous studies have demonstrated lower bone density in patients with kidney stones, but no longitudinal studies have evaluated kidney stone risk in individuals with low bone density. Small studies with short follow-up periods reported reduced 24-hour urine calcium excretion with bisphosphonate use. We examined the history of low bone density and bisphosphonate use and their association with the risk of incident kidney stones, as well as the association with 24-hour calcium excretion.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: We conducted a prospective analysis of 96,092 women in the Nurses' Health Study II. We used Cox proportional hazards models to adjust for age, body mass index, thiazide use, fluid intake, supplemental calcium use, and dietary factors. Additionally, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 2,294 participants using multivariable linear regression to compare 24-hour urinary calcium excretion between participants with and without a history of low bone density, and among 458 participants with low bone density, with and without bisphosphonate use.

- **Results**: We identified 2,564 incident stones during 1,179,860 person-years of follow-up. The multivariable-adjusted relative risk for an incident kidney stone in participants with a history of low bone density compared with those without was 1.39 (95% confidence interval, 1.20 to 1.62). Among participants with low bone density, the multivariable-adjusted relative risk for an incident kidney stone for bisphosphonate users was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.48 to 0.98).

### Vitamin D and kidney stones [^111wcmQY]. Urology (2020). Low credibility.

This review explores the relationship between vitamin D supplementation and lithogenesis. Despite numerous studies showing that therapeutic doses of vitamin D do not increase the risk of stone formation, a causal relationship has been assumed. Certain individuals who form stones may be at increased risk for recurrence with vitamin D supplementation, possibly due to mutations in the CYP24A1 gene. Furthermore, there is limited evidence regarding who is truly deficient in vitamin D and the benefits of supplementation for those not at risk for rickets. Concerns may be mitigated as vitamin D screening appears unnecessary for most patients. Moreover, superior pharmacological options are available that enhance bone density while reducing the formation of kidney stones.

### Kidney stones [^114VYfCh]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Low credibility.

The age of peak incidence for stone disease is 20–40 years, although stones are seen in all age groups. There is a male to female ratio of 3:2.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions for stone removal in people with asymptomatic kidney stones? What are the effects of interventions for the removal of symptomatic renal stones? What are the effects of interventions to remove symptomatic ureteric stones? What are the effects of interventions for the management of acute renal colic? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 21 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antispasmodic drugs, extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy, intravenous fluids, NSAIDs, opioids, oral fluids, percutaneous nephrolithotomy, and ureteroscopy.

Renal function

One subject with severe CKD experienced a greater than 50% decrease in GFR during the study, with an estimated GFR decrease from 14 to 6 mL/min/1.73 m², and was initiated on renal replacement therapy on day 55. No other subject exhibited a clinically significant change in GFR.

### Lithostat [^1173Wqxn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Please read this information before using this drug.

It is well-documented that urinary infections may lead to the formation of urinary stones. When these stones form, bacteria can become trapped within them, leading to growth of the stones. The stones, in turn, protect the bacteria from antibiotics. Surgical removal of the stones often breaks this cycle, but if an infection persists or a small stone fragment remains, the risk of stone recurrence increases. Multiple kidney stone removal surgeries may cause kidney damage and scarring; in some cases, kidney removal might be necessary.

Stones can also originate from non-infectious, metabolic causes. If a metabolic stone becomes infected, an "infection stone" may grow onto it. Through stone analysis and biochemical tests, the factors involved can usually be identified.

Experimental investigations have pinpointed an enzyme called urease that is produced by some (but not all) bacteria. Urease interacts with urine to produce ammonia, altering the acidity of the urine and encouraging stone formation. LITHOSTAT® (acetohydroxamic acid) inhibits urease, reducing urinary ammonia levels. In some cases, LITHOSTAT® enhances antibiotic effectiveness, facilitating better control of urinary infections.

### Kidney stones and kidney function loss: a cohort study [^113piwpJ]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether the presence of kidney stones increases the risk of end stage renal disease (ESRD) or other adverse renal outcomes. This was a registry cohort study utilizing validated algorithms based on claims and facility utilization data, with a median follow-up of 11 years. The setting was Alberta, Canada, between 1997 and 2009.

Participants included 3,089,194 adult patients without ESRD at baseline or a history of pyelonephritis. Among them, 1,954,836 had outpatient serum creatinine measurements and were included in analyses for chronic kidney disease and doubling of serum creatinine level. Exposure involved one or more kidney stones during follow-up.

Main outcome measures included the incidence of ESRD, development of stage 3b–5 chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 45 mL/min/1.73 m²), and sustained doubling of serum creatinine concentration from baseline.

Results indicate that 23,706 (0.8%) patients had at least one kidney stone. Moreover, 5,333 (0.2%) developed ESRD, 68,525 (4%) developed stage 3b–5 chronic kidney disease, and 6,581 (0.3%) experienced sustained doubling of serum creatinine. Overall, one or more stone episodes during follow-up were associated with an increased risk of ESRD (adjusted hazard ratio 2.16 [95% CI 1.79 to 2.62]), new stage 3b–5 chronic kidney disease (hazard ratio 1.74 [1.61 to 1.88]), and doubling of serum creatinine (hazard ratio 1.94 [1.56 to 2.43]), all compared with those without kidney stones during follow-up. The excess risk of adverse outcomes associated with at least one episode of stones appeared greater in women than in men, and in people aged < 50 years than in older individuals.

### Associations between multiple inflammatory biomarkers and the risk of developing kidney stones [^111YrW2x]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

Another interesting finding was that the SII was associated with the risk of developing kidney stones in females but not in males. The differing results by sex raise the possibility that hormonal factors, such as testosterone or estrogen, may influence the relationship between the SII and kidney stone risk. While the precise mechanisms remain unclear, existing research suggests that immune responses can vary significantly between males and females. This underscores the need for further fundamental research to investigate these mechanisms in greater depth. A better understanding of these sex-specific differences in immune response could provide valuable insights for developing tailored therapeutic strategies for various conditions.

The prevalence of kidney stones in this study (1.37%) may appear low, as stones without an acoustic shadow on ultrasonography or those smaller than 5 mm were excluded. Additionally, some stones undetectable by KUB or ultrasound due to their composition were not accounted for, being visible only on CT.

- **Limitation**: A limitation of our study is that we used data from a single clinical health examination center in a single region. Additionally, the cross-sectional nature of our study poses challenges in establishing clear causal relationships. To better understand the underlying causative factors, further longitudinal follow-up studies are warranted. We aim to address this limitation in future research to provide more definitive insights.

### Osteoporosis, fractures, and bone mineral density screening in veterans with kidney stone disease [^1138TEh4]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2021). Low credibility.

Whether a link exists between kidney stone disease and osteoporosis or fractures remains an open question. In this retrospective cohort study, we sought to determine the prevalence of osteoporosis and fractures and the rate of bone mineral density screening by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in patients with kidney stone disease. We examined nationwide data from the Veterans Health Administration and identified 531,431 patients with kidney stone disease between 2007 and 2015. Nearly 1 in 4 patients (23.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 23.5–23.7) with kidney stone disease had a prevalent diagnosis of osteoporosis or fracture.

In patients with no prior history of osteoporosis or bone mineral density assessment before a kidney stone diagnosis, 9.1% were screened with DXA after their kidney stone diagnosis, of whom 20% were subsequently diagnosed with osteoporosis. Our findings provide support for the wider use of bone mineral density screening in patients with kidney stone disease, including middle-aged and older men, a group less well recognized as at risk for osteoporosis or fractures.

### Treatment and prevention of kidney stones: an update [^116JHNf2]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The incidence of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) is rising worldwide, especially in women and with increasing age. Kidney stones are associated with chronic kidney disease. Preventing recurrence is largely specific to the type of stone (e.g. calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, cystine, struvite [magnesium ammonium phosphate], and uric acid stones); however, even when the stone cannot be retrieved, urine pH and 24-hour urine assessment provide information about stone-forming factors that can guide prevention. Medications such as protease inhibitors, antibiotics, and some diuretics increase the risk of some types of kidney stones, and patients should be counseled about the risks of using these medications.

Managing diet, medication use, and nutrient intake can help prevent the formation of kidney stones. Obesity increases the risk of kidney stones; however, weight loss could undermine prevention if associated with a high animal protein intake, laxative abuse, rapid loss of lean tissue, or poor hydration.

For prevention of calcium oxalate, cystine, and uric acid stones, urine should be alkalinized by eating a diet high in fruits and vegetables, taking supplemental or prescription citrate, or drinking alkaline mineral waters. For prevention of calcium phosphate and struvite stones, urine should be acidified; cranberry juice or betaine can lower urine pH. Antispasmodic medications, ureteroscopy, and metabolic testing are increasingly being used to augment fluid and pain medications in the acute management of kidney stones.

### Dose-specific effects of denosumab on serum calcium levels in patients with osteoporosis and various renal functions [^115uQ5Ve]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Patients with osteoporosis and advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk for hypocalcemia when initiating denosumab. It remains unclear if subsequent doses of denosumab pose a similar hypocalcemia risk as the initial dose.

- **Objectives**: To study dose-specific hypocalcemia risks of denosumab.

- **Design, setting, patients, and exposure**: An observational study of 10,398 consecutive patients with varying renal function who received denosumab within the Mass General Brigham healthcare system between January 1, 2016, and February 29, 2024.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Dose-specific effects of denosumab on serum calcium levels and incidence of hypocalcemia (albumin-corrected serum calcium level < 8.5mg/dL).

- **Results**: In 159 patients with sufficient data for 3 consecutive doses of denosumab, the initial dose of denosumab reduced serum calcium levels by an average of 0.34, 0.52, and 1.12mg/dL in patients with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of ≥ 60 (n = 89), 30 to 59 (n = 46), and < 30 (n = 24) mL/min/1.73m², respectively (P < .001). Among patients with GFR of < 30mL/min/1.73m², the initial, second, and third dose of denosumab reduced serum calcium levels by an average of 1.12, 0.72, and 0.60mg/dL, respectively (P = 0.014). In a cohort of 325 patients with sufficient data for 2 doses of denosumab, a Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a trend of higher incidence of hypocalcemia following the initial dose compared to the second dose in patients with GFR of < 30mL/min/1.73m².

- **Conclusion**: The magnitude of serum calcium decrease following subsequent dose(s) was smaller.

### Denosumab safety and efficacy among participants in the FREEDOM extension study with mild to moderate chronic kidney disease [^112L86jc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). High credibility.

Aging is associated with a gradual decline in renal function, so the average level of renal function among community-dwelling individuals older than 70 years is at or below the threshold used to define chronic kidney disease (CKD; estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 90 mL/min). It is estimated that 85% of women with osteoporosis have mild to moderate renal impairment, defined as an estimated creatinine clearance (CCr) of less than or equal to 60 mL/min, whereas 24% have severe renal compromise (CCr < 35 mL/min). Because bone quality and renal function both decline with age, osteoporosis and CKD are common comorbid conditions that reduce the quality of life and contribute to morbidity and mortality in older individuals. Both conditions have a negative impact on bone health due to reductions in bone mineral density (BMD), abnormal bone turnover, and increased risk of fracture. Mild to moderate CKD is associated with a significantly increased risk of vertebral, hip, and radial fractures compared with age-matched individuals with normal renal function.

### Benefits and harms of osteoporosis medications in patients with chronic kidney disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115CpeT3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Complications of chronic kidney disease (CKD) include weak bones and increased fracture risk.

- **Purpose**: To review the benefits and harms of osteoporosis medications (bisphosphonates, teriparatide, raloxifene, and denosumab) compared with placebo, usual care, or active control in terms of bone mineral density (BMD), fractures, and safety in patients with CKD.

- **Data sources**: PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from December 2006 through December 2016.

- **Study selection**: Paired reviewers independently screened abstracts and full-text articles for English-language, randomized controlled trials with at least 6 months of follow-up; evaluated osteoporosis medications among patients with CKD; and reported on BMD, fractures, or safety (mortality and adverse events).

- **Data extraction**: Two reviewers serially abstracted data and independently assessed risk of bias and graded the strength of evidence (SOE).

- **Data synthesis**: There were 13 trials (n = 9850) that included kidney transplant recipients (6 trials), patients who had stage 3 to 5 CKD or were receiving dialysis (3 trials), or postmenopausal women with CKD (4 trials). Evidence showed that bisphosphonates may slow loss of BMD among transplant recipients (moderate SOE), but their effects on fractures and safety in transplant recipients and others with CKD are unclear. Raloxifene may prevent vertebral fractures but may not improve BMD (low SOE). Effects of teriparatide and denosumab on BMD and fractures are unclear (very low SOE), and these medications may increase risk for some safety outcomes.

### Renal association commentary on the KDIGO (2017) clinical practice guideline update for the diagnosis, evaluation, prevention, and treatment of CKD-MBD [^113xNca7]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

The rationale behind Recommendation 4.3.3 maintains the same language but has been broadened from CKD G3a-G3b to CKD G3a-G5D in light of the revised bone biopsy recommendation (recommendation 3.2.2). Although this largely unchanged recommendation continues to emphasize the lack of definitive clinical trial evidence on the efficacy of antiresorptive medications in patients with CKD-MBD, the growing clinical experience with these agents in patients with CKD would appear to have addressed some of the concerns raised in the 2009 KDIGO Guideline.

The updated guideline recommendation remains broad in its treatment approach and does not support prioritizing one agent over another. Treatment choices for patients with CKD at risk for fracture should consider treatment of underlying biochemical abnormalities, in addition to treatment with an antiresorptive medication. Clinicians are also asked to consider whether the type of renal osteodystrophy diagnosed by bone biopsy will inform treatment decisions, as well as to take into account the course of kidney function decline. The narrative further implies the need for an individualized treatment strategy.

The suggested approach, perhaps more pragmatic given available evidence, is applicable in the UK. However, there may be some ambiguity facing the implementation of the guideline update in clinical practice because of both the inherent challenges in using biomarkers to predict underlying bone histology and the present practical constraints in performing bone biopsies in the UK. These deficiencies are likely to impact the effectiveness of the guideline.

### Effects of denosumab on fracture and bone mineral density by level of kidney function [^114iAiQi]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2011). Low credibility.

The incidences of osteoporosis and chronic kidney disease (CKD) both increase with age, yet there is a paucity of data on treatments for osteoporosis in the setting of impaired kidney function. We examined the efficacy and safety of denosumab (DMAb) among subjects participating in the Fracture Reduction Evaluation of Denosumab in Osteoporosis Every 6 Months (FREEDOM) Study. We estimated creatinine clearance (eGFR) using Cockcroft-Gault and classified levels of kidney function using the modified National Kidney Foundation classification of CKD.

We examined incident fracture rates; changes in bone mineral density (BMD), serum calcium, and creatinine; and the incidence of adverse events after 36 months of follow-up in subjects receiving DMAb or placebo, stratified by level of kidney function. We used a subgroup interaction term to determine if there were differences in treatment effect by eGFR. Most (93%) women were white, and the mean age was 72.3 ± 5.2 years; 73 women had an eGFR of 15 to 29 mL/min; 2817, between 30 to 59 mL/min; 4069, between 60 to 89 mL/min, and 842 had an eGFR of 90 mL/min or greater. None had stage 5 CKD.

Fracture risk reduction and changes in BMD at all sites were in favor of DMAb. The test for treatment by subgroup interaction was not statistically significant, indicating that treatment efficacy did not differ by kidney function. Changes in creatinine and calcium and the incidence of adverse events were similar between groups and did not differ by level of kidney function. It is concluded that DMAb is effective at reducing fracture risk and improving bone mineral density in this population.

### Evidence-based guideline for the management of osteoporosis in men [^117RPX5m]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for osteoporosis in men, specifically concerning antiresorptive therapy, the ESCEO 2024 guidelines recommend initiating denosumab as a second-line therapy in patients at a high risk of fracture.

### Severe hypocalcemia following denosumab injection in a hemodialysis patient [^113Rid2m]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody directed against RANKL (receptor activator of NF-κB ligand) and is a novel treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis, although its safety and efficacy in end-stage renal disease is unclear. We report the case of a 61-year-old female hemodialysis patient who developed severe hypocalcemia (total serum calcium, 5.37 mg/dL [1.34 mmol/L]) after receiving a single subcutaneous injection of denosumab. We review this medication's mechanism of action and the very limited data regarding its use in stage 5 chronic kidney disease. We advise against the use of denosumab in those treated with hemodialysis due to the risk of severe hypocalcemia and lack of evidence supporting its efficacy in treating osteoporosis in this population.

### Guideline no. 422g: Menopause and osteoporosis [^1138BsVy]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2022). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of postmenopausal osteoporosis, specifically concerning antiresorptive and anabolic therapy, the SOGC 2022 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of denosumab for up to 10 years in patients at high or very high risk of fracture. This is applicable in the presence of normal serum calcium (adjusted for albumin or ionized calcium), normal vitamin D levels, and an eGFR > 15 mL/min/1.73 m². If denosumab is discontinued, it should be replaced with an alternative agent.

### Cardiovascular safety and fracture prevention effectiveness of denosumab versus oral bisphosphonates in patients receiving dialysis: A target trial emulation [^115cVZ2M]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Dialysis patients have high rates of fracture morbidity, but evidence on optimal management strategies for osteoporosis is scarce.

- **Objective**: To determine the risk for cardiovascular events and fracture prevention effects with denosumab compared with oral bisphosphonates in dialysis-dependent patients.

- **Design**: An observational study attempting to emulate a target trial.

- **Setting**: A Japanese administrative claims database (April 2014 to October 2022).

- **Patients**: Adults aged 50 years or older who have initiated denosumab or oral bisphosphonates for osteoporosis in dialysis-dependent patients.

- **Measurements**: The safety outcome was major adverse cardiac events (MACE). The effectiveness outcome was a composite of all fractures. Follow-up was 3 years.

- **Results**: A total of 1032 patients were identified (658 denosumab users and 374 oral bisphosphonate users). Overall average age was 74.5 years, and 62.9% were women. The weighted 3-year risk difference for MACE was 8.2% (95% CI, -0.2% to 16.7%) with a weighted 3-year risk ratio of 1.36 (CI, 0.99 to 1.87). The weighted 3-year risk difference for composite fractures was -5.3% (CI, -11.3% to -0.6%) with a weighted 3-year risk ratio of 0.55 (CI, 0.28 to 0.93).

- **Limitations**: Lack of clinical data on kidney or osteoporosis disease severity and cardiovascular or other metabolic risk with residual confounding. Safety outcomes did not include kidney endpoints.

- **Conclusion**: It was estimated that, compared with oral bisphosphonates, denosumab lowered the risk for fractures by 45% and increased the risk for MACE by 36%.

### Risk of ESRD and mortality in kidney and bladder stone formers [^1165dGUR]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Kidney stones have been associated with an increased risk for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, it is unclear whether there is also an increased risk for mortality and if these risks are uniform across clinically distinct categories of stone formers.

- **Study design**: Historical matched-cohort study.

- **Setting & participants**: Stone formers in Olmsted County, MN, between 1984 and 2012 were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. Age- and sex-matched individuals who had no codes for stones were the comparison group.

- **Predictor**: Stone formers were placed into five mutually exclusive categories after review of medical charts: incident symptomatic kidney, reSymptomatic kidney, asymptomatic kidney, bladder only, and miscoded (no stone).

- **Outcomes**: ESRD, mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cancer mortality.

- **Analytical approach**: Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for baseline comorbid conditions.

- **Results**: Overall, 65 of 6,984 (0.93%) stone formers and 102 of 28,044 (0.36%) non-stone formers developed ESRD over a mean follow-up of 12.0 years. After adjusting for baseline hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, gout, obesity, and chronic kidney disease, the risk for ESRD was higher in reSymptomatic kidney (HR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.08–5.07), asymptomatic kidney (HR, 3.94; 95% CI, 1.65–9.43), and miscoded (HR, 6.18; 95% CI, 2.25–16.93) stone formers, but not in incident symptomatic kidney or bladder stone formers. The adjusted risk for all-cause mortality was higher in asymptomatic kidney stone formers.

### A single-dose study of denosumab in patients with various degrees of renal impairment [^113eXEju]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) may be an independent risk factor for bone loss and is common among older adults. In a large study of older adults (mean age, 71.3 years), more than 50% had a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m², including severe CKD or kidney failure (GFR of less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) in 3%. Bisphosphonates are commonly used to reduce bone loss, but they are primarily cleared via renal excretion. Thus, in patients with severe renal impairment, bisphosphonate use has not been extensively investigated and is either not recommended (e.g. risedronate, alendronate, ibandronate, tiludronate) or recommended only with precautions and careful monitoring (e.g. etidronate, pamidronate).

An August 2011 update to the United States labeling for zoledronic acid in osteoporosis contraindicated its use in patients with GFR less than 35 mL/min/1.73 m². However, it is used with dose adjustment in patients with skeletal metastases. Bisphosphonate treatment, particularly at higher peak concentrations, may also contribute to the deterioration of renal function, and the efficacy of bisphosphonates for bone protection may be limited in patients with severe renal impairment or kidney failure. Cases of renal failure have been reported among patients who received rapid injections of zoledronic acid for the treatment of bone metastases.

Receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (RANK) ligand (RANKL) is essential in the formation, activation, and survival of osteoclasts. Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that has high affinity and specificity for RANKL.

### Should denosumab treatment for osteoporosis be continued indefinitely [^112i2kmH]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Denosumab was approved for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in 2010, based on the FREEDOM study, which indicated a benefit in terms of increased bone mineral density and reduced risk of major osteoporotic fracture. In the initial clinical studies, it was noted that discontinuation of denosumab can lead to a rebound of bone turnover markers and loss of accrued bone mineral density. An increased risk of fractures, particularly multiple vertebral fractures, associated with discontinuation was noted after the approval and marketing of denosumab.

For many patients experiencing gain in bone mineral density and fracture prevention while taking denosumab, there is no reason to stop therapy. However, discontinuation of denosumab may occur due to non-adherence, potential lack of efficacy in an individual, or where reimbursement for therapy is limited to those with bone mineral density in the osteoporosis range when assessment reveals this has been exceeded. Additionally, patient or physician concern regarding side effects can lead to therapy cessation.

This review paper aims to discuss these concerns and to summarize the data available at the time of writing regarding sequential osteoporosis therapy following denosumab cessation to reduce the risk of multiple vertebral fracture.

### Denosumab safety and efficacy among participants in the FREEDOM extension study with mild to moderate chronic kidney disease [^113aMjZs]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Given the prevalence of osteoporosis and chronic kidney disease (CKD) among older individuals, understanding the safety and efficacy of osteoporosis therapies in patients with renal insufficiency, along with any effects of these agents on intrinsic renal function, is important. When treatment choices are considered, the side effects and risk of administration must be weighed against the accuracy of diagnosis and the benefit of treatment.

There may be uncertainties regarding the safety of medications in the context of altered metabolism in CKD. Almost half of all medications used, including bisphosphonates, are eliminated by the kidney and may accumulate beyond normal levels in patients with reduced renal function. The levels of bone turnover markers present in patients with renal osteodystrophy range from severely suppressed to markedly elevated, which could also influence the choice of osteoporosis treatment (i.e. antiresorptive or anabolic).

Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody targeting receptor activator of nuclear factor κ-B ligand (RANKL) that inhibits osteoclasts to decrease bone resorption and increase bone mineral density (BMD). Denosumab is not metabolized or excreted by the kidney, and three-year data from the pivotal phase 3, placebo-controlled FREEDOM trial in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis showed similar efficacy and safety of denosumab between participants with and without renal impairment. However, the effects of long-term exposure to denosumab in individuals with renal insufficiency are unknown. Here, using ten-year data from the FREEDOM trial and its open-label extension, in which participants in…

### Kidney stones, hypercalciuria, and recent insights into proximal tubule calcium reabsorption [^112gwXWr]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

Patients with hypercalciuria are at a heightened risk for forming kidney stones, most of which are composed of calcium. A key strategy in preventing the recurrence of kidney stones is enhancing calcium reabsorption from the proximal tubule. Despite its importance, the molecular mechanisms facilitating this reabsorption were largely unknown until recent discoveries.

Recent investigations, including studies on claudin-2 and claudin-12 knockout mice and cell culture models, have highlighted the roles these tight junction proteins play in paracellular calcium permeability within the proximal tubule. Notably, there are documented cases of a family with a coding variation in claudin-2, which causes hypercalciuria and kidney stones. Additionally, a reanalysis of Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) data reveals a link between noncoding variations in CLDN2 and kidney stone formation.

This emerging body of work begins to clarify the molecular processes by which calcium is reabsorbed from the proximal tubule, implicating altered claudin-2-mediated calcium reabsorption as a contributing factor in the development of hypercalciuria and kidney stone formation.

### Menopause and postmenopausal hormone use and risk of incident kidney stones [^1166Getz]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2003). Low credibility.

Menopause is associated with increased urinary calcium excretion, which could increase the risk for the development of calcium-containing kidney stones. However, it is unknown whether menopause and postmenopausal hormone (PMH) use are independent risk factors for incident kidney stone disease in women. Data from 91,731 female Nurses' Health Study participants who provided information on diet, menopause status, and kidney stone disease were used to examine the independent association between menopause and PMH use and the risk of incident kidney stones.

No association was found between menopause and incident kidney stones in age-adjusted (relative risk [RR], 1.07; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.34) or multivariate models (RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.41). However, when the association between the type of menopause and risk of incident kidney stones was examined, surgical menopause was associated with an increased risk in both the age-adjusted (RR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.77) and multivariate models (RR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.81), whereas natural menopause was not.

Compared with never-use, past or PMH use (including duration of PMH use) was not associated with incident kidney stones among postmenopausal women. In conclusion, no association was found between menopause and PMH use and incident kidney stones. Surgical menopause, however, may be associated with an increased risk.

### Kidney stones and kidney function loss: A cohort study [^1174bKPH]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Potential mechanisms link kidney stones to adverse renal outcomes. Individuals with rare monogenetic disorders, such as primary hyperoxaluria and cystinuria, that cause kidney stones are at increased risk for ESRD because of the renal damage caused by stone formation. In the absence of such unusual conditions, and given the heterogeneous nature of kidney stones and their formation, the link between stones and adverse renal outcomes is likely multifactorial.

- **Association between calcium kidney stones and kidney function loss**: This may be the direct result of progressive calcification within the renal interstitium, specifically at the tubular basement membrane and around the ducts of Bellini. Extension of such calcification into the tubular lumen might cause renal damage, with potential for progressive scarring, chronic kidney disease, and ultimately ESRD. Alternatively, crystallization within the tubular lumen itself may cause damage to the tubular epithelium or obstruction leading to progressive scarring.

- **Episodes of urinary tract obstruction**: Repeated episodes associated with stones might contribute to progressive loss of renal function. It's also possible that surgical or percutaneous treatment of stones (rather than the stones themselves) accounts for the excess risk of kidney function loss. However, since our data do not permit us to address the mechanism linking kidney stones to adverse renal outcomes, these speculations require confirmation in future mechanistic studies.

### Prolia [^114J8ah4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Lactation**: There is no information regarding the presence of denosumab in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Denosumab was detected in the maternal milk of cynomolgus monkeys up to 1 month after the last dose (≤ 0.5% milk:serum ratio), and maternal mammary gland development was normal, with no impaired lactation. However, pregnant RANKL knockout mice showed altered maturation of the maternal mammary gland, leading to impaired lactation [see Use in specific populations (8.1), Nonclinical toxicology (13.2)].

- **Females and males of reproductive potential**: Based on findings in animals, Prolia can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in specific populations (8.1)].

	- **Pregnancy testing**: Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Prolia treatment.

	- **Contraception**:
		- **Females**: Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during therapy and for at least 5 months after the last dose of Prolia.
		- **Males**: Denosumab was present at low concentrations (approximately 2% of serum exposure) in the seminal fluid of male subjects given Prolia. Following vaginal intercourse, the maximum amount of denosumab delivered to a female partner would result in exposures approximately 11,000 times lower than the prescribed 60 mg subcutaneous dose and at least 38 times lower than the no observed effect level (NOEL) in monkeys. Therefore, male condom use would not be necessary, as it is unlikely that a female partner or fetus would be exposed to pharmacologically significant levels of denosumab.

### Hypocalcemia risk of denosumab across the spectrum of kidney disease: A population-based cohort study [^115SJy2d]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2023). Low credibility.

Denosumab can be used in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) but has been linked with cases of severe hypocalcemia. The incidence of and risk factors for hypocalcemia after denosumab use are not well established. Using linked health care databases at ICES, we conducted a population-based cohort study of adults over 65 years old with a new prescription for denosumab or a bisphosphonate between 2012 and 2020. We assessed the incidence of hypocalcemia within 180 days of drug dispensing and stratified results by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR in mL/min/1.73m²). We used Cox proportional hazards to assess risk factors for hypocalcemia. There were 59,151 and 56,847 new denosumab and oral bisphosphonate users, respectively. Of the denosumab users, 29% had serum calcium measured in the year before their prescription, and one-third had their serum calcium checked within 180 days after their prescription. Mild hypocalcemia (albumin-corrected calcium < 2.00 mmol/L) occurred in 0.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6, 0.7) of new denosumab users and severe hypocalcemia (< 1.8 mmol/L) in 0.2% (95% CI 0.2, 0.3). In those with an eGFR < 15 or receiving maintenance dialysis, the incidence of mild and severe hypocalcemia was 24.1% (95% CI 18.1, 30.7) and 14.9% (95% CI 10.1, 20.7), respectively. In this group, kidney function and baseline serum calcium were strong predictors of hypocalcemia. We did not have information on over-the-counter vitamin D or calcium supplementation. In new bisphosphonate users, the incidence of mild hypocalcemia was 0.3% (95% CI 0.3, 0.3).

### A single-dose study of denosumab in patients with various degrees of renal impairment [^115WFKuT]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2012). Low credibility.

In conclusion, results from this study indicate that renal function impairment does not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of denosumab, and, therefore, dose adjustments are not required for denosumab administration in these patients. As expected with antiresorptive therapy, and consistent with other denosumab studies, transient decreases in serum calcium concentration were observed after denosumab administration. The potential for hypocalcemia in subjects with severe CKD and kidney failure appeared greater compared with subjects with mild or moderate CKD and subjects with normal renal function. In patients with impaired renal function that receive denosumab, particularly those with severe kidney disease (defined herein as a GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2), it is important to provide adequate supplementation of calcium and vitamin D and to adequately manage secondary hyperparathyroidism.

### Kidney failure from kidney stones: an ANZDATA study [^111YWaQo]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Low credibility.

In the general population, a history of kidney stones is associated with future adverse events, including an increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) or progressing to kidney failure (KF), hypertension, bone fractures, and stroke. Due to the accumulating evidence of long-term risk of adverse events, kidney stones are now recognized as a marker of systemic disease and a predictor of metabolic and cardiovascular complications. This recognition shifts management towards treating kidney stones as a chronic medical condition, emphasizing the importance of long-term surveillance and management of potential risk factors. While the prognosis and adverse events for patients with kidney stones in the general population have been well studied, such information has not yet been specifically applied to patients with KF who require kidney replacement therapy (KRT).

Our data present the first analysis showing improved survival of KF patients with kidney stones undergoing dialysis, whether hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD), compared with KF due to other causes, with no difference for patients with a kidney transplant. Our results remained valid even after matching for age, gender, era of dialysis and transplant, and dialysis vintage. The better survival of kidney stone patients with KF on dialysis should be reassuring. A possible explanation could be the increased risk of mortality in the control group, which consists mainly of patients with KF due to diabetes and renovascular causes. Such patients experience shorter survival on dialysis compared with KF due to other causes.

In the kidney transplantation group, a kidney stone developing in the transplant is an obvious source of concern, requiring proactive management.

### Clinical review. Kidney stones 2012: Pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management [^114K9MT1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

The pathogenetic mechanisms of kidney stone formation are complex and involve both metabolic and environmental risk factors. Over the past decade, major advances have been made in the understanding of the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of kidney stone disease.

- **Evidence acquisition and synthesis**: Both original and review articles were found via a PubMed search reporting on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of kidney stones. These resources were integrated with the authors' knowledge of the field.

- **Conclusion**: Nephrolithiasis remains a major economic and health burden worldwide. It is considered a systemic disorder associated with chronic kidney disease, bone loss and fractures, increased risk of coronary artery disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and the metabolic syndrome. Further understanding of the pathophysiological link between nephrolithiasis and these systemic disorders is necessary for the development of new therapeutic options.

### Kidney stones and kidney function loss: a cohort study [^1179z3i3]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Kidney stones are a common and potentially preventable cause of morbidity in the general population. Using a cohort of more than three million people treated in a universal healthcare system, we found that the risks of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and two other clinically relevant adverse renal outcomes were all significantly higher in individuals with at least one symptomatic kidney stone episode.

The excess risk of all three adverse renal outcomes associated with stone episodes appeared to be greater in women than in men, and more pronounced among younger individuals than those aged 50 years or older. The observed association between stones and risk was independent of potential confounders and seemed to be magnified in those with multiple episodes compared to individuals with a single episode. These findings suggest that kidney stones are an important potential contributor to the risk of ESRD and that patients with prior kidney stones should be considered at increased risk for adverse renal outcomes — especially younger women or those with multiple symptomatic episodes.

Consistent with our data, a recent prospective cohort study of about 1.5 million people in the United Kingdom found that kidney stones were a significant risk factor for ESRD in women but not in men. The basis for this finding is unclear, but we speculate that, although men are more likely to develop stones, they are protected from obstructive complications due to differing anatomy.

### Denosumab-induced hypocalcemia and hyperparathyroidism in de novo kidney transplant recipients [^114cfTac]. American Journal of Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

Denosumab represents a realistic treatment option to increase bone mineral density in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). It is still unknown how and to what extent post-transplantation bone disease and graft function influence the effects of denosumab on mineral metabolism indexes. In this study, we analyze risk factors of hypocalcemia and parathyroid hormone (PTH) increase after denosumab administration in eighteen de novo KTRs and its management before and after this treatment.

- **Methods**: We conducted a monocentric, observational, prospective study on de novo KTRs. All KTRs enrolled received a single 60 mg subcutaneous dose of denosumab every 6 months. Before kidney transplantation, no patients were treated with calcimimetics. After kidney transplantation and before antiresorptive therapy, no patients were treated with calcimimetic drugs and/or vitamin D receptor agonists, while all patients received nutritional vitamin D supplementation (from 1,000 IU to 1,500 IU daily).

- **Results**: Hypocalcemia was related to the degree of lumbar osteoporosis (p = 0.047); the increase in the PTH level was correlated to baseline bone turnover markers (bone alkaline phosphatase, serum osteocalcin, and β-C-terminal telopeptide), the 25 OH status, and eGFR. The introduction of calcitriol, after the PTH increase, in addition to cholecalciferol, was necessary to ensure adequate control of serum calcium and PTH during a follow-up of 15 months. Following the treatment with denosumab, an improvement in areal bone mineral density at both lumbar and femoral sites was observed.

### Kidney stones and kidney function loss: A cohort study [^111mg78Z]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

To investigate whether the presence of kidney stones increases the risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or other adverse renal outcomes, a registry cohort study was conducted using validated algorithms based on claims and facility utilization data, with a median follow-up of 11 years. The study was set in Alberta, Canada, between 1997 and 2009.

The participants included 3,089,194 adult patients without ESRD at baseline or a history of pyelonephritis. Of these, 1,954,836 had outpatient serum creatinine measurements and were included in analyses of chronic kidney disease and doubling of serum creatinine levels.

- **Exposure**: One or more kidney stones during follow-up.
- **Main outcome measures**: Incident ESRD, development of stage 3b-5 chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 45 mL/min/1.73 m²), and sustained doubling of serum creatinine concentration from baseline.

Results showed that 23,706 (0.8%) patients had at least one kidney stone; 5,333 (0.2%) developed ESRD, 68,525 (4%) developed stage 3b-5 chronic kidney disease, and 6,581 (0.3%) experienced sustained doubling of serum creatinine. Overall, one or more stone episodes during follow-up was associated with increased risk of ESRD (adjusted hazard ratio 2.16 [95% CI 1.79 to 2.62]), new stage 3b-5 chronic kidney disease (hazard ratio 1.74 [1.61 to 1.88]), and doubling of serum creatinine (hazard ratio 1.94 [1.56 to 2.43]), all compared with those without kidney stones during follow-up. The excess risk of adverse outcomes associated with at least one episode of stones seemed greater in women than in men, and in people aged < 50 years than in older individuals.

### Hypocalcemia post denosumab in patients with chronic kidney disease stage 4–5 [^116J8abg]. American Journal of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Denosumab, a RANK-ligand inhibitor, is an effective treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men. Unlike the bisphosphonates, it is not excreted by the kidney. Little is known, however, about its efficacy and safety in patients with severe chronic kidney disease (CKD).

- **Methods**: A retrospective study was performed in CKD 4–5D patients from a tertiary referral hospital who were treated with denosumab between 1st January 2011 and 31st March 2014. Data collected included information about the following: CKD stage, fracture history, bone mineral density, serum calcium levels pre and post denosumab treatment, episodes of hypocalcemia, relevant medications, and adverse events.

- **Results**: Eight patients with CKD-5 and six patients with CKD-4 were identified (all female, mean age 77.1 ± 9.9). The mean pre-denosumab calcium value was 2.42 ± 0.12 mmol/l, PTH 20.2 ± 14.7 pmol/l, and 25-OH vitamin D 69.1 ± 30.1 nmol/l. After denosumab treatment, 6/8 patients with CKD-5/5D, and 2/5 patients with CKD-4 developed severe hypocalcemia. Two patients developed direct adverse complications of hypocalcemia (seizure, laryngospasm, prolonged QTc). Among the patients who developed hypocalcemia, the median time to serum calcium nadir was 21 days and the median time to correction of hypocalcemia was 71 days. Treatment of hypocalcemia required large doses of oral calcium and calcitriol, and increases in dialysate calcium concentration.

- **Conclusions**: A high rate of severe hypocalcemia was observed in patients with advanced CKD treated with denosumab. If denosumab is used in patients…

### Common and rare variants associated with kidney stones and biochemical traits [^113CVRBm]. Nature Communications (2015). Low credibility.

The lifetime risk of kidney stones in the United States is 8.8%, with an estimated recurrence rate of 14% after 1 year and 35% after 5 years, placing a significant burden on the health care system. In Iceland, the prevalence in individuals older than 70 years is 10.1% for men and 4.2% for women. Kidney stones form when urine becomes supersaturated with salts such as calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate and when urine concentrations of natural inhibitors of stone formation — such as citrate, magnesium, pyrophosphate, uromodulin, and osteopontin — are low. Calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate are the most common (approximately 80%) constituents of kidney stones.

The mechanism of stone formation involves both environmental factors, such as diet, and genetic traits. Individuals with a family history of kidney stones are at a greater risk than others of developing the condition. Recent studies estimate that up to 65% of kidney stone formers have a family history of kidney stones, and both twin and genealogy studies have reported strong heritability of kidney stone disease. Candidate gene association studies have attempted to assess the role of several genes involved in calcium homeostasis on kidney stone formation. These studies have been limited by sample size, the results are conflicting, and they do not consider a broad spectrum of sequence variants.

### Nephrolithiasis and risk of incident bone fracture [^117Xc4jp]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Higher urine calcium is a common feature of calcium nephrolithiasis and may be associated with lower bone mineral density in individuals with kidney stones. However, previous population-based studies of kidney stones and the risk of bone fracture demonstrate conflicting results. We examined independent associations between a history of kidney stones and incident fracture.

- **Materials and methods**: We performed prospective studies using data from the Nurses' Health Study of 107,001 women with 32 years of follow-up and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study of 50,982 men with 26 years of follow-up. We excluded premenopausal women, men younger than 45 years, and individuals who reported osteoporosis at baseline. Study outcomes were incident wrist (distal radius) or incident hip (proximal femur) fracture due to low or moderate trauma. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to adjust for multiple factors, including age, race, body mass index, thiazide use, supplemental calcium, and dietary intakes.

- **Results**: There were 4,940 wrist and 2,391 hip fractures in women, and 862 wrist and 747 hip fractures in men. All fractures were incident. The multivariable adjusted relative risk of incident wrist fracture in participants with a history of kidney stones compared to participants without kidney stones was 1.18 (95% CI 1.04–1.34) in women and 1.21 (95% CI 1.00–1.47) in men. The pooled multivariable adjusted relative risk of wrist fracture was 1.20 (95% CI 1.08–1.33). The multivariable adjusted relative risk of incident hip fracture in participants with kidney stones was 0.96.

### Association between low bone mass and the serum RANKL and OPG in patients with nephrolithiasis [^114D8Azs]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

A number of studies have provided evidence for the association between kidney stones and lower BMD. In men, stronger associations have been reported between the history of nephrolithiasis and low BMD. In addition, population-based studies have shown an increased fracture risk among stone formers. In fact, several in vitro and rodent studies have revealed that proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) are involved in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. These cytokines increase the synthesis of RANKL and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF).

In the mid-1990s, it was discovered that the OPG/RANKL/RANK system plays a main role in the regulation of bone remodeling. OPG is expressed on the osteoblasts and osteocytes, which bind to RANK and stimulate the activity and differentiation of osteoclasts. Due to the soluble receptor role of OPG for RANKL, it can prevent RANKL from interacting with RANK through binding to RANKL, suggesting that it plays an antiresorptive role.

The aim of this study was to define the role of RANKL and OPG in the development of nephrolithiasis-related reduced bone mineral density. We compared nephrolithiasis patients with low bone mass to nephrolithiasis patients with normal BMD to identify risk factors for the development of low bone mass in such patients.

### Denosumab and cinacalcet for primary hyperparathyroidism (DENOCINA): A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^1162GqKx]. The Lancet. Diabetes & Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Medical treatment options for primary hyperparathyroidism are scarce. We aimed to assess the efficacy of denosumab combined with cinacalcet in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.

- **Methods**: In this randomised, single-centre, proof-of-concept, double-blind trial, patients aged at least 18 years with primary hyperparathyroidism were recruited from the Department of Endocrinology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark. Key eligibility criteria included a T-score between -1.0 and -3.5 at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, or total hip. Patients were assigned (1:1:1) via permuted block randomisation to receive 30 mg cinacalcet per day plus 60 mg denosumab subcutaneously every 6 months (n = 14; combination group), denosumab plus placebo (n = 16; denosumab group), or placebo plus placebo injection (n = 15; placebo group) for one year. Primary outcomes were changes in bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry at the lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, and distal forearm after one year. Additionally, effects on bone-metabolic biochemistry were explored. Patients and investigators were masked. All enrolled patients were included in efficacy analyses. The trial was conducted in an outpatient setting and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03027557, and has been completed.

- **Findings**: Between March 14, 2017, and March 16, 2018, we recruited 285 participants. Sixteen patients were randomly allocated to the denosumab group, 15 to the combination group, and 15 to the placebo group. Dropout was limited to one patient in the combination group.

### Denosumab safety and efficacy among participants in the FREEDOM extension study with mild to moderate chronic kidney disease [^1178UobZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Several limitations of this study should be considered. First, the majority of participants had mild CKD classified as CKD stage 2, very few had CKD stage 4, and none had CKD stage 5. However, the 3-year FREEDOM analysis reported by Jamal et al. included a relatively larger number of individuals with CKD stage 4 (N = 73) and demonstrated that treatment efficacy and safety did not differ by renal function. Second, owing to the criteria applied for participation in FREEDOM and the extension study, patients were excluded if they had a diagnosis of either secondary hyperparathyroidism or CKD requiring dialysis. This is an important limitation of most clinical trials evaluating osteoporosis therapies, because included individuals with reduced eGFR likely have age-related declines in renal function rather than intrinsic renal disease with known renal pathology (e.g. diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus) or proteinuria. Thus, results from our study population may not be generalizable to the typical CKD patient population, in which abnormal mineral metabolism is common, and dialysis is often required to compensate for poor renal function. Additional studies are needed to investigate the safety and efficacy of antiresorptive treatments in the setting of advanced kidney disease and renal pathology, specifically how gains in BMD can be achieved without further perturbation of the mineral balance. Third, the present analysis was descriptive in nature and did not evaluate statistical significance. Finally, given the 10-year duration of the study, there was a decline over time in the number of participants, which could have impacted the findings.

### Should denosumab treatment for osteoporosis be continued indefinitely [^115uVKDw]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Denosumab was approved for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in 2010 based on the FREEDOM study, which indicated a benefit in terms of increased bone mineral density and reduced risk of major osteoporotic fracture. In the initial clinical studies, it was noted that discontinuation of denosumab can lead to a rebound of bone turnover markers and loss of accrued bone mineral density. An increased risk of fractures, particularly multiple vertebral fractures, associated with discontinuation was noted after approval and marketing of denosumab.

For many patients experiencing gain in bone mineral density and fracture prevention while taking denosumab, there is no reason to stop therapy. However, discontinuation may occur due to non-adherence; potential lack of efficacy in an individual; limitations on reimbursement for therapy when bone mineral density in the osteoporosis range has been exceeded; or concerns from patients or physicians regarding side effects.

This review paper aims to discuss these concerns and summarize the data available at the time of writing regarding sequential osteoporosis therapy following denosumab cessation to reduce the risk of multiple vertebral fractures.

### Bone mineral density and fracture among prevalent kidney stone cases in the third national health and nutrition examination survey [^113srtUw]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2001). Low credibility.

Concern that people who form kidney stones may have reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and increased fracture risk has motivated clinical and population-based studies; however, findings are inconsistent. In this cross-sectional study, we utilize the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) to determine whether a history of kidney stones (n = 793) is associated with lower femoral neck BMD and whether the association is similar for men and women. We further explore whether dietary calcium modifies the association between kidney stone history and BMD, and whether there is an association between kidney stone history and prevalent spine or wrist fracture.

Our findings indicate that men with a history of kidney stones have lower femoral neck BMD than men without such a history, after adjusting for age, body mass index (BMI), race/ethnicity, and other potential confounders. The effect of kidney stone history on BMD is weaker for women. Men with kidney stone history also report higher incidences of prevalent wrist and spine fractures. Dietary calcium, represented by usual milk consumption, is positively associated with BMD for both men and women, and modifies the effect of kidney stone history on BMD for men. Specifically, among men who form kidney stones, milk consumption is more strongly associated with femoral neck BMD than among men without such a history. The effect modification suggests that the difference in BMD between men with and without a history of kidney stones is observed only at lower levels of milk consumption.

- **Rationale**: Chapter 3.2 of the 2009 KDIGO guideline focuses on the diagnosis of CKD-MBD in bone. It states that, in patients with CKD stages 3–5D, it is reasonable to perform a bone biopsy in various settings. These include, but are not limited to: unexplained fractures, persistent bone pain, unexplained hypercalcemia, unexplained hypophosphatemia, possible aluminum toxicity, and prior to therapy with bisphosphonates in patients with CKD-MBD (not graded).

- **2017 KDIGO update**: In patients with CKD G3a–G5D with evidence of CKD-MBD and/or risk factors for osteoporosis, BMD testing is suggested to assess fracture risk if results will impact treatment decisions (2B).

### A single-dose study of denosumab in patients with various degrees of renal impairment [^115iKczF]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2012). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of a single 60-mg subcutaneous dose of denosumab in subjects with various degrees of renal function impairment. In accordance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance, which differed somewhat from the most recent National Kidney Foundation Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines, participants were classified into renal function categories ranging from normal to kidney failure requiring dialysis, employing the Cockcroft-Gault equation.

### Topamax [^111UGXx5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Topamax increases the risk of kidney stones. During adjunctive epilepsy trials, the risk for kidney stones in Topamax-treated adults was 1.5%, an incidence about 2 to 4 times greater than expected in a similar, untreated population. As in the general population, the incidence of stone formation among Topamax-treated patients was higher in men. Kidney stones have also been reported in pediatric patients taking Topamax for epilepsy or migraine. During long-term (up to 1 year) Topamax treatment in an open-label extension study of 284 pediatric patients aged 1–24 months with epilepsy, 7% developed kidney or bladder stones. Topamax is not approved for treatment of epilepsy in pediatric patients less than 2 years old [see Use in specific populations (8.4)].

Topamax is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can promote stone formation by reducing urinary citrate excretion and by increasing urinary pH [see Warnings and precautions (5.4)]. The concomitant use of Topamax with any other drug producing metabolic acidosis, or potentially in patients on a ketogenic diet, may create a physiological environment that increases the risk of kidney stone formation, and should therefore be avoided.

Increased fluid intake increases the urinary output, lowering the concentration of substances involved in stone formation. Hydration is recommended to reduce new stone formation.

An increase in urinary calcium and a marked decrease in urinary citrate was observed in Topamax-treated pediatric patients in a one-year active-controlled study.

### Nephrolithiasis-associated bone disease: pathogenesis and treatment options [^116JXRTi]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Nephrolithiasis remains a formidable health problem in the United States and worldwide. A very important but underaddressed area in nephrolithiasis is the accompanying bone disease. Epidemiologic studies have shown that osteoporotic fractures occur more frequently in patients with nephrolithiasis than in the general population. Decreased bone mineral density and defects in bone remodeling are commonly encountered in patients with calcium nephrolithiasis. The pathophysiologic connection of bone defects to kidney stones is unknown. Hypercalciuria and hypocitraturia are two important risk factors for stone disease, and treatments with thiazide diuretics and alkali, respectively, have been shown to be useful in preventing stone recurrence in small prospective trials. However, no studies have examined the efficacy of these agents or other therapies in preventing continued bone loss in calcium stone formers. This manuscript reviews the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and potential treatments of bone disease in patients with nephrolithiasis.

### Molecular modifiers of kidney stones [^1162WDye]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

This review discusses the role of molecular modifiers as inhibitors of kidney stone formation, drawing largely from in-vitro evidence while citing relevant in-vivo studies. An emphasis is placed on physical observations of crystal growth inhibition, focusing predominantly on the literature of calcium oxalate and L-cystine.

The last decade has witnessed several breakthroughs in the identification of molecules with promise to curb kidney stone formation, as well as discoveries of the mechanisms by which these molecules (or combinations thereof) function as inhibitors of pathological crystal growth. Studies of L-cystine and calcium oxalate crystallization have uncovered inhibitors that are more effective than current therapies. In-vitro assays using advanced techniques such as atomic force microscopy have characterized modifier-crystal interactions and mechanisms of crystal growth inhibition. A recent study of calcium oxalate crystals uncovered a new inhibition pathway, leading to crystal dissolution at relatively low modifier concentrations.

Advanced methods of identifying therapeutics for kidney stone disease have created greater awareness of the potential impact of crystal modifiers in pathological crystallization. Many natural and synthetic species have the capacity to act as growth inhibitors; however, the challenge of bridging in-vitro and in-vivo evidence has proven to be difficult. Future efforts should focus on better integrating laboratory research, clinical trials, and animal studies.

### Management of RANKL-mediated disorders with denosumab in children and adolescents: A global expert guidance document [^111u15Dh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

If deescalation of therapy is desired to maintain a therapeutic effect while reducing the effect on bone mineral density (BMD), denosumab therapy may be tapered by gradually extending the dose interval with the addition of a bisphosphonate. The approach utilized is as follows:

- **Tapering strategy**: Once the period of 4-weekly denosumab is completed, denosumab treatment alternates with zoledronate 0.025 mg/kg every 4 weeks, and later every 6 weeks. A final zoledronate dose is administered 12 weeks after the last denosumab dose. If hypercalcemia occurs at any time, an extra dose of zoledronate 0.025 mg/kg is given.

- **Authors' experience**: Tapering of the denosumab dose or interval without the use of an intravenous (IV) bisphosphonate is insufficient to prevent rebound hypercalcemia.

- **Monitoring parameters**: Serum calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and the urinary calcium/creatinine ratio on fasting second-void urine samples should be closely monitored during denosumab treatment and for at least 8 months following its discontinuation. Measurements should occur at least monthly for this full period, but increased frequency is often warranted at times of higher risk. These include when the dose interval is extended and between 2 and 6 months after discontinuation. Patients and families should be thoroughly counseled to recognize symptoms of hypercalcemia, which should prompt measurement of serum calcium. According to the authors' experience, hypercalcemia is a late, abrupt manifestation of the rebound phenomenon.

Further zoledronate at 0.025 to 0.05 mg/kg or denosumab is usually required to manage hypercalcemia; however, caution is needed with bisphosphonates in the presence of acute kidney injury.

### Management of RANKL-mediated disorders with denosumab in children and adolescents: A global expert guidance document [^115gSvEb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Prevention and management of "rebound" hypercalcemia is a primary safety concern in children and adolescents before skeletal maturity. It involves the prevention and early detection of hypercalcemia between denosumab doses or after discontinuation. Skeletally mature adolescents appear to be at lower risk but still require close monitoring. The aim of therapeutic strategies to prevent rebound hypercalcemia is to allow gradual resorption of excess bone accumulated during treatment while preventing resorption rapid enough to exceed renal calcium excretion capacity, which leads to hypercalcemia. Hydration is an important determinant of renal calcium excretion, and it is helpful to prescribe a daily oral fluid target to ensure fluid intake meets or exceeds recommendations for age and body size, with adjustments for high temperatures and physical exercise.

- **Use of IV bisphosphonates**: IV bisphosphonates are invariably needed to prevent rebound hypercalcemia after denosumab discontinuation or during tapering of the dose or interval. The premise is to use the longer duration of action and less potent antiresorptive effect of bisphosphonates to decrease the rapid rebound of bone turnover that occurs at denosumab offset.

A number of approaches have been used, and there are currently insufficient data to recommend one over the others:

- **Approach 1**: Zoledronate 0.025 mg/kg 4 and 8 weeks after the last denosumab dose, followed by risedronate 35 mg weekly (or every 2 weeks if weight < 30 kg) for 6 months. If hypercalcemia occurs, an additional dose of zoledronate 0.025 mg/kg is given. Alendronate may be used instead of risedronate.

### Association between low bone mass and the serum RANKL and OPG in patients with nephrolithiasis [^116hmPBF]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Nephrolithiasis is a risk factor for osteopenia and osteoporosis. Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) regulate bone remodeling and osteoclastogenesis. This study aimed to evaluate the relation between serum OPG, RANKL concentration, and bone mineral density (BMD) in patients with kidney stone disease.

- **Methods**: Forty-four nephrolithiasis patients with either low bone mass or normal BMD (considered the control group) were enrolled in this study. BMD was measured at the lumbar spine (L1-L4) and femoral neck by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). The serum OPG and RANKL were determined using the ELISA method.

- **Results**: The median levels of serum OPG were significantly higher in nephrolithiasis patients with low bone mass compared to the nephrolithiasis patients with normal BMD (3.9 pmol/l versus 3.1 pmol/l; P = 0.03). A negative correlation was detected between bone densities of the femoral neck and OPG in patients with nephrolithiasis (r = −0.344, P = 0.02).

- **Conclusion**: The present study showed that high serum fasting OPG levels may be indicative of femoral neck BMD in patients with nephrolithiasis.

### Denosumab safety and efficacy among participants in the FREEDOM extension study with mild to moderate chronic kidney disease [^114aZGFH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates are widely used to prevent fractures in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. Data from pivotal trials and their extension studies have shown no effects of treatment with oral alendronate, risedronate, and ibandronate on renal function. Reports comparing alendronate with placebo in individuals with CKD stages 3 to 5 showed variable results for BMD improvement with alendronate over placebo in individuals with mild to moderate CKD. Regarding fracture, the risks of clinical fracture and vertebral fracture were reduced with alendronate treatment to a similar degree in those with and without impaired renal function.

A pooled analysis of 9 clinical trials suggested the safety and efficacy of risedronate in osteoporotic women with an age-related decline in renal function. However, no study has reported data for a bisphosphonate treatment duration longer than 3 years. Because of their clearance by the kidneys and reports of renal impairment and acute renal failure associated with the use of intravenous zoledronic acid, all bisphosphonates carry a warning for use in patients with severe renal impairment (CCr < 30 mL/min). Additional data are needed to assess the safety of bisphosphonates in patients with moderate to severe CKD, as well as the potential for empiric bisphosphonate dose reductions to lessen retention of these drugs in patients with significantly impaired renal excretion.

In addition to the greater gains in BMD achieved with denosumab over bisphosphonates, there may be benefits of denosumab over other osteoporosis treatments in the setting of renal impairment.

### Bone in parathyroid diseases revisited: Evidence from epidemiological, surgical and new drug outcomes [^114RMeoQ]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody targeting RANKL, a pivotal mediator of bone resorption. Its indication for use, regardless of the patient's renal filtration rate, is of clinical significance, particularly in elderly patients or those with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and severe renal involvement. It has been proven that denosumab is a safe and efficient treatment option for postmenopausal women with mild-to-moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) and PHPT. After 24 months of treatment, bone mineral density (BMD) significantly increased in patients with CKD and osteoporosis related to PHPT. Additionally, a significant drop in calcium levels was observed in the PHPT with CKD group compared to the PHPT without CKD group. The risk of hypocalcemia and severe hypocalcemia is higher among CKD patients, with late stages of CKD (3b-5) and lower baseline calcium levels representing the main predisposing factors.

### Risk factors of asymptomatic kidney stone passage in adults with recurrent kidney stones [^111WEH6Z]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Kidney stones are highly prevalent and characterized by a high rate of recurrence. Thus, kidney stones not only cause pain, discomfort, and reduced quality of life but also incur tremendous health care costs. However, a significant number of kidney stones pass without symptoms and aren't noticed by the patient. Currently, data regarding the frequency of asymptomatic spontaneous stone passage are limited.

This study evaluated the natural history of asymptomatic kidney stones and factors associated with asymptomatic spontaneous stone passage in patients with recurrent calcium-containing stones. We found that a high number of patients (209 of 383; 55%) experienced a stone event within a relatively short follow-up period of 3 years. Interestingly, 36% (158 of 442) of the spontaneous kidney stone passages were asymptomatic. The number of asymptomatic spontaneous stone passages was significantly associated with a higher number of stones on CT at randomization.

With advances in imaging technology, the possibility of detecting asymptomatic kidney stones has increased. Treatment options for kidney stones include active surveillance, extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy, and percutaneous nephrolithotomy. However, a treatment strategy for asymptomatic kidney stones is yet to be established. In several guidelines, kidney stones ≤ 5 mm have been considered insignificant; however, the extent to which stone-related events can occur and when surgical intervention should be performed in these small stones remains under debate. According to previously published data, approximately half of patients…

### Bisphosphonates and management of kidney stones and bone disease [^112uZvgy]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2021). Low credibility.

Kidney stones are strongly associated with low bone density and bone fracture. Clinical management focuses on the prevention of kidney stones and bone fracture. We reviewed the literature on kidney stones and bone disease with a special focus on updates in therapeutic strategies, particularly regarding dietary management, supplements, and medications. Emphasis is placed on recent studies related to bisphosphonates and kidney stone management.

Recent findings indicate that bisphosphonate medications, commonly used in managing low bone density, may also reduce urinary calcium. A recent large prospective study found that bisphosphonates might reduce the risk of kidney stones in individuals with low bone density. In addition to lowering urinary calcium, bisphosphonates may act as inhibitors in the urinary space.

There are multiple dietary and pharmacologic strategies that can be considered for managing kidney stones and bone disease, such as a low salt and normal calcium diet, as well as thiazides, alkali, and bisphosphonate medications. Bisphosphonates may play an important role in reducing bone resorption and the overall risk of kidney stone and bone disease.
