## Question

Please provide guidelines for treatment in terms of chlorine gas exposure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for guidelines for treatment in terms of chlorine gas exposure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate scene safety and decontamination. Then, I should verify airway and breathing priorities and oxygenation targets. Next, I will review bronchodilator therapy and the role of corticosteroids. After that, I need to check advanced respiratory support indications, including intubation and prone positioning. I will then consider adjunctive therapies and what to avoid. Finally, I should confirm disposition, observation windows, and long-term follow-up for reactive airways dysfunction syndrome, and I will integrate special populations and mass-casualty considerations throughout.

> Let me first confirm scene safety and decontamination, because chlorine is heavier than air and responders can be secondarily exposed. I need to ensure rescuers don appropriate PPE, including SCBA or a minimum of an N95 with eye protection depending on concentration and context, and remove the patient from the contaminated area promptly, as there is no specific antidote and supportive care is the mainstay [^8822bcd9] [^8adec062]. Wait, let me verify decontamination needs: patients exposed only to chlorine gas without skin or eye irritation generally do not require decontamination, whereas those with liquid exposure or ocular/skin involvement need copious irrigation; I should double-check that nuance to avoid overtreatment or delays in care [^3dbbdbb9] [^0047f864].

> Next, I should review airway, breathing, and circulation priorities. I need to check for stridor, hoarseness, or progressive dyspnea that signal impending airway compromise and consider early intubation if these evolve, because upper airway edema can progress rapidly after chlorine exposure [^8adec062]. I should confirm oxygenation targets and start humidified oxygen for any dyspnea or hypoxemia, titrating to maintain SpO2 94–98% when feasible, and I will establish IV access and continuous monitoring for all symptomatic patients [^0305d38f] [^8adec062].

> I will now examine bronchodilator therapy, since chlorine causes bronchospasm and increased airway resistance. Hold on, I should verify the evidence base: inhaled beta-agonists are standard, and combining ipratropium with a beta-agonist has supportive experimental data for reversing bronchoconstriction and reducing airway resistance; I should recommend albuterol plus ipratropium for moderate to severe cases and repeat dosing as needed while monitoring response [^8afd4ddf] [^80a02957]. Let me reconsider the role of aminophylline; although it has been mentioned, the evidence is limited and inconsistent, so I should not prioritize it over inhaled bronchodilators and reserve it for refractory cases if at all [^0047f864].

> Now, corticosteroids are controversial, so I need to be cautious. Animal data suggest potential benefit when given very early after exposure, but human data are inconclusive and heterogeneous, and steroids may impair epithelial repair if given too late. Therefore, I should avoid routine steroids and consider short-course systemic corticosteroids only for significant bronchospasm or wheeze refractory to bronchodilators, ideally within the first few hours, while acknowledging the uncertainty and balancing risks like infection and hyperglycemia [^81a7f144] [^8afd4ddf]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to recommend steroids broadly for all symptomatic patients, but that overstates the evidence; I should correct that and limit their use to select cases with clear indication and close monitoring [^81a7f144].

> For advanced respiratory support, I should confirm indications for intubation and mechanical ventilation. Severe exposures can lead to ALI/ARDS, so I need to intubate for respiratory failure, altered mental status, severe hypoxemia, or inability to protect the airway, and apply lung-protective ventilation strategies per ARDS principles, including low tidal volumes and adequate PEEP [^notfound]. Let me verify the role of prone positioning; case-based experience and ARDS literature support prone positioning for refractory hypoxemia in chlorine-induced ARDS, and I should consider it early when oxygenation fails to improve with conventional measures [^33fcaf5a].

> I should review adjunctive therapies and explicitly state what to avoid. There is no specific antidote for chlorine, so I must not delay supportive care searching for one. Sodium bicarbonate nebulization has only modest, short-term improvements in FEV1 in one RCT and is not standard of care, so I should not recommend it routinely. Antibiotics are not indicated unless there is evidence of infection. And I need to avoid beta-blockers that can worsen bronchospasm in this setting [^8afd4ddf] [^8adec062]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not conflating chlorine with other agents; unlike cyanide or organophosphates, chlorine has no antidotal therapy, reinforcing the primacy of supportive care [^8adec062].

> Next, I should review disposition and observation. Asymptomatic patients with a reliable history and normal exam can be observed for 6–12 hours and discharged with strict return precautions, whereas symptomatic patients with cough, dyspnea, or chest tightness should be admitted and observed until symptom-free, given the risk of delayed pulmonary edema. Pulmonary edema typically appears 2–4 hours after moderate exposure and 30–60 minutes after severe exposure, so I need to ensure an adequate observation window aligned with exposure severity [^3dbbdbb9] [^0047f864]. I should double-check that children and unreliable historians warrant a lower threshold for admission and extended observation, which is consistent with pediatric vulnerability and delayed presentations [^3dbbdbb9].

> Long-term, I need to ensure follow-up for reactive airways dysfunction syndrome, which can persist months to years after significant chlorine exposure. I should counsel patients on irritant avoidance, smoking cessation, and arrange pulmonary function testing and clinical review at 4–6 weeks, with earlier follow-up if symptoms persist, because RADS is a recognized sequela and may require ongoing asthma-style management [^5dfd3257] [^8afd4ddf]. Let me verify that this is consistent with occupational and environmental guidance; yes, structured follow-up for irritant-induced asthma is recommended in exposed workers and should be mirrored in clinical care [^notfound].

> Special populations require tailored decisions. Children have smaller airways and higher risk of obstruction, so I should maintain a lower threshold for admission, observation, and early airway support. Older adults and those with COPD, asthma, or cardiovascular disease are at higher risk of complications, so I should anticipate ARDS, myocardial ischemia, or neurologic events and monitor closely. In pregnancy, standard supportive care applies, and I should avoid therapies with unclear benefit or teratogenic risk, reserving steroids for compelling indications with shared decision-making [^8adec062] [^723e81b3]. I should confirm that mass-casualty triage emphasizes rapid decontamination where indicated, oxygen and bronchodilators for all with respiratory symptoms, and early identification of those needing ICU-level care, which aligns with prehospital models for irritant gas exposures [^8822bcd9] [^3dbbdbb9].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and communication are complete. I should record exposure details, time course, symptoms, oxygenation, bronchodilator response, imaging findings, and disposition rationale, and I must communicate clearly about delayed symptoms and when to return, because many patients deteriorate after an initial quiescent period. This supports patient safety and aligns with public health reporting needs in significant exposures [^8adec062] [^0047f864].

Chlorine gas exposure management is **supportive care only** [^8afd4ddf], with no specific antidote [^8adec062]. Immediate priorities are **airway protection**, **humidified oxygen**, and **bronchodilators** for bronchospasm [^80a02957]; intubate if there is respiratory failure or airway edema [^8adec062]. Observe all patients for at least 6–12 hours [^3dbbdbb9] because delayed pulmonary edema can occur [^0047f864]. Corticosteroids are not routinely recommended [^81a7f144] but may be considered for severe bronchospasm or RADS; antibiotics are reserved for documented infection. Long-term, monitor for reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS) [^5dfd3257] and provide pulmonary follow-up [^8afd4ddf].

---

## Immediate management and decontamination

- **Remove from exposure**: Move patients to fresh air immediately [^4a9fbe30]; chlorine is heavier than air, so avoid low-lying areas [^7e1c00c5].

- **Decontamination**: Remove contaminated clothing and flush skin/eyes with copious water [^df8bc8a8]; chlorine gas exposures generally do not require decontamination unless there is liquid contact or significant skin/eye irritation [^3dbbdbb9].

- **Airway and breathing**: Ensure a patent airway; administer humidified oxygen to maintain SpO2 ≥ 94% [^0305d38f] [^8adec062].

---

## Supportive medical management

### Respiratory care

- **Bronchodilators**: Nebulized beta-agonists (e.g. albuterol) are first-line for bronchospasm; add ipratropium if wheeze persists [^8afd4ddf] [^80a02957].

- **Corticosteroids**: Not routinely recommended [^81a7f144]; consider for severe bronchospasm or RADS, but evidence is limited [^8afd4ddf].

- **Mechanical ventilation**: Use lung-protective strategies (tidal volume 6–8 mL/kg, plateau pressure ≤ 30 cm H2O) if ARDS develops [^notfound]; prone positioning may improve oxygenation [^33fcaf5a].

---

### Adjunctive therapies

Adjunctive options include **sodium bicarbonate nebulization**, which may modestly improve FEV1 at 2–4 hours but is not standard care [^8afd4ddf]. Antibiotics are reserved for **documented infection**; they are not prophylactic [^8afd4ddf].

---

## Indications for hospitalization and observation

Hospitalize patients with **persistent respiratory symptoms**, **severe exposure**, or **underlying lung disease** [^3dbbdbb9]. Observe asymptomatic patients with significant exposure for 6–12 hours [^3dbbdbb9] because delayed pulmonary edema can occur [^0047f864]. Discharge only when asymptomatic with normal exam and stable oxygenation after observation [^3dbbdbb9].

---

## Long-term complications and follow-up

Long-term complications include **reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS)** [^5dfd3257], chronic cough, and bronchial hyperreactivity [^80a02957]. Arrange pulmonary function testing and clinical follow-up at 4–6 weeks; counsel on exposure avoidance and smoking cessation [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

Children are more vulnerable to **airway obstruction** due to smaller airways; maintain a lower threshold for admission and observation [^8adec062]. Pregnant patients should receive standard supportive care; avoid experimental therapies. In mass-casualty incidents, triage should prioritize airway and respiratory support, with extended observation for delayed complications [^3dbbdbb9].

---

## Summary of treatment guidelines

| **Intervention** | **Indication** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Humidified oxygen | All symptomatic patients | Strong |
| Nebulized beta-agonists | Bronchospasm | Strong |
| Corticosteroids | Severe bronchospasm or RADS | Conditional |
| Mechanical ventilation | Respiratory failure or ARDS | Strong |
| Observation | Significant exposure or asymptomatic patients | 6–12 hours |
| Antibiotics | Documented infection only | Strong |

---

Chlorine gas exposure management is **supportive**, emphasizing airway protection, oxygenation, and bronchodilation, with vigilant observation for delayed pulmonary injury and structured follow-up for RADS [^8afd4ddf].

The panel agreed that the overall certainty of the evidence against prophylaxis treatment with HCQ was moderate (failure to prevent infection) due to concerns with imprecision, and the panel balanced the lack of clear benefit with the increased risk of harms from the body of evidence reported in the treatment section, in addition to the side effects reported in the trials to make a strong recommendation. The guideline panel recommended against the use of HCQ as post-exposure prophylactic treatment for persons exposed to COVID-19.

### Guideline for disinfection and sterilization in healthcare facilities, 2008 [^1d140494]. CDC (2008). Medium credibility.

Executive summary — Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 presents evidence-based recommendations on preferred methods for cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization of patient-care medical devices and the healthcare environment, noting that maximum effectiveness results from first cleaning and removal of organic and inorganic materials. Chemical disinfectants for patient-care equipment include alcohols, glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, iodophors, ortho-phthalaldehyde, peracetic acid, phenolics, quaternary ammonium compounds, and chlorine, and sterilization methods discussed include steam sterilization, ethylene oxide (ETO), hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, and liquid peracetic acid. The choice of disinfectant, concentration, and exposure time is based on the risk for infection associated with use of the equipment and other factors, and when properly used these processes can reduce the risk for infection associated with invasive and noninvasive medical and surgical devices; however, health-care workers should adhere strictly to the cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization recommendations in this document and to instructions on product labels. New topics addressed include inactivation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, bioterrorist agents, emerging pathogens, and bloodborne pathogens; toxicologic, environmental, and occupational concerns; disinfection in ambulatory settings and home care; new sterilization processes such as hydrogen peroxide gas plasma and liquid peracetic acid; and disinfection of complex instruments (e.g., endoscopes).

Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) and ozone (O3) — field disinfection characteristics and graded guidance — Chlorine dioxide–production tablets contain 6.4% sodium chlorite as the active ingredient, and a long reaction or contact time of upwards of 2 to 4 h is needed; ClO2 does not produce a lasting residual and water must be protected from sunlight. Ozone is one of the strongest oxidants and disinfectants and rapidly kills organisms but breaks down rapidly, so adequate concentration and contact time must be assured. Recommendations are as follows: "Chlorine dioxide and O3 are widely used and potent water disinfectants, including efficacy against the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence". Additionally, "Portable, point-of-use products generating ClO2 or O3 have limited data demonstrating effective concentration and contact time. Weak recommendation, moderate quality evidence".

Miscellaneous disinfectants — chlorine dioxide (ClO2) and ozone (O3) — are described as potent biocides due to strong oxidizing potential that have been used for many years to disinfect municipal water and numerous other industrial applications, but until recently benefits were limited to large-scale applications because standard formulations must be made on-site and are associated with a risk for producing volatile or toxic gas; newer methods may enable cost-effective and portable generation for small-scale applications.

### Emergency management of chlorine gas exposure-a systematic review [^8afd4ddf]. Clinical Toxicology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chlorine exposure can lead to pulmonary obstruction, reactive airway dysfunction syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome and, rarely, death.

Objective

We performed a systematic review of published animal and human data regarding the management of chlorine exposure.

Methods

Three databases were searched from 2007 to 2017 using the following keywords "("chlorine gas" OR "chlorine-induced" OR" chlorine-exposed") AND ("therapy" OR "treatment" OR "post-exposure")". Forty-five relevant papers were found: 22 animal studies, 6 reviews, 19 case reports and 1 human randomized controlled study. General management: Once the casualty has been removed from the source of exposure and adequately decontaminated, chlorine-exposed patients should receive supportive care. Humidified oxygen: If dyspnea and hypoxemia are present, humidified oxygen should be administered. Inhaled bronchodilators: The use of nebulized or inhaled bronchodilators to counteract bronchoconstriction is standard therapy, and the combination of ipratropium bromide with beta 2 -agonists effectively reversed bronchoconstriction, airway irritation and increased airway resistance in experimental studies. Inhaled sodium bicarbonate: In a randomized controlled trial, humidified oxygen, intravenous prednisolone and inhaled salbutamol were compared with nebulized sodium bicarbonate. The only additional benefit of sodium bicarbonate was to increase the forced expiratory volume in one second, 2 and 4h after administration. Corticosteroids: Dexamethasone 100mg/kg intraperitoneally (IP) reduced lung edema when given within 1h of chlorine inhalation and when administered within 6h significantly decreased (p < 0.01) the leukocyte count in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). As corticosteroids were never given alone in clinical studies, it is impossible to assess whether they had an additional beneficial effect. Antioxidants: An ascorbic acid/deferoxamine combination (equivalent to 100mg/kg and 15mg/kg, respectively) was administered intramuscularly 1h after chlorine exposure, then every 12h up to 60h, then as an aerosol, and produced a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in BAL leukocytes and a significant reduction (p < 0.007) in mortality at 72h. The single clinical case reported was uninterpretable. Sodium nitrite: Sodium nitrite 10mg/kg intramuscularly (IM), 30min post-chlorine exposure in mice and rabbits significantly reduced (p < 0.01) the number of leukocytes and the protein concentration in BAL and completely reversed mortality in rabbits and decreased mortality by about 50% in mice. No clinical studies have reported the use of sodium nitrite. Dimethylthiourea: Dimethylthiourea 100mg/kg IP significantly decreased (p < 0.05) lymphocytes and neutrophils in BAL fluid 24h after chlorine exposure in experimental studies. No clinical studies have been undertaken. AEOL 10150: Administration of AEOL10150 5mg/kg IP at 1h and 9h post-chlorine exposure reduced significantly the neutrophil (p < 0.001) and macrophage (p < 0.05) bronchoalveolar cell counts. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4): IM or IP TRPV4 reduced significantly (p < 0.001) bronchoalveolar neutrophil and macrophage counts to baseline at 24h. No clinical studies have been performed. Reparixin and triptolide: In experimental studies, triptolide 100–1000 µg/kg IP 1h post-exposure caused a significant decrease (p < 0.001) in bronchoalveolar neutrophils, whereas reparixin 15mg/kg IP 1h post-exposure produced no benefit. Rolipram: Nanoemulsion formulated rolipram administered intramuscularly returned airway resistance to baseline. Rolipram (40%)/poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (60%) 0.36mg/mouse given intramuscularly 1h post-exposure significantly reduced (p < 0.05) extravascular lung water by 20% at t+6h. Prophylactic antibiotics: Studies in patients have failed to demonstrate benefit. Sevoflurane: Sevoflurane has been used in one intubated patient in addition to beta 2 -agonists. Although the peak inspiratory pressure was decreased after 60min, the role of sevofluorine is not known.

Conclusions

Various therapies seem promising based on animal studies or case reports. However, these recommendations are based on low-level quality data. A systematic list of outcomes to monitor and improve may help to design optimal therapeutic protocols to manage chlorine-exposed patients.

Chlorine dioxide — scope of activity, applications, and safety — has data supporting manufacturers' bactericidal, fungicidal, sporicidal, tuberculocidal, and virucidal label claims; a chlorine dioxide generator has been shown effective for decontaminating flexible endoscopes but is not currently FDA-cleared for use as a high-level disinfectant. Chlorine dioxide can be produced by mixing two solutions, such as a solution of chlorine with a solution of sodium chlorite, and in 1986 a chlorine dioxide product was voluntarily removed from the market due to leakage of cellulose-based dialyzer membranes allowing bacterial migration.

To provide guidance to clinicians, the Wilderness Medical Society convened experts to develop evidence-based guidelines for water disinfection in situations where the potability of available water is not ensured, including wilderness and international travel, areas affected by disaster, and other areas without adequate sanitation. The guidelines present the available methods for reducing or eliminating microbiologic contamination of water for individuals, groups, or households; evaluation of their effectiveness; and practical considerations. The evidence evaluation includes both laboratory and clinical publications. The panel graded the recommendations based on the quality of supporting evidence and the balance between benefits and risks or burdens, according to the criteria published by the American College of Chest Physicians.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^8822bcd9]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Airway respiratory irritants — Key considerations for care and responder safety: Airway respiratory irritants can exacerbate underlying reactive airway diseases (e.g., asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) and precipitate or exacerbate bronchospasm, respiratory distress, and hypoxia. As patients may be off gassing (particularly hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen cyanide) in the back of the transport vehicle, it is important to have adequate ventilation of the patient compartment. Removal from the toxic environment, oxygen (humidified if available), general supportive therapy, bronchodilators, respiratory support, and rapid transport are core elements of care as there are no specific antidotes for any of these inhaled agents except for heavy metals that may be chelated in-hospital after agent identification. Hydrogen sulfide causes the cells responsible for the sense of smell to be stunned into inaction and therefore with a very short exposure will shut down and the exposed victim will not perceive the smell, yet the victim continues to absorb the gas as it is still present. Inhaled agents have become popular as a means of committing suicide and, if there is some form of suicide signage, hoses, or buckets of substances visible as you arrive at the vehicle or residence, immediately retreat to well ventilated area and don self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) before opening the vehicle or making entry as these gases may be highly concentrated and potentially lethal to EMS responders. Household bathroom, kitchen, and oven cleaners when mixed can generate various airway respiratory irritants (ammonia, chloramine, and chlorine gas releases are particularly common), and a very common exposure is to chloramine, a gas liberated when bleach (hypochlorite) and ammonia are combined; chloramine then hydrolyzes in the distal airways and alveoli to ammonia and hypochlorous acid. Sudden sniffing death can result from a single use of inhalant of abuse. Some inhalants can cause cardiac arrest due to dysrhythmias from irritated myocardium, and this syndrome most often is associated with abuse of butane, propane, and effects of the chemicals in the aerosols.

### Acute respiratory distress after exposure to chlorine dioxide-based disinfectant [^61b1b858]. Occupational Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Key learning points

What is already known about this subject:

During the COVID-19 pandemic chlorine dioxide has emerged as a widely used surface disinfectant.
Chlorine dioxide has been marketed as the ideal surface disinfectant: efficient against near all pathogenic microorganisms, fast-acting, non-toxic and safe to use.
Chlorine dioxide gas is a known irritant, but the concentration in the product used for surface disinfection is below the limit requiring the product to be labelled as potentially hazardous to health.

What this study adds:

Even though the chlorine dioxide concentration in the aqueous solution is very low, when the gas is released during use, the concentration in the working atmosphere may exceed relevant occupational exposure levels.
This case raises concern that normal use of these products may cause respiratory health damage.

What impact this may have on practice or policy:

The current legislation should be revised so that such products are required to be marked according to their potential health hazard.
Before adopting this chemical for surface disinfection purposes, careful assessment of the risk for health damage is advised, including measurements of chlorine dioxide concentrations in the working atmosphere.
In healthcare settings, the health hazard for patients should also be considered. Patient rooms should be adequately ventilated before they are used after having been disinfected with chlorine dioxide.

Halogen toxicity and iodine use considerations: Chlorine has no known toxicity at concentrations used for water disinfection, though reactions with organic contaminants can yield chlorinated hydrocarbons, chloroform, and other trihalomethanes with carcinogenic potential in animal models; however, the risk of severe illness or death from infectious diseases if disinfection is not used is far greater than any risk from chlorine byproducts. Iodine has not gained general acceptance for long-term use in large populations because of concern for its physiologic activity, and although older data suggest iodination with a low residual concentration ≤ 1 to 2 mg L−1 appears safe in people with normal thyroid function, no major agencies recommend prolonged use.

### Summary of WHO infection prevention and control guideline for Ebola and Marburg disease: a call for evidence based practice [^050352e0]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Consistently and rigorously applied IPC measures against potentially highly fatal Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus are essential to halt transmission of the diseases caused by these viruses. Both viruses belong to the Filoviridae family. IPC is a cross cutting area of work that requires collaboration among different agencies as part of a cohesive outbreak response. In addition to IPC practitioners, the many stakeholders and individuals with different roles in outbreak response — logistics teams, clinical and community health and care workers — should be aware of the latest IPC principles and recommendations for Ebola and Marburg disease because this directly affects their practices.

Cumulative experience during past outbreaks justified a review of existing IPC recommendations as experts observed inappropriate practices. Examples include the notion that more personal protective equipment (PPE) is always better than less personal PPE, as well as the routine spraying of chlorine for disinfection despite previous WHO recommendations against this practice. Another common observation was lack of standardised IPC approaches and practices by national (country) and partner organisations involved in implementing IPC measures during outbreaks, which resulted in confusion among health and care workers. Up to date, evidence based IPC guidelines for Ebola and Marburg disease are thus critical to ensuring a safe, systematic, and standardised approach during outbreaks.

Graniteville chlorine gas release — exposure characteristics and clinical outcomes are detailed. In January 2005, an early morning train accident released approximately 54,000 lb of chlorine gas, with most residents asleep except 180 millworkers on-shift. Three exposure durations were defined as very short-term (1–5 min), short-term (~10–15 min), and long-term (~30–60 min), with exposure doses varying from lethal (> 1,000 ppm) to the harmless odor threshold (0.2 ppm), and the plume was about 1.5 km wide at severe concentrations (≥ 20 ppm). Eight of nine immediate fatalities occurred on site, all due to asphyxiation or acute respiratory failure with pulmonary edema on autopsy. The most severely injured (n = 71) were admitted, with one death after discharge, and a hospital review of patients with both spirometry and chest X-ray found a predominantly restrictive lung function pattern. Treatments included β-agonists, ipratropium bromide, inhaled, oral, or intravenous corticosteroids, antibiotics, and nebulized or intravenous sodium bicarbonate. Five hundred and twenty-nine people were treated and released from emergency departments, and 331 sought medical care at physician's offices. Long-term follow-up of the known 1,384 victims is on-going, with preliminary evidence demonstrates significantly reduced lung volumes in the severely exposed.

### Clinical management of casualties exposed to lung damaging agents: a critical review [^be670920]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

There is no specific antidote for the treatment of casualties exposed to chlorine, phosgene, or mustards; therefore, management is largely supportive. Corticosteroid treatment has been given to casualties accidentally exposed to chlorine. Clinical data on efficacy are inconclusive as the numbers given steroids have been small and the indications for administration unclear. There have been no clinical controlled studies. There is a stronger evidence base from animal studies, particularly from porcine and rodent models. Lung injury induced by phosgene and mustard appears to be mediated by glutathione depletion, lipid peroxidation, free radical generation, and subsequent cellular toxicity. There is limited evidence to suggest that repletion of glutathione reduces and/or prevents lung damage by these agents. This may provide an opportunity for therapeutic intervention.

Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) for drinking water — capabilities and limitations are that ClO2-production tablets contain 6.4% sodium chlorite as the active ingredient, ClO2 is capable of inactivating most waterborne pathogens including Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts, and a major disadvantage for field use is the long reaction or contact time with upward of 2 to 4 h needed to achieve dependable disinfection; ClO2 does not produce a lasting residual and water undergoing chlorine dioxide disinfection must be protected from sunlight. Assessment of supporting evidence states chlorine dioxide is a widely used and potent water disinfectant, including efficacy against the protozoan parasites Cryptosporidium (Evidence grade: 1A), but individual use products have limited data demonstrating effective concentration and contact time (Evidence grade: 2B).

Chlorine compounds — blood spill and environmental surface disinfection: For small spills of blood on noncritical surfaces, the area can be disinfected with a 1:10 dilution of 0.5%–6.15% sodium hypochlorite or an EPA-registered tuberculocidal disinfectant, and an EPA-registered tuberculocidal disinfectant has been recommended for decontaminating blood spills. For large spills, the surface should be cleaned before an EPA-registered disinfectant or a 1:10 (final concentration) solution of household bleach is applied; if a sharps injury is possible, the surface initially should be decontaminated, then cleaned and disinfected (1:10 final concentration). At least 500 ppm available chlorine for 10 minutes is recommended for decontaminating CPR training manikins, and clinicians should not alter their use of chlorine on environmental surfaces on the basis of testing methodologies that do not simulate actual disinfection practices.

### Chlorine gas exposure at a metal recycling facility – California, 2010 [^7e1c00c5]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2011). Low credibility.

On June 8, 2010, chlorine gas was released from a ruptured, 1-ton, low-pressure tank being recycled at a California metal recycling facility. A total of 23 persons, including employees, customers, and workers at nearby businesses, were treated for the effects of the fumes at seven area hospitals. Chlorine is a corrosive, greenish-yellow gas that is heavier than air and can cause severe respiratory damage; it is used widely in water purification, sewage treatment, and disinfectant washes for foods. Following the incident, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and CDC collaborated with the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) on an Assessment of Chemical Exposures (ACE) to determine 1) the circumstances surrounding those exposed during the chlorine gas release, 2) health effects associated with exposures, and 3) recommendations for preventing recurrences. This report describes the chlorine gas release in California and summarizes the results of the ACE investigation. Of 29 persons potentially exposed to chlorine gas, 27 were interviewed to collect information regarding their exposures. In addition, information regarding acute health effects and symptoms was abstracted from medical records. At the time of the chlorine gas release, 15 persons were outdoors, and 13 were exposed for > 30 minutes before they were decontaminated. Twenty-three persons reported experiencing one or more upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms within 24 hours of exposure; six persons were hospitalized for 1–11 days. Based on these findings, CDPH issued a statewide alert to all recycling facilities on how to handle containers with potential hazardous waste.

- Victims exposed only to chlorine gas who have no skin or eye irritation do not need decontamination. They may be transferred immediately to the Support Zone. All others require decontamination.
- Symptomatic patients complaining of persistent shortness of breath, severe cough, or chest tightness should be admitted to the hospital and observed until symptom-free.
- If the treater feels that the patient has been exposed to a significant amount of chlorine, despite a relatively a benign clinical appearance he/she should be admitted for observation.
- Clinical signs of pulmonary edema will typically present 2–4 hours following a moderate exposure and 30
- 60 minutes following a severe exposure.
- Victims exposed only to chlorine gas who have no skin or eye irritation do not need decontamination. They may be transferred immediately to the Support Zone. All others require decontamination.
- Symptomatic patients complaining of persistent shortness of breath, severe cough, or chest tightness should be admitted to the hospital and observed until symptom-free.
- Administer 100% humidified supplemental oxygen, perform endotracheal intubation and provide assisted ventilation as required.
- Positioning
- Improvement in oxygenation has been associated with a change to the prone position. Drug Therapy for Inhalation Exposure‡* Animal experiments and anecdotal human experience suggests that inhaled beta-adrenergic agonists, Na bicarbonate therapy, aminophylline, corticosteroids, terbutaline, other beta2 agonists, N-acetyl cysteine and ibuprofen may be effective in treating chlorine-induced pulmonary edema. Optimal doses of these agents have not been established.
- The use of anti-reflux therapy, antibiotics and steroids are the other arms of management.
- The routine use of anti-reflux therapy is recommended to prevent secondary reflux-associated injury. Disposition and Follow-up Patient Release Asymptomatic patients who have normal initial examinations and no signs of toxicity after observation for 48 hours may be discharged with instructions to seek medical care promptly if symptoms develop. Follow-up Follow-up is recommended for all hospitalized patients because long-term respiratory problems can result. Respiratory monitoring is recommended until the patient is symptom-free. Chlorine-induced reactive airways dysfunction syndrome has been reported to persist from 2 to 12 years.

### Acute respiratory distress after exposure to chlorine dioxide-based disinfectant [^2557cb2c]. Occupational Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

This case report presents new information on a possible health hazard associated with the use of chlorine dioxide solutions for surface disinfection in an occupational setting. This health hazard is not currently reflected in the product's Material Safety Data Sheet, as the concentration of the gas in the solution is below the level that requires it to be marked as potentially hazardous to health according to European CLP regulation. We show with a simple estimation that there is a potential exposure for chlorine dioxide gas well above relevant occupational exposure limit values during surface disinfection with 200 ppm chlorine dioxide solutions. Before adopting this chemical for surface disinfection purposes, we advise careful assessment of the risk for health damage. Preferably, these risk assessments should include measurements of chlorine dioxide concentrations in the working atmosphere. In hospital settings, also the potential health hazard for patients should be considered.

### Mustard gas: imminent danger or eminent threat? [^92d7fa70]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To increase awareness of the widespread environmental prevalence of the chemical warfare agent mustard gas, examine the acute and chronic toxic effects to exposed humans, and discuss medical treatment guidelines for mustard gas exposures.

Data Sources

Literature retrieval of medical case reports and clinical studies was accomplished using PubMed and the Cochrane Database (1919-March 2007). Search terms included mustard, mustard gas, sulfur mustard, chemical warfare, blister agents, vesicants, and war gas. Historical information and current events were accessed through military field manuals and Internet searches.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All articles in English identified from the data sources were evaluated. Adult and pediatric populations were included in the review.

Data Synthesis

Mustard gas and other chemical weapons are feared for their use as weapons of terror; however, the major threat of mustard gas lies elsewhere. Tons of this chemical agent were produced for war, then subsequently buried in landfills, disposed of at sea, or left to decay in storage facilities. There are documented and anecdotal reports of chemical weapon burial sites and ocean dumps across the globe spanning from the Arctic Circle to Australia. Numerous accidental exposures have occurred over the past decade. Mustard gas is corrosive to the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract. Extensive exposures can also affect other organ systems. Its ability to cause harm to multiple organ systems at extremely low doses in virtually any environmental condition makes it an extremely dangerous agent. Immediate decontamination of people exposed to mustard gas liquids and vapors is paramount. Supportive care and long-term followup is necessary for exposed persons. Research is under way to find antidotes or treatment methods for mustard gas exposure, but currently there are no definitive treatment guidelines.

Conclusions

Mustard gas is a weapon, but also a prevalent environmental threat. Recognizing the immense environmental presence of mustard gas disposal sites and the signs and symptoms of exposure will help speed treatment to those accidentally or purposefully exposed.

### Ethylene glycol exposure: an evidence-based consensus guideline for out-of-hospital management [^447bf90b]. Clinical Toxicology (2005). Low credibility.

In 2002, poison centers in the US reported 5816 human exposures to ethylene glycol. A guideline that effectively determines the threshold dose for emergency department referral and need for pre-hospital decontamination could potentially avoid unnecessary emergency department visits, reduce health care costs, optimize patient outcome, and reduce life disruption for patients and caregivers. An evidence-based expert consensus process was used to create this guideline. Relevant articles were abstracted by a trained physician researcher. The first draft of the guideline was created by the primary author. The entire panel discussed and refined the guideline before distribution to secondary reviewers for comment. The panel then made changes based on the secondary review comments. The objective of this guideline is to assist poison center personnel in the out-of-hospital triage and initial management of patients with a suspected exposure to ethylene glycol by (1) describing the process by which the exposure might be evaluated, (2) identifying the key decision elements in managing the case, (3) providing clear and practical recommendations that reflect the current state of knowledge, and (4) identifying needs for research. This guideline is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. The panel recognizes that specific patient care decisions may be at variance with this guideline and are the prerogative of the patient and health professionals providing care, considering all of the circumstances involved. Recommendations are in chronological order of likely clinical use. The grade of recommendation is in parentheses. (1) A patient with exposure due to suspected self-harm, misuse, or potentially malicious administration should be referred to an emergency department immediately regardless of the dose reported (Grade D). (2) Patients with inhalation exposures will not develop systemic toxicity and can be managed out-of-hospital if asymptomatic (Grade B). Patients with clinically significant mucous membrane irritation should be referred for evaluation (Grade D). (3) Decontamination of dermal exposures should include routine cleansing with mild soap and water. Removal of contact lenses and immediate irrigation with room temperature tap water is recommended for ocular exposures. All patients with symptoms of eye injury should be referred for an ophthalmologic exam (Grade D). (4) Patients with symptoms of ethylene glycol poisoning should be referred immediately for evaluation regardless of the reported dose (Grade C). (5) The absence of symptoms shortly after ingestion does not exclude a potentially toxic dose and should not be used as a triage criterion (Grade C). (6) Adults who ingest a "swallow" (10–30 mL), children who ingest more than a witnessed taste or lick, or if the amount is unknown of most ethylene glycol products should be referred immediately for evaluation. The potential toxic volume of dilute solutions (e.g., concentration < 20%) is larger and can be estimated by a formula in the text (Grade C). (7) A witnessed taste or lick only by a child, or an adult who unintentionally drinks and then expectorates the product without swallowing, does not need referral (Grade C). (8) Referral is not needed if it has been > 24 hours since a potentially toxic unintentional exposure, the patient has been asymptomatic, and no alcohol was co-ingested (Grade D). (9) Gastrointestinal decontamination with ipecac syrup, gastric lavage or activated charcoal is not recommended. Transportation to an emergency department should not be delayed for any decontamination procedures (Grade D). (10) Patients meeting referral criteria should be evaluated at a hospital emergency department rather than a clinic. A facility that can quickly obtain an ethylene glycol serum concentration and has alcohol or fomepizole therapy available is preferred. This referral should be guided by local poison center procedures and community resources (Grade D). (11) The administration of alcohol, fomepizole, thiamine, or pyridoxine is not recommended in the out-of-hospital setting (Grade D).

- Blurred vision or eye tearing
- Burning feeling in the nose, throat, lungs, and eyes
- Coughing and/or coughing up white to pink-colored fluid
- Chest tightness
- Breathing problems, shortness of breath, or rapid and shallow breathing
- Respiratory failure
- Frostbite if exposed to liquid chlorine
- Nausea and/or vomiting
- Skin pain, redness, and/or blisters If low amounts are breathed in, symptoms may show up later. What to do if you are exposed Get away Get away from the area where the chlorine was released and breathe fresh air. Outdoors If the chlorine release was outdoors, go indoors and shelter in place. Make sure windows are closed and ventilation systems are turned off to make sure the chlorine does not come inside. If you cannot go indoors, leave the area where the chlorine was released. Do not scrub. If your eyes are burning or you can't see normally, wash your eyes for 10–15 minutes with lukewarm water.

Do not use eye drops. Dry your face, then tilt your head back and dry your hair, and then dry down your body. Use anything that will soak up water. Drop used things to the floor. Dress in any available clean clothes to prevent hypothermia. This is especially important if temperatures are cool. Get help Get help right away by calling 911, going to the hospital if local officials say it is safe to leave your home, or calling the Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222. Treatment If someone has swallowed chlorine, do not force vomiting. No known cure exists for chlorine exposure. Treatment involves removing chlorine from the body as soon as possible and providing supportive medical care. Symptoms can be treated in a hospital setting or by trained emergency personnel. Long-term health effects Short exposure Lung health usually returns to normal within 7 to 14 days.

Although most people recover completely, symptoms and lung issues may continue for those more seriously exposed. Exposure to chlorine can lead to reactive airways dysfunction syndrome, asthma caused by chemicals. Long term exposure This often occurs in the workplace. Teeth may be weakened. Multiple exposures to chlorine may also produce flu-like symptoms and high risk of RADS.

### Chlorine gas induced acute respiratory distress syndrome due to pool shock [^33fcaf5a]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Chlorine gas is a known pulmonary irritant with potential to cause significant lung injury. Most severe cases stem from industrial accidents or chemical warfare, and while exposure is common with chlorinated household cleaners, life threatening events are rare. A 75-year-old male developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following an accidental chlorine exposure after mixing calcium hypochlorite powder with water in his sink, triggering an explosion with chlorine gas release. He rapidly developed bronchospasm, pulmonary edema and respiratory failure within hours of exposure, in addition to severe chemical conjunctivitis. He was rapidly intubated, received bronchodilators, intravenous dexamethasone and inhaled epoprostenol, and underwent prone positioning. Targeted therapy for chlorine gas induced lung injury is limited. Despite a rapid decline over his initial clinical course, and prognostic markers all portending a poor outcome, aggressive management of his lung injury with standard ARDS care proved to be effective, and the patient made an excellent recovery.

### 2019 update of the WSES guidelines for management of () infection in surgical patients [^7be0ea24]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

In a health-care setting, transmission of C. difficile spores occurs primarily via the contaminated hands of health-care workers, but contact with a contaminated environment, contaminated utensils or medical devices has also been implicated. Hand hygiene with soap and water and the use of contact precautions along with good cleaning and disinfection of the environment and patient equipment should be used by all health-care workers in contact with any patient with known or suspected CDI. Hand hygiene is a cornerstone of prevention of nosocomial infections, including infection due to C. difficile. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are highly effective against non-spore-forming organisms, but they do not kill C. difficile spores or remove C. difficile from the hands.

Though disposable glove use during care of a patient with CDI may be effective in preventing the transmission of C. difficile, these must be removed at the point of use and the hands should then be thoroughly decontaminated with soap and water.

For environmental cleaning, disinfection with sodium hypochlorite solutions are usually recommended in patient areas where C. difficile transmission is ongoing.

In 2016, a cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital to analyze the impact of location of sinks on hand washing compliance after caring for patients with CDI. Healthcare workers' hand washing compliance was low, and a poor access to sinks was associated with decreased hand washing compliance.

Environmental decontamination of clinical areas, ideally using hypochlorite agents or a sporicidal product, is recommended; however, in practice, compliance with cleaning protocols is often suboptimal.

In 2017, a qualitative systematic review including 46 studies investigated the impact of specific interventions on CDI rates in acute-care hospitals. The most effective interventions, resulting in a 45% to 85% reduction in CDI, included daily to twice daily disinfection of high-touch surfaces (including bed rails) and terminal cleaning of patient rooms with chlorine-based products. Chlorhexidine bathing and intensified hand-hygiene practices were not effective for reducing CDI rates.

Halogen disinfection — field variables and combination products: The primary factors of the first-order chemical disinfection reaction are concentration and contact time, allowing lower concentrations to be used with longer contact times or, in field disinfection, to minimize halogen dose and improve taste or conversely to minimize required contact time with higher doses. Multiple products combine chlorine with a C-F powder to clarify and disinfect in 1 step, resulting in decreased turbidity, high disinfection for bacteria and viruses, increased removal of protozoan cysts over chlorine alone, and significant removal of other contaminants such as arsenic.

### Trends in chlorine and chloramine gas exposures reported to United States poison centers [^64236740]. Clinical Toxicology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chlorine and chloramine gas inhalation can occur when household cleaners are mixed. The increased emphasis on disinfecting practices during the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to an increase in chlorine and chloramine gas exposures in the United States, which has not been studied.

Methods

In a retrospective review, reported data on chlorine and chloramine gas exposures in the National Poison Data System were collected from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2022. Data included demographics and exposure details, including location, dose, formulation, co-exposures, treatments, and outcomes. Demographic analyses and descriptive statistics were conducted.

Results

During the study period, 85,104 total exposures to chlorine and chloramine gas were reported, consisting of 79,281 isolated exposures and 5,823 co-exposures. Total exposures increased by 61% from 8,385 in 2015 to 13,503 in 2022, with the largest increase of 38.3% occurring from 2019 to 2020. Total exposures remained increased through 2022 with no return to pre-pandemic levels. Most exposures occurred in "own residence" (n = 72,213, 84.9%), with a larger proportion of exposures occurring at home peri-pandemic versus pre-pandemic (88.4% versus 81.7%). One percent (n = 1,030) of exposures were admitted to a non-critical care unit, 0.73% (n = 619) were admitted to a critical care unit, and 0.03% (n = 26) resulted in death.

Discussion

The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and increased emphasis on cleaning practices were likely contributing factors to the marked increase in exposures in 2020, which persisted through 2022. Cleaning practices that developed during the beginning of the pandemic likely persisted despite returning to more normal daily routines, which may explain the ongoing increase in reported exposures. Most reported exposures were unintentional, mild in symptomatology, and required the use of non-invasive therapies, if any.

Conclusions

Future efforts should focus on public education on the safe use of cleaning products to prevent exposure to toxic chlorine and chloramine gases.

### Recommendations for burns care in mass casualty incidents: WHO emergency medical teams technical working group on burns (WHO TWGB) 2017–2020 [^a1bc308c]. Burns (2021). Medium credibility.

Inhalation injury

First responders, and those at the initial receiving health facility, are advised to be observant for the early signs and symptoms of a thermal inhalational injury. Inhalational injuries can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Early recognition and intervention of likely airway compromise or respiratory failure is an important step in helping improve patient outcome. Signs of inhalational injury include soot in the mouth, facial burns, stridor, hoarseness and confusion.

The type of incident and mechanism of burn injury will also provide additional indications to risk of inhalational injury. Evidence suggests that failure to recognise actual or pending airway compromise from inhalational burns early increases mortality rate significantly. Findings from a three staged mix methods study following the burn MCI in Taiwan (2015) identified that patients with inhalational injuries were prone to be under-triaged when first responders used the Simple and START triage tools and no burn injury specific triage tool was used. Those with inhalational burns rapidly developed airway obstruction and hypoxia whilst awaiting transportation. The authors recommended that evaluation of inhalational injury be an integral part of triage procedures and evaluation of inhalational injury the most critical step in the triage process.

Consideration should also be given to the possibility of chemical inhalational injuries such as those resulting from mustard gas, phosphorus and chlorine following MCIs. Appropriate personal protective equipment is advised when managing patients suspected of being victims of a chemical incident and an awareness of the often delayed effects of the agent is important (e.g. Mustard agents). Industrial accidents can also give rise to inhalational injuries – for example cyanide poisoning from acrylics.

Inhalational injury impacts significantly on patient outcome.· However, early and appropriate interventions and referral of such patients to specialised burn centres can help support improved outcome. Early interventions include airway protection, oxygenation and cautious fluid management. Advanced airway management (intubation and ventilation) is resource intense and thus consideration at the earliest possible phase of care should be given to onward planning of patient care. Considering the complexity of positively diagnosing inhalation injury even in specialised settings, it is likely that first responders will often miss the condition. Careful re-assessment at the first receiving hospital is therefore paramount.

### Do we know how best to disinfect child care sites in the United States? A review of available disinfectant efficacy data and health risks of the major disinfectant classes [^442e2150]. American Journal of Infection Control (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Children in child care settings have a high infectious burden. They are frequently exposed to sanitizing and disinfecting agents, whose toxicities have not been studied in these settings. Current guidance on the preferred disinfection agents for child care is vague.

Methods

This article combines 2 different sources of information: the Environmental Protection Agency registration data on the efficacy of hospital-grade disinfectants and a review of the research on the toxicities of the most common of these disinfectants to summarize information that could be used for more evidence-based early care and education disinfection regulations and guidelines.

Results

Coverage of these organisms varied both between disinfectant classes (defined by active ingredient), as well as within classes. The 3 most common active ingredients in the database-quaternary ammonias, bleaches, and hydrogen peroxides-had 251, 63, and 31 products, respectively. Quaternary ammonias and bleaches are both known asthmagens, with the potential for toxic gas release when mixed. Quaternary ammonias may also cause reproductive toxicity. Disinfectant-grade peroxides have relatively low inhalational toxicity.

Conclusions

A clear rationale is needed to establish policies for determining preferable disinfection products for use in child care settings, based on efficacy against relevant pathogens, toxicity, ease of use, and cost. When other factors are equal, the use of peroxide-based disinfectant products is recommended to minimize inhalational toxicity.

### A survey of cystic fibrosis center recommendations for nebulizer cleaning and disinfection [^fae66f3e]. Respiratory Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite advancements in cystic fibrosis (CF) therapeutics, the persistence of chronic infections necessitates continued use of nebulized therapies. Though the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation recommends well-defined cleaning and disinfection of nebulizers to mitigate pathogen exposure risks, discrepancies between Cystic Fibrosis Foundation guidelines, manufacturers' instructions, and variability in center recommendations contribute to confusion and non-standardized practices.

Methods

A digital survey was distributed to directors, associate directors, and care coordinators of CF centers across the United States to investigate the methods, frequency, and educational practices surrounding nebulizer care they provide patients. Responses were analyzed using descriptive techniques and chi-square analyses.

Results

Of 855 distributed surveys, 129 respondents provided insights into nebulizer care recommendations. Discrepancies in disinfection frequency were notable, with 18% of respondents recommending disinfecting nebulizers less than daily. Approximately 20% of respondents were unsure if their recommendations aligned with Cystic Fibrosis Foundation guidelines while 73% reported that their recommendations strictly adhered to the published guidelines. Of this 73%, all recommended at least daily cleaning, with 69% specifying cleaning before reuse; and 88% recommended disinfection at least daily, with 36% specifying disinfection before reuse. Only 10% recommended both cleaning and disinfection after every use. Disinfection less than daily was recommended by 11% of the respondents who felt they were strictly following the guidelines. We also highlight respondents who cited barriers to strict adhesion to the published guidelines.

Conclusions

The highlighted variations in CF centers' recommendations for nebulizer care with deviations from Cystic Fibrosis Foundation guidelines underscore the necessity for developing clear and practical guidelines that consider both efficacy and the realities of patient adherence. Collaboration among CF care centers, patients, guideline committees, and other stakeholders is essential to develop recommendations that effectively address the challenges faced by the CF community, ensuring the safe and effective nebulizer use.

During the scan

Apply all standard radiation protection and optimisation principles
Use the appropriate PPE
Use disposable protective elements for the scanners

When the patient is scanned and goes home

After scanning a COVID-19 patient, scanners and room surfaces should be disinfected to prevent possible spread of infection. If available, local recommendations and guidelines should be followed, e.g. Public Health England has released a guide for disinfecting scanners and clinic rooms with solutions containing 1000 ppm available chlorine, and appropriate training for environmental maintenance personnel is recommended.
Before the patient is released, if the hybrid study involves a CT of the chest, it is imperative to look for incidental COVID-19 findings that might suggest COVID-19 infection.
If incidental COVID-19 findings are detected in the lungs, it must be reported immediately to the referring clinician, and the patient triaged for the appropriate care pathway.

Coccidioidomycosis laboratory exposure — environmental remediation specifies that all surfaces and the outside of objects needed for continued use should be thoroughly cleaned with bleach at a 1:10 dilution or hydrogen peroxide (≥ 6%). Wetting and contact time are emphasized; ≥ 20 minutes is recommended, though disinfecting can be extended to sterilization and spore-killing if the time of exposure is extended to 6–10 hours. Personnel performing environmental remediation should wear N95 or other appropriate respirators, culture materials should be wetted with sporicide, bagged or placed in a covered bucket, autoclaved, and discarded whenever possible, and accidents in or near a biological safety cabinet should prompt negative room pressure and paraformaldehyde vapor decontamination.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^ef6723a2]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Giardia prevention — exposure avoidance, hand hygiene, and water safety in HIV care: Avoidance of untreated water sources and hand washing with soap and water after exposure to potentially fecally contaminated material or contact with an infected person or animal are recommended, and these recommendations are especially important in individuals with severe immunosuppression. In adults with HIV infection, an intervention regimen of intensive hand washing (after defecation, after cleaning infants who had defecated, before preparing food, before eating, and before and after sex) coupled with weekly reminder telephone calls resulted in fewer Giardia infections. Alcohol-based gels are ineffective against Giardia cysts and should not be used as a substitute for hand washing when exposure to Giardia is a concern. In a hospital, standard precautions (use of gloves and hand washing after gloves are removed) should be sufficient to prevent transmission from an infected patient to a susceptible person with HIV. For travelers, hikers, and campers to areas where water may be contaminated or of doubtful safety, they should be advised of methods to make water safe for drinking, including using bottled water, disinfecting water by heating it to a rolling boil for 1 minute, or using a filter tested and rated to National Safety Foundation Standard 53 or Standard 58 for cyst and oocyst reduction. Waterborne outbreaks of giardiasis can be prevented with adequate filtration, chlorination, and maintenance of water distribution systems, and travelers should also be advised about transmission risk from contaminated recreational water.

### Infection prevention and control studies for care of patients with suspected or confirmed filovirus disease in healthcare settings, with focus on Ebola and Marburg: an integrative review [^d17b138c]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To review evidence pertaining to methods for preventing healthcare-associated filovirus infections (including the survivability of filoviruses in clinical environments and the chlorine concentration required for effective disinfection), and to assess protocols for determining the risk of health worker (HW) exposures to filoviruses.

Design

Integrative review.

Data sources

PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, internet-based sources of international health organisations (eg, WHO, CDC), references of the included literature and grey literature.

Study selection

Laboratory science, clinical research and real-world observational studies identified through comprehensive search strings that pertained to Ebola disease and Marburg disease and the three research objectives.

Methods

Using the framework of population, intervention or exposure, outcomes, study types and report characteristics, reviewers extracted data and critically appraised the evidence using predefined data extraction forms and summary tables. The extraction forms, summary tables and critical appraisals varied based on the included literature; we used both the QUIPS Risk-of-Bias tool when possible and an internally developed instrument to systematically extract and review the evidence from observational and experimental studies. Evidence was then synthesised and summarised to create summary recommendations.

Results

Thirty-six studies (including duplicates across research questions) were included in our reviews. All studies that related to the review questions were either (1) descriptive, real-world studies (ie, environmental audits of various surfaces in operational Ebola Treatment Units) or (2) controlled, laboratory studies (ie, experimental studies on the survivability of ebolaviruses in controlled conditions), presenting a range of concerns pertaining to bias and external validity. Our reviews of viral survivability evidence revealed significant disconnections between laboratory-based and real-world findings. However, there is greater viral persistence in liquid than dried body fluids, with the possible exception of blood, and ebolaviruses can survive for significant periods of time in dried substrate. Evidence suggests that 0.5% hypochlorite solution should be used for disinfection activity. Spills should be cleaned with covering and soaking for 15 min. Existing literature suggests that within a well-resourced clinical environment with trained, foreign HWs and established protocols, transmission of ebolaviruses as an occupational risk is a rare event. Despite the high rates of HW infections within public African healthcare settings, no evidence with low risk of bias exists to assess the risk of various occupational exposures given that all high-quality studies were conducted on foreign Ebola clinicians who had low overall rates of infection. This review underscores the critical need for better-quality evidence to inform best practices to ensure HW safety during filovirus disease epidemics.

### Acute respiratory distress after exposure to chlorine dioxide-based disinfectant [^6f67549e]. Occupational Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Chlorine dioxide gas is a potent respiratory irritant, and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) has proposed a threshold limit value — ceiling (TLV-C) of 0.1 ppm in the working atmosphere due to the potential for respiratory tract irritation and pulmonary oedema. Even though the concentration of chlorine dioxide in the disinfectant solution is relatively low, an estimation based on the described use and some theoretical assumptions shows that the patient may have been exposed to concentrations far above this threshold limit value, see time–history graph of estimated concentration in Figure 1 applying a Near Field–Far Field model. This estimation shows a maximum concentration of 4 ppm and a 30-min mean of 3 ppm. The assumptions in this model are that 1 l of 200 ppm chlorine dioxide solution is used to clean a room with a 40 m 3 volume over 30 min. It is assumed that all the chlorine dioxide gas in the solution is released as the solution evaporates and that the gas is evenly distributed in the room volume. The room is assumed to be ventilated with five air changes per hour. This shows that even though the product has a concentration below the threshold requiring it to be marked as potentially hazardous to health according to the European CLP regulation, the concentrations in the working atmosphere of cleaning personnel may greatly exceed the levels considered to be safe.

Figure 1.
Exposure estimate chlorine dioxide based on the case report. NF = Near Field exposure, FF = Far Field exposure, C = Concentration, TWA = time weighted average.

Our evaluation of this case history is that the patient's symptoms most likely represent an irritant asthmatic reaction caused by repeated exposure to chlorine dioxide gas in concentrations that likely were above the relevant health-based threshold limit values. Her symptoms show a tight-linked relation with exposure to the disinfectant. Unfortunately, spirometry or other investigations objectively demonstrating airway reactions were not performed in the symptomatic phase of her condition. Differential diagnoses for the acute exacerbation leading up to the hospital admission are mainly infection or an allergic reaction. Infection is considered not to be likely due to the lack of fever or other clinical signs of infection, and the lack of infection markers in the blood. Allergic reaction is considered less likely because no plausible allergic agents have been identified. Infection or allergic reaction cannot explain the airway irritation she experienced during repeated exposures to chlorine dioxide.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for water disinfection for wilderness, international travel, and austere situations [^ed707808]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Preferred technique — selection depends on logistics and source water, and combined processes may be needed: the optimal technique depends on number of persons, space and weight, source water quality, taste preferences, and fuel; because halogens are not effective for killing Cryptosporidium and common microfilters are not reliable for viruses, optimal protection may require a 2-step process of 1) filtration or C.F., then 2) halogenation, while heat (boiling) is effective as a 1-step process. In disasters, household or point-of-use disinfection is advised; chlorine is the simplest method, cloudy water should be clarified before using hypochlorite, and for marine voyages only reverse osmosis membrane filters are adequate. For storage and daily use, iodine works only for short periods, prolonged storage should use chlorination in tightly sealed containers, and narrow‑mouthed or spigot containers help prevent contamination.

### A systematic review of chlorine-based surface disinfection efficacy to inform recommendations for low-resource outbreak settings [^a078a231]. American Journal of Infection Control (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Infectious diseases can be transmitted via fomites (contaminated surfaces/objects); disinfection can interrupt this transmission route. However, disinfection guidelines for low-resource outbreak settings are inconsistent and not evidence-based.

Methods

A systematic review of surface disinfection efficacy studies was conducted to inform low-resource outbreak guideline development. Due to variation in experimental procedures, outcomes were synthesized in a narrative summary focusing on chlorine-based disinfection against 7 pathogens with potential to produce outbreaks in low-resource settings (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella spp., hepatitis A virus, rotavirus, norovirus, and Ebola virus).

Results

Data were extracted from 89 laboratory studies and made available, including 20 studies on relevant pathogens used in combination with surrogate data to determine minimum target concentration × time ("CT") factors. Stainless steel (68%) and chlorine-based disinfectants (56%) were most commonly tested. No consistent trend was seen in the influence of chlorine concentration and exposure time on disinfection efficacy. Disinfectant application mode; soil load; and surface type were frequently identified as influential factors in included studies.

Conclusions

This review highlights that surface disinfection efficacy estimates are strongly influenced by each study's experimental conditions. We therefore recommend laboratory testing to be followed by field-based testing/monitoring to ensure effectiveness is achieved in situ.

### Potential for chlorine gas-induced injury in the extrapulmonary vasculature [^bc234492]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2010). Low credibility.

Exposure to chlorine gas (Cl(2)) primarily causes injury to the lung and is characterized by inflammation and oxidative stress mediated by reactive chlorine species. Reducing lung injury and improving respiratory function are the principal therapeutic goals in treating individuals exposed to Cl(2) gas. Less is known on the potential for Cl(2) gas exposure to cause injury to extrapulmonary tissues and specifically to mediate endothelial dysfunction. This concept is forwarded in this article on the basis that (1) many irritant gases whose reactivity is limited to the lung have now been shown to have effects that promote endothelial dysfunction in the systemic vasculature, and as such lead to the acute and chronic cardiovascular disease events (e.g., myocardial infarctions and atherosclerosis); and (2) that endogenously produced reactive chlorine species are now considered to be central in the development of cardiovascular diseases. This article discusses these two areas with the view of providing a framework in which potential extrapulmonary toxic effects of Cl(2) gas exposure may be considered.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^3b058c18]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Cyanide exposure — patient safety considerations advise wearing appropriate PPE during rescue of multiple casualties, managing off‑gassing risk after ingestion, avoiding nitrites when carbon monoxide poisoning is suspected, and selecting pregnancy-safe antidote therapy. In the event of multiple casualties, be sure to wear appropriate PPE during rescue evacuation from the toxic environment. If the patient ingests cyanide, it will react with the acids in the stomach generating hydrogen cyanide gas; maximize air circulation in closed spaces as gastric contents may release hydrogen cyanide gases with vomiting or belching. Do not use nitrites in conjunction with suspected carbon monoxide poisoning as it worsens the hemoglobin oxygen carrying capacity, and hydroxocobalamin is only agent safe for treatment of cyanide poisoning in pregnant patients.

### Acute respiratory distress after exposure to chlorine dioxide-based disinfectant [^f45566ca]. Occupational Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

A hospital cleaner developed acute respiratory distress after working with a chlorine dioxide-based disinfectant. The content of chlorine dioxide in the product is below the limit that would require the product to be labelled as hazardous to health, but we show with a simple estimation that the relevant threshold limit values for chlorine dioxide in the working atmosphere may be exceeded under normal use of the product. This may have implications for risk assessment of the use of such chlorine dioxide-based disinfectants and may warrant stricter regulations for labelling these products.

### Mitigation of chlorine lung injury by increasing cyclic AMP levels [^6dd65e93]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2010). Low credibility.

Chlorine is considered a chemical threat agent to which humans may be exposed as a result of accidental or intentional release. Chlorine is highly reactive, and inhalation of the gas causes cellular damage to the respiratory tract, inflammation, pulmonary edema, and airway hyperreactivity. Drugs that increase intracellular levels of the signaling molecule cyclic AMP (cAMP) may be useful for treatment of acute lung injury through effects on alveolar fluid clearance, inflammation, and airway reactivity. This article describes mechanisms by which cAMP regulates cellular processes affecting lung injury and discusses the basis for investigating drugs that increase cAMP levels as potential treatments for chlorine-induced lung injury. The effects of beta(2)-adrenergic agonists, which stimulate cAMP synthesis, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, which inhibit cAMP degradation, on acute lung injury are reviewed, and the relative advantages of these approaches are compared.

Chemical irritants and choking agents — exposure features and initial care include that the irritants and corrosives include common chemicals such as ammonia, bromine, and chlorine, which can affect the skin, eyes, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal tract, and predominantly, the upper and lower respiratory tracts; decontamination includes copious water irrigation of the skin and eyes, management is mainly supportive, and the risk of delayed pulmonary injury remains for 24 hours, with a noted report that the Assad regime in Syria has used chlorine gas against civilians, causing at least 1 pediatric death. Choking agents are described as producing delayed pulmonary injury with immediate eye symptoms; most choking agents are heavier than air, which could produce higher concentrations at the breathing level of the child, and treatment is supportive.

### Do corticosteroids have a role in preventing or reducing acute toxic lung injury caused by inhalation of chemical agents? [^81a7f144]. Clinical Toxicology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the evidence that treatment with corticosteroids improves the outcome in those exposed to lung-damaging agents.

Methods

We searched Pubmed, Toxnet, Cochrane database, Google Scholar, and Embase from 1966 to January 2010 using the search terms "steroid", "corticosteroid", "lung injury", "lung damage", and "inhalation". These searches identified 287 papers of which 118 contained information on animal studies. However, most were reviews or case reports and only a few were controlled animal experiments of which 13 were considered relevant. ROLE OF CORTICOSTEROIDS:

Animal Studies

Corticosteroids have no beneficial effect at the alveolar level on acute lung injury, which is caused by inhalation of poorly water-soluble compounds (e.g. nitrogen dioxide, ozone, phosgene) or following severe exposure to water-soluble compounds (e.g. chlorine, ammonia). In the recovery phase, corticosteroids may even be harmful, because corticosteroids hamper the division of type II alveolar cells and hamper the differentiation from type II into type I alveolar cells. The latter is important for the re-epithelialization of the alveolus and removal of excess of water in the alveolus. Furthermore, the quality of animal studies does not always allow extrapolation to human exposures. Differences between humans and animals in anatomy, pulmonary defense systems, breathing physiology, as well as the way the animals have been exposed, and the timing and route of corticosteroids in animal studies make predictions difficult. ROLE OF CORTICOSTEROIDS:

Human Studies

An abundance of uncontrolled case reports and a few human crossover studies have evaluated the outcome of human volunteers exposed to various lung-damaging agents. Only a few reports contained systematic information on corticosteroid treatment. Data on the efficacy of corticosteroids after human exposure to lung-damaging agents are inconclusive. Often the number of patients involved is small or the severity of exposure is unclear or not well determined. These reports are therefore limited in their ability to establish a cause-effect relationship for the treatments involved. In some studies involving mild to moderate exposure to water-soluble agents (e.g. chlorine, ammonia), corticosteroid treatment was beneficial for some physiological parameters, such as airway resistance or arterial oxygen tension. However, severe lung injury and inflammation appear not to be improved by corticosteroid treatment. The optimal duration of treatment to obtain these beneficial effects has not been assessed adequately, but it only seems to be useful in the first hours after exposure. Generally, studies evaluating exposure to water-soluble compounds have too short a follow-up, which hampers the evaluation of the efficacy of corticosteroid treatment. The results of studies with longer follow-up suggest that the initial slight improvement in some variables is lost several hours after exposure.

Conclusions

Clinical data on the efficacy of corticosteroids after human exposure to lung-damaging agents are inconclusive as the number of well-structured controlled studies is small and the indications for administration of corticosteroids are unclear. There have been no human controlled studies of high-dose exposure to lung-damaging agents. Furthermore, treatment with corticosteroids is limited by the potential side effects, such as prolonged neuromuscular weakness, deregulation of glucose metabolism, superinfection, and sepsis, which could diminish the chances for recovery.

### Myocardial infarction, acute ischemic stroke, and hyperglycemia triggered by acute chlorine gas inhalation [^723e81b3]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Chlorine is one of the most common substances involved in toxic inhalation. Until now, several accidental exposures have been reported. The damage to the respiratory tract in the immediate phase after exposure to chlorine is well defined. Death occurs particularly due to pulmonary edema with respiratory failure and circulatory collapse. On the other hand, no association with myocardial infarction, acute stroke, severe hyperglycemia, and acute chlorine inhalation has been reported in literature. In the present study, an elderly (74-year-old) and diabetic case with myocardial infarction, acute stroke, hyperglycemia, and respiratory failure associated with acute chlorine intoxication after a diagnosis of acute chlorine poisoning and treatment in the emergency department is reported and the literature is revisited. Physicians should know that in elderly patients with a systemic disease who apply with chlorine gas inhalation, more serious complications along with damage in respiratory tract might be observed.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^eea4ea89]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma in athletes — clinical features and management: Athletes, particularly those competing at a high level, have an increased prevalence of various respiratory conditions compared to non-athletes, including asthma, EIB, allergic or non-allergic rhinitis, chronic cough, inducible laryngeal obstruction, and recurrent respiratory infections; airway hyperresponsiveness is common in elite athletes, often without reported symptoms, and asthma in elite athletes is commonly characterized by less correlation between symptoms and pulmonary function, higher lung volumes and expiratory flows, less eosinophilic airway inflammation, more difficulty in controlling symptoms, and some improvement in airway dysfunction after cessation of training. Preventive measures to avoid high exposure to air pollutants, allergens (if sensitized) and chlorine in pools during training should be discussed; they should avoid training in extreme cold or pollution (Evidence C), document the effects of therapeutic trials, use adequate anti-inflammatory therapy — especially ICS — and minimize use of beta2 agonists to help avoid the development of tolerance.

### Complications of chlorine inhalation in a pediatric chemical burn patient: a case report [^57ad6dec]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2012). Low credibility.

The majority of burn injuries in the pediatric population occur at home, and a significant proportion are the result of exposure to household cleaning products. A common injury-causing agent is bleach, which has the potential to release chlorine gas, a potent respiratory irritant that leads to the added risk of inhalation injury. The survival of pediatric patients with chemical burns is extremely high, and the 3 strongest predictors of mortality are large burn size, age < 48 months, and the presence of inhalation injury. The authors present a rare case of a pediatric fatality from a chemical bleach burn that resulted in acute respiratory distress syndrome as well as hemodynamic and pulmonary instability that required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The authors critically appraised the management of this patient to determine the possible effect certain events had on the unexpected and poor outcome of this patient, including fluid resuscitation, the effect of the chemical inhalation injury, sedation, and the need for invasive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation life support.

### Nontuberculosis Mycobacterium infections in orthopaedic surgery: review of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment guidelines [^29fbaa05]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Occupational Exposure

While there are over 170 species in the Mycobacterium genus, most being nontuberculosis, only a few account for human infections. These include but are not limited to species such as Mycobacterium abscessus, M fortuitum, M chelonae, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), M intracellulare, M chimera, M marinum, M ulcerans, M kansasii, and M smegmatis. Most NTM species can be easily isolated from the environment, including soil, plants, water, animals, and birds. Engineered water systems, including treatment centers and distribution and building plumbing, are major reservoirs for NTM. These organisms survive within biofilms through the drinking water system and have innate resistance to chlorine at concentrations typically found in tap water. However, linking NTM infections to a certain source is challenging because of delayed presentations after exposure, delayed diagnosis, and the lack of standardized methods for genotyping the various strains. Complete elimination of these organisms during drinking water treatment might not be possible with current water treatment strategies. Regarding risk reduction for individuals, temperatures > 50°C (125° F) are sufficient to inactivate some NTM. For MAC, temperatures > 65°C (149° F) are required to inhibit growth. Both temperatures exceed safety guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Even with higher water heater temperatures, NTM can still survive in the cold water system.

In addition to drinking water, a study by Strollo et alfound an increased incidence of NTM cases in states with oceanic coastlines, which encompass approximately 70% of annual NTM cases. Organisms can grow in fresh, brackish, and salt waters. Of additional concern is potential contamination in hospital plumbing systems, which can lead to life-threatening nosocomial infections. This extensive risk can be seen in a study by Carson et al, which found NTM contamination of the incoming city water in 83% of hemodialysis centers in the United States. However, this study failed to report whether these contaminations led to any nosocomial infections. Nosocomial infections can also be seen with a lack of appropriate disinfection or sterilization of reusable medical equipment, and this risk is also growing because of resistance to antiseptics and disinfectants. Numerous global studies have also shown a lack of compliance with standardized disinfection and sterilization guidelines, which has led to numerous outbreaks.

may occur at high concentrations. After acute exposure, pulmonary function usually returns toward baseline within 7 to 14 days. Although complete recovery generally occurs, symptoms and prolonged pulmonary impairment may persist. Exposure to chlorine can lead to reactive airways dysfunction syndrome, a chemical irritant-induced type of asthma. others require decontamination as described below. If exposure levels are determined to be safe, decontamination may be conducted by personnel wearing a lower level of protection than that worn in the Hot Zone. Quickly access for a patent airway, ensure adequate respiration and pulse. Stabilize the cervical spine with a collar and a backboard if trauma is suspected. Administer. oxygen as required and establish intravenous access if necessary. Place on a cardiac monitor. Watch for signs of airway swelling and obstruction such as progressive hoarseness, stridor, or cyanosis.

Continue irrigating exposed skin and eyes, as appropriate. In cases of respiratory compromise secure airway and respiration via endotracheal intubation. Avoid. Previously decontaminated patients and patients exposed only to chlorine gas who have no skin or eye irritation may be transferred immediately to the Critical Care Area. All others require decontamination as described below. Evaluate and support airway, breathing, and circulation. Children may be more vulnerable to corrosive agents than adults because of the smaller diameter of their. airways. In cases of respiratory compromise secure airway and respiration via endotracheal intubation. If not possible, surgically secure an airway. Treat patients who have bronchospasm with aerosolized bronchodilators. The use of bronchial sensitizing agents in situations of multiple chemical exposures may pose.

Asymptomatic patients and those who experienced only minor sensations of burning of the nose, throat, eyes, and respiratory tract may be released. In most cases, these patients will be free of symptoms in an hour or less. They should be advised to seek medical care promptly if symptoms develop or recur (see the Chlorine-Patient. There is no antidote for chlorine, but its effects can be treated and most exposed persons get well. Persons who have experienced serious symptoms may need to be hospitalized. A single small exposure from which a person recovers quickly is not likely to cause delayed or long-term effects. After a serious exposure, symptoms may.

### Updated review of reported cases of reactive airways dysfunction syndrome [^5dfd3257]. Occupational Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

A previous systematic review of the diagnosis of reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS), undertaken from 1985 to 2004, found a lack of standardization of case reporting, thus misattribution of symptoms can occur.

Aims

We aimed to update the systematic review, update the list of reported causes and see whether a more structured approach to reporting has been adopted.

Methods

We undertook a systematic literature review, using the databases EMBASE and Ovid MEDLINE, with search terms 'reactive airways dysfunction syndrome' or 'asthma AND acute irritant', and reported according to PRISMA guidelines. We included papers and abstracts published from January 2005 to September 2019, and articles were grouped by the presence or absence of diagnostic features: 'definite' RADS (met Brooks' criteria) or 'possible' RADS (Brooks' criteria not met or insufficient data). We collected demographic and diagnostic data for cases, where given.

Results

Eleven papers and six conference abstracts met the inclusion criteria, 13 of which were case series or reports, and comprised 752 cases in total; seven articles met Brooks' criteria for RADS diagnosis. A variety of agents were implicated, with chlorine or chlorine-releasing molecules most frequently reported.

Conclusions

A lack of standardized reporting of RADS remains. The majority of published articles and conference abstracts either do not meet, or contain insufficient data to judge against, Brooks' criteria, particularly in relation to onset of symptoms and bronchial hyper-reactivity or variability of airflow obstruction. Some novel agents are described, in keeping with recognized structural taxonomies.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^4cda09ad]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Radiation exposure — patient safety and EMS clinician risk — Treat life-threatening medical problems and traumatic injuries prior to assessing for and treating radiation injuries or performing decontamination. Irradiated patients pose no threat to medical clinicians, and contaminated patients pose very little threat to medical clinicians who use appropriate PPE including N95 masks or respirators, gloves, gowns, and face and eye protection. In general, trauma patients who have been exposed to or contaminated by radiation should be triaged and treated based on the severity of their conventional injuries. A patient who is contaminated with radioactive material generally poses a minimal exposure risk to medical personnel, although should not be placed in a contained space before decontamination.

### Pneumomediastinum from acute inhalation of chlorine gas in 2 young patients [^98b554d5]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Trichloroisocyanuric acid is a high-efficiency and-low toxicity fungicide and bleach. It is commonly used as disinfectant for industrial circulating water, swimming pools, restaurants, and other public places in China. When trichloroisocyanuric acid is put into water, chlorine gas is produced. Chlorine gas is a potent pulmonary irritant that causes acute damage in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts (J Toxicol Clin Toxicol. 1998;36(1–2):87–93). Pneumomediastinum is a rare complication in patients with acute chlorine gas poisoning. A small amount of gas can be asymptomatic, but a large amount of gas entering the mediastinum suddenly will lead to respiratory and circulatory disorder, mediastinal swing, or even cardiopulmonary arrest. Severe chlorine gas poisoning patients usually need mechanical ventilation; if the pneumomediastinum is not found on time, threat to life would be greatly increased. It requires a high index of suspicion for diagnosis and rapid treatment. The proper use of ventilator, timely and effective treatment of original disease, and multiple system organ support had significant impact on the prognosis. The pneumomediastinum case secondary to inhalation of chlorine gas that we report here should remind all emergency department physicians to maintain a high index of suspicion for this disease and seek immediate and proper intervention when treating patients with acute chlorine gas poisoning, once diagnosed, especially in younger patients.

Phosgene (COCl2) exposure — clinical effects and toxic dose thresholds are described, noting that it "caused the greatest number of chemical deaths during World War I", and that "Those exposed develop ALI/ARDS after an initial asymptomatic latent period". Phosgene (CG) is "produced globally in large quantities", with concern for mass-casualty releases. "Histologic damage occurs at doses greater than 30 ppm·min, and clinical pulmonary edema becomes evident above 150 ppm·min. The estimated human LD50 is 500 ppm·min". There are "no proven therapeutic strategies or evidence-based guidelines" for CG injury. Two mechanisms are proposed: hydrolysis to hydrochloric acid (HCl) is "unlikely" because "insufficient HCl is produced" to overcome lung buffering, while as a "highly electrophilic, hydrophobic gas", CG "penetrates readily into the lower respiratory tract", reacts with nucleophilic tissue components via acylation (primary/secondary amines, hydroxyl, sulfhydryl), leading to "release of arachidonic acid mediators such as leukotrienes", "up-regulation of oxidative response enzymes", disruption of the "alveolar–capillary interface" with movement of "fluid and inflammatory cells into the alveoli", and "lipid peroxidation and surfactant damage".

### Chlorine gas inhalation: human clinical evidence of toxicity and experience in animal models [^80a02957]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2010). Low credibility.

Humans can come into contact with chlorine gas during short-term, high-level exposures due to traffic or rail accidents, spills, or other disasters. By contrast, workplace and public (swimming pools, etc.) exposures are more frequently long-term, low-level exposures, occasionally punctuated by unintentional transient increases. Acute exposures can result in symptoms of acute airway obstruction including wheezing, cough, chest tightness, and/or dyspnea. These findings are fairly nonspecific, and might be present after exposures to a number of inhaled chemical irritants. Clinical signs, including hypoxemia, wheezes, rales, and/or abnormal chest radiographs may be present. More severely affected individuals may suffer acute lung injury (ALI) and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Up to 1% of exposed individuals die. Humidified oxygen and inhaled beta-adrenergic agents are appropriate therapies for victims with respiratory symptoms while assessments are underway. Inhaled bicarbonate and systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids also have been reported anecdotally to be beneficial. Chronic sequelae may include increased airways reactivity, which tends to diminish over time. Airways hyperreactivity may be more of a problem among those survivors that are older, have smoked, and/or have pre-existing chronic lung disease. Individuals suffering from irritant-induced asthma (IIA) due to workplace exposures to chlorine also tend to have similar characteristics, such as airways hyperresponsiveness to methacholine, and to be older and to have smoked. Other workplace studies, however, have indicated that workers exposed to chlorine dioxide/sulfur dioxide have tended to have increased risk for chronic bronchitis and/or recurrent wheezing attacks (one or more episodes) but not asthma, while those exposed to ozone have a greater incidence of asthma. Specific biomarkers for acute and chronic exposures to chlorine gas are currently lacking. Animal models for chlorine gas inhalation have demonstrated evidence of oxidative injury and inflammation. Early epithelial injury, airways hyperresponsiveness, and airway remodeling, likely diminishing over time, have been shown. As in humans, ALI/ARDS can occur, becoming more likely when the upper airways are bypassed. Inhalation models of chlorine toxicity provide unique opportunities for testing potential pharmacologic rescue agents.

### Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in children: Delphi study and consensus document about definition and epidemiology, diagnostic work-up, treatment, and follow-up [^b09e9337]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

EIB can be particularly present in endurance athletes because of the high intensity and frequency of training. In these subject EIB is primarily associated with the significant increased minute ventilation through mouth breathing (bypassing nasal filtration) and with the exposure to external factors such as cold temperature (like for athletes involved in winter sports), pollutants, chlorine (like for swimmers) or allergens (like athletes of indoor sports sensitized to house dust mite). Regarding winter sports, the prevalence of asthma and EIB in cross-country skiers increases with age and higher prevalence has been identified in athletes with longer history of competitions. The increased risk of EIB in subjects practicing winter sports could be attributed to the greater inhalation of cold air during training and competitions that favors bronchoconstriction according to the "osmolar theory" (see Pathogenesis section) as demonstrated by a reported prevalence of EIB in summer sports of 23%, and in winter sports of 55%. On the other hand, in physical activities performed on ice surfaces like hockey or figure skating, the increased release of pollen from fossil-fueled ice resurfacing machines and the presence of ultrafine particles from polishing machines on ice rinks used by the players can increase the risk of EIB. Swimming, traditionally considered a safe sport for asthmatic patients, may also be associated with EIB. This risk for EIB has been explained by the "pool chlorine hypothesis" that associates the exposure to chlorine and organic chlorine products used for pool disinfection, such as trichloramine, with development of EIB in certain subjects. On the contrary, other data suggested that pool swimmers may have some protection against bronchoconstriction. Hence, the hypothesis regarding chlorinated pools remains debated and long-term studies are required to definitively determine whether chlorinated swimming pools plays any role in the development of EIB.

Methods

Study Design and Participants

We retrospectively recruited 110 HCWs with COVID-19 at Tongji Hospital from January 1 to February 9, 2020. Exposure, epidemiologic, demographic information was retrospectively collected by a structured questionnaire, and the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic information was collected from electronic medical records. First-line HCWs were defined as those who worked in fever clinics or wards and provided direct care to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Non–first-line HCWs were defined as those who attended patients in general (ie, patients without COVID-19).

To detect the prevalence of subclinical infection of asymptomatic HCWs, we actively screened 335 HCWs at Tongji Hospital. The screened HCWs comprised 135 staff members (40.3%) from fever clinics or wards and 200 staff (59.7%) from other departments. Participants were randomly selected according to their staff identification numbers. The study was approved by the Tongji Hospital research ethics committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. All collected data were securely stored in a database. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Personal Protective Equipment and Environmental Cleansing Protocols

The personal protective equipment (PPE) used in low-contagion areas included surgical masks (equivalent to ASTM level 2), latex gloves and gowns (equivalent to AAMI level 2), and disposable round caps. The PPE used in the high-contagion areas included fit-tested particulate respirators (equivalent to an N95 mask), long-sleeved gowns (equivalent to AAMI level 4), goggles, disposable round caps, latex gloves, and shoe covers. The detailed environmental cleaning protocols were as follows: (1) a chlorine dioxide air disinfection machine was used 4 times a day for 2 hours at a time for air disinfection in wards with patients; (2) empty wards were irradiated with UV light once a day for 1 hour; (3) chlorine dioxide (500 mg/L) was sprayed with an ultra-low volume sprayer for air disinfection in public areas, with a dose of 20 to 30 mL/m 3; and (4) surfaces of environmental objects were wrapped with chlorine-containing disinfection solution (1000 mg/L) twice a day. The environmental samples were collected after disinfection.

### Exercise recommendations and practical considerations for asthma management-an EAACI position paper [^5c737f38]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

4.4 Environmental Factors and Considerations

The environment in which exercise is undertaken is an important consideration for people with asthma on the basis that V E in excess of 30 L/min results in a shift in breathing pattern from almost exclusive nasal airflow to combined oral and nasal airflow. As a result, the lower airways are exposed to a greater quantity of unconditioned air and potential deposition of airborne allergens and other inhaled noxious particles during moderate to vigorous‐intensity exercise. Environmental factors that can trigger or worsen asthma symptoms include changes in meteorological conditions, the composition of inhaled air, which may contain high concentrations of chemical components (e.g. trichloramines in chlorinated swimming pools), air pollutants (i.e. various types and sizes of particulate matter [PM], ozone [O 3], nitrogen dioxide [NO 2], sulphur dioxide SO 2), and airborne allergens. The atmospheric temperature is also relevant given increased exposure to dry cold air is a common cause of EIB in a significant proportion of people with asthma. Whilst inhalation of warm humid air is typically considered to be less 'asthmogenic', breathing hot air has been shown to increase airway resistance via the cholinergic reflex pathway and potential activation of airway C‐fibres (i.e. acting to provoke bronchoconstriction and cough).

Of particular concern for individuals with asthma engaging in exercise is the ongoing climate change crisis as the pollen season is projected to occur earlier in the year and for longer durations, with heatwaves, landscape fires, and episodic air pollution also expected to occur more frequently. It is generally considered that the benefits of regular exercise outweigh the health risks associated with air pollution in the general population; however, individuals with asthma are at risk of EIB or exacerbation and therefore strategies need to be considered on an individual basis and incorporated as part of a personalised asthma management plan to negate the potential adverse effects of environmental exposures during exercise (Table 4).

### An official American Thoracic Society workshop report: chemical inhalational disasters. biology of lung injury, development of novel therapeutics, and medical preparedness [^469ae590]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2017). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society workshop on toxic inhalational lung injury — goals and principal findings emphasize that the goals were to provide a forum to review the evidence supporting current standard medical therapies, present updates on epidemiology and underlying pathophysiology, discuss innovative approaches to delineate mechanisms and identify new specific therapeutic targets, discuss promising novel medical countermeasures, facilitate collaborative research efforts, and identify challenges and future directions in the ongoing development, manufacture, and distribution of effective and specific medical countermeasures. Although general supportive therapies extrapolated from treatment of clinical syndromes including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), reactive airways dysfunction (RADS), and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) remain the mainstay of treatment for toxic inhalational lung injuries, a better understanding of basic pathophysiology has led to the discovery of novel specific therapeutic targets and promising new compounds in development. Novel antidotes of particular interest in preclinical large-animal models include R-107, a novel antioxidant countermeasure for inhalational chlorine toxicity, agents for the treatment of cyanide poisoning, and intratracheal tissue plasminogen factor to counter toxic airway effects of sulfur mustard (SM) inhalation.

Environment and disinfection of equipment

Open the windows two to four times a day for more than 30 min each time in occupied rooms. If necessary, use fans to mechanically enhance air flow, or use a circulating ultraviolet air disinfection machine for disinfection. Disinfect unoccupied rooms by ultraviolet light once a day for more than 1 hour each time. Windowless rooms and storage rooms should be regularly ventilated and disinfected with ultraviolet light. Due to the positive pressure generated by the laminar flow, the contaminated air may be transmitted to the clean area. Therefore, the laminar flow system should be closed in high-incidence areas, and the windows should be opened for ventilation. The floor and corridors of the ward can be wiped or sprayed with disinfectant (chlorine concentration of 1000 mg/L) twice a day. If the surface and the floor of environmental objects are contaminated with patient excretions, secretions, vomit and so on, first, remove the visible pollutant with disposable absorbent materials such as paper towels; second, cover the area with a towel soaked in 2000 mg/L chlorine disinfectant for 30 min; and third, wipe clean. The surfaces of the frequently contacted objects (such as bed rails, bed head boards, bed end boards, tables, pagers, monitors, door handles) in the wards should be wiped and disinfected two to three times a day with a 1000 mg/L chlorine disinfectant. Stethoscopes, infusion pumps, sphygmomanometers and other commonly used items should be thoroughly wiped and disinfected with a 1000 mg/L chlorine disinfectant or paper towels containing peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide after each use.

Pollutant disposal

In hospitals equipped with a sewage treatment system, patient excretions, secretions, vomit and so on can be directly discharged into the sewage pond after increasing the dosage of sewage disinfectant to ensure that the residual chlorine content is greater than 6.5 mL/L. Bed sheets and quilts used by patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 can be sterilised by circulating steam or boiling for 30 min; or soaked in 500 mg/L chlorine-containing disinfectant for 30 min and then routinely sterilised; or sealed with orange-soluble packaging exclusively used for medical supplies and transported to the washing centre (keeping a record of handover). After each discharge, the ward should be thoroughly disinfected.

### An official ATS clinical practice guideline: interpretation of exhaled nitric oxide levels (FENO) for clinical applications [^b700c265]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

Allergen exposure and persistently high FENO — recommendation and considerations: We recommend accounting for persistent and/or high allergen exposure as a factor associated with higher levels of FENO (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Persistently high FENO (> 50 ppb in adults, 35 ppb in children) may result from poor adherence to ICS therapy, poor inhaled drug delivery, or continued exposure to allergen, and continuing or increasing exposure to aeroallergens may result in a rise in FENO or the persistence of an elevated FENO; the magnitude of the effect may be sufficient for FENO levels to increase beyond the cut point of 50 ppb, even in the absence of respiratory symptoms. However, if the patient is asymptomatic and has a high FENO, then no change in treatment is required, and levels greater than 50 ppb in a well-treated asymptomatic patient may be "normal" for that specific patient.

### Practice recommendations in the diagnosis, management, and prevention of carbon monoxide poisoning [^e510fd18]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is common in modern society, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality in the United States annually. Over the past two decades, sufficient information has been published about carbon monoxide poisoning in the medical literature to draw firm conclusions about many aspects of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and clinical management of the syndrome, along with evidence-based recommendations for optimal clinical practice. This article provides clinical practice guidance to the pulmonary and critical care community regarding the diagnosis, management, and prevention of acute CO poisoning. The article represents the consensus opinion of four recognized content experts in the field. Supporting data were drawn from the published, peer-reviewed literature on CO poisoning, placing emphasis on selecting studies that most closely mirror clinical practice.
