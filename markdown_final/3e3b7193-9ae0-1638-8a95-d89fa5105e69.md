## Question

64 yo F with severe rheumatoid arthritis (on weekly methotrexate and daily folic acid) presents with new atrial fibrillation; home meds include amlodipine, simvastatin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (for recent UTI, started 2 days ago). INR today is 1.0, renal function normal. Cardiology recommends starting warfarin now at 5 mg nightly. Is it safe to start standard-dose warfarin?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is safe to start standard-dose warfarin in a 64-year-old woman with severe rheumatoid arthritis who is taking weekly methotrexate with daily folic acid, and who just started trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 2 days ago for a UTI, with normal renal function and an INR of 1.0. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the indication for anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation and the baseline bleeding risk. Then, I should verify the major drug–drug interactions, especially trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole with warfarin and with methotrexate. Next, I will consider pharmacogenetic and age-related warfarin sensitivity, and whether a standard 5 mg load is appropriate. After that, I need to outline a safer initiation strategy with close INR monitoring. Finally, I should evaluate alternatives like DOACs and synthesize a practical, risk-mitigated plan with clear checkpoints and contingencies.

> Let me first confirm the indication and baseline risk. New-onset atrial fibrillation in a 64-year-old woman carries elevated stroke risk, and contemporary guidelines recommend anticoagulation when the CHA2DS2-VASc score indicates an annual thromboembolic risk of at least 2% in men or 3% in women, which is typically met at CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women, so anticoagulation is indicated unless contraindicated [^754f89b5] [^f8863fc1].

> Wait, let me verify the key drug–drug interaction. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a classic potentiator of warfarin via inhibition of CYP2C9–mediated metabolism of S-warfarin, with multiple FDA labels explicitly warning that co-administration prolongs prothrombin time and increases bleeding risk, and that coagulation should be reassessed frequently when these agents are combined [^fb28098a] [^9afa0903] [^a4653fdb]. Hold on, I should also confirm the mechanism and magnitude; authoritative reviews list trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole among the most impactful warfarin interactants, reinforcing the need for proactive dose adjustment and intensified INR monitoring rather than a standard loading dose [^932b3cef] [^a559a3d1].

> I need to check the methotrexate piece carefully. Methotrexate is a folate antagonist and trimethoprim is a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor; co-administration can increase methotrexate toxicity, particularly myelosuppression, even though both are used with folic acid supplementation in RA. Guidelines advise avoiding the combination when possible or using heightened vigilance with closer CBC monitoring if unavoidable [^6fbd151c] [^e7b7a94e]. Let me reconsider the timing; she started TMP-SMX 2 days ago, so the interaction with warfarin is already in play and the methotrexate risk is present, even if folic acid mitigates some adverse effects [^6fbd151c].

> Next, I should review warfarin sensitivity factors. Age over 65, female sex, and genetic variation in CYP2C9 and VKORC1 can all increase warfarin sensitivity, making a 5 mg daily starting dose potentially excessive in many older adults even without interacting drugs; pharmacogenetic guidance and clinical algorithms consistently support lower initial doses and slower titration in sensitive phenotypes, which argues against a fixed 5 mg load here [^0d1d52a5] [^d4e3b4eb]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies at initiation; yes, initiation in older adults often starts at 2–3 mg with careful titration to avoid overshooting INR, especially with interacting drugs on board [^notfound].

> I will now examine a safer initiation strategy. Given the potent CYP2C9 inhibition from TMP-SMX, I should start warfarin at a reduced dose, for example 2.5 mg daily, and plan INR checks every 2–3 days for the first week, then every 3–5 days until stable, with a low threshold to withhold or reduce dose if INR rises too quickly. This aligns with interaction-management principles that emphasize closer monitoring and dose adjustment rather than fixed loading when interacting drugs cannot be avoided [^8526a563] [^b54ebbe0]. But wait, what if rapid anticoagulation is needed? If there is truly urgent need, bridging with a parenteral agent is preferred over aggressive warfarin loading, which is safer than risking supratherapeutic INR and bleeding with a high initial warfarin dose in this context [^c1519da4].

> Let me consider alternatives. DOACs are generally preferred over warfarin in nonvalvular AF due to lower intracranial hemorrhage and mortality, fewer food and drug interactions, and no routine lab monitoring, so switching to apixaban or rivaroxaban would bypass the CYP2C9 interaction entirely and simplify management here [^f8863fc1] [^79f0e575]. I should confirm there is no mechanical valve or moderate-to-severe rheumatic mitral stenosis, which would make warfarin mandatory; if none are present, a DOAC is reasonable and may be safer than navigating warfarin with TMP-SMX on board [^e04ac92d].

> Hold on, I should verify the methotrexate monitoring plan if we proceed with TMP-SMX. I would obtain a baseline CBC and liver panel, repeat CBC within a week of starting TMP-SMX, and reassess liver enzymes given the hepatotoxic potential of methotrexate and the added folate antagonism from trimethoprim; if there is any decline in counts or rise in transaminases, I would hold methotrexate and reassess the antibiotic choice [^6fbd151c] [^e7b7a94e]. Let me double-check that folic acid timing does not mitigate this specific interaction; it reduces methotrexate adverse effects but does not eliminate the additive antifolate toxicity risk with trimethoprim, so monitoring remains essential [^6fbd151c].

> Putting this together, I should conclude clearly. Starting standard-dose warfarin at 5 mg nightly in this 64-year-old with new AF who just began TMP-SMX is not safe because of the high likelihood of rapid INR elevation and bleeding from CYP2C9 inhibition, compounded by age-related warfarin sensitivity. A safer approach is to start warfarin at 2.5 mg daily with frequent INR monitoring, or preferably switch to a DOAC to avoid the interaction altogether, while closely monitoring CBC and liver function due to the methotrexate–trimethoprim combination [^fb28098a] [^f8863fc1] [^6fbd151c].

---

It is **not safe** to start standard-dose warfarin (5 mg nightly) in this patient because trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) **potently inhibits CYP2C9** and displaces warfarin from protein binding, which can rapidly elevate INR and increase bleeding risk [^fb28098a] [^932b3cef]. If warfarin is necessary, start at 2.5 mg with INR checks every 2–3 days until stable, and consider a DOAC if no contraindications exist, as DOACs have fewer interactions and do not require INR monitoring [^f8863fc1] [^33340aa1]. Monitor closely for bleeding and adjust therapy as needed.

## Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and warfarin

- **CYP2C9 inhibition**: TMP-SMX inhibits CYP2C9, which metabolizes S-warfarin, increasing warfarin exposure and INR [^fb28098a] [^932b3cef].
- **Protein binding displacement**: TMP-SMX displaces warfarin from albumin, increasing free warfarin and anticoagulant effect [^notfound].
- **Clinical evidence**: Multiple reports and labels document INR prolongation and bleeding with concomitant use, necessitating close INR monitoring and dose adjustment [^fb28098a] [^9afa0903].

---

### Methotrexate and warfarin

Methotrexate has **minimal direct interaction** with warfarin; however, both can cause hepatotoxicity and myelosuppression, so combined use warrants monitoring of liver function and blood counts [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **ACC/AHA/ACCP 2024 guidelines**: Recommend DOACs over warfarin for AF due to fewer interactions, less monitoring, and lower intracranial bleeding risk; use warfarin only when DOACs are contraindicated or unavailable [^f8863fc1] [^79f0e575].
- **CHEST 2012 guidelines**: When interacting drugs are used with warfarin, increase INR monitoring frequency and adjust dose based on trends; avoid fixed-dose adjustments due to variable responses [^8526a563].
- **FDA warnings**: TMP-SMX with warfarin requires frequent INR checks and dose adjustment due to interaction risk [^fb28098a] [^9afa0903].

---

## Recommended management strategy

Given the **high risk of INR elevation and bleeding**, avoid starting standard-dose warfarin with TMP-SMX. Consider the following:

| **Option** | **Recommendation** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran) | Preferred if no contraindications | - Fewer interactions <br/> - No INR monitoring <br/> - Lower ICH risk [^f8863fc1] [^79f0e575] |
| Warfarin (if DOACs contraindicated) | Start 2.5 mg with INR every 2–3 days until stable | - Reduced initial dose <br/> - Close monitoring mitigates interaction risk [^8526a563] [^b54ebbe0] |
| Alternative antibiotic | Consider non-interacting options (e.g. beta-lactams) if clinically appropriate | Avoids interaction altogether [^8526a563] |

---

## Monitoring and patient counseling

- **INR monitoring**: Check INR every 2–3 days after initiation, then weekly until stable, and after any medication changes [^notfound].
- **Bleeding precautions**: Educate on bleeding signs and when to seek care.
- **Methotrexate monitoring**: Continue routine CBC and LFTs; watch for additive hematologic or hepatic toxicity [^a2ffd6b2].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Starting standard-dose warfarin with TMP-SMX is **unsafe** due to the risk of rapid INR elevation and bleeding. Prefer a DOAC if eligible; if warfarin is necessary, start at 2.5 mg with frequent INR monitoring, and consider switching the antibiotic when feasible.

Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common autoimmune, destructive, inflammatory arthritis in adults. Effective treatments include oral conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs; eg, methotrexate), injectable biologic DMARDs, and targeted synthetic DMARDs (oral). Key recommendations are to start effective treatment immediately with DMARDs to reduce disability; use effective doses of methotrexate (oral or subcutaneous) with folic acid as the initial treatment; rapidly escalate treatment with various DMARDs, if methotrexate alone is not effective in controlling rheumatoid arthritis; and aim for a treat-to-target strategy with a goal of low disease activity or remission by frequently monitoring disease activity and escalating treatment.

### The patient with atrial fibrillation [^94f053f6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a frequently encountered arrhythmia, particularly affecting the elderly. Patients at significant risk for stroke should be considered for anticoagulation with warfarin. Management of atrial fibrillation revolves around either controlling the ventricular rate response or trying to maintain sinus rhythm with either pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic therapies. There are many treatment options to consider, based upon the patient's expectations, symptoms, and comorbid conditions. Therefore, the treatment of atrial fibrillation must be individualized.

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) initiation — parenteral overlap and discontinuation: When rapid anticoagulant effect is required, a rapidly acting parenteral anticoagulant should be started together with the VKA and discontinued after at least 5 days of concomitant therapy and once the INR has been in the therapeutic range for at least two measurements approximately 24 h apart. If there is no urgent need for an immediate anticoagulant effect, warfarin administration can be commenced without the concurrent use of a rapid-acting anticoagulant.

### A potential interaction between warfarin and atovaquone [^2741435f]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of increased international normalized ratio (INR) in a patient established on warfarin therapy who was then initiated on atovaquone therapy.

Case Summary

A 53-year-old African American male with HIV was prescribed warfarin 5 mg/day for 12 months after diagnosis of idiopathic deep vein thrombosis and bilateral pulmonary emboli (target INR 2.5 [range 2.0–3.0]). The patient required Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia prophylaxis and was prescribed atovaquone instead of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole therapy because of the latter drug's known interaction with warfarin. The patient's INR rose by greater than 50% (from 2.3 to 3.5) after 7 days of concomitant warfarin and atovaquone. In response, the patient's total weekly warfarin dose was decreased by 5%. Eight days later, the patient's INR was still supratherapeutic at 3.1. Approximately 4 weeks later, his INR was 4.2. One dose of warfarin was withheld and then the total weekly warfarin dosage was decreased by another 10%. Eight days later, the patient discontinued atovaquone therapy but continued on warfarin as prescribed. One day after atovaquone discontinuation, his INR decreased to 1.7. Due to this subtherapeutic INR level, 8 days later the total weekly warfarin dose was increased by 5%. Although a follow-up appointment was scheduled, no further INR values were obtained because the patient's 12-month course of anticoagulation therapy was completed and warfarin was discontinued. The patient did not report any adverse effects or signs or symptoms of hemorrhage while his INR values were supratherapeutic.

Discussion

Warfarin's potential for interactions with other highly protein-bound drugs, such as atovaquone, can result in displacement from protein binding sites and increased serum concentrations of warfarin. Based on a search of MEDLINE/PubMed, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and the Food and Drug Administration MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting Program (all through July 31, 2010), no cases were found of an interaction between atovaquone and warfarin. The Horn Drug Interaction Probability Scale calculated this to be a probable interaction between warfarin and atovaquone.

Conclusions

Although current medication references do not report an interaction between atovaquone and warfarin, knowledge of their pharmacodynamic properties can enable practitioners to anticipate the consequences of a possible transient increase in warfarin serum concentration, such as that seen in our patient, when given concomitantly.

### Clinically relevant drug-drug interactions in primary care [^a559a3d1]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Drug interactions are common in the primary care setting and are usually predictable. Identifying the most important and clinically relevant drug interactions in primary care is essential to patient safety. Strategies for reducing the risk of drug-drug interactions include minimizing the number of drugs prescribed, re-evaluating therapy on a regular basis, considering nonpharmacologic options, monitoring for signs and symptoms of toxicity or effectiveness, adjusting dosages of medications when indicated, and adjusting administration times. Inhibition or induction of cytochrome P450 drug metabolizing isoenzymes is the most common mechanism by which clinically important drug interactions occur. The antimicrobials most likely to affect the international normalized ratio significantly in patients receiving warfarin are trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, metronidazole, and fluconazole. An empiric warfarin dosage reduction of 30% to 50% upon initiation of amiodarone therapy is recommended. In patients receiving amiodarone, limit dosages of simvastatin to 20 mg per day and lovastatin to 40 mg per day. Beta blockers should be tapered and discontinued several days before clonidine withdrawal to reduce the risk of rebound hypertension. Spironolactone dosages should be limited to 25 mg daily when coadministered with potassium supplements. Avoid prescribing opioid cough medicines for patients receiving benzodiazepines or other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol. Physicians should consider consultation with a clinical pharmacist when clinical circumstances require the use of drugs with interaction potential.

Warfarin interaction mitigation — The most effective method to avoid adverse outcomes associated with drug interactions is to try to avoid, when feasible, concurrent use of potentially interacting drugs and to use noninteracting alternatives instead; when noninteracting alternatives are not available, adverse outcomes can be avoided by increasing the frequency of monitoring and adjusting warfarin doses based on INR response, and prospective dosing adjustments are inappropriate because of the unpredictable nature of patient response to drug interactions.

### Warfarin pharmacogenetics: to genotype or not to genotype, that is the question [^fae37e1a]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Genotype is well recognized to influence the dose of warfarin necessary for therapeutic anticoagulation. Recent randomized controlled trials evaluating the clinical utility of genotype-guided warfarin dosing have produced varying results. We review the design and results of the recent clinical trials, assess the impact of their findings on warfarin dosing, and examine unanswered questions related to clinical implementation of warfarin pharmacogenetics.

3: Poor documentation:

Patients were often not issued with patient-held information and written dosage instructions at start of therapy, or discharged from hospital without an appointment for next INR measurement or for consultation with appropriate healthcare professional. New referrals to anticoagulation service had incomplete information making appointments more challenging for the haematology team. Patients were affected by reduced quality of anticoagulation leading to potentially life-threatening over or under coagulation.

4: Failure to consider significant pharmacological interactions:

Not enough safe practice had been promoted regarding co-prescribing one or more clinically significant interacting medicines or informing anticoagulant services that an interacting medicine had been prescribed. Co-prescribed medications were frequently not documented on the referral form, with the consequence that the anticoagulation team were unable to identify any potentially dangerous interactions in a timely manner.

### Precision dosing of warfarin: open questions and strategies [^d4e3b4eb]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Warfarin has a very narrow therapeutic window and obvious interindividual variability in its effects, with many factors contributing to the body's response. Algorithms incorporating multiple genetic, environment and clinical factors have been established to select a precision dose for each patient. A number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted to explore whether patients could benefit from these algorithms; however, the results were inconsistent. Some questions remain to be resolved. Recently, new genetic and non-genetic factors have been discovered to contribute to variability in optimal warfarin doses. The results of further RCTs have been unveiled, and guidelines for pharmacogenetically guided warfarin dosing have been updated. Based on these most recent advancements, we summarize some open questions in this field and try to propose possible strategies to resolve them.

### Sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim (sulfamethox-TMP DS) [^fb28098a]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

It has been reported that sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may prolong the prothrombin time in patients who are receiving the anticoagulant warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate). This interaction should be kept in mind when sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is given to patients already on anticoagulant therapy, and the coagulation time should be reassessed.

Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin (a CYP2C9 substrate). Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, given at a common clinical dosage, increased the phenytoin half-life by 39% and decreased the phenytoin metabolic clearance rate by 27%. When administering these drugs concurrently, one should be alert for possible excessive phenytoin effect.

Sulfonamides can also displace methotrexate from plasma protein binding sites and can compete with the renal transport of methotrexate, thus increasing free methotrexate concentrations.

There have been reports of marked but reversible nephrotoxicity with co-administration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim and cyclosporine in renal transplant recipients.

Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim therapy, especially in elderly patients. Serum digoxin levels should be monitored.

Increased sulfamethoxazole blood levels may occur in patients who are also receiving indomethacin.

Occasional reports suggest that patients receiving pyrimethamine as malaria prophylaxis in doses exceeding 25 mg weekly may develop megaloblastic anemia if sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is prescribed.

Complete blood counts should be done frequently in patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim; if a significant reduction in the count of any formed blood element is noted, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should be discontinued. Urinalyses with careful microscopic examination and renal function tests should be performed during therapy, particularly for those patients with impaired renal function.

Drug Interactions

In elderly patients concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported.

It has been reported that sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may prolong the prothrombin time in patients who are receiving the anticoagulant warfarin.

Warfarin drug–drug interactions — scope and key modifiers are outlined: manufacturer labeling lists " > 200 specific agents" that may interfere, yet cross-source concordance is limited with "648 entries" across four sources and "only 50" in common. Pharmacokinetic modifiers include inhibitors of S-warfarin clearance — phenylbutazone, sulfinpyrazone, metronidazole, and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole — which potentiate prothrombin time (PT), while cimetidine and omeprazole act on the R-isomer and "potentiate the PT only modestly"; amiodarone inhibits clearance of both enantiomers and potentiates warfarin anticoagulation. Inducers that reduce effect include barbiturates, rifampin, azathioprine, and carbamazepine, and long-term alcohol consumption increases clearance; enzyme induction evidence considered rifampin and barbiturates "likely" and interactions with carbamazepine, griseofulvin, aminoglutethimide, nafcilin, and dicloxacillin "probable." Pharmacodynamic potentiators include second-generation and third-generation cephalosporins, thyroxine, and clofibrate, and doses of salicylates of " > 1.5 g per day" may augment effect; acetaminophen potentiates with prolonged use in a randomized, blinded trial, and heparin potentiates but in therapeutic doses produces "only a slight prolongation of the PT."

### Warfarin: a case history in pharmacogenetics [^4964ff7f]. Heart (2005). Low credibility.

Both hereditary and environmental factors contribute to inter-individual variability in drug response. The considerable interest in the role of genes has to be balanced with the contribution of external influences. Warfarin provides a useful case study of the need to integrate both genetic and non-genetic information when selecting the right dose for a patient. This article discusses the latest data on genotype and warfarin sensitivity and the efforts to incorporate this information into normograms. Exploring the genetics of warfarin response will lead not only to safer prescribing but elucidate the mechanism of action of warfarin and enable the development of new anticoagulant drugs.

Atrial fibrillation oral anticoagulation efficacy — Meta-analysis using intention-to-treat shows adjusted-dose oral anticoagulation reduces all stroke versus placebo with a risk reduction of 62% (95% CI 48% to 72%). By on-treatment analysis excluding patients not undergoing oral anticoagulation at the time of stroke, the preventive efficacy of oral anticoagulation exceeded 80%. Among the randomized trials, 4 were placebo controlled; of the 2 that were double blinded with regard to anticoagulation, one was stopped early because of external evidence that oral anticoagulation was superior to placebo, and the other included no female subjects. In 3 trials dosing was regulated by prothrombin time ratio; 2 used INR target ranges of 2.5 to 4.0 and 2.0 to 3.0. Follow-up was generally between 1 and 2 y, with the longest 2.2 y.

### New oral anticoagulants: which one should my patient use? [^5885e164]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

The new oral anticoagulants are rapidly replacing warfarin for several indications. In contrast to warfarin, which lowers the functional levels of all of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, the new agents target either factor Xa or thrombin. With targeted inhibition of coagulation, the new oral anticoagulants have pharmacologic and clinical features that distinguish them from warfarin. Focusing on these features, this paper (a) compares the pharmacology of the new oral anticoagulants with that of warfarin (b) identifies the class effects of these drugs and their differentiating features, (c) reviews their current indications, and (d) uses this information to help clinicians make informed decisions regarding the choice of the right anticoagulant for the right patient.

### New oral anticoagulants vs. warfarin treatment: no need for pharmacogenomics? [^004ce726]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

For patients requiring long-term anticoagulation, oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin have overwhelming efficacy data and present significant challenges. In addition to the potential exposure to numerous drug-drug and drug-food interactions, patients receiving warfarin require frequent monitoring. It had been hoped that the integration of pharmacogenomic with clinical information would improve anticoagulation control with warfarin, but trials have not supported this aim. Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) offer both advantages and disadvantages and deserve consideration in appropriate patients.

Drug: Warfarin — mechanism, dosing target, and determinants of dose: Warfarin is administered orally as a racemic mixture of S-warfarin and R-warfarin and specifically inhibits vitamin K epoxide reductase, reducing activation of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X. Warfarin has a narrow therapeutic index with concentration-dependent risks of bleeding or lack of efficacy. Clinically, dosing is tailored to the international normalized ratio with a target INR of 2 to 3 for most indications, and genetic variants along with age, body size, vitamin K intake, comorbidities, and concomitant medications contribute to warfarin sensitivity and dose requirements.

### Optimizing use of current anticoagulants [^59f458bf]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Although warfarin has been the mainstay of oral anticoagulation therapy for decades, evidence-based methods for improving the quality of warfarin therapy remain underused. The arrival of new anticoagulants that do not require routine laboratory monitoring and lack the significant dietary and drug interaction potential that are seen with warfarin is an important evolutionary step in the management of thromboembolic disease. However, it will be years before the efficacy and long-term safety of these new agents are defined. Newer oral anticoagulants will be more expensive than generic warfarin. This article examines various approaches to optimize the clinical use of warfarin. For patients able to achieve stable anticoagulation control, warfarin remains an important therapeutic option, delivering similar clinical outcomes at a fraction of the cost to the health care system.

### Adverse effects of low-dose methotrexate: a randomized trial [^0a3c6c24]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Low-dose methotrexate (LD-MTX) is the most commonly used drug for systemic rheumatic diseases worldwide and is the recommended first-line agent for rheumatoid arthritis. Despite extensive clinical use for more than 30 years, few data on adverse event (AE) rates derive from randomized, placebo-controlled trials, where both causality and magnitude of risk can be inferred.

Objective

To investigate AE rates, risk, and risk differences comparing LD-MTX versus placebo.

Design

Prespecified secondary analyses of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01594333).

Setting

North America.

Participants

Adults with known cardiovascular disease and diabetes or metabolic syndrome.

Intervention

Random allocation to LD-MTX (≤ 20 mg/wk) or placebo. All participants received folic acid, 1 mg/d, 6 days per week.

Measurements

Risks for specific AEs of interest, as well as for all AEs, were compared across treatment groups after blinded adjudication.

Results

After an active run-in period, 6158 patients were enrolled and 4786 randomly assigned to a group; median follow-up was 23 months and median dosage 15 mg/wk. Among the randomly assigned participants, 81.2% were male, median age was 65.7 years, and median body mass index was 31.5 kg/m2. Of 2391 participants assigned to LD-MTX, 2080 (87.0%) had an AE of interest, compared with 1951 of 2395 (81.5%) assigned to placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 1.17 [95% CI, 1.10 to 1.25]). The relative hazards of gastrointestinal (HR, 1.91 [CI, 1.75 to 2.10]), pulmonary (HR, 1.52 [CI, 1.16 to 1.98]), infectious (HR, 1.15 [CI, 1.01 to 1.30]), and hematologic (HR, 1.15 [CI, 1.07 to 1.23]) AEs were elevated for LD-MTX versus placebo. With the exception of increased risk for skin cancer (HR, 2.05 [CI, 1.28 to 3.28]), the treatment groups did not differ in risk for other cancer or mucocutaneous, neuropsychiatric, or musculoskeletal AEs. Renal AEs were reduced in the LD-MTX group (HR, 0.85 [CI, 0.78 to 0.93]).

Limitation

The trial was done in patients without rheumatic disease who tolerated LD-MTX during an active run-in period.

Conclusion

Use of LD-MTX was associated with small to moderate elevations in risks for skin cancer and gastrointestinal, infectious, pulmonary, and hematologic AEs, whereas renal AEs were decreased.

### Warfarin sensitivity: be aware of genetic influence [^1922d6a7]. Age and Ageing (2003). Low credibility.

Background

avoidance of over anticoagulation in response to warfarin therapy would reduce risk of associated bleeding.

Subjects

two elderly patients with venous thromboembolism exhibited extreme anticoagulant response to warfarin. Both were noted to have variant CYP2C9 alleles, which reduce the metabolic capacity of cytochrome P450 2C9.

Discussion

adverse outcomes with warfarin therapy could be explained and possibly avoided by identifying patients with variant alleles for CYP2C9 before initiation of therapy.

### Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim ds [^047510e2]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Drug Interactions

In elderly patients concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily
thiazides, an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been
reported.

It has been reported that sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may prolong the
prothrombin time in patients who are receiving the anticoagulant warfarin. This
interaction should be kept in mind when sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is
given to patients already on anticoagulant therapy, and the coagulation time
should be reassessed.

Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of
phenytoin. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, given at a common clinical dosage,
increased the phenytoin half-life by 39% and decreased the phenytoin metabolic
clearance rate by 27%. When administering these drugs concurrently, one should
be alert for possible excessive phenytoin effect.

Sulfonamides can also displace methotrexate from plasma protein binding sites
and can compete with therenal transport of methotrexate, thus increasing free
methotrexate concentrations. There have been reports of marked but reversible
nephrotoxicity with coadministration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim
andcyclosporine in renal transplant recipients.

Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant sulfamethoxazole
and trimethoprim therapy, especially in elderly patients. Serum digoxin levels
should be monitored.

Increased sulfamethoxazole blood levels may occur in patients who are
receiving indomethacin. Occasional reports suggest that patients receiving
pyrimethamine as malaria prophylaxis in doses exceeding 25 mg weekly may develop
megaloblastic anemia if sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is prescribed.

The efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants can decrease when co-administered
with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Like other sulfonamide-containing drugs,
sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim potentiates the effect of oral hypoglycemics.
In the literature, a single case of toxic delirium has been reported after
concomitant intake of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and amantadine.

In the literature, three cases of hyperkalemia in elderly patients have been
reported after concomitant intake of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and an
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor.8,9

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, specifically the trimethoprim component,
can interfere with a serum methotrexate assay as determined by the competitive
binding protein technique (CBPA) when a bacterial dihydrofolate reductase is
used as the binding protein. No interference occurs, however, if methotrexate is
measured by a radioimmunoassay (RIA).

The presence of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may also interfere with the
Jaffé alkaline picrate reaction assay for creatinine, resulting in
overestimations of about 10% in the range of normal values.

Do not administer to patients who are unable to swallow a tablet.

Methotrexate Tablets is a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures.1

2.2 Recommended Dosage for Neoplastic Diseases

Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia

The recommended starting dosage of Methotrexate Tablets is 20 mg/m2 orally once weekly, as part of a combination chemotherapy maintenance regimen. After initiating Methotrexate Tablets, periodically monitor absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and platelet count and adjust the dose to maintain ANC at a desirable level and for excessive myelosuppression.

Mycosis Fungoides

The recommended dosage of Methotrexate Tablets is 25 to 75 mg orally once weekly when administered as a single agent or 10 mg/m2 orally twice weekly as part of a combination chemotherapy regimen.

Relapsed or Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas

The recommended dosage of Methotrexate Tablets is 2.5 mg orally 2 to 4 times per week (maximum 10 mg per week) as part of a metronomic combination chemotherapy regimen.

2.3 Recommended Dosage for Rheumatoid Arthritis

The recommended starting dosage of Methotrexate Tablets is 7.5 mg orally once weekly with escalation to achieve optimal response. Dosages of more than 20 mg once weekly result in an increased risk of serious adverse reactions, including myelosuppression. When responses are observed, the majority occurred between 3 and 6 weeks from initiation of treatment; however, responses have occurred up to 12 weeks after treatment initiation.

Administer folic acid or folinic acid to reduce the risk of methotrexate adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

### Factor Xa inhibitors vs warfarin for preventing stroke and thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation [^79f0e575]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Is treatment with factor Xa inhibitors associated with better efficacy and safety compared with the vitamin K antagonist warfarin for preventing strokes or other systemic embolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation?

Bottom Line

Compared with warfarin, factor Xa inhibitors are associated with a lower risk of stroke and other systemic embolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation. Factor Xa inhibitors were associated with lower rates of intracranial hemorrhage and mortality compared with warfarin. Factor Xa inhibitors were associated with a reduction in major bleeding events, but there was heterogeneity between the included studies, and the reduction was not statistically significant in a prespecified sensitivity analysis.

### Methotrexate drug interactions in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic review [^57ba47ed]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) often have comorbidities that require multiple medications. Several of these medications may alter the efficacy or increase the toxicity of methotrexate (MTX). The purpose of our study was to determine which drugs used in combination with MTX (excluding disease modifying antirheumatic drugs, folic and folinic acid, corticosteroids, and biologic agents) enhance side effects or toxicity of MTX or lower its efficacy.

Methods

A systematic literature search was performed with Medline, Embase, Cochrane Register and Database, and abstracts from the 2006/2007 annual congresses of the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism. A manual search of the citation lists of retrieved publications was performed.

Results

Of the 1172 articles identified, 67 were included: 21 pharmacokinetics studies, 5 observational studies, and 78 case reports. Most medications do not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics profile of MTX. Among the clinical studies, cytopenia and elevation of liver enzymes were the main reported toxicities. The use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) was mentioned as a risk factor for developing cytopenia in one observational study and in 17 case reports. Thirty case reports of cytopenia were attributed to the use of concomitant nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, including acetylsalicylic acid. Two studies described mild abnormalities of liver enzymes with the use of isoniazid, and one study with the use of high-dose ASA.

Conclusion

Based on the published literature, MTX has limited drug interactions, with the exception of TMP-SMX and high-dose ASA, which can exacerbate toxicity of MTX. The clinical significance of these interactions has not been substantiated by extensive clinical observations.

### Azathioprine-induced warfarin resistance [^0909521e]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe a case of azathioprine-induced warfarin resistance, present a literature review on warfarin-azathioprine interactions, and provide recommendations on appropriate management of this clinically significant interaction.

Case Summary

A 29-year-old female with Cogan's syndrome experienced thrombosis of the left internal carotid artery. She was treated with an average weekly warfarin dose of 39 mg (5.5 mg daily) prior to beginning azathioprine therapy. Three weeks following initiation of azathioprine 150 mg daily, the international normalized ratio (INR) decreased from 1.9 (prior to the medication change) to 1.0 without any change in the warfarin dose or other relevant factors. Over several weeks, the patient's warfarin dose was titrated up to 112 mg weekly (16 mg daily) to achieve an INR of 2.5 (a 188%, or 2.9-fold dose increase). Because of elevated liver enzyme levels, the azathioprine dosage was decreased to 100 mg daily. Within 2 weeks following that decrease, warfarin requirements decreased to 105 mg weekly (15 mg daily).

Discussion

Azathioprine was the probable causative agent of warfarin resistance according to the Naranjo probability scale, and a possible causative agent according to the Drug Interaction Probability Scale. A literature search (PubMed, 1966-December 2007) revealed 8 case reports of this drug interaction and 2 cases involving a similar effect with 6-mercaptopurine, the active metabolite of azathioprine. The exact mechanism of the interaction remains unknown. Previously published case reports point to a rapid onset and offset of the warfarin-azathioprine interaction and a dose-dependent increase of at least 2.5-fold in warfarin dose requirement with the initiation of azathioprine 75–200 mg daily.

Conclusions

This case report and several others point toward azathioprine as a clinically significant inducer of warfarin resistance. Providers should anticipate the need for higher warfarin doses, warfarin dose adjustment, and close INR monitoring in patients receiving azathioprine or its active metabolite, 6-mercaptopurine.

Methotrexate dosing and duration in psoriasis — Indicated for severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis not responsive to other therapy, methotrexate is administered as a weekly single oral dose with gradual increases until optimal response; total dose should not ordinarily exceed 30 mg/wk, doses should be reduced to the lowest possible amount, and a test dose of 2.5–5 mg is recommended. Treatment can be continued as long as necessary with adequate monitoring, and folic acid supplementation 1–5 mg daily by mouth, except for the day of methotrexate dosing, reduces the frequency of side effects.

### Clinical prediction model for time in therapeutic range while on warfarin in newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation [^ff8565ef]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a growing public health and clinical problem, as an aging population, prolonged survival of patients with cardiac conditions predisposing to AF, enhanced detection of more sporadic forms of AF, and other factors have collectively served to expand the number of AF diagnoses. 1 AF portends a 5‐fold increased risk of thromboembolic events; thus, any new AF diagnosis requires assessment of thromboembolic risk and in many cases, proper oral anticoagulation (OAC) to mitigate excess risk. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Though warfarin and other vitamin K antagonists (VKA) have been the primary OACs for several decades, the recent introduction of 4 non–vitamin K antagonists, direct OACs (DOACs), has expanded the therapeutic options for thromboprophylaxis in AF. Meta‐analyses have reported small improvements in efficacy and safety with DOACs compared with warfarin; however, these modest improvements must be considered with the higher cost of DOACs, which have created uncertainty about their overall cost‐effectiveness. 7, 8, 9, 10 Other concerns limiting more widespread use of DOACs include an inability to monitor their anticoagulation effects, short half‐lives that increase thrombosis risk when doses are missed, and lack of experience with reversal agents that may be needed in urgent settings. 11 Alternatively, warfarin is an inexpensive, long‐used, well‐researched, and effective therapeutic, associated with a 64% reduction in ischemic stroke in nonvalvular AF compared with placebo. 12, 13 However, warfarin possesses multiple untoward attributes complicating its use, including a narrow therapeutic range, numerous drug and dietary interactions, and a metabolism strongly dependent on multiple genetic polymorphisms that make warfarin's ultimate pharmacologic effects difficult to predict. 9, 12, 13, 14

two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as

possible.

Laboratory Tests

Complete blood counts should be done frequently in patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim; if a significant reduction in the count of any formed blood element is noted, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should be discontinued. Urinalyses with careful microscopic examination and renal function tests should be performed during therapy, particularly for those patients with impaired renal function.

Drug Interactions

In elderly patients concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported.

It has been reported that sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may prolong the prothrombin time in patients who are receiving the anticoagulant warfarin. This interaction should be kept in mind when sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is given to patients already on anticoagulant therapy, and the coagulation time should be reassessed.

Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, given at a common clinical dosage, increased the phenytoin half-life by 39% and decreased the phenytoin metabolic clearance rate by 27%. When administering these drugs concurrently, one should be alert for possible excessive phenytoin effect.

2.1 Important Dosage and Safety Information

Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential before starting methotrexate tablets [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Instruct patients and caregivers to take the recommended dosage as directed, because medication errors have led to deaths [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

When switching the dosing regimen from oral administration to intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous administration, an alternative dosing regimen may be necessary.

Do not administer to patients who are unable to swallow a tablet.

Methotrexate tablets are a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures.1

2.2 Recommended Dosage for Neoplastic Diseases

Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia

The recommended starting dosage of methotrexate tablets are 20 mg/m2orally once weekly, as part of a combination chemotherapy maintenance regimen. After initiating methotrexate tablets, periodically monitor absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and platelet count and adjust the dose to maintain ANC at a desirable level and for excessive myelosuppression.

Mycosis Fungoides

The recommended dosage of methotrexate tablets are 25 to 75 mg orally once weekly when administered as a single agent or 10 mg/m2orally twice weekly as part of a combination chemotherapy regimen.

Relapsed or Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas

The recommended dosage of methotrexate tablets are 2.5 mg orally 2 to 4 times per week (maximum 10 mg per week) as part of a metronomic combination chemotherapy regimen.

2.3 Recommended Dosage for Rheumatoid Arthritis

The recommended starting dosage of methotrexate tablets are 7.5 mg orally once weekly with escalation to achieve optimal response. Dosages of more than 20 mg once weekly result in an increased risk of serious adverse reactions, including myelosuppression. When responses are observed, the majority occurred between 3 and 6 weeks from initiation of treatment; however, responses have occurred up to 12 weeks after treatment initiation.

Administer folic acid or folinic acid to reduce the risk of methotrexate adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

Drug Interactions

In elderly patients concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported.

It has been reported that sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may prolong the prothrombin time in patients who are receiving the anticoagulant warfarin. This interaction should be kept in mind when sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is given to patients already on anticoagulant therapy, and the coagulation time should be reassessed.

When administering these drugs concurrently, one should be alert for possible excessive phenytoin effect.

Sulfonamides can also displace methotrexate from plasma protein binding sites and can compete with the renal transport of methotrexate, thus increasing free methotrexate concentrations.

There have been reports of marked but reversible nephrotoxicity with coadministration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim and cyclosporine in renal transplant recipients.

Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim therapy, especially in elderly patients. Serum digoxin levels should be monitored. Increased sulfamethoxazole blood levels may occur in patients who are also receiving indomethacin.

Occasional reports suggest that patients receiving pyrimethamine as malaria prophylaxis in doses exceeding 25 mg weekly may develop megaloblastic anemia if sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is prescribed.

The efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants can decrease when coadministered with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim.

Like other sulfonamide-containing drugs, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim potentiates the effect of oral hypoglycemics.

In the literature, a single case of toxic delirium has been reported after concomitant intake of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and amantadine.

In the literature, three cases of hyperkalemia in elderly patients have been reported after concomitant intake of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor.7,8

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, specifically the trimethoprim component, can interfere with a serum methotrexate assay as determined by the competitive binding protein technique (CBPA) when a bacterial dihydrofolate reductase is used as the binding protein. No interference occurs, however, if methotrexate is measured by a radioimmunoassay (RIA).

The presence of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may also interfere with the Jaffé alkaline picrate reaction assay for creatinine, resulting in overestimations of about 10% in the range of normal values.

### Risk of atrial fibrillation and stroke in rheumatoid arthritis: Danish nationwide cohort study [^eb8eda68]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Clinical implications

In the recent years, the care of patients with rheumatoid arthritis has been extended to cover the increased comorbidity, especially that due to cardiovascular disease. Newly developed guidelines recommend annual screening for cardiovascular risk factors in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, to counter the reported increased risk of, for example, acute myocardial infarction and stroke. As no evidence has been available on the risk of atrial fibrillation, the focus has primarily been on standard primary prevention of hard end points by traditional risk score assessment. Overall, our findings corresponded to one new case of atrial fibrillation per 12 rheumatoid arthritis patients followed for 10 years after diagnosis. Given the augmented risk of atrial fibrillation (which is often asymptomatic) and the ample opportunity for diagnosis of arrhythmia at the recommended annual screening appointments, we suggest that the clinical focus should here include screening for atrial fibrillation, not least in light of the relative easiness of such screening, the risk of stroke with subsequent disability and societal burden, and the powerful effect of anticoagulation treatment. Moreover, these findings may indicate that rheumatoid arthritis can add to future risk stratification scores for stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation and lower the threshold for anticoagulation. As inflammation is likely to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation and stroke, this study also underlines the importance of rigorous control of inflammation with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs, not only for the management of joint symptoms but also to reduce the need for drugs with potential adverse cardiovascular effects and, ultimately, to diminish the inflammation driven atherothrombotic process.

### Refining drug safety in rheumatology [^e1b563e7]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

This issue explores several important safety concerns that currently plague the rheumatologist and health care providers who care for patients with rheumatic diseases. Weighing safety against efficacy can be a complex task that is best alleviated by understanding the issues, nature, and breadth of problems associated with drug use. Therapeutic decision-making must be evidence-based, judicious, and appropriate for the patient and situation. Understanding drug safety is paramount to ensuring both success of therapy and benefit to the patient. Similarly, it is important not to underestimate the impact of uncontrolled disease activity in decision-making. Drug safety must be weighed against the severity and risks of the disease under treatment. Clearly the benefit/risk ratio has improved for many of the therapies discussed in this book. The use of both conventional and novel therapies mandates an understanding of the mechanisms of action, unique toxicities, screening and monitoring measures, and rules for drug avoidance.

Obtain blood counts at baseline, periodically during treatment, and as clinically indicated. Monitor patients for clinical complications of myelosuppression. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue methotrexate tablets taking into account the importance of methotrexate tablet treatment in the context of the severity of the disease being treated, the severity of the adverse drug reaction, and availability of alternative therapy. Withhold or discontinue methotrexate tablets for severe gastrointestinal toxicity taking into account the importance of methotrexate tablet treatment in the context of the severity of the disease being treated, the severity of the adverse drug reaction, and availability of alternative therapy. Methotrexate can cause severe and potentially irreversible hepatotoxicity, including fibrosis, cirrhosis, and fatal liver failure.

The safety of methotrexate tablets in patients with hepatic disease is unknown. Monitor liver tests at baseline, periodically during treatment and as clinically indicated. Withhold or discontinue methotrexate tablets taking into account the importance of methotrexate tablet treatment in the context of the severity of the disease being treated, the severity of the adverse drug reaction, and availability of alternative therapy. Methotrexate can cause renal toxicity, including irreversible acute renal failure. Monitor renal function at baseline, periodically during treatment and as clinically indicated. Withhold or discontinue methotrexate tablets for severe renal toxicity taking into account the importance of methotrexate tablet treatment in the context of the severity of the disease being treated, the severity of the adverse drug reaction, and availability of alternative therapy.

Administer glucarpidase in patients with toxic plasma methotrexate concentrations and delayed methotrexate clearance due to impaired renal function. Refer to the glucarpidase prescribing information for additional information. Deaths occurred in patients as a result of medication errors. Most commonly, these errors occurred in patients who were taking methotrexate daily when a weekly dosing regimen was prescribed. For patients prescribed a once weekly dosing regimen, instruct patients and caregivers to take the recommended dosage as directed, because medication errors have led to death. Neoplastic Diseases Products containing folic acid or its derivatives may decrease the clinical effectiveness of methotrexate. Therefore, instruct patients not to take products containing folic acid or folinic acid unless directed to do so by their healthcare provider.
