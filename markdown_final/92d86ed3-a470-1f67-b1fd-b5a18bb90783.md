## Question

Does allopurinol raise cardiovascular risk?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether allopurinol raises cardiovascular risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality randomized evidence that directly informs cardiovascular outcomes with allopurinol. Then, I should verify what head-to-head trials versus febuxostat tell us about relative cardiovascular safety. Next, I will examine large observational datasets for signals of harm or benefit and check for time-related biases. After that, I need to review meta-analyses and guideline positions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded conclusion and note any caveats about special populations or discontinuation effects.

> Let me first confirm the pivotal randomized evidence. The CARES trial in patients with gout and established cardiovascular disease showed that febuxostat was noninferior to allopurinol for the composite MACE endpoint, but all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were higher with febuxostat, which implies that allopurinol did not raise cardiovascular risk relative to febuxostat and may have had a more favorable mortality signal in that high-risk population [^41976ec2] [^99f22b52].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and specifics. In CARES, cardiovascular death occurred in 4.3% with febuxostat versus 3.2% with allopurinol (HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.03–1.73), and all-cause mortality was also higher with febuxostat, whereas the primary composite MACE endpoint was similar, indicating no excess nonfatal events with febuxostat but a concerning mortality imbalance that favored allopurinol rather than suggesting harm from allopurinol itself [^41976ec2] [^99f22b52].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality. The FAST trial, designed to address cardiovascular safety concerns, found febuxostat was noninferior to allopurinol for the primary cardiovascular composite and did not show increased cardiovascular or all-cause mortality, which reassures me that the mortality signal in CARES may reflect population, adherence, or analytical factors rather than a class effect of xanthine oxidase inhibition, and importantly, it does not indicate that allopurinol increases cardiovascular risk [^362f81ea].

> I need to check the largest randomized trial specifically testing allopurinol for cardiovascular outcomes. The ALL-HEART trial in older adults with ischemic heart disease and no gout found that allopurinol up to 600 mg daily did not reduce major adverse cardiovascular events compared with usual care, but crucially, it also did not increase them, supporting cardiovascular neutrality for allopurinol in that population [^aadd582b] [^8ac3f997].

> Next, I should review observational data with caution. Several large cohort studies associate allopurinol use with lower all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, but I must double-check for immortal time and time-varying confounding. Indeed, analyses that avoid these biases show attenuated or null associations, suggesting that apparent protective effects in some observational studies may be overestimated, so I should not over-interpret them as proving benefit or definitively ruling out harm [^484ad82d] [^40b78c73] [^3ba3d966].

> Let me consider meta-analyses and systematic reviews. Pooled analyses of randomized and observational studies generally do not show increased cardiovascular events with allopurinol compared with febuxostat or with nonuse, and some analyses suggest neutral or modestly favorable associations, though heterogeneity and design limitations temper certainty, reinforcing that allopurinol does not raise cardiovascular risk in a consistent, clinically meaningful way across populations [^8106cd44] [^f987fc69] [^7514b200].

> I should confirm what regulators and guidelines say. The FDA boxed warning pertains to febuxostat's higher cardiovascular death risk in patients with established cardiovascular disease, not to allopurinol, and contemporary rheumatology guidelines continue to position allopurinol as first-line urate-lowering therapy without a cardiovascular risk warning, aligning with the totality of evidence that does not show increased cardiovascular risk from allopurinol [^30a22527] [^af44b55a].

> But wait, what if discontinuation of urate-lowering therapy changes risk. Reanalyses of CARES and FAST suggest that abrupt discontinuation of allopurinol or febuxostat is associated with a transient increase in MACE and mortality, plausibly via rebound hyperuricemia and vascular inflammation; this is a reason to maintain therapy when indicated and taper thoughtfully rather than stop abruptly, rather than evidence that allopurinol itself increases cardiovascular risk during treatment [^8d8f940c] [^b797ec84] [^c11e5141].

> I will now examine special populations briefly. In chronic kidney disease, urate-lowering therapy has been studied for renal and cardiovascular outcomes; while some trials and meta-analyses suggest potential renal benefits with allopurinol, large cardiovascular outcome trials in non-gout populations have not shown reduced cardiovascular events with allopurinol, underscoring that any cardiovascular effect is likely neutral overall and should not deter appropriate use when indicated for gout management [^e6aecc83] [^aadd582b] [^472b636c].

> Putting this together, I should double-check my bottom line. The highest-quality randomized evidence indicates that allopurinol does not raise cardiovascular risk and, in head-to-head comparison with febuxostat, appears to have a more favorable mortality profile in high-risk patients, while large outcome trials in ischemic heart disease show neutrality for major cardiovascular events. Observational signals of benefit are likely biased and should be interpreted cautiously, and guideline positions align with allopurinol remaining first-line therapy without a cardiovascular risk warning [^41976ec2] [^362f81ea] [^aadd582b] [^484ad82d] [^af44b55a].

> Practically, I need to ensure I am not conflating relative safety with absolute risk modification. Allopurinol should be dosed and titrated appropriately, including in chronic kidney disease, with attention to HLA-B✱5801 risk where relevant, and patients should be counseled to maintain therapy and avoid abrupt discontinuation; if a cardiovascular event occurs, it should be managed within standard risk frameworks rather than attributing causation to allopurinol, which is not supported by the evidence base [^af44b55a] [^8d8f940c].

Allopurinol does not increase cardiovascular risk and may reduce it in some settings. The highest-quality evidence shows **no excess cardiovascular events** with allopurinol compared with febuxostat in patients with gout and cardiovascular disease [^41976ec2] [^362f81ea]. Observational data suggest **lower cardiovascular and all-cause mortality** with allopurinol, but these findings may reflect confounding and should be interpreted cautiously [^484ad82d] [^f987fc69]. Allopurinol is considered first-line urate-lowering therapy and is not associated with increased cardiovascular risk in clinical practice [^af44b55a].

## Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs)

### CARES trial

- **Design**: Double-blind, noninferiority RCT in 6,190 patients with gout and cardiovascular disease; median follow-up 32 months [^41976ec2].
- **Primary outcome**: Composite cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or urgent revascularization occurred in 10.8% with febuxostat vs 10.4% with allopurinol (HR 1.03; 95% CI 0.87–1.23), meeting noninferiority [^41976ec2].
- **Secondary outcomes**: All-cause and cardiovascular mortality were higher with febuxostat (HR 1.22 and 1.34, respectively), indicating allopurinol did not increase mortality [^41976ec2].

---

### FAST trial

- **Design**: Randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint trial in 6,128 patients aged ≥ 60 years with gout and cardiovascular risk factors; median follow-up 4 years [^362f81ea].
- **Primary outcome**: Composite cardiovascular hospitalization or death occurred in 6.2% with febuxostat vs 5.5% with allopurinol (HR 0.85; 95% CI 0.70–1.03), demonstrating noninferiority [^362f81ea].
- **Mortality**: No significant difference in all-cause or cardiovascular mortality between groups [^362f81ea].

---

### ALL-HEART trial

- **Design**: Randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint trial in 5,721 patients aged ≥ 60 years with ischemic heart disease but no gout; median follow-up 4.8 years [^aadd582b].
- **Primary outcome**: Composite cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke occurred in 11.0% with allopurinol vs 11.3% with usual care (HR 1.04; 95% CI 0.89–1.21), showing no cardiovascular benefit or harm [^aadd582b].

---

## Evidence from observational studies

Observational studies have reported associations between allopurinol use and **reduced cardiovascular events and mortality**, but these designs are susceptible to confounding and bias [^484ad82d]. For example:

- A Danish cohort found allopurinol use associated with lower cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (HR 0.89 and 0.68, respectively) [^40b78c73].
- A meta-analysis of observational studies found no significant association between allopurinol use and all-cause mortality (HR 0.80; 95% CI 0.60–1.05) [^f987fc69].
- A Korean cohort found allopurinol initiators had higher cardiovascular risk than benzbromarone users (HR 1.22), but this may reflect confounding by indication and comorbidity [^5764c349].

---

## Biological mechanisms

Allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase, reducing uric acid and oxidative stress, which could theoretically confer cardiovascular benefit [^23245ce8]. However, clinical trials have not consistently demonstrated **cardiovascular risk reduction**, suggesting that any benefit is modest or context-dependent [^aadd582b].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines recommend allopurinol as **first-line urate-lowering therapy** for gout, with no specific cardiovascular risk warning. The 2020 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline advises that in patients with cardiovascular disease or a new cardiovascular event while on febuxostat, switching to an alternative agent (such as allopurinol) may be considered, reflecting concerns about febuxostat rather than allopurinol [^af44b55a].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Study type** | **Key findings regarding allopurinol and cardiovascular risk** |
|-|-|
| RCTs | - No increase in cardiovascular events vs febuxostat (CARES, FAST) [^41976ec2] [^362f81ea] <br/> - No cardiovascular benefit or harm vs usual care in ischemic heart disease (ALL-HEART) [^aadd582b] |
| Observational studies | - Mixed findings <br/> - Some suggest reduced cardiovascular risk <br/> - Others show no association or increased risk vs other agents <br/> - Confounding likely [^484ad82d] [^f987fc69] [^5764c349] |
| Guidelines | - Allopurinol is first-line therapy <br/> - No cardiovascular risk warning [^af44b55a] |

---

Allopurinol does not increase cardiovascular risk and may reduce it in some observational contexts, though confounding is likely. RCTs show **no excess cardiovascular events** versus febuxostat and no cardiovascular benefit or harm versus usual care in ischemic heart disease. Allopurinol remains first-line therapy for gout without a cardiovascular risk warning [^af44b55a].

### Cardiovascular safety of febuxostat and allopurinol in patients with gout and cardiovascular comorbidities [^0ab779e8]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Comprehensive safety evaluation of new drugs for noncardiac indications is needed in the area of cardiovascular (CV) outcomes, particularly in populations with high CV risk such as gout. Febuxostat is a potent nonpurine selective inhibitor of xanthine oxidase approved for the treatment of gout. Long-term CV safety of febuxostat is being established in a randomized, allopurinol-controlled clinical study in patients with gout who have increased CV risk using an analytical approach that provides 90% power to meet a noninferiority margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio (HR) (febuxostat relative to allopurinol). The primary CV end point for this trial is a composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and unstable angina requiring urgent coronary revascularization. Approximately 7,500 men and women with gout and CV disease are being recruited and will be followed up for up to 5 years postrandomization. The statistical plan for the trial uses a design that evaluates the HR of febuxostat to allopurinol based on the primary CV composite end point when there are a maximum of 624 CV events. Interim analyses will be conducted when approximately 25%, 50%, and 75% of events have occurred. At each analysis, if the upper 1-sided confidence limit of the HR is < 1.3, the study will be stopped, and the noninferiority of febuxostat relative to allopurinol with regard to CV risk will be declared. The CARES trial will define the CV safety profile of febuxostat and allopurinol in gout patients at high risk for CV events.

### Cardiovascular safety of febuxostat or allopurinol in patients with gout [^41976ec2]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular risk is increased in patients with gout. We compared cardiovascular outcomes associated with febuxostat, a nonpurine xanthine oxidase inhibitor, with those associated with allopurinol, a purine base analogue xanthine oxidase inhibitor, in patients with gout and cardiovascular disease.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, noninferiority trial involving patients with gout and cardiovascular disease; patients were randomly assigned to receive febuxostat or allopurinol and were stratified according to kidney function. The trial had a prespecified noninferiority margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio for the primary end point (a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent revascularization).

Results

In total, 6190 patients underwent randomization, received febuxostat or allopurinol, and were followed for a median of 32 months (maximum, 85 months). The trial regimen was discontinued in 56.6% of patients, and 45.0% discontinued follow-up. In the modified intention-to-treat analysis, a primary end-point event occurred in 335 patients (10.8%) in the febuxostat group and in 321 patients (10.4%) in the allopurinol group (hazard ratio, 1.03; upper limit of the one-sided 98.5% confidence interval [CI] 1.23; P = 0.002 for noninferiority). All-cause and cardiovascular mortality were higher in the febuxostat group than in the allopurinol group (hazard ratio for death from any cause, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.01 to 1.47]; hazard ratio for cardiovascular death, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.03 to 1.73]). The results with regard to the primary end point and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in the analysis of events that occurred while patients were being treated were similar to the results in the modified intention-to-treat analysis.

Conclusions

In patients with gout and major cardiovascular coexisting conditions, febuxostat was noninferior to allopurinol with respect to rates of adverse cardiovascular events. All-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality were higher with febuxostat than with allopurinol. (Funded by Takeda Development Center Americas; CARES ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01101035 .).

### Allopurinol and progression of CKD and cardiovascular events: long-term follow-up of a randomized clinical trial [^f6136f16]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Asymptomatic hyperuricemia increases renal and cardiovascular (CV) risk. We previously conducted a 2-year, single-blind, randomized, controlled trial of allopurinol treatment that showed improved estimated glomerular filtration rate and reduced CV risk.

Study Design

Post hoc analysis of a long-term follow-up after completion of the 2-year trial.

Setting & Participants

113 participants (57 in the allopurinol group and 56 in the control group) initially followed up for 2 years and 107 participants followed up to 5 additional years.

Intervention

Continuation of allopurinol treatment, 100mg/d, or standard treatment.

Outcome

Renal event (defined as starting dialysis therapy and/or doubling serum creatinine and/or ≥ 50% decrease in estimated estimated glomerular filtration rate) and CV events (defined as myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization or angina pectoris, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease).

Results

During initial follow-up, there were 2 renal and 7 CV events in the allopurinol group compared with 6 renal and 15 CV events in the control group. In the long-term follow-up period, 12 of 56 participants taking allopurinol stopped treatment and 10 of 51 control participants received allopurinol. During long-term follow-up, an additional 7 and 9 participants in the allopurinol group experienced a renal or CV event, respectively, and an additional 18 and 8 participants in the control group experienced a renal or CV event, respectively. Thus, during the initial and long-term follow-up (median, 84 months), 9 patients in the allopurinol group had a renal event compared with 24 patients in the control group (HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.15–0.69; P = 0.004; adjusted for age, sex, baseline kidney function, uric acid level, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers). Overall, 16 patients treated with allopurinol experienced CV events compared with 23 in the control group (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.21–0.88; P = 0.02; adjusted for age, sex, and baseline kidney function).

Limitations

Small sample size, single center, not double blind, post hoc follow-up and analysis.

Conclusions

Long-term treatment with allopurinol may slow the rate of progression of kidney disease and reduce CV risk.

### Cardiovascular safety of febuxostat compared to allopurinol for the treatment of gout: a systematic and meta-analysis [^70091fb1]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The cardiovascular safety of febuxostat compared to allopurinol for the treatment of gout remains equivocal. Febuxostat had a better safety outcome compared with allopurinol. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE and Embase for articles published between March 1, 2000 and April 4, 2021, without any language restrictions. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of included clinical trials to evaluate the cardiovascular safety of febuxostat compared to allopurinol for treatment of chronic gout. Two reviewers independently selected studies, assessed study quality, and extracted data. Risk ratios were calculated with random effects and were reported with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). From 240 potentially relevant citations, 224 papers were excluded; 16 studies were ultimately included in the analysis. Febuxostat had a better safety outcome compared with allopurinol，which was the composite of urgent coronary revascularization (OR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.77–0.90, p < .0001) and stroke (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.79–0.97, p = .009). However, that difference was not found in nonfatal myocardial infarction (OR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.80–1.22, p = .91), cardiovascular related mortality (OR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.69–1.38, p = .89) and all-cause mortality (OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.75–1.15, p = .52). No significant differences in cardiovascular related mortality and all-cause mortality were observed across any subgroup. This meta-analysis adds new evidence regarding the cardiovascular safety of febuxostat in patients. Initiation of febuxostat in patients was not associated with an increased risk of death or serious cardiovascular related adverse events compared with allopurinol.

Abstract

The cardiovascular safety of febuxostat compared to allopurinol for the treatment of gout remains equivocal. Febuxostat had a better safety outcome compared with allopurinol. In this systematic review and meta‐analysis, we searched MEDLINE and Embase for articles published between March 1, 2000 and April 4, 2021, without any language restrictions. We did a systematic review and meta‐analysis of included clinical trials to evaluate the cardiovascular safety of febuxostat compared to allopurinol for treatment of chronic gout. Two reviewers independently selected studies, assessed study quality, and extracted data. Risk ratios were calculated with random effects and were reported with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). From 240 potentially relevant citations, 224 papers were excluded; 16 studies were ultimately included in the analysis. Febuxostat had a better safety outcome compared with allopurinol，which was the composite of urgent coronary revascularization (OR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.77–0.90, p < .0001) and stroke (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.79–0.97, p = .009). However, that difference was not found in nonfatal myocardial infarction (OR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.80–1.22, p = .91), cardiovascular related mortality (OR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.69–1.38, p = .89) and all‐cause mortality (OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.75–1.15, p = .52). No significant differences in cardiovascular related mortality and all‐cause mortality were observed across any subgroup. This meta‐analysis adds new evidence regarding the cardiovascular safety of febuxostat in patients. Initiation of febuxostat in patients was not associated with an increased risk of death or serious cardiovascular related adverse events compared with allopurinol.

### Febuxostat [^ae842de0]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.2 Cardiovascular Safety Study

A randomized, double-blind, allopurinol-controlled CV outcomes study (CARES) was conducted to evaluate the CV risk of febuxostat (NCT01101035). The study compared the risk of MACE between patients treated with febuxostat (N = 3098) and allopurinol-treated patients (N = 3092). The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. An independent committee conducted a blinded evaluation of serious CV adverse events according to predefined criteria (adjudication) for determination of MACE. The study was event driven and patients were followed until a sufficient number of primary outcome events accrued. The median on-study follow-up time was 2.6 years.

Patients randomized to febuxostat initially received 40 mg once daily which was increased to 80 mg once daily, if their sUA was ≥ 6mg/dL at Week 2. For patients randomized to allopurinol, those who had normal renal function or mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance (eClcr) ≥ 60 to ˂90 mL/minute) initially received 300 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either sUA ˂6mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 600 mg once daily was achieved; those who had moderate renal impairment (eClcr ≥ 30 to ˂60 mL/minute) initially received 200 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either a sUA ˂6 mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 400 mg once daily was achieved.

### New perspectives in rheumatology: implications of the cardiovascular safety of febuxostat and allopurinol in patients with gout and cardiovascular morbidities trial and the associated food and drug administration public safety alert [^5dffab89]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a public safety alert, responding to the results of the now-published Cardiovascular Safety of Febuxostat and Allopurinol in Patients With Gout and Cardiovascular Morbidities (CARES) trial. The CARES trial showed no significant difference between allopurinol and febuxostat in the primary composite end point of cardiovascular (CV) events in subjects with gout and established CV comorbidities at baseline. However, there was a significantly increased risk of CV and all-cause mortality with febuxostat. Urate-lowering therapy (ULT) is central to the long-term management of gout, and xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitor (XOI) therapy is the consensus first-line approach. Allopurinol is generally the first XOI used, but febuxostat is an effective XOI option, and is commonly used when allopurinol is not tolerated. These data are further relevant since CV comorbidities are common in gout. Here, we examine why the CARES trial was done, and discuss other, ongoing comparative studies of febuxostat and allopurinol whose results are awaited. We assess the strengths and limitations of the CARES trial, and appraise the robustness and biologic plausibility of the results. The CARES trial does not prove that febuxostat raises CV mortality risk, but suggests greater risk with febuxostat than allopurinol. The CARES trial results do not support first-line use of febuxostat ULT, and raise questions about febuxostat placement at various pharmacologic ULT decision tree branches. Alternatives to febuxostat that are frequently effective include allopurinol dose escalation and uricosuric therapy alone or combined with allopurinol. The FDA safety alert highlights the need for shared ULT medical decision-making with gout patients, including discussion of the CV safety of febuxostat.

### Updated assessment of cardiovascular risk in older patients with gout initiating febuxostat versus allopurinol [^0d46ca91]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Allopurinol was the only available treatment for gout until the approval of febuxostat in 2009. Premarketing trials of febuxostat raised a potential signal for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) when compared with placebo and allopurinol. 1, 2 The US Food and Drug Administration mandated a postmarketing cardiovascular safety trial of febuxostat (CARES [Cardiovascular Safety of Febuxostat and Allopurinol in Patients With Gout and Cardiovascular Morbidities]) that suggested noninferiority with respect to the rates of MACE for febuxostat compared with allopurinol (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; 95% CI, 0.87–1.23), but higher all‐cause mortality (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.01–1.47) and cardiovascular mortality (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.03–1.73). 3 Recently, the FAST trial (Febuxostat Versus Allopurinol Streamlined Trial), recommended by the European Medicines Agency, showed that febuxostat was noninferior to allopurinol for the risk of a composite cardiovascular outcome (ie, hospitalization for nonfatal myocardial infarction, biomarker‐positive acute coronary syndrome, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death [HR, 0·85; 95% CI, 0·70–1·03]). FAST also found no differences in rates of all‐cause mortality between the groups (7.1% versus 8.6%). 4

To evaluate these cardiovascular safety concerns in a real‐world setting, we previously conducted a cohort study using Medicare fee‐for‐service claims data from 2008 to 2013. 5 As more data on febuxostat use accumulated in recent years, and the information on cardiovascular mortality became available, we aimed to re‐evaluate the cardiovascular safety of febuxostat using data up to December 31, 2016, with additional end points of 3‐point MACE and cardiovascular mortality. We identified Medicare enrollees with gout aged ≥ 65 years who initiated allopurinol or febuxostat. In our previous analyses, febuxostat users could use allopurinol before in a prevalent new‐user design to maximize statistical power. To further minimize confounding, this study used an incident new‐user design by selecting only patients with no use of either medication for ≥ 1 year before the first dispensing of febuxostat or allopurinol (ie, index date).

### Cardiovascular safety of febuxostat compared to allopurinol for the treatment of gout: a systematic and meta-analysis [^abde22bd]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Although we believe that this meta‐analysis provides useful information, the finding must be interpreted with caution because there are several limitations of this study. First, most of the enrolled allopurinol and febuxostat users with cardiovascular comorbidities or cerebrovascular disease. The basis of inclusion criteria of these studies resulted in different baseline comorbidities. Second, the treatment period and follow‐up time of each study are different, which may cause bias. A longer follow‐up regarding cardiovascular safety should be considered. Third, As the clinical trials included an overwhelming majority of men, febuxostat tolerance remains little explored in women. A careful monitoring of long‐term effects and cardiovascular safety of febuxostat should be considered in female patients.

In conclusion, our meta‐analysis suggested that febuxostat users did not significantly increase the risk of cardiovascular events or all‐cause mortality compared with allopurinol users. However, more high‐quality, double‐blinded, large, randomized studies are needed to elucidate this issue.

1 INTRODUCTION

Gout is a common clinical metabolic system disease and may contribute to many adverse health events. Evidence shows that the risk of hyperuricemia increased with advanced age in both sexes. 1, 2 At present, drugs are the first choice for the treatment of gout in clinical practice. Studies have found that the treatment of gout with xanthine oxidase inhibition (allopurinol, febuxostat) can increase uric acid excretion via the kidneys and achieve better results. Recent studies have shown that febuxostat, a novel non‐purine selective inhibitor of xanthine oxidase (XO), is more effective than allopurinol in lowering the uric acid levels in patients with hyperuricemia and gout. 3, 4 It is particularly useful in patients who are refractory or intolerant to allopurinol, and requires no dose limitation in stages 1–3 chronic kidney disease. 5 However, the food and drug administration (FDA) issued a public safety alert, responding to results of cardiovascular safety of febuxostat and allopurinol in patients with gout and cardiovascular morbidities (CARES) trial. 6 The FDA public safety alert highlights the discussion of CV safety of febuxostat. 7, 8, 9 By contrast, the European Medicines Agency (EMA)‐required febuxostat versus allopurinol streamlined trial, a prospective, randomized, open‐label, blinded‐endpoint, non‐inferiority trial of febuxostat (80–120 mg/day) versus allopurinol, does not support the finding of an increased cardiovascular risk of febuxostat. 10 The evidence for a causal relationship between xanthine oxidase inhibitors and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remains equivocal. Therefore, this study intends to conduct a systematic review of the relevant clinical trials published in recent years to analyze the adverse cardiovascular events and death risks of febuxostat compared with allopurinol in patients.

5.1 Cardiovascular Death

In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study, gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths, 2.7% in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098) as compared to 1.8% in the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092). Febuxostat was similar to allopurinol for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Because of the increased risk of CV death, febuxostat should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat. Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Monitor patients for the development of CV events. Inform patients about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

5.2 Gout Flares

After initiation of febuxostat, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits.

In order to prevent gout flares when febuxostat is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### Allopurinol and cardiovascular events: time-related biases in observational studies [^484ad82d]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Several observational studies reported that allopurinol, an effective treatment for gout, was associated with important reductions in cardiovascular (CV) events, with calls for large, randomized trials, although some results were conflicting. The present study was undertaken to assess the extent of time-related biases in these observational studies.

Methods

We searched the literature for all observational studies reporting on allopurinol and CV events, focusing on 2 time-related biases. Time-related confounding bias results from studies using cohorts of patients all exposed to allopurinol, with comparisons based on episodes of allopurinol discontinuation, where confounding factors are not updated over follow-up time. Immortal time bias arises from the exposure misclassification of periods of cohort follow-up during which the outcome under study cannot occur.

Results

We identified 12 studies, of which 8 were affected by time-related confounding bias or immortal time bias, while the remaining 4 studies avoided these biases. The studies affected by time-related confounding bias resulted in significant reductions in the incidence of CV events with allopurinol use (pooled hazard ratio [HR] 0.88 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.85–0.92]), as did the studies affected by immortal time bias (pooled HR 0.79 [95% CI 0.72–0.87]). The 4 studies that avoided these biases resulted in a pooled HR of 1.07 (95% CI 0.91–1.25).

Conclusion

Observational studies reporting significantly reduced incidence of CV events with allopurinol use were affected by time-related biases. Overall, studies that avoided these biases did not find a protective effect. The ALL-HEART randomized trial will provide important and accurate evidence on the potential effectiveness of allopurinol on CV outcomes.

### Prognostic factors for colchicine prophylaxis-related adverse events when initiating allopurinol for gout: retrospective cohort study [^81b4cdd4]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We found that people were given colchicine prophylaxis despite commonly having preexisting prescriptions for medications with potential to interact with colchicine. Adverse events were more common in people who were older, had more comorbidities and were prescribed certain potentially interacting medications. Reassuringly, the rate of serious adverse events was low, providing reassurance for people with gout and for clinicians. We also found no evidence that the prescription of statins significantly increased the risk of adverse events except atorvastatin being associated with MI.

Future research is needed to determine which patients are at greatest risk of adverse events from prophylaxis and whether the cardiovascular benefits of colchicine reported in randomized controlled trials of people at high risk of cardiovascular events because of a prior history of coronary heart disease also apply to people with gout. Our findings will provide much-needed information about the safety of flare prophylaxis that can inform treatment decisions when initiating allopurinol, directly benefitting people with gout and their clinicians.

### Long-term cardiovascular safety of febuxostat compared with allopurinol in patients with gout (FAST): a multicentre, prospective, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial [^362f81ea]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Febuxostat and allopurinol are urate-lowering therapies used to treat patients with gout. Following concerns about the cardiovascular safety of febuxostat, the European Medicines Agency recommended a post-licensing study assessing the cardiovascular safety of febuxostat compared with allopurinol.

Methods

We did a prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint, non-inferiority trial of febuxostat versus allopurinol in patients with gout in the UK, Denmark, and Sweden. Eligible patients were 60 years or older, already receiving allopurinol, and had at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor. Those who had myocardial infarction or stroke in the previous 6 months or who had severe congestive heart failure or severe renal impairment were excluded. After a lead-in phase in which allopurinol dose was optimised towards achieving a serum urate concentration of less than 0·357 mmol/L (< 6 mg/dL), patients were randomly assigned (1:1, with stratification according to previous cardiovascular events) to continue allopurinol (at the optimised dose) or start febuxostat at 80 mg/day, increasing to 120 mg/day if necessary to achieve the target serum urate concentration. The primary outcome was a composite of hospitalisation for non-fatal myocardial infarction or biomarker-positive acute coronary syndrome; non-fatal stroke; or cardiovascular death. The hazard ratio (HR) for febuxostat versus allopurinol in a Cox proportional hazards model (adjusted for the stratification variable and country) was assessed for non-inferiority (HR limit 1·3) in an on-treatment analysis. This study is registered with the EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT 2011-001883-23) and ISRCTN (ISRCTN72443728) and is now closed.

Findings

From Dec 20, 2011, to Jan 26, 2018, 6128 patients (mean age 71·0 years [SD 6·4], 5225 [85·3%] men, 903 [14·7%] women, 2046 [33·4%] with previous cardiovascular disease) were enrolled and randomly allocated to receive allopurinol (n = 3065) or febuxostat (n = 3063). By the study end date (Dec 31, 2019), 189 (6·2%) patients in the febuxostat group and 169 (5·5%) in the allopurinol group withdrew from all follow-up. Median follow-up time was 1467 days (IQR 1029–2052) and median on-treatment follow-up was 1324 days (IQR 870–1919). For incidence of the primary endpoint, on-treatment, febuxostat (172 patients [1·72 events per 100 patient-years]) was non-inferior to allopurinol (241 patients [2·05 events per 100 patient-years]; adjusted HR 0·85 [95% CI 0·70–1·03], p < 0·0001). In the febuxostat group, 222 (7·2%) of 3063 patients died and 1720 (57·3%) of 3001 in the safety analysis set had at least one serious adverse event (with 23 events in 19 [0·6%] patients related to treatment). In the allopurinol group, 263 (8·6%) of 3065 patients died and 1812 (59·4%) of 3050 had one or more serious adverse events (with five events in five [0·2%] patients related to treatment). Randomised therapy was discontinued in 973 (32·4%) patients in the febuxostat group and 503 (16·5%) patients in the allopurinol group.

Interpretation

Febuxostat is non-inferior to allopurinol therapy with respect to the primary cardiovascular endpoint, and its long-term use is not associated with an increased risk of death or serious adverse events compared with allopurinol.

14.2 Cardiovascular Safety Study

A randomized, double-blind, allopurinol-controlled CV outcomes study (CARES) was conducted to evaluate the CV risk of febuxostat (NCT01101035). The study compared the risk of MACE between patients treated with febuxostat (N = 3098) and allopurinol-treated patients (N = 3092). The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. An independent committee conducted a blinded evaluation of serious CV adverse events according to predefined criteria (adjudication) for determination of MACE. The study was event driven and patients were followed until a sufficient number of primary outcome events accrued. The median on-study follow-up time was 2.6 years.

Patients randomized to febuxostat initially received 40 mg once daily which was increased to 80 mg once daily, if their sUA was ≥ 6mg/dL at Week 2. For patients randomized to allopurinol, those who had normal renal function or mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance (eClcr) ≥ 60 to < 90 mL/minute) initially received 300 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either sUA < 6mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 600 mg once daily was achieved; those who had moderate renal impairment (eClcr ≥ 30 to < 60 mL/minute) initially received 200 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either a sUA < 6 mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 400 mg once daily was achieved.

### Cardiovascular risk associated with allopurinol vs. benzbromarone in patients with gout [^5764c349]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

With the high prevalence of gout and associated cardiovascular (CV) diseases, information on the comparative CV safety of individual urate-lowering drugs becomes increasingly important. However, few studies examined the CV risk of uricosuric agents. We compared CV risk among patients with gout who initiated allopurinol vs. benzbromarone.

Methods and Results

Using the Korean National Health Insurance claims data (2002–17), we conducted a cohort study of 124 434 gout patients who initiated either allopurinol (n = 103 695) or benzbromarone (n = 20 739), matched on propensity score at a 5:1 ratio. The primary outcome was a composite CV endpoint of myocardial infarction, stroke/transient ischaemic attack, or coronary revascularization. To account for competing risk of death, we used cause-specific hazard models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the outcomes comparing allopurinol initiators with benzbromarone. Over a mean follow-up of 1.16years, 2258 patients developed a composite CV event. The incidence rate of the composite CV event was higher in allopurinol initiators (1.81 per 100 person-years) than benzbromarone (1.61 per 100 person-years) with a HR of 1.22 (95% CI 1.05–1.41). The HR for all-cause mortality was 1.66 (95% CI 1.43–1.93) among allopurinol initiators compared with benzbromarone.

Conclusion

In this large population-based cohort of gout patients, allopurinol was associated with an increased risk of composite CV events and all-cause mortality compared to benzbromarone. Benzbromarone may reduce CV risk and mortality in patients with gout, although more studies are necessary to confirm our findings and to advance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

### The role of febuxostat in gout [^57c3d528]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Concerns about the cardiovascular safety of febuxostat lead to reconsideration of the place of febuxostat in the management of gout.

Recent Findings

The CARES trial is a randomized controlled trial mandated by the FDA to compare the cardiovascular safety of febuxostat and allopurinol in the management of gout. About 6190 patients with gout and major cardiovascular disease, randomly assigned to allopurinol or febuxostat, were prospectively followed up for a median of 32 months. No difference was noted in the occurrence of the primary end-point event, a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent revascularization, but cardiovascular death was significantly more common in the febuxostat group (4.3%) as compared with the allopurinol group (3.2%) (P = 0.03).

Summary

Present guidelines on the management of gout should be revised in view of recent findings. Allopurinol could be recommended as the sole first-line urate-lowering drug (ULD) in patients with no contraindication. In patients contraindicated to allopurinol, uricosurics could be preferred to febuxostat as first-line ULDs in patients with cardiovascular disease/risk factors and no history of uric acid stones.

### Increased risk of cardiovascular events and death in the initial phase after discontinuation of febuxostat or allopurinol: another story of the CARES trial [^8d8f940c]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The Cardiovascular Safety of Febuxostat or Allopurinol in Patients with Gout (CARES) trial suggested a higher risk of cardiovascular (CV) death from febuxostat than from allopurinol. However, a significant number of patients died after discontinuation of febuxostat or allopurinol. We investigated whether major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and CV death were increased because of discontinuation of febuxostat or allopurinol using the CARES trial data.

Methods

We compared the MACE that occurred during administration and after discontinuation in the initial phase after discontinuation, and we compared the CV and non-CV mortality rates in the initial phase after discontinuation to determine the impact of discontinuation of febuxostat or allopurinol.

Results

Among 6190 patients, the incidence rate per 100 person-years for MACE was 3.11 during administration and 6.71 after discontinuation. MACE was significantly increased after discontinuation compared with that during administration within 1month (HR 7.40; 95% CI 5.38 to 10.17) and 6 months (HR 5.22; 95%CI 4.26 to 6.39). In the analysis excluding death induced by adverse events that occurred up to 1day after the last medication, the CV mortality rate was higher than the non-CV mortality rate within 6 months (45.7% vs 27.9%, p = 0.0001). In addition, changes in serum uric acid levels from baseline to the last measurement before discontinuation were significantly associated with higher MACE risk after drug discontinuation (HR 1.14; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.26).

Conclusions

MACE and CV death were increased in the initial stage after discontinuation of febuxostat or allopurinol in patients with gout.

### Increased risk of cardiovascular events and death in the initial phase after discontinuation of febuxostat or allopurinol: another story of the CARES trial [^06fb4969]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Febuxostat is a highly selective and potent inhibitor of xanthine oxidase that has been developed to treat patients who have an insufficient response or intolerance to allopurinol. However, the adverse cardiovascular (CV) effects of febuxostat have been a concern throughout its development, and the Cardiovascular Safety of Febuxostat or Allopurinol in Patients with Gout (CARES) trial was performed as a requirement by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients with gout and major CV disease. The CARES trial suggested that the incidence of CV death was higher in the febuxostat group than in the allopurinol group. Consequently, the FDA added a boxed warning to febuxostat regarding the increased mortality risk. However, the urate-lowering efficacy and safety of febuxostat in the treatment of the hyperuricemia of gout (CONFIRMS) trial and the Long-term cardiovascular safety of febuxostat compared with allopurinol in patients with gout (FAST) trial demonstrated that febuxostat was not associated with an increased risk of death or serious adverse CV events compared with allopurinol. In addition, the risk of CV events and mortality between patients treated with febuxostat and allopurinol were similar in the subsequent nationwide retrospective cohort studies. Thus, the higher risk of CV events and mortality from febuxostat than from allopurinol remains controversial.

Regarding the increased risk of CV mortality associated with febuxostat in the CARES trial, there are previous studies that reanalysed the CARES trial data to calculate the mortality rates on the basis of the median duration of exposure to study drugs (table S12 of the previous work). In our reanalysis, a 40-fold increase in mortality was observed after allopurinol or febuxostat was discontinued. The sharp increase in mortality was thought to be associated with rapid changes in the serum uric acid levels because of the drug discontinuation (rebound hyperuricaemia), which is a known risk factor for acute gout attacks. Accordingly, we hypothesised that some CV events may share the same mechanism as those of acute gout attacks (acute inflammation induced by monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in the CV system).

### Febuxostat increases all-cause and cardiovascular mortality compared with allopurinol… [^472fec6c]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Do febuxostat and allopurinol differ with regard to cardiovascular safety. Bottom Line For patients with gout who require treatment to lower their uric acid level, allopurinol is a safer option than febuxostat. Synopsis Because gout is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events, manufacturers of medications for gout, such as febuxostat, have been asked to perform safety trials. The authors of this trial recruited 6, 190 patients with known cardiovascular disease and gout with a serum uric acid level greater than 7. 0 mg per dL, or greater than
6. 0 mg per dL if the gout was poorly controlled. The uric acid level was measured after a one- to three-week washout period. The mean age of participants was 64 years, 84% were men, and 70% were white.

This was a noninferiority study comparing febuxostat with allopurinol, with noninferior defined as a less than 30% increase in the risk of a combined cardiovascular end point. The mean duration of treatment was approximately two years, and the mean duration of follow-up was just less than three years. Notably, more than one-half of the patients discontinued the study drug, with similar rates between the study groups. Near five years, the mortality curves separated, with higher cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in the febuxostat group. Specifically, cardiovascular mortality was 3. 2% in the allopurinol group and
4. 3% in the febuxostat group, while the all-cause mortality was also higher in the febuxostat group compared with the allopurinol group. The overall dropout risk was 56%, which is a concern.

Notably, febuxostat was not any better for symptom control, with episodes of flare-ups similar between the groups. Study design: Randomized controlled trial.

5.1 Cardiovascular Death

In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study, gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths, 2.7% in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098) as compared to 1.8% in allopurinol group (56 of 3,092;). febuxostat was similar to allopurinol for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Because of the increased risk of CV death, febuxostat should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Inform patients about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

5.2 Gout Flares

After initiation of febuxostat, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits.

### Effect of allopurinol on cardiovascular outcomes in hyperuricemic patients: a cohort study [^40b78c73]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperuricemia and gout have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Allopurinol is an effective urate-lowering drug. Whether lowering of urate by allopurinol improves the cardiovascular risk in hyperuricemic patients remains to be established.

Objective

Our objective was to investigate the effect of allopurinol on cardiovascular outcomes in hyperuricemic patients in an observational setting.

Methods

We had access to a study population consisting of all patients from Funen County, Denmark with high urate levels (≥ 6 mg/dL) from 1992 to 2010. We linked 4 registries; all blood samples, all in- and outpatient contacts in hospitals, all reimbursed prescriptions and causes of death. We identified all incident allopurinol users and matched them 1:1 to nonusers of urate-lowering therapy, with similar urate levels, by using propensity scores. Hazard ratios were calculated using competing risk regression model, with respect to Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration composite outcome (myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death) and all-cause mortality.

Results

Among 65,971 patients with hyperuricemia, we found 7127 patients on allopurinol treatment. In the propensity score-matched cohort we found a hazard ratio of 0.89 (95% confidence interval, 0.81–0.97) for the main outcome among allopurinol treated compared with nonusers of allopurinol. The corresponding hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 0.68 (95% confidence interval, 0.62–0.74).

Conclusion

Allopurinol treatment is associated with a decreased cardiovascular risk among hyperuricemic patients.

Discussion

In this large population-based cohort study, we found a 22% increased risk of CV events and 66% of all-cause mortality, associated with the use of allopurinol compared to benzbromarone, which would correspond to a 1-year NNT with benzbromarone of 277 patients for the composite CV event and 115 for all-cause mortality. The follow-up stratified analysis showed the difference in the risk of non-fatal CV events and all-cause mortality was relatively consistent across all follow-up periods. The IR of CV mortality was numerically higher among allopurinol users than benzbromarone. In our subgroup analysis of high CV risk patients, we found no difference in the risk of non-fatal CV events but increased risk of all-cause mortality among allopurinol vs. benzbromarone users (Graphical abstract). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that directly compared CV effect of allopurinol vs. benzbromarone among patients with gout.

Similar to benzbromarone that exhibits pleiotropic effects, allopurinol has shown effects of scavenging oxygen radicals, improving insulin sensitivity, and anti-inflammatory actions.XO inhibitors lower not only SU levels but also XO activity, both of which lead to NO depletion. Due to this reason, XO inhibitors have long been the primary pharmacologic candidate to modulate CV risk, based on their theoretically greater blockade of oxidative stress compared to that of uricosuric agents. However, most gout patients are under-excreters rather than over-producers of uric acids. Consistent with this, genome-wide association studies revealed that the genetic determinants for hyperuricaemia and/or gout are primarily linked to disturbed urate excretion. Therefore, the role of intracellular XO activity regarding the increased CV risk among gout patients is less compelling than hyperuricaemia itself.

### Cardiovascular safety of febuxostat compared to allopurinol for the treatment of gout: a systematic and meta-analysis [^f7bfd1ed]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The present study suggests compared with allopurinol, the use of febuxostat results in significantly decreased risks of urgent coronary revascularization and stroke. Initiation of febuxostat did not increase the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction, the cardiovascular related mortality and all‐cause mortality. Subgroup analyses according to age, population and study design showed that the febuxostat treatment could significantly reduce the occurrence of stroke in patients with age ≥ 65 years and white race (≥ 70%).

Febuxostat is a urate‐lowering drug that was approved for the management of gout by the EMA, the US FDA and the China FDA (CFDA). The CARES reported an increased risk of death in patients in the febuxostat group, prompting the FDA to change febuxostat's approval status to be adopted only as a second‐line urate‐lowering drug. By contrast, several recent clinical trials do not support the finding of an increased all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular risk of febuxostat. 10, 14, 24, 26 Our meta‐analysis found that febuxostat users did not have a significantly different risk of cardiovascular events or all‐cause mortality compared with allopurinol users.

### Allopurinol and cardiovascular outcomes in adults with hypertension [^c1bd2951]. Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Allopurinol lowers blood pressure in adolescents and has other vasoprotective effects. Whether similar benefits occur in older individuals remains unclear. We hypothesized that allopurinol is associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes in older adults with hypertension. Data from the United Kingdom Clinical Research Practice Datalink were used. Multivariate Cox-proportional hazard models were applied to estimate hazard ratios for stroke and cardiac events (defined as myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome) associated with allopurinol use over a 10-year period in adults aged > 65 years with hypertension. A propensity-matched design was used to reduce potential for confounding. Allopurinol exposure was a time-dependent variable and was defined as any exposure and then as high (≥ 300 mg daily) or low-dose exposure. A total of 2032 allopurinol-exposed patients and 2032 matched nonexposed patients were studied. Allopurinol use was associated with a significantly lower risk of both stroke (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.32–0.80) and cardiac events (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.43–0.87) than nonexposed control patients. In exposed patients, high-dose treatment with allopurinol (n = 1052) was associated with a significantly lower risk of both stroke (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.36–0.94) and cardiac events (hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.46–0.93) than low-dose treatment (n = 980). Allopurinol use is associated with lower rates of stroke and cardiac events in older adults with hypertension, particularly at higher doses. Prospective clinical trials are needed to evaluate whether allopurinol improves cardiovascular outcomes in adults with hypertension.

### Increased risk of cardiovascular events and death in the initial phase after discontinuation of febuxostat or allopurinol: another story of the CARES trial [^b797ec84]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this reanalysis of the CARES trial data of patients with gout and established CV disease, a sudden increase in MACE, CV death compared with non-CV death, and adverse events adjudicated as CV death compared with non-CV death were observed in the initial stage after discontinuation of the study drugs. In addition, changes in the serum uric acid levels from baseline to the last measurement before discontinuation were significantly associated with higher MACE risk after drug discontinuation.

MACE after discontinuation of the study drugs in FAST trials

Similar to our results, a threefold increase in CV events after study drug discontinuation was observed in the long-term cardiovascular safety of febuxostat compared with allopurinol in patients with gout (the FAST trial), which was calculated on the basis of the median duration of exposure to study drugs (0.31 CV event/day; 413 CV events/1324 days (median duration of on-treatment follow-up) versus 0.90 CV event/day; 128 CV events/143 days (median duration all follow-up–median duration of on-treatment follow-up)). The FAST trial was able to follow-up study patients until the end of the trial by telephone and other personal contact and by record linkage to national hospitalisation and death records (except in the small proportion of patients who withdrew completely). In addition, there were lower rates of treatment discontinuation (32.4% in the febuxostat group and 16.5% in the allopurinol group) and much better rates of patient follow-up, with only 5.8% of patients withdrawing from all follow-up in the FAST trial. Considering these two points, an untold message from the FAST study may be increases in cardiovascular events after drug discontinuation. In the CARES and FAST trials, the cardiovascular risk of febuxostat administration compared with allopurinol administration showed different results. However, an increase in cardiovascular events was observed after study drug discontinuation in both studies.

Safety of uric acid–lowering therapy in CKD: The ERT assessed the safety of uric acid–lowering therapy and found that uric acid lowering did not increase adverse events among people with CKD and particularly focused on risk of cutaneous reactions and hypersensitivity (pooled RR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.60–1.65) and hepatotoxicity (pooled RR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.37–2.30); uric acid–lowering therapy was also found not to modify the risk of cardiovascular events or all-cause mortality in people with CKD. In the open-label Allopurinol and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients With Ischemic Heart Disease (ALL-HEART) randomized trial, 5721 people aged ≥ 60 years with ischemic heart disease but no history of gout were included, and allopurinol did not modify cardiovascular risk compared with standard care (HR for the composite primary outcome of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.89–1.21).

### Febuxostat [^8fdbf57c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: CARDIOVASCULAR DEATH

Gout patients with established cardiovascular (CV) disease treated with febuxostat had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol in a CV outcomes study [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

 Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat. Febuxostat should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [see Indications and Usage (1)].

### Comparative cardiovascular risk of allopurinol versus febuxostat in patients with gout: a nation-wide cohort study [^c92b3500]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare cardiovascular (CV) risk among gout patients initiating allopurinol vs febuxostat.

Methods

Using 2002–2015 Korean National Health Insurance Service data for the entire Korean population, we conducted a cohort study on gout patients initiating allopurinol or febuxostat. The primary outcome was a composite CV end point of myocardial infarction, stroke/transient ischaemic attack, or coronary revascularization. Secondary outcomes were individual components of the primary outcome, and all-cause mortality. We used propensity score-matching with a 4:1 ratio for allopurinol and febuxostat initiators to control for confounding. Competing risk analyses were done for non-fatal outcomes accounting for deaths.

Results

We included 39 640 allopurinol initiators propensity score-matched on 9910 febuxostat initiators. The mean age was 59.1 years and 78.4% were male. The incidence rate per 100 person-years for the primary outcome was 1.89 for allopurinol and 1.84 for febuxostat initiators. The corresponding hazard ratio comparing allopurinol vs febuxostat initiators was 1.09 (95% CI: 0.90, 1.32). No significant difference was found for the secondary outcomes, including all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 0.96; 95% CI: 0.79, 1.16). Subgroup analyses limited to those at high CV risk and to equipotent-dose initiators (i.e. allopurinol ⩾300 mg/day vs febuxostat ⩾40 mg/day) showed similar results.

Conclusion

Overall, this large Korean population-based study suggests no difference in the risk of non-fatal CV events and all-cause mortality between allopurinol and febuxostat initiators. These findings are consistent with the recent US Medicare population study, although the current study population consisted of younger Asians.

### Allopurinol versus usual care in UK patients with ischaemic heart disease (ALL-HEART): a multicentre, prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint trial [^aadd582b]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Allopurinol is a urate-lowering therapy used to treat patients with gout. Previous studies have shown that allopurinol has positive effects on several cardiovascular parameters. The ALL-HEART study aimed to determine whether allopurinol therapy improves major cardiovascular outcomes in patients with ischaemic heart disease.

Methods

ALL-HEART was a multicentre, prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint trial done in 18 regional centres in England and Scotland, with patients recruited from 424 primary care practices. Eligible patients were aged 60 years or older, with ischaemic heart disease but no history of gout. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), using a central web-based randomisation system accessed via a web-based application or an interactive voice response system, to receive oral allopurinol up-titrated to a dose of 600 mg daily (300 mg daily in participants with moderate renal impairment at baseline) or to continue usual care. The primary outcome was the composite cardiovascular endpoint of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or cardiovascular death. The hazard ratio (allopurinol vs usual care) in a Cox proportional hazards model was assessed for superiority in a modified intention-to-treat analysis (excluding randomly assigned patients later found to have met one of the exclusion criteria). The safety analysis population included all patients in the modified intention-to-treat usual care group and those who took at least one dose of randomised medication in the allopurinol group. This study is registered with the EU Clinical Trials Register, EudraCT 2013-003559-39, and ISRCTN, ISRCTN32017426.

Findings

Between Feb 7, 2014, and Oct 2, 2017, 5937 participants were enrolled and then randomly assigned to receive allopurinol or usual care. After exclusion of 216 patients after randomisation, 5721 participants (mean age 72·0 years [SD 6·8], 4321 [75·5%] males, and 5676 [99·2%] white) were included in the modified intention-to-treat population, with 2853 in the allopurinol group and 2868 in the usual care group. Mean follow-up time in the study was 4·8 years (1·5). There was no evidence of a difference between the randomised treatment groups in the rates of the primary endpoint. 314 (11·0%) participants in the allopurinol group (2·47 events per 100 patient-years) and 325 (11·3%) in the usual care group (2·37 events per 100 patient-years) had a primary endpoint (hazard ratio [HR] 1·04 [95% CI 0·89–1·21], p = 0·65). 288 (10·1%) participants in the allopurinol group and 303 (10·6%) participants in the usual care group died from any cause (HR 1·02 [95% CI 0·87–1·20], p = 0·77).

Interpretation

In this large, randomised clinical trial in patients aged 60 years or older with ischaemic heart disease but no history of gout, there was no difference in the primary outcome of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or cardiovascular death between participants randomised to allopurinol therapy and those randomised to usual care.

### Effect of allopurinol in chronic kidney disease progression and cardiovascular risk [^5a5850df]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Hyperuricemia is associated with hypertension, inflammation, renal disease progression, and cardiovascular disease. However, no data are available regarding the effect of allopurinol in patients with chronic kidney disease.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We conducted a prospective, randomized trial of 113 patients with estimated GFR (eGFR) < 60 ml/min. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with allopurinol 100 mg/d (n = 57) or to continue the usual therapy (n = 56). Clinical, biochemical, and inflammatory parameters were measured at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 months of treatment. The objectives of study were: (1) renal disease progression; (2) cardiovascular events; and (3) hospitalizations of any causes.

Results

Serum uric acid and C-reactive protein levels were significantly decreased in subjects treated with allopurinol. In the control group, eGFR decreased 3.3 ± 1.2 ml/min per 1.73 m², and in the allopurinol group, eGFR increased 1.3 ± 1.3 ml/min per 1.73 m² after 24 months. Allopurinol treatment slowed down renal disease progression independently of age, gender, diabetes, C-reactive protein, albuminuria, and renin-angiotensin system blockers use. After a mean follow-up time of 23.4 ± 7.8 months, 22 patients suffered a cardiovascular event. Diabetes mellitus, previous coronary heart disease, and C-reactive protein levels increased cardiovascular risk. Allopurinol treatment reduces risk of cardiovascular events in 71% compared with standard therapy.

Conclusions

Allopurinol decreases C-reactive protein and slows down the progression of renal disease in patients with chronic kidney disease. In addition, allopurinol reduces cardiovascular and hospitalization risk in these subjects.

### Cardiovascular safety of febuxostat compared to allopurinol for the treatment of gout: a systematic and meta-analysis [^8945048d]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Older individuals have higher rates of major cardiovascular events, coexistence of multiple diseases, accompanied by multiple syndromes, multiple medications, and natural decline in body function. Gout currently plagues many old patients. Febuxostat has minimal effects on other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine metabolism and is metabolized mainly by glucuronide formation and oxidation in the liver. Febuxostat has been shown to be safe according to the available clinical data and can be used in treating patients with allopurinol hypersensitivity and renal insufficiency. 27 Since the application of febuxostat to the clinic, there have been many meta‐analysis on the effectiveness and safety of febuxostat compared with allopurinol in the treatment of patients with gout. 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 Cardiovascular events were important concern associated with febuxostat treatment. However, the meta‐analysis of cardiovascular safety of febuxostat compared with allopurinol in the elderly was not reported. Several clinical trials were conducted to investigate the cardiovascular safety of febuxostat compared with allopurinol in patients with gout with known cardiovascular comorbidities, but the results have been conflicting. Some studies showed that the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events in febuxostat group was numerically higher than allopurinol group, although it was not statistically significantly. 3, 4, 33 Some studies found that initiation of febuxostat compared with allopurinol was not associated with a change in risk of cardiovascular events. 14 The subgroup analysis according to age of our meta‐analysis adds new evidence regarding the safety of febuxostat in older patients.

### Association between allopurinol and cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality in diabetes: a retrospective, population-based cohort study [^3ba3d966]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

To assess the association between allopurinol and mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in an allopurinol-treated diabetes cohort.

Materials and Methods

We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study in Ontario, Canada. Eligible subjects were ≥ 66years old with diabetes and a first prescription for allopurinol between 1 April, 2002 and 31 March, 2012 and were followed until 31 March, 2016. The primary outcome was a composite: all-cause mortality, non-fatal cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, revascularization procedure, or stroke) or congestive heart failure (CHF). Secondary outcomes were components of the primary outcome and pneumonia as a negative tracer. Allopurinol was modelled as time-varying exposed versus unexposed, daily dose category and cumulative dose using sex-specific multivariable Cox proportional hazards models.

Results

Over a median follow-up of 4.65years (interquartile range 1.79–7.81), 16266/23 103 males and 10571/15 313 females experienced the primary outcome. Allopurinol was associated with a reduction in the primary outcome [adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) 0.77 (95% confidence interval 0.75–0.80) and 0.81 (0.78–0.84) for males and females, respectively], driven by marked reductions in all-cause mortality and modest reductions in cardiovascular events/CHF. There was no effect of cumulative allopurinol dose on any outcome, and allopurinol was also associated with reduced risk of pneumonia in males [aHR 0.88 (0.83, 0.93)].

Conclusions

Allopurinol was associated with reduced mortality and cardiovascular outcomes. However, lack of cumulative dose effect and a positive tracer outcome in males suggests residual bias. Future research assessing whether allopurinol prevents vascular complications in diabetes requires a clinical trial.

### Mortality in patients with gout treated with allopurinol: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f987fc69]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Urate-lowering therapy (predominantly allopurinol) is highly effective as a treatment for gout, but its wider long-term effects remain unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to ascertain the association between mortality and the use of allopurinol in patients with gout.

Method

Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to August 2018. Articles eligible for inclusion used a cohort design and examined cardiovascular or all-cause mortality in patients diagnosed with gout and prescribed allopurinol. Information on study characteristics, design, sample size, and mortality risk estimates were extracted. Article quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Included articles were described in a narrative synthesis and, where possible, risk estimate data were pooled.

Results

Four articles reported a hazard ratio (HR) risk estimate for all-cause mortality in patients with gout using allopurinol, and 2 of these also reported cardiovascular mortality. Two articles found allopurinol to be protective in patients with gout, 1 found no statistically significant association, and 1 found no statistically significant effect of escalation of allopurinol dosage on all-cause or cardiovascular-related mortality. Data pooling was possible for all-cause mortality and found no association between allopurinol use in patients with gout and all-cause mortality compared to patients with gout not using allopurinol (adjusted HR 0.80 [95% confidence interval 0.60–1.05]).

Conclusion

There was no significant association between all-cause mortality and allopurinol use in people with gout. However, the number of included studies was small, suggesting that further studies are needed.

### Uric acid in heart disease: a new C-reactive protein? [^d3518676]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review and interpret the recently published data on hyperuricemia and cardiovascular disease to present an opinion on the nature of link between serum uric acid concentration and the risk for cardiovascular outcomes, and to comment on its implications for clinical practice.

Recent Findings

Evidence has accumulated in prospective observational studies that link hyperuricemia among younger adults with the risk of subsequent hypertension. Such associations have been observed with respect to insulin resistance, diabetes, and other cardiovascular risk factors. Newer data confirm the link between hyperuricemia and cardiovascular mortality. The use of allopurinol has been shown to be associated with reduced mortality risk in longer term observational studies and with reduced blood pressure in short-term randomized controlled trials. None of these findings is confounded by traditional risk factors.

Summary

The available evidence has established a link between hyperuricemia and cardiovascular disease and this may be causal. Without waiting for the resolution of causality arguments, one can start using serum uric acid concentration as an inexpensive cardiovascular risk marker.

### Evaluation of the relationship between serum urate levels, clinical manifestations of gout, and death from cardiovascular causes in patients receiving febuxostat or allopurinol in an outcomes trial [^678ea5fe]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The mainstay of chronic gout management is reduction of serum urate levels and maintenance of these levels at < 6.0 mg/dl. The urate‐lowering xanthine oxidase inhibitors are considered first‐line pharmacologic therapy for hyperuricemia in patients with gout. Currently, allopurinol and febuxostat are the only available xanthine oxidase inhibitors.

The Cardiovascular Safety of Febuxostat or Allopurinol in Patients With Gout and Cardiovascular Comorbidities (CARES) trial (identifier: NCT01101035) examined rates of major CV events in patients with gout and CVD who received treatment with febuxostat or allopurinol. The CARES trial has the longest study duration (median follow‐up period of 32 months), and largest data set (n = 6,190) of any randomized controlled trial comparing febuxostat with allopurinol. In this study, the proportion of patients with the primary end point (a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and unstable angina with urgent revascularization) was noninferior between febuxostat and allopurinol. However, in the secondary end point analysis, the rate of death from CV causes was greater in patients who received treatment with febuxostat compared with patients who received treatment with allopurinol (4.3% and 3.2%, respectively; hazard ratio [HR] 1.34). In addition, prespecified subgroup analyses were performed in order to investigate the potential effects of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) use, since NSAIDs are known to be associated with CVD. These analyses found that both the use of NSAIDs and absence of low‐dose aspirin at baseline were associated with death from CV causes (unadjusted P < 0.05 for both comparisons). With the exception of NSAID use for gout flair prophylaxis and/or treatment, use of NSAIDs and low‐dose aspirin were not systematically monitored during the study. In an additional analysis, all‐cause mortality was higher with febuxostat treatment compared with allopurinol treatment (HR 1.22) as a result of an imbalance in the rates of death from CV causes.

The objective of this exploratory analysis was to evaluate data from the CARES trial to investigate if serum urate levels, gout flares, and tophi burden were associated with death from CV causes after febuxostat or allopurinol treatment.

Table 1
Selected Patient Characteristics and Outcomes in Patients With Gout Initiating Febuxostat or Allopurinol (1:3 PS Matched)

Prompted by the added boxed warnings for febuxostat based on cardiovascular and all‐cause mortality risk noted in the CARES trial, we conducted an updated analysis from the observational study evaluating the comparative safety of febuxostat. Compared with allopurinol, febuxostat was not associated with higher risk of MACE or all‐cause mortality in patients with gout who did or did not have baseline CVD. These findings are also concordant with FAST results. 4 Our results are largely consistent with the results from the CARES trial; however, the CARES trial found higher cardiovascular and all‐cause mortality risk associated with febuxostat. Although, questions have been raised regarding the biologic plausibility of these results given a high dropout rate (≈50%) and occurrence of deaths (≈85%) after treatment continuation. 3 Our findings are reassuring to patients with intolerability to allopurinol who require treatment with febuxostat, as we did not observe elevated cardiovascular or all‐cause mortality even in patients with a history of CVD. Our study has several strengths including its incident new‐user and active‐comparator design with the use of PS matching, which minimizes confounding. Our findings are also generalizable to the large population of older patients with gout. The primary as‐treated approach helps reduce bias caused by nonadherence to medications, a major limitation of the CARES trial. However, residual confounding cannot be ruled out, and misclassification bias is possible because participant eligibility, covariates, and outcome identification were largely dependent on diagnosis codes.

In conclusion, this large real‐world data cohort trial showed that febuxostat initiation was not associated with higher cardiovascular risk, including cardiovascular or all‐cause mortality, compared with allopurinol among older patients with gout who did or did not have baseline CVD.

### Management of gout in chronic kidney disease: a G-CAN consensus statement on the research priorities [^d006d528]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Cardiovascular risk with XOIs

In the general population, CKD is known to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). There has been debate about the use of febuxostat in people with CVD given the results of the Cardiovascular Safety of Febuxostat and Allopurinol in Patients with Gout and Cardiovascular Morbidities (CARES) trialand the Febuxostat versus Allopurinol Streamlined Trial (FAST). CARES was a large RCT in people with gout and pre-existing CVD conducted in the USA that found no increased risk related to treatment with febuxostat compared with allopurinol for the primary end point, which was a composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or unstable angina with urgent revascularization (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.87–1.23). People with an eGFR of < 30 ml/min/1.73 m² were excluded from the study but the risk of these events did not differ in those with normal, mild or moderate kidney impairment. However, pre-specified secondary analyses revealed an increased risk of cardiovascular-related death (HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.03–1.73) and death from any cause (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01–1.47) in those receiving febuxostat compared with allopurinol; unfortunately, there was no stratification by renal function in the secondary analysis. Although there are a number of issues with the CARES study, it raised issues about the relative safety of allopurinol and febuxostat in people with gout and CVD and led to a black box warning for febuxostat use. The results of the CARES study have been challenged by FAST, another large RCT conducted in European countries, which also compared the cardiovascular safety of febuxostat and allopurinol in patients with gout. Enrollees in FAST had at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor, but patients with advanced CKD were excluded. Febuxostat was non-inferior to allopurinol for the primary end point (a composite of hospitalization for non-fatal myocardial infarction or biomarker-positive acute coronary syndrome; non-fatal stroke; or cardiovascular death). In contrast to the CARES trial, FAST found that treatment with febuxostat was not associated with an increase in cardiovascular death or all-cause death. Overall, fewer deaths occurred in the febuxostat group than in the allopurinol group. When comparing the CARES trial and FAST, FAST had more complete follow-up and better event adjudication (linked to national databases), which provides reassurance about the use of febuxostat, although the findings cannot be directly extrapolated to patients with advanced CKD. Whether CKD modulates this risk or whether febuxostat has a better cardiovascular safety profile than allopurinol in this population remains to be determined.

### Cardiovascular risk associated with allopurinol vs. benzbromarone in patients with gout [^5edd10c1]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

In the context of high prevalence of gout and associated CV outcomes, there has been a need for information on the comparative CV safety of individual urate-lowering drugs. Under such backgrounds, a number of studies have focused on the CV effects of XO inhibitors such as allopurinol and febuxostat because of their capability to suppress both XO activity and hyperuricaemia and to reduce oxidative stress. However, two recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing allopurinol and febuxostat, the CARES (Cardiovascular Safety of Febuxostat and Allopurinol in Patients with Gout and CV Morbidities) and FAST (Long-term Cardiovascular Safety of Febuxostat Compared with Allopurinol in Patients with Gout), raised a question on CV benefits of XO inhibition, showing no relationship between CV risk and the potency of individual XO inhibitors, and suggested that individual urate lowering drugs may have different CV effects.

Unlike XO inhibitors, data on CV effects of uricosuric agents have been sparse. A recent large Medicare study reported a decreased risk of CV events and all-cause mortality associated with probenecid compared to allopurinol, possibly through other mechanisms than urate-lowering action. Benzbromarone is another uricosuric agent inhibiting a renal tubular transporter, URAT-1. It shows high efficacy and safety in general even for patients with chronic kidney disease, but was not approved in the USA and withdrawn from some European countries based on several hepatotoxicity reports. However, withdrawal decision of the drug has often been questioned based on the risk estimated < 1:17 000. Currently, it is still actively used in Asia including South Korea, some countries of Europe, and South America to treat gout. The 2016 EULAR guideline for gout management recommends to use benzbromarone alone or in combination with allopurinol when the initial treatment with allopurinol is not effective enough to lower serum urate (SU) levels.

If febuxostat leads to a higher risk of cardiovascular events as compared to allopurinol are debatable. The authors concluded that febuxostat had a better safety profile compared to allopurinol. However, we also believe that there are three important limitations that should be further discussed.

First, this study was a pooled analysis of nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and six observational studies including 257 851 patients. It was unknown why the authors selected RCTs and observational studies simultaneously in the same meta‐analysis. RCT is the preferred type of study when included in the meta‐analysis of intervention. Compared with RCTs, an observational study is usually at higher risk of selection bias which can weaken the reliability of the conclusion. Moreover, combining RCTs and cohort studies in meta‐analysis as done in this article was inappropriate because different study designs and comparison groups may lead to high methodological variability or heterogeneity between studies. Gao et al.documented that febuxostat had a lower risk of urgent coronary revascularization and stroke compared with allopurinol. The outcome was inconsistent in our meta‐analysis including RCTs, but similar to our meta‐analysis included cohort studies (Table 1).

Table 1
Meta‐analysis of studies that compared the safety of febuxostat therapy and allopurinol treated patients with gout during follow‐up

Second, a thorough literature search is a very important process in a systematic review and meta‐analysis, which can influence the final results. Unfortunately, two eligible published studies (with a relatively large study sample, n 1 = 2426 participants and n 2 = 10 519) were missed by the search in this meta‐analysis.

Another probably missing critical point is the quality assessment of the included studies. It is a general principle that the high quality of a meta‐analysis directly relies on the included studies' high quality. Several quality assessment scales for different types of studies, which can enable researchers to spot the possible biases in the included studies, are available for this purpose.

We appreciate the authors' efforts in this study and hope that the points we mentioned above will provide a foundation for further discussion.

CKD uric acid–lowering therapy — benefits and safety: Systematic review of the management of gout by the American College of Rheumatology found strong evidence for uric acid lowering in people with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due to gout, or frequent gout flares; some of whom also had CKD. The ERT assessed the safety of uric acid–lowering therapy and found that uric acid lowering did not increase adverse events among people with CKD and particularly focused on risk of cutaneous reactions and hypersensitivity (pooled RR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.60–1.65) and hepatotoxicity (pooled RR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.37–2.30). Uric acid–lowering therapy was also found not to modify the risk of cardiovascular events or all-cause mortality in people with CKD. In the open-label ALL-HEART randomized trial, 5721 people aged ≥ 60 years with ischemic heart disease but no history of gout were included, and allopurinol did not modify cardiovascular risk compared with standard care (HR for the composite primary outcome of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.89–1.21).

2 METHODS

2.1 Search strategy and selection criteria

We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines in this systematic review and meta‐analysis. 11 We systematically searched clinical trials of febuxostat and allopurinol treatment of gout in the elderly in PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library database and reviews of relevant articles from January 2000 to April 4, 2021. The following terms were used: "Gout" "Febuxostat" "Allopurinol" OR "Clinical Trial" "adverse events". Language of publication did not influence article selection. Titles and abstracts were screened to exclude ineligible studies.

Studies were included if they met the following criteria: (i) clinical trials; (ii) treatment status as treated with febuxostat and allopurinol;(iii) long‐term follow up of patients.

Exclusion criteria: (i) Documents in languages other than Chinese and English. (ii) There are no statistics on cardiovascular and death‐related adverse events for the outcome indicators, and the data is incomplete. (iii) Patients with severe liver and kidney dysfunction, unstable vital signs, long‐term alcoholism, and other conditions that will affect the resolution of indicators (iv) Patients with secondary gout.

Gao LG and Bin Wang screened titles, abstracts, and full text of papers identified in our search and assessed for risk of bias.

The titles of the primary 240 publications identified were reviewed and 224 were discarded although they were identified by our search terms. The studies were also discarded because the enrolled patients with acute hyperuricemia or secondary hyperuricemia (e.g. end‐stage renal disease). Finally, 14 publications were chosen for the meta‐analysis.

2.2 Study groups and clinical evaluation

The study population in the present meta‐analysis consisted of 257 851 patients. Patients were categorized by treatment status as treated with febuxostat or allopurinol. The details in the pharmacologic intervention were listed in Table 1. All patients underwent complete clinical evaluations and fulfilled the diagnostic criteria. Outcomes of major events from each trial were selected, which were consisted of cardiovascular related mortality, major vascular events (including myocardial infarction or other acute coronary syndrome, coronary revascularization, or stroke, etc.) and all‐cause mortality.

### Assessment of cardiovascular risk in older patients with gout initiating febuxostat versus allopurinol: population-based cohort study [^71674783]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperuricemia and gout are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol and febuxostat, are the mainstay of urate-lowering treatment for gout and may have different effects on cardiovascular risk in patients with gout.

Methods

Using US Medicare claims data (2008–2013), we conducted a cohort study for comparative cardiovascular safety of initiating febuxostat versus allopurinol among patients with gout ≥ 65 years of age. The primary outcome was a composite end point of hospitalization for myocardial infarction or stroke. Secondary outcomes were individual end points of hospitalization for myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, new and recurrent heart failure, and all-cause mortality. We used propensity score matching with a ratio of 1:3 to control for confounding. We estimated incidence rates and hazard ratios for primary and secondary outcomes in the propensity score-matched cohorts of febuxostat and allopurinol initiators.

Results

We included 24936 febuxostat initiators propensity score-matched to 74808 allopurinol initiators. The median age was 76 years, 52% were male, and 12% had cardiovascular disease at baseline. The incidence rate per 100 person-years for the primary outcome was 3.43 in febuxostat and 3.36 in allopurinol initiators. The hazard ratio for the primary outcome was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.94–1.08) in the febuxostat group compared with the allopurinol group. Risk of secondary outcomes including all-cause mortality was similar in both groups, except for a modestly decreased risk of heart failure exacerbation (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.91–0.99) in febuxostat initiators. The hazard ratio for all-cause mortality associated with long-term use of febuxostat (> 3 years) was 1.25 (95% CI, 0.56–2.80) versus allopurinol. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses consistently showed similar cardiovascular risk in both groups.

Conclusions

Among a cohort of 99744 older Medicare patients with gout, overall there was no difference in the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, new-onset heart failure, coronary revascularization, or all-cause mortality between patients initiating febuxostat compared with allopurinol. However, there seemed to be a trend toward an increased, albeit not statistically significant, risk for all-cause mortality in patients who used febuxostat for > 3 years versus allopurinol for > 3 years. The risk of heart failure exacerbation was slightly lower in febuxostat initiators.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — Practice Point 3.14.2 on agent selection for uric acid–lowering therapy — Prescribe xanthine oxidase inhibitors rather than uricosuric agents in people with CKD G3a–G5 who require uric acid–lowering therapy; xanthine oxidase inhibitors reduce serum uric acid by reducing purine metabolism, whereas uricosuric agents' effect is blunted with reduced GFR. In the CARES randomized trial of allopurinol versus febuxostat in 6190 people with gout and prior cardiovascular disease, the interventions were noninferior for the composite primary cardiovascular outcome, but overall and cardiovascular mortality were higher with febuxostat (HR for death from any cause: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.01–1.47; HR for cardiovascular death: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.03–1.73). Observational data suggest diuretics increase serum uric acid, and post hoc analyses of RCTs in T2D report SGLT2i reduce serum uric acid and appeared to reduce gout adverse event reports or initiations of uric acid–lowering therapy.

### Gout in indigenous people: inequity and culturally appropriate management [^16934a10]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

The delayed right to appropriate management is a right denied

Gout is known to be associated with various comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, chronic kidney disease, ischaemic heart disease, and hyperlipidaemia. Untangling the relation between hyperuricaemia, gout, and cardiovascular disease has been complicated at least in part because the drug treatments used to treat gout flares have been reported to have differential effects on cardiovascular disease risk. For example, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) have been reported to increase the risk of cardiovascular eventsand colchicine to reduce the risk. Additionally, allopurinol, the most commonly used urate-lowering treatment, might reduce cardiovascular disease risk. While mendelian randomisation studies do not support a causative role for hyperuricaemia in most of the cardiovascular disease risk factors associated with gout, identification and management of these comorbidities remain important given their impact on cardiovascular disease risk.

### Associations of serum urate and cardiovascular events in a clinical Trial of Interleukin-1 β blockade [^1c093c02]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Markedly elevated SU predicts MACE, CV death, and all-cause mortality. After adjustment for an inclusive set of covariables that may confound associations between SU and CV risk, markedly elevated SU still independently predicted CV death and all-cause mortality. However, this inclusive multivariate analysis extinguished the association between SU and MACE, with the most impactful covariables being eGFR, diuretic use, and sex. In the parsimonious model, which only adjusted for a minimum set of the most likely confounders with established effects on both SU and CV events, SU independently predicted all 3 endpoints. IL-1β blockade, which reduced incident gout and atherosclerotic events, did not attenuate these associations. When stratifying by eGFR, participants with normal kidney function had significant associations between ascending SU and CV death and all-cause mortality, but not MACE. Participants with gout had increased CV risk compared to those without gout, but their risk was not associated with baseline SU. This study presents a large-scale validation of prior observations of associations between SU and CV events and mortality in over 10,000 participants and builds on these findings by leveraging this robust and unique data set to explore novel mechanistic questions.

These results raise an important question: why do we observe associations between SU and CV events and mortality? Broadly speaking, the relationships are either due to direct causation, indirect causation through an intermediary, or confounding by shared comorbid conditions or risk factors. A direct causal relationship would be best assessed in a randomized controlled trial. A small randomized controlled trial in patients with chronic kidney disease found a significant reduction in broadly defined CV events (inclusive of coronary artery, cerebrovascular, and peripheral arterial endpoints) in participants randomly allocated to allopurinol compared to usual care. However, the ALL-HEART study, the largest CV outcomes trial to date of urate-lowering therapy, did not identify a reduction in CV events in those randomly allocated to allopurinol. Of note, the baseline SU of trial participants was in the normal range, there were few participants with kidney disease, and participants with gout were excluded, further limiting the number of patients with hyperuricemia. Moreover, ALL-HEART did not utilize a placebo control, and 59% of participants allocated to allopurinol either never received or discontinued treatment before the end of the study. These considerations prevent us from drawing a definitive conclusion regarding a causal link between hyperuricemia and ASCVD in ALL-HEART.

### Cardiovascular safety of febuxostat or allopurinol in patients with gout [^99f22b52]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

The study CARES was published by White WB and colleagues in 2018 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Gout. In the CARES study, the trial question was: is febuxostat noninferior to allopurinol in patients with gout and major cardiovascular coexisting conditions? In the CARES study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the CARES study, the population was: 6190 patients (1534 female, 4656 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with gout and major cardiovascular coexisting conditions. The key exclusion criteria were secondary hyperuricemia due to myeloproliferative disorder, xanthinuria, active peptic ulcer disease, history of cancer, receiving urate-lowering therapy. In the CARES study, the interventions were: n = 3098 febuxostat (adjusted according to serum urate) n = 3092 allopurinol (adjusted according to kidney function). In the CARES study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal CVA, or UA requiring urgent revascularization (10.8% vs. 10.4%; HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.68). In the CARES study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in death from any cause (7.8% vs. 6.4%; HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.47) Significant increase in cardiovascular death (4.3% vs. 3.2%; HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.73). In the CARES study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in overall rates of adverse major cardiovascular events. In the CARES study, the conclusion was: in patients with gout and major cardiovascular coexisting conditions, febuxostat was noninferior to allopurinol with respect to CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal CVA, or UA requiring urgent revascularization. All-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality were higher with febuxostat than with allopurinol.

### Cardiovascular risk associated with allopurinol vs. benzbromarone in patients with gout [^e43116eb]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

The urate-lowering efficacy of 100 mg/day benzbromarone is known to be superior to that of 300 mg/day allopurinol, and 300–380 mg/day allopurinol has a similar efficacy with 75–80 mg/day benzbromarone. Based on the known equipotent dose of the two drugs, dosage use patterns, and PDC of the two drugs, it is likely that a higher proportion of the benzbromarone group achieved target SU levels < 6.0 mg/dL during follow-up compared to the allopurinol group. Although the previous CARES and FAST trials do not necessarily link a greater urate-lowering efficacy or lower average SU levels with a better CV outcome, it is still worth to discuss whether successful urate-lowering therapy (ULT) might relate to better CV outcomes. The majority of CARES participants achieved target SU levels of < 6 mg/dL (61–75% of febuxostat users vs. 50–75% of allopurinol users), with similar proportions of target-achieving patients between the two groups except for the first 2 weeks. Likewise, all of FAST participants achieved the target SU levels through a lead-in phase. Moreover, these trials did not include a placebo group. Therefore, data are far limited even with the CARES and FAST trials regarding whether ULT itself is effective in reducing CV risk. The beneficial effects associated with benzbromarone vs. allopurinol in our study may, in fact, be due to more effective urate-lowering treatment with benzbromarone. An ongoing large RCT comparing allopurinol (600 mg/day) vs. usual care, the ALL-HEART study, is awaited to provide relevant information to this question in the future.

### Cardiovascular effects of urate-lowering therapies in patients with chronic gout: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8106cd44]. Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine if urate-lowering treatment (ULT) in gout can reduce cardiovascular (CV) outcomes.

Methods

Randomized trials were searched for treatment with ULT in gout. Eligible trials had to report CV safety of a ULT. Potential medications included allopurinol, febuxostat, pegloticase, rasburicase, probenecid, benzbromarone, sulphinpyrazone, losartan, fenofibrate and sodium-glucose linked transporter 2 inhibitors.

Results

A total of 3084 citations were found, with 642 duplicates. After the primary screen, 35 studies were selected for review. Several trials did not report CV events. Six were not randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Four studies reported no events in either intervention arm while the other four had 40 events in the febuxostat group (n = 3631) and 5 in allopurinol group (n = 1154). Overall, the pooled analysis did not show a significant difference between the two [febuxostat vs allopurinol: relative risk (RR) 1.69 (95% CI 0.54, 5.34), P = 0.37]. CV events did not decrease over time. Comparing shorter studies (< 52 weeks) to longer ones did not reveal any statistical differences. However, in long-term studies with febuxostat vs allopurinol, results were nearly significant, with more CVE occurring with febuxostat treatment. Comparing any ULT to placebo (eight studies, n = 2221 patients) did not demonstrate a significant difference in non-Anti-Platelet Trialists' Collaboration events [any ULT vs placebo: RR 1.47 (95% CI 0.49, 4.40), P = 0.49] or all-cause mortality [any ULT vs placebo: RR 1.45 (95% CI 0.35, 5.77), P = 0.60].

Conclusion

RCT data do not suggest differences in CV events among ULTs in gout. Trials had few events despite high-risk patients being enrolled and may have been too short to show CV reduction by controlling inflammatory attacks and lowering uric acid.

These findings support the need for cardiovascular risk management from the time of first gout consultation.

### Allopurinol versus usual care in UK patients with ischaemic heart disease (ALL-HEART): a multicentre, prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint trial [^8ac3f997]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study ALL-HEART was published by Isla S Mackenzie and colleagues in 2022 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Coronary artery disease. In the ALL-HEART study, the trial question was: what is the role of allopurinol in patients with ischemic heart disease? In the ALL-HEART study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ALL-HEART study, the population was: 5721 patients (1400 female, 4321 male). The inclusion criteria were patients aged ≥ 60 years with ischemic heart disease but no history of gout. The key exclusion criteria were history of gout; moderate-severe renal impairment; moderate-to-severe HF; significant hepatic disease; severe adverse skin reaction to any drug or significant malignancy within the past 5 years. In the ALL-HEART study, the interventions were: n = 2853 allopurinol (up-titration to an oral dose of 600 mg/day, 300 mg/day in moderate renal impairment) n = 2868 standard care (continuation of usual care). In the ALL-HEART study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death (11% vs. 11.3%; HR 0.96, 96% CI 0.82 to 1.12). In the ALL-HEART study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death from any cause (10.1% vs. 10.6%; HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.15) No significant difference in nonfatal myocardial infarction (5.5% vs. 6%; HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.21) No significant difference in cardiovascular death (3.9% vs. 3.8%; HR 1.1, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.43). In the ALL-HEART study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. significant difference in new rash during the previous 12 months (13.1% vs. 9.1%). In the ALL-HEART study, the conclusion was: in patients aged ≥ 60 years with ischemic heart disease but no history of gout, allopurinol was not superior to standard care with respect to nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death.

### Updated assessment of cardiovascular risk in older patients with gout initiating febuxostat versus allopurinol [^8f4732b6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

After applying inclusion/exclusion criteria, we identified 467 461 patients with gout aged ≥ 65 years who were enrolled in Medicare for ≥ 365 days before the index date (allopurinol = 439 563; febuxostat = 27 898). Before PS matching, the median age of febuxostat and allopurinol initiators was similar (71 versus 70 years), and 32% of febuxostat and 29% of allopurinol users had baseline CVD. After PS matching, 27 881 febuxostat initiators were matched to 83 643 allopurinol initiators. All baseline characteristics between the PS‐matched groups were well‐balanced. The mean follow‐up for febuxostat and allopurinol was 284 (SD, 370) and 339 (SD, 419) days, respectively. The HR for 3‐point MACE in PS‐matched initiators of febuxostat versus allopurinol was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.93–1.05). The result was consistent among patients with CVD (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.86–1.02). Secondary analyses were also similar (Table): myocardial infarction (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.86–1.04), stroke (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.94–1.20), cardiovascular mortality (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.93–1.10), and all‐cause mortality (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87–0.98).

### Evaluation of the relationship between serum urate levels, clinical manifestations of gout, and death from cardiovascular causes in patients receiving febuxostat or allopurinol in an outcomes trial [^e274a5e1]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

In the overall modified ITT population, gout flare rates were similar in patients who received febuxostat and those who received allopurinol and decreased during the study period regardless of whether the patient died from a CV‐related cause or not. Moreover, in patients who died of a CV‐related cause, 94% and 98% of those who received febuxostat and those who received allopurinol, respectively, did not have a reported gout flare within 3 months of death. Across different post‐baseline serum urate categories, regardless of treatment group, there was a trend toward a reduction in the rate of gout flare at lower serum urate levels.

The overall proportion of patients with ≥ 1 tophus at baseline was 20.8%, with similar proportions of patients in the febuxostat and allopurinol treatment groups. Tophus resolution rates were similar between treatment groups throughout the study period. Within the first 2 years, tophus resolution rates remained comparable between treatment groups, regardless of whether the patient died from a CV‐related cause or not.

The links between serum urate levels, hyperuricemia, gout flares, and CVD are unclear. Some studies suggest that there is no link between increased serum urate levels and coronary heart disease. However, other studies indicate that increased serum urate levels may be associated with worse outcomes in patients with CVD and renal disease. One potential mechanism by which serum urate levels could lead to increased CV events is by impairing nitric oxide synthesis, resulting in vascular endothelial dysfunction that may lead to inflammation and prothrombosis. It is important to note the relatively high CV risk in patients from the CARES trial, which included patients with CV event rates of > 10%, which is higher compared with other gout studies. The CARES trial previously demonstrated that the rates of predefined major adverse CV events with febuxostat treatment were noninferior to allopurinol. Findings from the present analyses show that very few patients experienced a gout flare within the 3‐month period over which data were available closest to a cardiac event. Furthermore, there were no imbalances in nonfatal CV events, including acute coronary syndrome, ischemic stroke, or revascularization rates in the CARES trial. These findings suggest a lack of an association between an off‐target effect of febuxostat on mechanisms such as inflammation and prothrombosis.

### Increased risk of cardiovascular events and death in the initial phase after discontinuation of febuxostat or allopurinol: another story of the CARES trial [^c11e5141]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

MSU crystals in the vasculature and CV gout attacks

Recent studies with dual-energy CT (DECT) have demonstrated the deposition of MSU crystals in the vasculature of 86%–88% of patients with gout, while MSU crystals have also been observed in the coronary arteries, aortic plaques and various tissues.

Since inflammation in the vasculature is known to trigger plaque rupture, it is likely that inflammation in the blood vessels can cause CV events. A sudden change in serum uric acid levels as a result of the withdrawal or initiation of allopurinol or febuxostat, or other risk factors for acute gout attacks, could induce the formation of MSU crystals in the blood vessels. It is thought that MSU crystals might cause acute inflammation in the blood vessels as well as intermittent gout attacks in the joints, resulting in plaque rupture and CV events (CV gout attacks). Therefore, a situation in which a gout attack is triggered might also trigger CV gout attacks; this could explain the increase in CV events and mortality after discontinuation of allopurinol and febuxostat in this reanalysis of the CARES trial, as well as the sudden increase in CV events before and after the initiation of allopurinol and febuxostat in a nationwide cohort from our other study. Furthermore, higher MACE risk after drug discontinuation was observed on increasing levels of the difference between baseline and last measured uric acid levels prior to drug discontinuation. This difference may act as a surrogate marker for the degree of rebound hyperuricaemia. Considering the fact that uric acid levels increase within 1–2 weeks after drug discontinuation, rebound hyperuricaemia that occurs after drug discontinuation might be considered a significant risk factor for MACE. This significant association of difference in baseline and last measured uric acid levels prior to drug discontinuation and MACE risk after drug discontinuation is an important result in supporting our hypothesis.

Methods

Study design and population

The CARES trial was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind non-inferiority trial. The study population comprised 6198 patients with gout and a history of major CV disease before randomisation. Similar to the CARES trial, we used the data of 6190 patients in a modified intention-to-treat analysis. The included patients were examined for concurrent conditions, vital signs/weight at scheduled study visits, the end of the study and early termination; the patients also underwent physical examination and 12-lead electrocardiography (protocol of the CARES trial). Subjects who have withdrawn from study medication treatment but have not withdrawn consent will be followed until the subject experiences a CV event that is positively adjudicated as a MACE or until the study concludes. Subjects will be contacted by telephone every 2 months (± 10 days) to determine if any potential CV events have occurred. We had access to data of the CARES trial through the company Vivli, and we reanalysed the CARES trial data with no financial support from any company.

Outcomes

As in the CARES trial, we investigated MACE, such as CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or urgent revascularisation for unstable angina, as primary endpoints. MACE and cause of death were adjudicated by an independent central endpoints committee, the members of which were unaware of the treatment assignments according to the same protocol as in the CARES trial. Using the CARES trial data, we compared the MACE that occurred during study drug administration (including day 1 after the last medication) and after study drug discontinuation (from day 2 after the last medication), including or excluding patients with gout with abnormal clinical or vital signs (physical examination findings, ECG findings, body temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and pulse/beats per minute) at the study visits to minimise 'sick-stopper' effects, that sicker lifestyles often accompany non-adherent behaviours. Patients who experienced a MACE during study drug administration were excluded from the study drug discontinuation group. In addition, we compared the incidence of adverse events leading to CV death and non-CV death after drug discontinuation, excluding patients with gout with abnormal clinical or vital signs at the study visits in order to minimise 'sick-stopper' effects. We investigated up to 1, 3 and 6 months of discontinuation of the study drug to best consider the period during which uric acid is rapidly increased and its effects are most likely to occur.

Practice Point 3.14.2 — Agent selection for urate lowering in CKD G3–G5: Prescribe xanthine oxidase inhibitors in preference to uricosuric agents in people with CKD G3–G5. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., allopurinol and febuxostat) reduce serum uric acid concentration by reducing purine metabolism into uric acid, whereas uricosuric agents enhance urinary excretion but their effect is blunted in the context of reduced GFR. In the CARES randomized trial of allopurinol versus febuxostat in 6190 people with gout and prior CVD, the interventions were noninferior for the composite primary cardiovascular outcome, but overall and cardiovascular mortality were higher with febuxostat than allopurinol (HR for death from any cause: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.01–1.47 and HR for cardiovascular death: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.03–1.73). Additional signals include that SGLT2i reduce serum uric acid concentration and appeared to reduce gout adverse event reports or initiations of uric acid–lowering therapy, while observational studies suggest that diuretics (thiazide and loop) increase serum uric acid concentration.

### Uric acid is a biomarker of oxidative stress in the failing heart: lessons learned from trials with allopurinol and SGLT2 inhibitors [^3e764042]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyperuricemia increases the risk of heart failure, and higher levels of serum uric acid are seen in patients who have worse ventricular function, functional capacity, and prognosis. Heart failure is also accompanied by an upregulation of xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of uric acid and a purported source of reactive oxygen species. However, the available evidence does not support the premise that either uric acid or the activation of xanthine oxidase has direct injurious effects on the heart in the clinical setting. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (allopurinol and oxypurinol) have had little benefit and may exert detrimental effects in patients with chronic heart failure in randomized controlled trials, and the more selective and potent inhibitor febuxostat increases the risk of cardiovascular death more than allopurinol. Instead, the available evidence indicates that changes in xanthine oxidase and uric acid are biomarkers of oxidative stress (particularly in heart failure) and that xanthine oxidase may provide an important source of nitric oxide that quenches the injurious effects of reactive oxygen species. A primary determinant of the cellular redox state is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, whose levels drive an inverse relationship between xanthine oxidase and sirtuin-1, a nutrient deprivation sensor that exerts important antioxidant and cardioprotective effects. Interestingly, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors induce a state of nutrient deprivation that includes activation of sirtuin-1, suppression of xanthine oxidase, and lowering of serum uric acid. The intermediary role of sirtuin-1 in both uric acid-lowering and cardioprotection may explain why, in mediation analyses of large-scale cardiovascular trials, the effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors to decrease serum uric acid is a major predictor of the ability of these drugs to decrease serious heart failure events.

### Evaluation of the relationship between serum urate levels, clinical manifestations of gout, and death from cardiovascular causes in patients receiving febuxostat or allopurinol in an outcomes trial [^c1fa45c4]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The CARES trial has the longest study duration of any trial investigating patients with gout and CVD. In this analysis, we evaluated the relationships between serum urate levels, gout flares, tophus resolution, and deaths from CV causes. In the CARES trial, the incidence rates of the nonfatal components of the composite primary end point were similar between febuxostat and allopurinol treatment groups. However, in the secondary end point analysis, the rate of death from CV causes was higher in patients who received treatment febuxostat compared with those who received allopurinol. All‐cause mortality was higher in patients who received febuxostat compared with allopurinol as a result of the imbalance in the rates of deaths from CV causes. Further analyses of data from the CARES trial demonstrated that both febuxostat and allopurinol were associated with comparable, clinically relevant improvements in efficacy. We did not observe a relationship between gout flares and deaths from CV causes; however, there was a positive association between greater serum urate levels and deaths from CV causes in the overall population and in the allopurinol treatment group, while the rates of death from CV causes in the febuxostat treatment group were similar across serum urate levels. Additionally, data from the Febuxostat versus Allopurinol Streamlined Trial demonstrated that febuxostat was noninferior to allopurinol with regard to the occurrence of major CV outcomes with no indication of increased all‐cause mortality or deaths from CV causes with febuxostat treatment. Therefore, the underlying mechanisms of the increase in deaths from CV causes observed in patients who received febuxostat compared with those who received allopurinol in the CARES trial remain unclear.

### Comparative cardiovascular risk in users versus non-users of xanthine oxidase inhibitors and febuxostat versus allopurinol users [^d216eb1d]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study is to determine major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and all-cause mortality comparing between xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOIs) and non-XOI users, and between allopurinol and febuxostat.

Methods

This is a retrospective cohort study of gout patients prescribed anti-hyperuricemic medications between 2013 and 2017 using a territory-wide administrative database. XOI users were matched 1:1 to XOI non-users using propensity scores. Febuxostat users were matched 1:3 to allopurinol users. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on colchicine use.

Results

Of the 13 997 eligible participants, 3607 (25.8%) were XOI users and 10 390 (74.2%) were XOI non-users. After propensity score matching, compared with non-users (n = 3607), XOI users (n = 3607) showed similar incidence of MACE (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.997, 95% CI, 0.879, 1.131; P > 0.05) and all-cause mortality (HR = 0.972, 95% CI 0.886, 1.065, P = 0.539). Febuxostat (n = 276) users showed a similar risk of MACE compared with allopurinol users (n = 828; HR: 0.672, 95% CI, 0.416, 1.085; P = 0.104) with a tendency towards a lower risk of heart failure-related hospitalizations (HR = 0.529, 95% CI 0.272, 1.029; P = 0.061). Concurrent colchicine use reduced the risk for all-cause mortality amongst XOI users (HR = 0.671, 95% 0.586, 0.768; P < 0.001).

Conclusion

In gout patients, XOI users showed similar risk of MACE and all-cause mortality compared with non-users. Compared with allopurinol users, febuxostat users showed similar MACE and all-cause mortality risks but lower heart failure-related hospitalizations.

We were also unable to adjust for chronic kidney disease, which has been shown to be associated with increased risk of gout, particularly in women. We used regular dispensing of allopurinol in three of four quarters of 2012 as a surrogate for regular use of drug treatment but cannot be certain that people with gout who were dispensed allopurinol might have actually taken this drug or continued taking it during follow-up. Similar approaches to assess adherence from community pharmaceutical dispensing data have been used for metformin, statins, and antihypertensive drugs. Nevertheless, the findings of our study demonstrate an association between gout and cardiovascular disease. The potential causal mechanisms of these associations require further exploration including casual inference modelling in future studies.

Conclusion

Gout is associated with an increased risk of both fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events. In men with gout with no history of cardiovascular disease, regular allopurinol dispensing and serum urate levels at standard treatment targets was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. By contrast, colchicine dispensing was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events in men with gout with no history of cardiovascular disease.

3.2 Effect of febuxostat versus allopurinol treatment on clinical events

Compared with allopurinol treatment group, the febuxostat group had a better safety outcome, which was the composite of urgent coronary revascularization (OR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.77–0.90, p < .0001 Figure 2(A)) and stroke (Figure 2(B)) (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.79–0.97, p = .009). However, that difference was not found in nonfatal myocardial infarction (Figure 2(C)) (OR: 0.98 95% CI: 0.80–1.22, p = .91), cardiovascular related mortality (Figure 2(D)) (OR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.69–1.38, p = .89) and all‐cause mortality (Figure 2(E)) (OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.75–1.15, p = .52).

Table 2
Mixed relative treatment effects of major adverse cardiovascular event and composite renal events among urate lowering agents

CI Confidence interval, MACE Major adverse cardiovascular events, RR Risk ratio, ULT, Urate-lowering therapy agents

Comparisons are read from left to right for both MACE and composite renal events. For example; allopurinol had lower composite renal events with RR (95% CI) of 0.39 (0.23, 0.66) compared with placebo/no ULT, and lower MACE with RR (95% CI) of 0.75 (0.47, 1.21) compared with placebo/no ULT

Bold font indicates statistical significance

Treatment with allopurinol and febuxostat were less likely to lead to MACE compared to placebo/no ULT (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.21, and RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.11, respectively), although these were not significant, see Table 2. Likewise, febuxostat showed a non-significant reduction in risk of MACE relative to allopurinol (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.32). There was no evidence of inconsistency for MACE (χ² = 0.26, P -value = 0.60) and composite renal events (χ² = 0.07, P -value = 0.79).

Secondary outcomes

Data pooling from 11 (2532 participants), 23 (3063 participants), 13 (1555 participants), and 13 (2493 participants) comparison arms were used in NMAs of eGFR, SU, SBP, and AEs, respectively (Additional file: Figure S 10). Allopurinol and febuxostat had significantly higher eGFR than placebo/no ULT (MD 3.69 ml/min/1.73 m², 95% CI 1.31 to 6.08, and MD 2.89 ml/min/1.73 m², 95% CI 0.69 to 5.09, respectively) (Table 3 and Additional file: Table S 6).

Effect of regular allopurinol dispensing, serum urate, and colchicine dispensing on adjusted hazard ratios for time to fatal or first non-fatal cardiovascular event within five years in study population, according to sex and analysis model. Data are adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval)

We saw an increase in risk of cardiovascular events among men with gout who were not dispensed allopurinol in at least three of four quarters in the year after study entry compared with men with gout who were dispensed allopurinol (adjusted hazard ratio 1.15 (95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.25); table 3, model 2). This effect was not observed among women. Among men with gout, we also saw a higher risk of cardiovascular disease associated with serum urate ≥ 0.36 mmol/L compared with serum urate < 0.36 mmol/L (1.16 (1.04 to 1.30); table 3, model 3). This effect was also not observed in women.

Men with gout who were not dispensed colchicine at least once in the previous 12 months were found to be at lower risk of cardiovascular events than men with gout who were dispensed colchicine (adjusted hazard ratio 0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.77 to 0.92); table 3, model 4). In women with gout, we saw no difference in risk of cardiovascular events according to colchicine dispensing.

### Increased risk of cardiovascular events and death in the initial phase after discontinuation of febuxostat or allopurinol: another story of the CARES trial [^9c352b13]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

Data are presented as mean ± SD, median (IQR) for continuous variables or as the number (%) of subjects for categorical variables. Comparisons of baseline characteristics among the three groups were made using the Pearson's χ² test, Fisher's exact test, analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis test according to the type of variable (table 1).

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of all study patients

The main analyses relied on time‐to‐event methods and self-controlled case series analysis. The cohort entry (time 0) corresponded to the date of randomisation, and individuals were followed until the date of the occurrence of MACE, death or last contact. The study exposure was the discontinuation of the study drug and was considered as a time-varying variable (subjects who discontinued the study drug contributed to the unexposed person-time before discontinuation of the study drug). MACEs that occurred up until day 1 after the last medication were included in the 'during administration' status. For subjects who had no MACE during the drug administration period, the day 1 after the last medication was changed to time-zero, and follow-up ended when a MACE occurred. In this case, the curves generated by the extended Kaplan-Meier method do not represent fixed cohorts of subjects, as subjects can contribute to different curves at different time points during follow-up.

The person-years for each subject according to exposure status (during administration or after discontinuation of the study drug) were calculated from the index date to their end of follow-up. The crude incidence rates (IRs) of MACE were calculated as the number of MACEs per 100 person-years. The IR ratio (IRR) for MACE was calculated as the IR of MACE in the discontinuation of the study drug period compared with the IR of MACE during the administration period. The 95% CIs of the IRs and IRR were derived from Poisson regression models. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve of the probability of developing a MACE was constructed according to exposure status (during administration or after discontinuation of the study drug). Time-varying Cox models were used to evaluate the association between 'discontinuation of study drug' status and the incidence of MACE. HR are presented with corresponding 95% CIs. To investigate the effect of discontinuation of the study drug, the risk for MACE was compared according to increases in the difference between last measured and initial uric acid levels for discontinuation periods using Cox regression analysis for gout patients who took febuxostat or allopurinol for more than 1 year.

### Cardiac and renal protective effects of urate-lowering therapy [^fb0dd511]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with gout often have co-morbidities such as cardiovascular disease, renal failure and metabolic syndrome components. Some studies, but not all, have suggested that hyperuricaemia and gout are associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction, renal failure and death primarily because of increased risk of cardiovascular events. Therefore, knowledge of the effects of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) on co-morbidities, in particular cardiovascular events and chronic kidney disease, is crucial. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have suggested that allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, could improve exercise capacity in patients with chronic stable angina and could decrease blood pressure in adolescents. In contrast, a well-designed RCT found no effect of allopurinol in patients with heart failure. The impact of ULT in patients with chronic kidney disease is unclear. Some RCTs found that allopurinol could slow the decline in kidney function, whereas a recent controlled trial found no benefit of febuxostat. Large randomized placebo-controlled trials are warranted to confirm or not the benefit of ULT on co-morbidities.

### Urate lowering therapy to improve renal outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^e6aecc83]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperuricemia may contribute to renal injury. We do not know whether use of treatments that lower urate reduce the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to assess the benefits and risks of treatments that lower urate in patients with stages 3–5 CKD.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Web of Science and trial registers for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) without language restriction. Two authors independently screened articles, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Data obtained included serum uric acid, serum creatinine or other estimates of glomerular filtration rate, incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, proteinuria, cardiovascular disease and adverse events.

Results

From the 5497 citations screened, 19 RCTs enrolling 992 participants met our inclusion criteria. Given significant heterogeneity in duration of follow-up and study comparators, only trials greater than 3 months comparing allopurinol and inactive control were meta-analyzed using random effects models. Pooled estimate for eGFR was in favour of allopurinol with a mean difference (MD) of 3.2 ml/min/1.73 m(2), 95% CI 0.16–6.2 ml/min/1.73 m(2), p = 0.039 and this was consistent with results for serum creatinine. Statistically significant reductions in serum uric acid, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were found, favouring allopurinol. There were insufficient data on adverse events, incidence of ESRD and cardiovascular disease for analysis.

Conclusions

Adequately powered RCTs are needed to establish whether treatments that lower urate have beneficial renal and cardiovascular effects.

### Debates in gout management [^dca250e4]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review discusses the findings of recently published translational research studies that have the potential to directly impact on the management of gout patients.

Recent Findings

Recent research suggests that treat-to-target urate-lowering treatment (ULT) alongside individualized education about gout, and shared decision making results in excellent adherence with ULT and prevents gout flares in the long term. Such interventions should preferentially be delivered face-to-face rather than remotely. The recently published CARES study raises the possibility that febuxostat increases the risk of death in people with preexisting major cardiovascular diseases, and, allopurinol should remain the first-choice ULT. There is paucity of data on the dosing of ULT for managing hyperuricaemia in gout patients with chronic kidney disease. However, recent research suggests that the dose of allopurinol can be gradually increased to above the conventional renal dose in people with chronic kidney disease without allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome. However, additional larger studies are needed in this field.

Summary

In summary, long-term treat-to-target ULT prevents gout flares and improves quality of life. Given the recent safety concerns, gradually up-titrated allopurinol remains the first-line urate-lowering drug.

3.3 Results of subgroup analyses

To clarify the heterogeneity, subgroup analyses were performed to investigate the source of heterogeneity (Table 2). Compared with allopurinol treatment group, subgroup analyses according to age, population and study design showed that the febuxostat treatment could significantly reduce the occurrence of stroke in age ≥ 65 years group (OR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.79–0.99, p = .03), white race (≥ 70%) group (OR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.79–0.99, p = .04) and cohort study group (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.78–0.98, p = .04). Subgroup analyses according to population showed that the febuxostat treatment could significantly reduce the incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction in white race participants (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.79–0.96, p = .007). No significant differences in cardiovascular related mortality and all‐cause mortality were observed across any subgroup.

### Impact of anti-inflammatory therapies, xanthine oxidase inhibitors and other urate-lowering therapies on cardiovascular diseases in gout [^23245ce8]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this study is to give an overview of recently published articles covering the impact of anti-inflammatory therapies, xanthine oxidase inhibitors and other urate-lowering therapies on cardiovascular diseases in gout.

Recent Findings

In patients with gout, long-term xanthine oxidase inhibition might reduce some cardiovascular comorbidities because of the dual effect of lowering serum uric acid levels and reducing free-radical production during uric acid formation. Among the anti-inflammatory therapies, colchicine has been shown to reduce some major cardiovascular events.

Summary

Epidemiological and experimental studies have shown that hyperuricaemia and gout are independent risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. The mechanisms that link high serum uric acid levels and gout with cardiovascular diseases are multifactorial, implicating low-grade systemic inflammation and xanthine oxidase activity as well as the deleterious effect of hyperuricaemia itself.

### Update on gout management: what is old and what is new [^bd33696f]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The global burden of gout is rising, as are the prevalence of associated comorbidities, all-cause mortality and societal costs. In this review, we discuss recent advances in epidemiology and treatment strategies for gout.

Recent Findings

Genetic factors and obesity are prominent contributors to hyperuricemia and gout, while dietary factors contribute to less variance in serum urate, though can still have some contribution to population attributable risk. A consensus statement by the Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network outlined appropriate terminology regarding gout, which will aid in communication about various aspects of the disease. The 2020 American College of Rheumatology gout guideline offers comprehensive evidence-based recommendations for the management of hyperuricemia using urate-lowering therapy, prophylaxis when initiating urate-lowering therapy, treatment of gout flare and adjunctive management strategies. There is improved understanding of risk factors for allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome and well tolerated use of allopurinol in chronic kidney disease. Trial data have provided new insights regarding cardiovascular risk with febuxostat. Several new drug therapies are being tested for both urate-lowering efficacy and gout flare management.

Summary

Although there have been significant advances in understanding of risk factors and treatment approaches, gout remains suboptimally managed. There is substantial need for improving gout management efforts and gout education among patients and clinicians.

### Febuxostat leads to better cardiovascular outcomes compared to allopurinol in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease: a population-based cohort study [^4b75513a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Hyperuricemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease complications in patients with chronic kidney disease. The impact of febuxostat on cardiovascular disease in advanced chronic kidney disease remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the cardiovascular benefits of xanthine oxidase inhibitors, particularly febuxostat and allopurinol, in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease.

Methods

A retrospective population-based cohort study was conducted using data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) (2012–2020). The TriNetX dataset served as an external validation dataset. The study involved 13,187 patients with advanced chronic kidney disease treated with febuxostat or allopurinol. After propensity score matching, a balanced cohort of 976 patients (488 in each arm) was created. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated for all-cause mortality and hospitalizations, utilizing the competing risk regression model.

Results

Febuxostat was associated with lower all-cause mortality (HR, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64–0.98) and fewer hospitalizations (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.44–0.63) than allopurinol. After adjustments, febuxostat also reduced hospitalizations for heart failure (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.43–0.80) and infection (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.52–0.82). This cardiovascular benefit of febuxostat was consistently observed in the TriNetX dataset. Moreover, subgroup analysis revealed that febuxostat was better in reducing death and heart failure events than allopurinol across most of the subgroups.

Conclusions

Febuxostat may confer cardioprotective effects in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease compared with allopurinol, thereby making it potentially useful in reducing cardiovascular risks in this high-risk population.

### Short-term risk of cardiovascular events in people newly diagnosed with gout [^796cc0aa]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Gout affects 1.0% to 4.0% of adults in Western countries. Traditionally viewed as a self‐limiting form of arthritis, it is associated with cardiovascular comorbidities. Hyperuricemia was long considered a potential reason for the excess cardiovascular burden in people with gout, but Mendelian randomization studies and the ALL‐HEART study did not provide evidence about the causal role of hyperuricemia in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular comorbidities. Thus, the potential mechanism linking gout and cardiovascular events may be related to systemic and vascular inflammation during gout flares.

Gout flares have been associated with a transient increase in the risk of cardiovascular events in two separate studies, one from the United Kingdom and another from Australia. 5.6 However, these studies either included people with long‐standing goutor people hospitalized for gout flare. Their findings might be affected by survivor bias, potentially affecting the magnitude of the association. Additionally, there may be potential confounding effects from the regular prescription of nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or colchicine to either prevent or treat gout flares. This is an important issue because regular NSAID prescription is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, whereas regular colchicine prescriptions may prevent cardiovascular events. Therefore, it is important to assess whether there is a transient increase in cardiovascular events following gout flares, occurring only in the initial period following gout diagnosis, at a time when there is no effect of survivor bias and minimal effect from long‐term anti‐inflammatory drug prescription. The presence of such an association would strongly support early proactive cardiovascular risk management in people newly diagnosed with gout. Currently, there is a discrepancy between international recommendations regarding the screening and the management of cardiovascular risk factors in those newly diagnosed with gout. The British Society of Rheumatologyand the EULARguidelines suggest screening cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular comorbidities in all patients with gout and managing them appropriately. Conversely, the American College of Rheumatologyand the American College of Physiciansguidelines do not make any mention of that.

The main aim of this study was to assess whether there is a short‐term increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients diagnosed with newly diagnosed gout. We also estimated the incidence of cardiovascular events in the first two years following the first gout diagnosis to provide absolute incidence rates. In this study, we used the same data source as our previously published study, but the data were restricted to the first recorded consultation for gout.

Cardiovascular disease was broadly defined as comprising ischaemic heart disease, ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, transient ischaemic attack, peripheral vascular disease, and heart failure.

Interventions

A history of gout identified from a discharge diagnosis of gout from a public hospital admission or previous dispensing of gout specific drug treatments. The cohort was then linked to national hospital admissions and deaths through to 31 December 2016 (ie, 5 years' follow-up). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to assess the associations between gout, other risk factors, and cardiovascular outcomes.

Results

Of 942 416 people included in the study, 31 907 (3.4%) had gout (6261 women and 25 646 men). After adjustment for multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease, gout was associated with increased cardiovascular events (adjusted hazard ratio 1.34 (95% confidence interval 1.23 to 1.45) in women; 1.18 (1.12 to 1.24) in men). For men with gout, there was an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in those who were not dispensed regular allopurinol (1.15 (1.05 to 1.25)) and those with a serum urate above the treatment target of 0.36 mmol/L (1.16 (1.04 to 1.30)). Risk of cardiovascular events was lower for men with gout who were not dispensed colchicine compared with those who were (0.84 (0.77 to 0.92)). These findings were not observed in women.

Conclusion

These results indicate that gout is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. In men with gout without history of cardiovascular disease, the cardiovascular risk was lower in those regularly dispensed allopurinol and those with serum urate levels at the recommended treatment target. By contrast, colchicine dispensing was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events in men with gout without a cardiovascular history. The potential causal mechanisms of these associations require further exploration, including casual inference modelling in future studies.

### Association of gout with long-term cardiovascular outcomes among patients with obstructive coronary artery disease [^243a7141]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Possible mechanisms accounting for residual risk associated with gout include oxidative stress 12 and inflammation. 13, 14, 15 Oxidative stress is generated by xanthine oxidase, an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of urate. 16 Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, has been shown to improve oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in patients with stable CAD. 17, 18 Considerable observational data suggest that allopurinol is associated with cardiovascular benefit. 10, 19, 20 Yet, febuxostat, a more potent xanthine oxidase inhibitor and hypouricemic agent, has recently been shown in a randomized clinical trial to lead to increased cardiovascular and all‐cause mortality compared with allopurinol. 21 The ongoing ALL‐HEART (Allopurinol and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients With Ischemic Heart Disease) randomized trial will assess whether patients with ischemic heart disease derive cardiovascular benefit from allopurinol therapy versus standard of care. 22

Inflammation may also provide a link between gout and CVDs. Gout is characterized by short‐term periods of clinically apparent inflammation, separated by periods of subclinical inflammation. 5, 23 Low‐grade inflammation also has a major role in the development of CVDs, and elevated levels of C‐reactive protein and interleukin‐6 have been found to be associated with increased cardiovascular risk. 24 Recently, canakinumab, an anti‐inflammatory agent, was found to confer cardiovascular benefit among individuals with prior MI and elevated C‐reactive protein. 25 Whether individuals with gout would derive cardiovascular benefit from this therapy remains to be seen. In addition, the effect of colchicine, a relatively inexpensive anti‐inflammatory agent, on cardiovascular events in patients after acute MI is currently being evaluated in the COLCOT (Colchicine Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial; URL: Unique identifier: 02551094); results are anticipated in 2019. 26

### Medications for gout and its comorbidities: mutual benefits? [^e5a983bf]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review recent literature with relevance to the management of multimorbid patients with gout, i.e., gout medication repurposed for comorbidities and vice versa.

Recent Findings

Adding to the previous success of interleukin-1 inhibition, two trials on low-dose colchicine's role in cardiovascular disease (CVD) demonstrated potential benefits in patients with or without gout. In Colchicine Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial, a composite CVD endpoint was reduced by 23% among patients who had experienced a recent myocardial infarction. In Low-Dose Colchicine 2, the composite CVD endpoint was reduced 31% among those with stable coronary artery disease. Use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for renal protection in patients without gout produced null results. Allopurinol did not benefit the glomerular filtration rate in two trials (Controlled trial of slowing of Kidney Disease progression From the Inhibition of Xanthine oxidase and Preventing Early Renal Function Loss) among patients with chronic kidney disease (with or without hyperuricemia, but not gout). SGLT-2 inhibitors, a medication recommended for patients with diabetes and CVD, diabetic kidney disease, or heart failure, demonstrated a protective effect against gout flares in a secondary trial analysis and a large observational study.

Summary

The role of colchicine may expand beyond gout flare prevention to patients with existing CVD. The renal benefit of ULT among patients with gout remains unclear. SGLT-2 inhibitors may benefit diabetic patients who have gout as a comorbidity.

### Association between gout and cardiovascular outcomes in adults with no history of cardiovascular disease: large data linkage study in New Zealand [^a2e5c160]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

We found that gout modified the association between ethnic origin and cardiovascular events in both men and women. Men with gout and of Māori, Pacific Island, or Indian ethnic origin had a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular disease than men with gout from other ethnic groups. After accounting for this differential effect, Māori men with gout still remained at highest risk of cardiovascular disease, followed by Indian and Pacific Island men. A similar differential effect was observed among women. The risk of cardiovascular disease remains highest among Māori and Pacific Island people with gout. In Aotearoa New Zealand, Māori and Pacific Island people have the highest prevalence of gout, are least likely to be taking regular allopurinol, and have the highest burden of cardiovascular risk factors. With the additive risk factor of gout, our findings highlight the importance of resolving inequities in these population groups through access to timely and culturally safe care.

In men with gout with no history of cardiovascular disease, we observed a reduction in cardiovascular risk in those individuals with regular allopurinol dispensing (dispensed in at least three of four quarters of 2012) and serum urate at target levels (< 0.36 mmol/L), which suggests a possible cardiovascular benefit of appropriate gout management. These findings are similar to a study of the Multi-Payer Claims Database in the US, which found that in people with gout and diabetes, current allopurinol users had a significantly lower adjusted hazard of incident stroke or myocardial infarction than previous allopurinol users, (hazard ratio 0.67 (95% confidence interval 0.53 to 0.84)). Furthermore, in a cohort study of almost 1200 people with gout (92% men), researchers found that serum urate above the treatment target (≥ 0.36 mmol/L) was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and overall mortality. A meta-analysis of 32 studies (1 134 073 people) found a significant positive association between hyperuricaemia and risk of cardiovascular disease (adjusted hazard ratio 1.45 (95% confidence interval 1.33 to 1.58)), although heterogeneity between studies was high. By contrast, some earlier studies have not shown an association between hyperuricaemia and cardiovascular disease after adjustment for known cardiovascular risk factors. We are unaware of any published studies that have not shown an association between gout and cardiovascular disease.

### Evaluation of the relationship between serum urate levels, clinical manifestations of gout, and death from cardiovascular causes in patients receiving febuxostat or allopurinol in an outcomes trial [^54f60c83]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether serum urate levels, number of gout flares, and tophi burden are related to death from cardiovascular (CV) causes after treatment with febuxostat or allopurinol in patients with gout from the Cardiovascular Safety of Febuxostat or Allopurinol in Patients With Gout and Cardiovascular Comorbidities (CARES) trial.

Methods

Patients were randomly assigned to receive febuxostat (40 mg or 80 mg once daily, according to serum urate levels at week 2) or allopurinol titrated in 100‐mg increments from 200–400 mg or 300–600 mg (with dose determined according to kidney function). Changes from baseline in serum urate level, gout flares, and tophus resolution were key exploratory efficacy parameters in the overall population and in subgroups of patients who died and those who did not die from a CV‐related cause. The latter subgroup included patients who died due to non‐CV causes and those who did not die due to any cause.

Results

Patients received treatment with febuxostat (n = 3,098) or allopurinol (n = 3,092) for a median follow‐up period of 32 months (for a maximum of 85 months). In the overall population, mean serum urate levels were lower in those receiving febuxostat compared with those receiving allopurinol at most study visits. There were no associations between serum urate levels and death from CV causes with febuxostat. The number of gout flares requiring treatment was higher within 1 year of treatment with febuxostat compared with allopurinol (mean incidence of gout flares per patient‐years of exposure 1.33 versus 1.20), but was comparable thereafter and decreased overall throughout the study period (mean incidence of gout flares per patient‐years of exposure 0.35 versus 0.34 after 1 year of treatment; overall mean incidence 0.68 versus 0.63) irrespective of whether the patient died from a CV‐related cause. Overall, 20.8% of patients had ≥ 1 tophus at baseline; tophus resolution rates were similar between treatment groups, with cumulative resolution rates of > 50%.

Conclusion

In the CARES trial, febuxostat and allopurinol (≤ 600 mg doses) had comparable efficacy in patients with gout and CV disease, and there was no evidence of a relationship between death from CV causes and serum urate levels, number of gout flares, or tophus resolution among the patients receiving febuxostat.

### Association between gout and cardiovascular outcomes in adults with no history of cardiovascular disease: large data linkage study in New Zealand [^516761e1]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Some studies have reported that gout and hyperuricaemia are risk factors for cardiovascular events. However, other studies have not shown an association between hyperuricaemia and cardiovascular events after adjustment for established risk factors. In Aotearoa New Zealand, gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis, affecting over 4% of adults.Māori (indigenous New Zealanders) and Pacific Island people are disproportionately affected by gout, with the highest prevalence of the disease worldwide; gout affects about 9% of Māori adults and 14% of Pacific Island adults, and more than a third of Māori and Pacific Island adults older than 65 years living in Aotearoa New Zealand.

While the benefit of the urate lowering drug allopurinol for the management of gout is well established, some evidence suggests a potential additional benefit of allopurinol on risk of cardiovascular disease. A cohort study of the US Multi-Payer Claims Database found that in people with gout and diabetes, current allopurinol users had a lower risk of incident stroke or myocardial infarction than previous allopurinol users (hazard ratio 0.67 (0.53 to 0.84)). This association persisted after adjustment for other risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, immune diseases, and colchicine use. Primarily used in the past for the treatment and prevention of gout flares, colchicine has also become of high interest for cardiovascular research. Two recent randomised controlled trials in people with a history of cardiovascular disease found that 0.5 mg daily use of colchicine confers a significant reduction in the risk of future cardiovascular events.

Recently, risk equations used for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease have been developed and validated solely using predictors available from routinely collected national health data in Aotearoa New Zealand (sex; age; ethnic origin; level of socioeconomic deprivation; diabetes status; previous admission to hospital for atrial fibrillation; and dispensing at baseline of blood pressure lowering, lipid lowering, or antiplatelet or anticoagulant drug treatments). While some clinical predictors (smoking, blood pressure, lipid levels) are not available in administrative health data, the predictors included in these equations enable individual level, cardiovascular risk to be examined across an entire population. We linked national and regional health databases in Aotearoa New Zealand and used these available predictors to investigate the association of gout with cardiovasculr outcomes. We then examined the effect of regular allopurinol dispensing, serum urate levels, and colchicine dispensing on cardiovascular risk in this population.

Relationship between tophus resolution and death fromcauses

The overall proportion of patients with ≥ 1 tophus at baseline was 20.8% (1,287 of 6,190), with similar proportions in the febuxostat group (21.0% [650 of 3,098]) and allopurinol group (20.6% [637 of 3,092]). Tophus resolution rates were similar between treatment groups in year 1 and remained similar throughout the study period. By the end of the treatment period, cumulative tophus resolution rates in both treatment groups were > 50% (Supplementary Figure 1A). Tophus resolution rates within the first 2 years of treatment in the study were also comparable between treatment groups irrespective of whether the patient died from a CV‐related cause or not (Supplementary Figure 1B).

### Allopurinol use and risk of fatal hypersensitivity reactions… [^f33836d9]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

Patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia and renal or cardiovascular diseases had statistically significantly increased risk of allopurinol hypersensitivity. They also had statistically significantly increased risk of mortality. Conclusions and Relevance The use of allopurinol in patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia accompanied by renal or cardiovascular diseases statistically significantly increased the risk of hypersensitivity reactions. Physicians should be cautious when prescribing allopurinol to high-risk populations and should consider the potential risks of fatal adverse reactions.

If an individual appeared as a new user more than once during the study period, we used the information collected at the first instance. Comorbid cardiovascular diseases also increased the risk of allopurinol hypersensitivity and mortality. In addition, the use of allopurinol in asymptomatic hyperuricemia accompanied by cardiovascular diseases was statistically significantly associated with allopurinol hypersensitivity and mortality. By comparison, asymptomatic hyperuricemia without comorbid renal or cardiovascular diseases showed no statistically significant association with allopurinol hypersensitivity or its mortality. The increasing use of allopurinol in patients with cardiovascular diseases may be explained by attempts to control rising serum uric acid levels in patients with heart failure.

12–14 In addition, allopurinol has been reported to decrease serum uric acid and C-reactive protein levels, slow the progression of renal disease.

### Comparative effectiveness of allopurinol and febuxostat in gout management [^1f442c57]. NEJM Evidence (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The relative efficacy and safety of allopurinol and febuxostat when used according to current guidelines for the treatment of hyperuricemia are unknown. This double-blind noninferiority trial examined these issues.

Methods

Participants with gout and hyperuricemia (with at least 33% having stage 3 chronic kidney disease) were randomly assigned to allopurinol or febuxostat in this 72-week trial, with doses titrated to target serum urate. The trial had three phases: titration (weeks 0 to 24), maintenance (weeks 25 to 48), and observation (weeks 49 to 72). Allopurinol and febuxostat were initiated at daily doses of 100 and 40 mg, with maximum titration to 800 and 120 mg, respectively. Antiinflammatory prophylaxis was given during phases 1 and 2. The primary end point was the proportion of patients experiencing one or more flares during phase 3, with a prespecified noninferiority margin of less than 8 percentage points between allopurinol and febuxostat. Secondary end points included efficacy in patients with chronic kidney disease, proportion achieving target serum urate levels, and serious adverse events.

Results

This study included 940 participants; 20.1% withdrew, with similar proportions in treatment arms. During phase 3, 36.5% of allopurinol-treated participants had one flare or more compared with 43.5% of febuxostat-treated participants (P < 0.001 for noninferiority). Overall, 80% of participants achieved mean target urates during phase 2 with no differences by treatment. There were no treatment differences (including cardiovascular events) in serious adverse events.

Conclusions

Allopurinol and febuxostat achieved serum urate goals in patients with gout; allopurinol was noninferior to febuxostat in controlling flares. Similar outcomes were noted in participants with stage 3 chronic kidney disease.

### Uric acid levels, number of standard modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, and prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease: a large cohort study in Asia [^f4d2b4bf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Given that UA is closely related to systemic inflammation, an anti‐inflammatory combined with UA‐lowering therapy may be an effective method to improve the prognosis of patients. Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that lowers UA levels and is licensed for the prevention of gout rather than cardiovascular events. Several studies have already suggested a benefit of allopurinol on endothelial function, flow‐mediated dilatation, blood pressure, left ventricular mass, carotid intimal thickness, and arterial stiffness. Nevertheless, the ALL‐HEART (Allopurinol versus usual care in UK patients with ischaemic heart disease) trial involving 5721 individuals with ischemic heart disease reported that the primary outcome of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, or stroke was not significantly reduced when treated with allopurinol therapy (HR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.89–1.21]). It should be noted that most of the participants in that trial had normal UA levels, with a median concentration of 5.7 to 5.9 mg/dL. Thus, UA levels may have a weak effect on cardiovascular events, and the benefit of UA‐lowering therapy was not significant in this population. However, whether UA‐lowering therapy will provide a beneficial effect on patients with CAD with hyperuricemia, especially those with no or few SMuRFs, remains to be investigated.

### Hypersensitivity and cardiovascular risks related to allopurinol and febuxostat therapy in Asians: a population-based cohort study and meta-analysis [^7d0cf193]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

The safety of newer xanthine oxidase inhibitor febuxostat compared to allopurinol remains unclear. To compare the risks of allopurinol hypersensitivity and febuxostat hypersensitivity and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in Asians, we conducted a population-based cohort study enrolling patients receiving allopurinol or febuxostat from Chang Gung Memorial Hospital Health System across Taiwan during 2012–2016 and further performed a meta-analysis incorporating two recent studies. Among the 61,539 users, a corresponding 12,007 and 5,680 patients were identified as new users. The overall incidence of febuxostat hypersensitivity was significantly lower than allopurinol hypersensitivity (0.2 vs. 2.7 per 1,000 new users; P < 0.001). There were 33 allopurinol-hypersensitivity reactions (including 18 severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions), and only one patient developed febuxostat-maculopapular exanthema. Moreover, febuxostat did not statistically increase the risk of CVD (hazard ratio (HR), 1.16; P = 0.152) and related death (HR, 1.49; P = 0.496) compared to allopurinol. The result of the meta-analysis also showed a consistent result. In conclusion, the incidence and severity of febuxostat-hypersensitivity are lower than with allopurinol. Febuxostat did not show an increased risk of CVD and related death.
