## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pediatric hives (urticaria), including classification, diagnostic approach, treatment, special scenarios, and follow-up. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining acute versus chronic urticaria and the key differentials. Then, I should verify the diagnostic workup, including when to test and when not to test. Next, I will review first-line therapy and escalation strategies, including dosing and safety. After that, I need to consider special populations and scenarios like infants, hereditary angioedema, and drug-induced urticaria. Finally, I will outline follow-up, prognosis, and red flags that warrant urgent action, making sure each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the classification framework, because everything downstream depends on getting this right. Pediatric urticaria is divided into acute urticaria, defined by wheals and/or angioedema lasting less than 6 weeks, and chronic urticaria, defined by symptoms persisting beyond 6 weeks; chronic cases are further categorized as chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) when no identifiable trigger is found, and chronic inducible urticaria when physical triggers provoke symptoms, with inducible forms being less common but not rare in children [^dbb516bd] [^4d8f3131].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology in acute cases. I should verify the common triggers in children. Infections, particularly viral upper respiratory infections, are the most frequent cause of acute urticaria in pediatrics, whereas foods, medications, and insect stings are less common but important when suggested by history; extensive allergy testing without a compatible history is not recommended because it rarely changes management and can lead to false positives [^d7ddf104] [^12811722].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach for acute urticaria. Wait, let me verify the principle: history and physical examination are paramount, and routine laboratory testing is not indicated unless the history suggests an underlying disease or the presentation is atypical; I almost said "order a CBC and CRP for everyone", but that would be overtesting in straightforward cases, so I should correct that and reserve labs for when the story is worrisome or persistent [^d7ddf104] [^3dccb5c6].

> For chronic urticaria, I need to ensure I am not over-ordering tests. A minimal workup is reasonable in most children: CBC, CRP or ESR, TSH, and thyroid peroxidase antibodies can be considered to screen for autoimmune thyroid disease, which is a recognized association; beyond that, testing should be guided by history and exam, and indiscriminate panels are discouraged due to low yield and cost [^3dccb5c6] [^760e5caa].

> Let me think about the basophil activation test (BAT). I initially thought it might be broadly useful, but wait, I should double-check its role. BAT positivity has been associated with higher likelihood of resolution in pediatric CSU, suggesting prognostic value rather than routine diagnostic utility; it is not a screening test for all patients and should be interpreted in context and, when available, in specialized settings [^4d8f3131].

> I will now examine first-line therapy for acute urticaria. Second-generation, nonsedating H1 antihistamines are first-line for symptom control; cetirizine, loratadine, desloratadine, and fexofenadine are appropriate choices, with pediatric dosing by age and weight; desloratadine has pediatric safety data down to 6 months, which is helpful in younger infants when clinically indicated [^dbb516bd] [^9f6d37e2] [^7dbdab51].

> For chronic spontaneous urticaria, I should confirm the stepwise algorithm. Start with standard-dose second-generation antihistamines; if inadequate control after 2–4 weeks, increase to up to fourfold the licensed dose, which is supported by guidelines and reviews; if still uncontrolled, add omalizumab as third-line therapy; for refractory cases, consider cyclosporine as fourth-line, recognizing that pediatric data are limited and monitoring for nephrotoxicity and hypertension is essential [^dbb516bd] [^7f74ce34] [^370d3115] [^91612afc] [^9d14cf79].

> But wait, what if the child presents with angioedema without hives? I need to check for hereditary angioedema (HAE) because management is entirely different. HAE is bradykinin-mediated and does not respond to antihistamines or corticosteroids; on-demand therapy with C1 inhibitor or icatibant is indicated, and pediatric-specific guidance supports access to approved agents for acute treatment and prophylaxis in children, including those under 12 years [^eb3be65a] [^0ad394db].

> Let me consider special populations and scenarios. In infants and toddlers, acute urticaria is very common and often infection-associated; the diagnostic and therapeutic approach mirrors adults, but I should be cautious with dosing and preferentially use agents with pediatric safety data; in adolescents, CSU prevalence and autoimmune associations rise, so I should maintain a lower threshold to screen thyroid function and consider BAT where available to inform prognosis [^12811722] [^4d8f3131].

> I should confirm medication-related urticaria considerations. Drug eruptions, including urticarial patterns, are a recognized cause of hives in children; a careful medication history, including OTC and herbal products, is essential, and culprit drug withdrawal is the cornerstone of management, with supportive antihistamines as needed while avoiding unnecessary corticosteroids [^c6169155].

> Next, I should review follow-up and reassessment cadence. For acute urticaria, most cases resolve within days to weeks; if symptoms persist beyond 6 weeks, reclassify as chronic and pivot to the CSU pathway. For CSU, reassess every 2–6 weeks to titrate therapy, document response, and step down when controlled; many children require months of therapy, and a meaningful minority have disease beyond 5 years, so expectations should be set accordingly [^14bb5282] [^760e5caa] [^4d8f3131].

> Hold on, I should verify red flags and when to escalate urgently. Any features of anaphylaxis — respiratory compromise, hypotension, or severe gastrointestinal symptoms — mandate immediate intramuscular epinephrine, even if hives are absent, because cutaneous signs can be missing in up to 10–20% of severe reactions; delays in epinephrine are associated with worse outcomes, so I need to ensure families and clinicians recognize this gap [^54083a93] [^1137778a].

> Let me reconsider the overall flow to ensure internal consistency. Start with history and exam to classify acute versus chronic and identify triggers; avoid unnecessary testing in acute cases; use second-generation antihistamines first-line and escalate dosing in CSU; add omalizumab if refractory; reserve cyclosporine for select refractory cases with monitoring; always consider HAE when angioedema occurs without hives; and schedule structured follow-up to track response and adjust therapy over time, aligning with contemporary international guidelines and pediatric data [^dbb516bd] [^4d8f3131] [^370d3115].

---

Hives in children are common and usually benign, but **identify red flags** (respiratory distress, angioedema, hypotension, or persistent symptoms > 6 weeks) to guide urgency and workup [^54083a93] [^dbb516bd]. Most cases are **acute and self-limited**, often viral or idiopathic; avoid routine allergy testing unless history suggests an allergen [^d7ddf104]. First-line treatment is a **non-sedating H1 antihistamine** (cetirizine, loratadine, fexofenadine, desloratadine) dosed by age/weight; escalate to higher doses if needed, and add a second agent or omalizumab for refractory chronic urticaria [^dbb516bd] [^370d3115]. Educate families on triggers, when to use epinephrine, and arrange follow-up to monitor for chronicity or complications [^760e5caa].

---

## Clinical presentation and classification

Hives present as **pruritic, erythematous, raised wheals** that blanch with pressure and typically resolve within 24 hours; new wheals may appear as others fade. Classification is by duration: **acute urticaria** (< 6 weeks) and **chronic urticaria** (> 6 weeks), with chronic cases further divided into spontaneous and inducible forms [^dbb516bd].

---

## Common causes and triggers

- **Acute urticaria**: Viral infections are the most common cause in children; foods, medications, and insect stings are less frequent but important when suggested by history [^d7ddf104].
- **Chronic urticaria**: Often idiopathic; autoimmune mechanisms are implicated in a subset, and physical triggers (cold, heat, pressure, exercise) are common in inducible forms [^4d8f3131].
- **Drug-induced urticaria**: Common culprits include antibiotics, NSAIDs, and anticonvulsants; reactions can be IgE-mediated or non–IgE-mediated [^c6169155].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Acute urticaria

For acute urticaria, **history and physical examination** are the primary tools; extensive laboratory testing is not recommended unless suggested by history or exam [^d7ddf104]. Routine allergy testing is not indicated without a compatible history, and viral testing is not routinely recommended [^d7ddf104].

---

### Chronic urticaria

- **Basic evaluation**: CBC, CRP/ESR, TSH, and thyroid antibodies are reasonable to screen for autoimmune thyroid disease and occult inflammation [^notfound].
- **Advanced testing**: Consider the basophil activation test (BAT) in refractory cases, as a positive BAT may predict earlier resolution; avoid indiscriminate autoimmune panels or extensive allergen testing unless history suggests a trigger [^4d8f3131] [^3dccb5c6].
- **Differential diagnosis**: Exclude urticarial vasculitis (biopsy if lesions persist > 24 hours, are painful, or leave bruising), hereditary angioedema (normal C1 inhibitor), and autoinflammatory syndromes [^3dccb5c6] [^e6245343].

---

## Management strategies

### Acute urticaria

- **First-line therapy**: Non-sedating H1 antihistamines (cetirizine, loratadine, fexofenadine, desloratadine) dosed by age/weight; cetirizine and loratadine are available in liquid formulations for younger children [^dbb516bd].
- **Dosing**: Cetirizine 0.25 mg/kg once daily (max 10 mg); loratadine 0.2 mg/kg once daily (max 10 mg); fexofenadine 30 mg twice daily for ages 6–11, 60 mg twice daily for ages 12+.
- **Short-course corticosteroids**: Consider for severe flares (e.g. prednisone 1 mg/kg/day for 3–5 days) with caution due to adverse effects; avoid chronic use [^notfound].

---

### Chronic urticaria

- **Stepwise therapy**: Start with standard-dose non-sedating H1 antihistamines; if inadequate control, increase to 2–4× the licensed dose (off-label but guideline-supported) [^dbb516bd] [^7f74ce34].
- **Second-line therapy**: Add a second antihistamine (different class) or H2 blocker (e.g. famotidine) if symptoms persist [^notfound].
- **Third-line therapy**: Omalizumab (anti-IgE) for refractory CSU in children ≥ 12 years; pediatric efficacy and safety are supported by randomized trials and guidelines [^dbb516bd] [^370d3115].
- **Fourth-line therapy**: Cyclosporine for severe, refractory cases with close monitoring for renal toxicity and hypertension [^91612afc] [^9d14cf79].

---

## Special considerations

- **Infants and young children**: Acute urticaria is common and often viral; use weight-based antihistamine dosing and avoid sedating agents when possible [^12811722].
- **School-aged children**: Chronic urticaria is less common but can significantly impact quality of life; address sleep disturbance, school absences, and psychosocial effects [^4d8f3131].
- **Adolescents**: Chronic urticaria prevalence rises; autoimmune associations and inducible forms are more common, warranting a lower threshold for thyroid screening and BAT [^4d8f3131].

---

## Patient education and follow-up

Education should cover **trigger avoidance**, recognition of **anaphylaxis**, and appropriate use of **epinephrine** when indicated. Arrange follow-up every 2–6 weeks initially to assess control and adherence, then space out as stable; monitor for chronicity, medication adverse effects, and psychosocial impact [^14bb5282] [^760e5caa].

---

## Prognosis

Acute urticaria typically resolves within days to weeks and has an excellent prognosis. Chronic urticaria persists beyond 6 weeks, with a **resolution rate of about 10% per year**; positive BAT and absence of basophils predict earlier resolution, whereas autoimmune comorbidity and inducible forms portend a longer course [^4d8f3131].

---

Hives in children are common and usually self-limited; **most cases resolve with antihistamines and supportive care**. Persistent or severe cases warrant a structured evaluation and stepwise therapy, with escalation to omalizumab or cyclosporine for refractory disease.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) diagnostic stratification — Biopsy-confirmed PML is defined by JC virus (JCV) antigens or nucleic acids or virions in brain biopsy tissue with typical histology in patients with typical clinical and radiological findings; laboratory-confirmed PML is JCV DNA detected by PCR of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients with typical clinical and radiological findings, and detection of intrathecal antibody production may also support the diagnosis; possible PML refers to patients with typical clinical and radiological findings without virologic or histologic confirmation in brain tissue or CSF. Presence of antibodies to JCV in serum or JCV DNA in blood or urine does not establish the diagnosis of PML because these studies can be positive in individuals without PML.

### Myths, facts and controversies in the diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis [^54083a93]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2019). Medium credibility.

Myth 2: 'There are no hives so it can't be anaphylaxis'

Cutaneous symptoms (most commonly urticaria or 'hives') are absent in around 10% of anaphylaxis reactions and where present may be delayed in onset. This is consistent with a case series of six paediatric fatalities due to food anaphylaxis, where only one child had evidence of skin involvement: the lack of skin signs may have delayed diagnosis and appropriate treatment with epinephrine, contributing to the fatal outcome. The Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) recently issued new guidelines, which define anaphylaxis as:
Any acute onset illness with typical skin features (urticarial rash or erythema/flushing, and/or angio-oedema), PLUS involvement of respiratory and/or cardiovascular and/or persistent severe gastrointestinal symptoms; or
Any acute onset of hypotension or bronchospasm or upper airway obstruction where anaphylaxis is considered possible, even if typical skin features are not present.

These criteria better reflect increasing recognition that cutaneous manifestations are often absent or appear late in near-fatal and fatal anaphylaxis.

The safe management of anaphylaxis depends on early recognition and treatment with intramuscular epinephrine. The British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI), in conjunction with the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, has recently updated its Allergy Management Plans for children (figure 1), highlighting the potential for skin symptoms to be absent in anaphylaxis.

Influenza vaccination — contraindications and precautions for inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) in children with or without HIV — Influenza vaccines are not approved for children aged < 6 months; persons with a previous severe allergic reaction to influenza vaccine should not receive influenza vaccine in the future, and future avoidance of influenza vaccine in this setting is recommended regardless of the suspected component; individuals with egg-associated reactions with symptoms other than hives or who required epinephrine may receive any licensed and recommended influenza vaccine "that is otherwise appropriate for the recipient's age and health status", but in persons with severe egg reactions vaccine should be administered in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting with supervision able to recognize and manage severe allergic conditions; a physician should be consulted before vaccinating children with a moderate-to-severe illness with a fever, in which case vaccination should be postponed until recovery.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (patients with HIV infection), IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend to consider initiating ACEis or ARBs for the treatment of proteinuric nephropathy in pediatric patients with HIV infection. Consider initiating ACEis or ARBs as first-line therapy for hypertension in these patients. Be cautious when using these agents because pediatric patients with HIV and proteinuria are at greater risk for salt wasting and are prone to dehydration.

Pegylated interferon alfa-2A (Pegasys) — preparations, major toxicities, and special instructions for HIV-infected children are detailed as follows: Preparation is injection with vials and prefilled syringes. Indicating need for medical attention, more frequent events include hematologic toxicity (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia), neurotoxicity (confusion, depression, insomnia, anxiety), and injection erythema; less frequent are cardiovascular effects (chest pain, hypertension, arrhythmias, hypotension) and hypoesthesia/paresthesia; rare events include vision abnormalities or loss of vision, allergic reaction (rash, hives), hypothyroidism, and development of antinuclear antibodies. Indicating need for medical attention if persistent or bothersome, more frequent issues include flu-like syndrome (myalgia, arthralgia, fever, chills, headache, back pain, malaise, fatigue), gastrointestinal disturbances (abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia), and pharyngitis, dry mouth; less frequent are alopecia, epistaxis, and elevated serum transaminases, serum creatinine and BUN, glucose, triglycerides. Special instructions note toxicity is dose-related with dose modifications based on type and degree of toxicity; for non-life threatening reactions, reduce dose or temporarily discontinue drug and restart at low doses with stepwise increases; if patients have visual complaints, an ophthalmologic exam should be performed to detect possible retinal hemorrhage or retinal artery or vein obstruction; should not be used in children with decompensated hepatic disease, significant cytopenia, autoimmune disease, or significant pre-existing renal or cardiac disease; if symptoms of hepatic decompensation occur (ascites, coagulopathy, jaundice), Peg-IFN-α-2A should be discontinued; monitor CBC, renal function, LFTs, thyroid function, and glucose; store vials and syringes in refrigerator and protect from light; administer SQ in abdomen or thigh and rotate injection sites.

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^12811722]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Are there biomarkers of activity in CSU?

The severity of CSU should be evaluated based on the intensity of its clinical symptoms. Several biomarkers, such as interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein and D-dimers, metalloproteinase-9 and complement C3 and C4, have shown distinctive patterns in CSU patients, but these molecules have still not been validated as useful biomarkers.

Key point: Although several substances may show specific levels in CSU patients, they have not yet been validated as CSU biomarkers.

Does isolated angioedema have clinical, therapeutic and/or prognostic implications?

Isolated angioedema with no hives that responds to antihistamines should be explored and phenotyped. Most guidelines – include isolated angioedema as a subtype of CSU. However, this condition does not share the typical features of chronic urticaria, such as being more frequent in women or having an autoimmune profile. In certain cases, typical CSU starts with isolated angioedema that evolves into cutaneous wheals. On the other hand, histaminergic angioedema is clearly different from bradykinin-mediated angioedema, which does not respond to antihistamines or corticosteroids, has a different physiopathology – and requires a different treatment approach. The differential diagnosis for isolated angioedema is shown in Table 5.

Table 5
Differential diagnosis of isolated angioedema

Key point: Isolated angioedema does not share the typical features of CSU.

How should the diagnosis of CSU in children be approached?

Chronic spontaneous urticaria is less frequent in children, but in general, it shares the underlying causes and physiopathology of CSU in adults. Therefore, the diagnostic approach in children and adults is the same. However, it should be noted that infants are more prone to develop acute urticaria secondary to an infection.

Key point: The diagnostic approach to CSU in children should be the same as that in adults.

Lipid formulations of amphotericin B in children — infusion reaction pattern shows lower overall toxicity than deoxycholate but early-onset reactions in a subset. Lipid formulations of amphotericin B cause less acute and chronic toxicity than amphotericin B deoxycholate, yet in approximately 20% of children they can cause acute infusion-related reactions, including chest pain, dyspnea, hypoxia, severe pain in the abdomen, flank, or leg, or flushing and urticaria. Compared with conventional amphotericin B, most (85%) reactions to lipid formulations occur within the first 5 minutes after infusion and rapidly resolve with temporary interruption of the amphotericin B infusion and administration of IV diphenhydramine; premedication with diphenhydramine can reduce the incidence of these reactions.

### History matters: preventing severe allergic transfusion reactions [^af250b5f]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

The question of whether to premedicate has been investigated in numerous prior studies. In the best known randomized prospective trials, the conclusion was that premedication did not reduce the overall ATR rate, but the size of these studies was small, in the treatment and placebo groups. Based on these studies, it can be concluded that there is little if any evidence of the effectiveness of antihistamines (specifically, diphenhydramine) on ATRs. These studies did not focus on patients with a history of severe ATRs, however, and information regarding the administration of antiallergy medication was not captured. In addition, the patient-selection process was questionable because the number of patients with hives was lower in the treatment group in 1 study.

In contrast, in the other study, patients with a history of ATRs were excluded, and the only patient experiencing shortness of breath was in the placebo group. Although another randomized prospective trial investigating the effect of chlorpheniramine maleate found that it prevents delayed (4–24 hours after the transfusion) rash in a reasonably small cohort that did not include severe ATRs, a retrospective study in pediatric hematology patients showed increased ATR frequency with premedication, likely due to premedication being used more in this category of patients. Altogether, current recommendations for ATR prophylaxis are based on these studies, which did not investigate premedication effects in patients with a history of severe ATRs. Moreover, the ATR diagnosis was not standardized, and these studies did not address imputability. In addition, no data on the administration of routine antiallergy medication were captured.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^14bb5282]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Urticaria/angioedema follow-up and treatment adjustment — timing and frequency: Follow-up in 2 to 6 weeks as symptoms and treatment response dictate, because management of urticaria/angioedema requires frequent follow-up visits to determine whether the intervention, treatment, or both is effective, and modifying treatment (step down or discontinue) based on patient response is necessary after 2 to 6 weeks to determine whether hives are persistent and likely to become chronic.

### Desloratidine (Clarinex) [^7dbdab51]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria

The efficacy and safety of CLARINEX Tablets 5 mg once daily was
studied in 416 chronic idiopathic urticaria patients 12 to 84 years of age, of
whom 211 received CLARINEX. In two double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized
clinical trials of six weeks' duration, at the pre-specified one-week primary
time point evaluation, CLARINEX Tablets significantly reduced the severity of
pruritus when compared to placebo (Table 4). Secondary
endpoints were also evaluated and during the first week of therapy CLARINEX
Tablets 5 mg reduced the secondary endpoints, "Number of Hives" and the "Size of
the Largest Hive", when compared to placebo.

Pruritus scored 0 to 3 where 0 = no symptom to 3 = maximal symptom.

Mean reduction in pruritus averaged over the first week of treatment.

The clinical safety of CLARINEX Syrup was documented in three, 15-day,
double-blind, placebo-controlled safety studies in pediatric subjects with a
documented history of allergic rhinitis, chronic idiopathic urticaria, or
subjects who were candidates for antihistamine therapy. In the first study, 2.5
mg of CLARINEX Syrup was administered to 60 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of
age. The second study evaluated 1.25 mg of CLARINEX Syrup administered to 55
pediatric subjects 2 to 5 years of age. In the third study, 1.25 mg of CLARINEX
Syrup was administered to 65 pediatric subjects 12 to 23 months of age and 1.0
mg of CLARINEX Syrup was administered to 66 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 months of
age. The results of these studies demonstrated the safety of CLARINEX Syrup in
pediatric subjects 6 months to 11 years of age.

### Treatment of chronic urticaria in children with antihistamines and cyclosporine [^91612afc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic idiopathic urticaria, daily hives that last > 6 weeks, can be resistant to antihistamines, even when higher than conventional doses are used. Other pharmacologic agents have been associated with inconsistent benefit.

Objective

We examined the relationship of clinical characteristics and the presence of autoimmune antibodies to antihistamine resistance in children. We further examined the efficacy and safety of cyclosporine in children whose urticaria was resistant to antihistamine.

Methods

Patients referred to the pediatric allergy and pulmonary specialty clinic at the University of Iowa Children's Hospital and diagnosed as having chronic idiopathic urticaria were identified during the period from August 2008 to July 2013. A retrospective examination of treatment and outcome was performed.

Results

Forty-six patients, 26 female patients and 20 male patients, with chronic idiopathic urticaria were identified. The ages of 16 patients who were antihistamine resistant ranged from 9 to 18 years (median, 12.5 years). Those patients who were antihistamine responsive had a median age of 6 years, significantly lower than those who were antihistamine resistant (P = 0.0001). There was no significant association between autoimmune antibodies and antihistamine resistance. All the patients who were antihistamine resistant were treated with cyclosporine; all experienced complete resolution of urticaria at times that ranged from 2 days to 3 months (median, 7 days). Relapses responsive to repeated cyclosporine occurred in 5 of the patients after 1 week to 15 months (median, 6 months). Adverse effects were not seen in these patients.

Conclusion

Our data were consistent with efficacy and safety of cyclosporine for chronic urticaria in children when even high doses of antihistamines are ineffective.

### Common skin rashes in children | AAFP… [^4272cfb5]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

8 Rapid antigen tests are routinely used in clinicians' offices and have a sensitivity of approximately 86%. 10 Cultures may be ordered when the suspicion for group A streptococcal infection is high, but the rapid antigen test result is negative. 11 Penicillin is the therapy of choice for streptococcal infection. Those allergic to penicillin and cephalosporins may be treated with oral macrolides or clindamycin.
10. Initially, children may develop vesicles or pustules that form a thick, yellow crust. With autoinoculation, the lesions may quickly spread. The face and extremities are most commonly affected. Although impetigo is usually a self-limited disease, antibiotics are often prescribed to prevent complications and spread of the infection.
12. Erythema Infectiosum Erythema infectiosum, or fifth disease, is caused by parvovirus B19.

It is a common childhood infection characterized by a prodrome of low-grade fever, malaise, sore throat, headache, and nausea followed several days later by an erythematous "slapped cheek" facial rash. Arthralgias occur in approximately 8% of young children with the disease but are much more common in teens and young adults. Patients are no longer considered infectious once the rash appears. Treatment is symptomatic and includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for arthralgias and antihistamines for pruritus.
13. Tinea Infection Tinea is a common fungal skin infection in children that may affect the scalp, body, groin, feet, hands, or nails. The diagnosis is based on physical examination findings and is confirmed by potassium hydroxide microscopy, periodic acid–Schiff staining of hair follicles, or fungal culture. This lesion is often referred to as ringworm.

15 Tinea capitis is treated with oral griseofulvin and terbinafine, depending on the most common etiologic agent in the geographic area. Tinea corporis is usually effectively treated with topical antifungals, with oral agents reserved for severe cases. 15.

### Desloratadine (Clarinex) [^9f6d37e2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.3 Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria

The efficacy and safety of CLARINEX Tablets 5 mg once daily was studied in 416 chronic idiopathic urticaria patients 12 to 84 years of age, of whom 211 received CLARINEX. In two double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of six weeks duration, at the pre-specified one-week primary time point evaluation, CLARINEX Tablets significantly reduced the severity of pruritus when compared to placebo (Table 5). Secondary endpoints were also evaluated, and during the first week of therapy CLARINEX Tablets 5 mg reduced the secondary endpoints, "Number of Hives" and the "Size of the Largest Hive", when compared to placebo.

The clinical safety of CLARINEX Oral Solution was documented in three, 15-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled safety studies in pediatric subjects with a documented history of allergic rhinitis, chronic idiopathic urticaria, or subjects who were candidates for antihistamine therapy. In the first study, 2.5 mg of CLARINEX Oral Solution was administered to 60 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age. The second study evaluated 1.25 mg of CLARINEX Oral Solution administered to 55 pediatric subjects 2 to 5 years of age. In the third study, 1.25 mg of CLARINEX Oral Solution was administered to 65 pediatric subjects 12 to 23 months of age and 1.0 mg of CLARINEX Oral Solution was administered to 66 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 months of age. The results of these studies demonstrated the safety of CLARINEX Oral Solution in pediatric subjects 6 months to 11 years of age.

### Experience with cyclosporine in children with chronic idiopathic urticaria [^9d14cf79]. Pediatric Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The identification of an autoimmune mechanism for many patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) was used as a rational for a controlled clinical trial of cyclosporine for adults with CIU not responsive to usual measures. That randomized placebo controlled clinical trial demonstrated clinical efficacy, acceptable safety, and a suggestion of inducing remission in such patients.

Objective

To report our experience with cyclosporine in pediatric patients with CIU.

Methods

Fifty-four patients with CIU were referred to us during the period from 2000 through June of 2005. Seven of those, aged 9–16, failed therapy with high dose antihistamines even with the addition of alternate morning prednisone. Neoral brand of cyclosporine, 3 mg/kg/day divided b.i.d., was initiated in these patients. Cyclosporine serum concentrations, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and blood pressure were routinely monitored.

Results

All had cessation of hives. This occurred after 1–4 weeks for six of the seven and 8 weeks for one. While some experienced relapses, all were eventually off of all medications and free of hives. None of the seven experienced any adverse effects.

Conclusions

Our experience in children is consistent with a previous controlled clinical trial in adults and supports the efficacy and safety of cyclosporine for CIU. However, we recommend that it be reserved for those whose CIU that is resistant to conventional measures and that patients be carefully monitored with cyclosporine serum concentrations and measures of renal function.

### Tapentadol toxicity in children [^ee3b2a94]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Tapentadol (Nucynta) is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe pain in adults. Tapentadol's mechanism of action consists of acting as an agonist on the μ-opioid receptor and by inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine. There are no published reports on the toxicity of tapentadol in pediatric patients. The goals of this study are to describe the incidence, medical outcomes, clinical effects, and treatment secondary to tapentadol exposure.

Methods

This retrospective observational study used data from the National Poison Data System. Inclusion criteria were exposure to tapentadol from November 1, 2008 to December 31, 2013; age 0 to 17 years; single ingestion; and followed to a known outcome.

Results

There were 104 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Eighty patients were aged ≤ 6, 2-year-olds the most common age group (60.6%). There were 52 male and 52 female patients. Of the 104 patients, 93 had unintentional exposures. No deaths were reported. Sixty-two of the patients had no effect, 34 had minor effects, 6 had moderate and 2 had major effects. Thirty patients reported drowsiness and lethargy. Other effects reported included nausea, vomiting, miosis, tachycardia, respiratory depression, dizziness/vertigo, coma, dyspnea, pallor, vomiting, edema, hives/welts, slurred speech, pruritus, and hallucinations/delusions. Fifty-three patients were reported to have no medical intervention.

Conclusions

This is the first study examining the toxic effects of tapentadol in a pediatric population. Although a majority of the patients in this review developed no effect from their exposure, two had life-threatening events. The most common effects reported were opioidlike.

### Efavirenz [^a00ba1e5]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.8 Rash

In controlled clinical trials, 26% (266/1008) of adult patients treated with 600 mg efavirenz experienced new-onset skin rash compared with 17% (111/635) of those treated in control groups [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Rash associated with blistering, moist desquamation, or ulceration occurred in 0.9% (9/1008) of patients treated with efavirenz. The incidence of Grade 4 rash (e.g., erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome) in adult patients treated with efavirenz in all studies and expanded access was 0.1%. Rashes are usually mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first 2 weeks of initiating therapy with efavirenz (median time to onset of rash in adults was 11 days) and, in most patients continuing therapy with efavirenz, rash resolves within 1 month (median duration, 16 days). The discontinuation rate for rash in adult clinical trials was 1.7% (17/1008).

Rash was reported in 59 of 182 pediatric patients (32%) treated with efavirenz [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Two pediatric patients experienced Grade 3 rash (confluent rash with fever, generalized rash), and four patients had Grade 4 rash (erythema multiforme). The median time to onset of rash in pediatric patients was 28 days (range 3–1642 days). Prophylaxis with appropriate antihistamines before initiating therapy with efavirenz in pediatric patients should be considered.

Efavirenz can generally be reinitiated in patients interrupting therapy because of rash. Efavirenz should be discontinued in patients developing severe rash associated with blistering, desquamation, mucosal involvement, or fever. Appropriate antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may improve the tolerability and hasten the resolution of rash. For patients who have had a life-threatening cutaneous reaction (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome), alternative therapy should be considered [see Contraindications (4)].

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^760e5caa]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Annotation 12 — Management of chronic urticaria/angioedema and periodic reassessment: Management entails realistic expectations, daily use of medications, appropriate avoidance measures, and regular follow-up, with periodic reassessment to determine response to therapy and to evaluate clinical changes over time; further work-up might be needed to rule out underlying causes or development of concomitant conditions, and a more detailed evaluation might be warranted for selected patients. If a biopsy is considered, consider conditions that might require special testing and coordinate this with a dermatopathologist, and objective assessments of the percentage of the body covered in hives, itch severity, and quality of life at the initial visit and each subsequent visit are also important. Complicating factors, such as use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents or an ACE inhibitor in a patient with episodic angioedema, are examples of medications that might compromise patient outcomes, and lack of salutary response to antihistamines taken regularly can also suggest that further evaluation for an alternative condition is warranted.

### Acute urticaria as the initial presentation of COVID-19 in a pediatric patient [^2e62b63b]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 5-year-old Hispanic girl with no significant medical history was seen for the evaluation of acute urticaria. Approximately 1 month previously, the patient developed hives after returning home from her father's house, where she spent the weekend. Her initial symptoms were hives across her entire body, sparing her face (Fig 1). She was treated with oral and topical diphenhydramine at the recommendation of her pediatrician. Her hives were moderately pruritic, and they worsened after she showered. Two days after her hives began, she developed fever, with her temperature reaching 101.6 °F. Her fever was treated with acetaminophen, but it continued to persist along with her hives for the next 3 days.

Fig 1
Patient with urticarial eruption on the trunk due to COVID-19.

As her symptoms continued to worsen, she presented to the emergency department 5 days after her symptoms began but was treated for idiopathic urticaria with H1 blockade and discharged home. Two days later, she developed a cough. She returned to the emergency department 11 days after her initial presentation because of her persistent hives, fevers, and cough. Her SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test result was positive, and she underwent additional evaluation for COVID-19 (Table I). Her prothrombin time was 14.1 seconds, international normalized ratio was 1.08, activated partial thromboplastin time was 36 seconds, fibrinogen level was 329 mg/dL, and D-dimer level was 0.75 μg/mL. In addition, her C-reactive protein level was 1.08 mg/dL, troponin level was < 0.02 ng/mL, ferritin level was 88 ng/mL, and N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide level was 25 pg/mL. As the patient was clinically stable, she was discharged home with supportive care. She continued to receive acetaminophen and was transitioned to cetirizine instead of diphenhydramine. Her symptoms persisted for the following week before resolving and have not reoccurred.

### Omalizumab (Xolair) [^370d3115]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Adult and Adolescent Patients 12 Years of Age and Older

The safety and efficacy of XOLAIR for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), previously referred to as chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) was assessed in two placebo-controlled, multiple-dose clinical trials of 24 weeks' duration (CSU Trial 1; n = 319, [NCT01287117]) and 12 weeks' duration (CSU Trial 2; n = 322, [NCT01292473]). Patients received XOLAIR 75 mg, 150 mg, or 300 mg or placebo by SC injection every 4 weeks in addition to their baseline level of H1 antihistamine therapy for 24 or 12 weeks, followed by a 16-week washout observation period. A total of 640 patients (165 males, 475 females) were included for the efficacy analyses. Most patients were white (84%) and the median age was 42 years (range 12–72).

Disease severity was measured by a weekly urticaria activity score (UAS7, range 0–42), which is a composite of the weekly itch severity score (range 0–21) and the weekly hive count score (range 0–21). All patients were required to have a UAS7 of ≥ 16, and a weekly itch severity score of ≥ 8 for the 7 days prior to randomization, despite having used an H1 antihistamine for at least 2 weeks.

### Olaparib for childhood tumors harboring defects in DNA damage repair genes: arm H of the NCI-COG pediatric MATCH trial [^bb2a7ff4]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Olaparib is a potent orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), an essential enzyme for single-strand DNA break repair by base excision (BER). By virtue of "synthetic lethality", adult malignancies including breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancer with germline and somatic BRCA1/2, RAD51C/D, and ATM inactivating mutations and resultant homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) are susceptible to PARP inhibition with olaparib monotherapy.DNA damage repair (DDR) gene alterations are uncommon in pediatric cancer, and it remains unclear whether they confer vulnerability to PARP inhibition. In this phase II study, we selected patients to receive olaparib monotherapy based on the validated genetic markers of DDR in adult malignancy detected with tumor-only sequencing with germline testing performed and reported separately. Actionable tumor alterations were identified in 5 DDR genes in 18 patients: BRCA2 (n = 8), BRCA1 (n = 2), ATM (n = 6), RAD51D (n = 2), and RAD51C (n = 1). In total, 11/18 variants were found to also be present in the germline: 4/8 BRCA2, 2/2 BRCA1, and 5/6 ATM. Retrospective analysis revealed tumor loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in only one patient; in all other cases, the variant allele frequency of somatic mutations was consistent with monoallelic loss. Of the 18 matched patients, 9 were ineligible for treatment, 3 declined assignment, and 6 enrolled (Figure 1). Treated patients received a dose 30% below the adult recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) as stipulated by the operating rules for Pediatric Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (MATCH) for agents not previously tested in children. The only patient with biallelic tumor loss of ATM was removed from the study following an acute allergic reaction (hives) to the first dose of olaparib recurring upon rechallenge; 3 others received < 85% of the agent during cycle 1 (early progression, patient withdrawal, and dosing error; each n = 1); 2 completed the first cycle with no DLT. Minimal hematologic toxicity was observed, including one patient with grade 3 lymphopenia, and 3 with grade 1/2 anemia. There were no responses. The median (range) number of cycles received was 1. Due to small patient numbers, no conclusions can be made regarding the efficacy of olaparib monotherapy in children. Additionally, the patients enrolled in this study may have had insufficient exposure to olaparib based on the starting dose, limited pharmacokinetics, and a recently published pediatric phase I study suggesting that even at olaparib doses equivalent to the adult RP2D, children attained lower peak plasma concentrations and AUC. Critically, in contrast to adult malignancies, the genomics of the pediatric tumors evaluated in the National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Children's Oncology Group (COG) Pediatric MATCH trial and other recent studies confirm that the majority of DDR pathway gene mutations in children are monoallelic and unlikely to confer a sufficient exploitable dependence on PARP inhibition. Alternative biomarkers of potential response to agents targeting DDR/response pathways in children are needed.

Less Common Adverse Reactions

Defecation urgency, fecal incontinence, dyspepsia, and viral gastroenteritis were reported in less than 2% of patients in the LINZESS treatment group and at an incidence greater than in the placebo treatment group.

Functional Constipation (FC) in Pediatric Patients 6 to 17 Years of Age

The safety of LINZESS 72 mcg once daily was evaluated in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age with FC in a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (Trial 7) [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. There were 164 patients per treatment group.

Diarrhea was the most common adverse reaction and was reported in 4% of LINZESS-treated patients compared to 2% of placebo-treated patients. One patient in the LINZESS-treated group reported severe diarrhea and discontinued treatment. No patient in the placebo-treated group discontinued treatment due to severe diarrhea. Most reported cases of diarrhea started within the first 2 weeks of LINZESS treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Other adverse reactions reported at a higher incidence in the LINZESS group than the placebo group included nausea (2 patients) and abdominal discomfort and dehydration (1 patient each).

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of LINZESS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Hypersensitivity reactions: Anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash (including hives or urticaria)

Gastrointestinal reactions: Hematochezia, nausea, rectal hemorrhage

### Desloratadine for chronic idiopathic urticaria: a review of clinical efficacy [^b3a5239f]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is a disabling affliction that considerably limits patients' daily activities and interferes with sleep. Clinical studies have shown that histamine H1-receptor antagonists (antihistamines) are highly effective for inhibiting the hives/wheals and pruritus associated with CIU, as well as improving patients' quality of life. Desloratadine is a rapid-acting, once-daily, nonsedating selective H1-receptor antagonist/inverse receptor agonist with proven clinical efficacy in patients with CIU. It has 10–20 times the in vivo H1 receptor-binding affinity of loratadine, its parent compound, and 52–194 times the H1 receptor-binding affinity of cetirizine, ebastine, loratadine, and fexofenadine. Desloratadine displays linear pharmacokinetics after oral administration. Age and sex have no apparent effect on the drug's metabolism and elimination, and food does not affect its bioavailability or absorption. Desloratadine also exerts anti-inflammatory effects via mechanisms that are independent of H1-receptor antagonism. Results from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of 6 weeks' duration in adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe CIU indicate that desloratadine significantly minimizes the severity of pruritus, reduces the number and size of hives, and improves disease-impaired sleep and daily activities. Improvements were noted after a single dose of desloratadine and were maintained over 6 weeks of treatment. Desloratadine was safe and well tolerated in clinical trials of patients with CIU. The adverse effect profile of desloratadine in adults, as well as in children aged from 6 months to 11 years, is comparable to that of placebo. Evaluations of cognitive and psychomotor performance in adults indicate no impairment of function with dosages of desloratadine 5 mg/day. In conclusion, desloratadine is an important therapeutic option for prompt and enduring symptom relief in patients with moderate-to-severe CIU. In addition to efficacy and safety, desloratadine affords a convenient administration regimen, rapid onset of action, and an absence of drug-drug or drug-food interactions. Other important prescribing considerations are that, unlike all first-generation and some second-generation antihistamines, desloratadine is nonsedating at its clinically approved dosage and does not impair psychomotor function.

### Oral immunotherapy for multiple foods in a pediatric allergy clinic setting [^3abd7308]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Parent Instruction

Parents were advised to give OIT doses with a meal or snack at a time when (1) they would be available to monitor the child for 1 hour after the dose, (2) the child would not exercise or be in a hot environment (including hot bath or shower) just before or for 2 hours after the dose, and (3) the child was not sick with fever, malaise, or significant respiratory symptoms. Parents were instructed in management of OIT reactions at home, with appropriate doses of diphenhydramine (for mild itching or perioral hives) and ranitidine (for post-OIT abdominal pain or nausea) included in postvisit instructions. They were instructed to inject epinephrine if the patient had allergy symptoms that involved at least 2 organ systems, generalized hives, respiratory distress, or protracted abdominal symptoms. If epinephrine was administered, the patient was taken to the nearest ED immediately.

Adverse Events Monitoring

Adverse events were documented by parent report or observation during clinic visits and by telephone call or encrypted e-mail between visits. Parents were provided with the senior author's e-mail address and cell phone number and were asked to report any reactions. If allergic symptoms occurred with a dose, the patient was treated with appropriate medications, and the dose was reduced to the previously tolerated dose, then advanced more slowly as tolerated. All dose escalations were done in the clinic.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^d7ddf104]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria — testing recommendations and indications: Skin testing or laboratory evaluation for allergy to foods, food additives, or aeroallergens not supported by a specific history compatible with IgE-mediated pathogenesis has not been associated with improved outcomes of care and is not recommended. Because acute urticaria and angioedema will usually resolve spontaneously, laboratory evaluation for chronic illness not suggested by the clinical history or physical examination and elimination diets are not recommended, and extensive evaluation for specific viral pathogens (or antiviral therapy) is not indicated unless suggested by the clinical history. In contrast, skin testing or immunoassay to identify specific triggers for acute urticaria and angioedema can be helpful if an allergic cause is suggested based on the patient's history, and skin testing in this scenario would only be done after the resolution of acute hives with suppression of antihistamines or through serologic testing in the presence of significant dermatographism.

Section 1: Classification and Diagnosis of HAE-nC1INH

Classification of Recurrent Angioedema Without Hives

Recurrent angioedema without hives encompasses a range of diagnoses with markedly different prognoses and treatments. Several different classification schemes of angioedema have recently been proposed. When evaluating a patient with angioedema, two of the most important criteria to consider are (1) whether the mechanism of swelling is from mast cell activation or another cause (especially bradykinin but potentially including other mast cell–independent mediators or mechanisms affecting vascular permeability) and (2) whether it is hereditary or acquired.

Mast cell–mediated angioedema can result from type I hypersensitivity reactions (antigen bound to specific IgE on mast cells), direct mast cell activation, or as part of chronic urticaria. While chronic urticaria most often includes hives, a significant minority (~ 10%) of these patients present only with angioedema. Mast cell–mediated angioedema without hives may be a separate disorder than chronic urticaria.

A number of drugs can cause angioedema through a variety of mechanisms in the absence of specific IgE. The drugs most commonly associated with angioedema include angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, other kininase (such as neprilysin or dipeptidyl peptidase IV [DPPIV]) inhibitors, tissue plasminogen activators, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

HAE includes a group of rare genetically transmitted disorders characterized by recurrent angioedema without hives. It should be recognized that hives are common and can occur coincidentally in patients with a separate diagnosis of recurrent angioedema. Biochemical abnormalities in HAE were first identified in 1962 and 1963 and subsequently shown to be autosomal dominant with high penetrance. HAE-C1INH is caused by pathogenic variants in the gene encoding C1INH (SERPING1) resulting in reduced functional levels of C1INH and leading to dysregulated production of bradykinin.

The initial laboratory evaluation

It was later determined that the patient's father was ill with COVID-19 when she stayed with him the weekend prior to developing urticaria. Over the course of the 11 days prior to her COVID-19 diagnosis, several immediate and extended family members developed COVID-19 infections, which were eventually traced back to exposure to the patient. She presented for follow-up to an outpatient allergy practice for further evaluation of her acute urticaria. As she was now asymptomatic with her hives resolved with the rest of her viral symptoms, she was advised to continue using cetirizine as needed.

### Oral immunotherapy for multiple foods in a pediatric allergy clinic setting [^cd0a3472]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background:

The increasing incidence of pediatric food allergy results in significant health care burden and family stress. Oral immunotherapy (OIT) can induce tolerance to peanut, milk, and egg. OIT for other foods, particularly multiple foods simultaneously, has not been thoroughly studied.

Objective:

To summarize our experience with OIT for multiple foods in a pediatric allergy clinic setting.

Methods:

Medical records were reviewed for patients undergoing OIT for multiple foods. Methods and outcomes of OIT were summarized. Outcomes were analyzed for correlation with baseline food allergen skin prick tests (SPTs) and specific IgE (sIgE) test results.

Results:

Forty-five patients aged 1.5 to 18 years undertook OIT for up to 12 foods, including peanut, tree nuts, seeds, legumes, and egg. At the time of review, 35 patients were receiving daily maintenance dosing, 4 had completed OIT and were continuing to eat their foods 3 times weekly, and 6 had stopped OIT because of anxiety, inconvenience, or allergy symptoms. A total of 49% of patients had reactions during the up-dosing process, mostly oral itching (33%), perioral hives (40%), and abdominal pain (35%). There was no correlation of baseline skin prick test (SPT) and sIgE test results with reaction threshold for baseline food challenge, lowest dose causing reactions during up-dosing, or time to reach maintenance. Higher baseline sIgE level but not baseline SPT result was associated with an increased number of allergic reactions during OIT. Baseline SPT correlated with stopping OIT.

Conclusion:

A similar approach to that used for peanut OIT can be taken for nonpeanut foods and for multiple foods simultaneously. High baseline allergy test results are not a contraindication to OIT.

### Unusual purpuric eruption in a child [^d5bf2d2c]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

A 5-year-old, previously healthy girl presented with new-onset, persistent, red, burning hives covering large segments of her body. Associated symptoms included angioedema, shortness of breath, and diarrhea. The lesions resolved after 24 hours, leaving behind areas of bruising. On physical examination, the patient appeared well, with scattered, variably sized, purpuric patches and urticarial plaques on the torso and extremities (Fig 1, Fig 2, Fig 3). Laboratory evaluation revealed leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, normal C1q antibody levels, and decreased C4 levels. Two weeks after the initial presentation, she developed the same purpuric eruption accompanied by acute hypoxic respiratory failure.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Urticaria multiforme
B. Urticarial vasculitis (UV)
C. Erythema multiforme
D. Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) (IgA-mediated vasculitis)

### Evaluating comorbidities, natural history, and predictors of early resolution in a cohort of children with chronic urticaria [^4d8f3131]. JAMA Dermatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Chronic urticaria (CU) affects 0.1% to 0.3% of children. Most cases have no identifiable trigger and are classified as chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). At least half of patients with CSU may have an autoimmune etiology that can be determined in vitro using the basophil activation test (BAT). While 30% to 55% of CU cases resolve spontaneously within 5 years in adults, the natural history and predictors of resolution in children are not known.

Objective

To assess the comorbidities, natural history of CU, and its subtypes in children and identify predictors of resolution.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We followed a pediatric cohort with chronic urticaria that presented with hives lasting at least 6 weeks between 2013 and 2015 at a single tertiary care referral center.

Exposures

Data were collected on disease activity, comorbidities, physical triggers, BAT results, complete blood cell count, C-reactive protein levels, thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, and thyroid peroxidase antibodies.

Main Outcomes and Measures

We assessed the rate of resolution (defined as absence of hives for at least 1 year with no treatment) and the association with clinical and laboratory markers.

Results

The cohort comprised 139 children younger than 18 years old. Thirty-one patients (20%) had inducible urticaria, most commonly cold induced. Six children had autoimmune comorbidity, such as thyroiditis and type 1 diabetes. Autoimmune disorders (24 patients [17%]) and CU (17 patients [12%]) were common in family members. Positive BAT results (CD63 levels > 1.8%) were found in 58% of patients. Patients with positive BAT results (CD63 level > 1.8%) were twice as likely to resolve after 1 year compared with negative BAT results (hazard ratio [HR], 2.33; 95% CI, 1.08–5.05). In contrast, presence of basophils decreased the likelihood of resolution (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.20–0.99). No correlation with age was found. Chronic urticaria resolved in 43 patients, with a rate of resolution of 10.3% per year. Levels of CD63 higher than 1.8% and absence of basophils were associated with earlier disease resolution.

Conclusions and Relevance

Resolution rate in children with CU is low. The presence of certain biomarkers (positive BAT result and basophil count) may help to predict the likelihood of resolution.

### Hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor: an updated international consensus paper on diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment [^8447a106]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

HAE-HS3OST6

This pathogenic variant has been described in one multigenerational family, and all affected individuals have been female, with an age of onset between 12 and 20 years. Attack frequency is reported as variable, between 1.2 and 36 per year. Attack locations described includes the face, extremities, abdomen, larynx, and tongue, with a report of worsening with the use of estrogen therapy.

HAE-Unknown

A proportion of patients with a phenotype indicative of HAE-nC1INH (recurrent angioedema that is not mast cell-mediated, normal C1INH function, and a positive family history of angioedema) do not have an identified pathogenic variant. They are classified into the group HAE of unknown cause (HAE-UNK). In HAE-UNK, angioedema typically first occurs in early adulthood. The angioedema most often involves the face and tongue and less frequently the gastrointestinal tract. Females are more frequently affected.

Specific Clinical Findings in Newly Described Hereditary Angioedema with Hives

Since the Symposium meeting, two reports have appeared associating additional mutations with hereditary recurrent angioedema. Interestingly, the clinical phenotype for both of these mutations appears to also include hives as well as angioedema. Further studies will be necessary before we know whether these represent HAE-nC1INH or familial urticaria.

HAE-CPN

A familial association between recurrent angioedema and CPN1 deficiency was first reported by Mathews et al. in 1978 prior to the recognition of HAE-nC1INH. Vincent et al. recently reported four unrelated families with angioedema affecting their face, abdomen, and larynx as well as CPN deficiency. In both reports, patients presented with hives as well as angioedema. Symptoms were associated with estrogens in several of the families. In several patients, elevated histamine levels were detected during attacks.

HAE-DAB2IP

This pathogenic variant was found in seven members (three female and four male) of a three-generation family from Argentina in whom affected members suffered from recurrent angioedema. Four of these seven patients also had recurrent hives involving multiple locations. The angioedema was worsened by estrogens.

Clinical Features Distinguishing HAE-nC1INH from INMA

The major differentiating features between HAE-nC1INH and INMA are the lack of a family history of swelling and the absence of known genetic pathogenic variants.

Pediatric Rheumatology, 23(2): P324

Introduction: B-cell targeted therapies such as Rituximab and Belimumab work well for treating juvenile lupus (1–3), however, there is a medical dilemma when a patient either reacts to one of the commonly used agents or is refractory to their use.

Objectives: To postulate the use of obinutuzumab in juvenile lupus as a potential alternative to other B-cell targeted therapies.

Methods: Case presentation:

A 9 years old girl fulfilled 8 SLICC criteria for lupus diagnosis (acute autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, leukopenia, proteinuria, acute cutaneous rash, low complement, positive ANA, anti-Sm and antiphospholipid).

The patient was initially managed with steroids, hydroxychloroquine and rituximab. Unfortunately, patient had severe reaction to rituximab in the form of widely spread hives. MMF was decided before the patient developed rapid respiratory deterioration and was admitted to PICU with Macrophage Activation Syndrome. CT chest showed an ARDS like picture. IV anakinra was instituted and was then escalated to continuous infusion as patient was clinically unstable with recalcitrant fever, rashes and rising ferritin levels. A more aggressive treatment including IVIG, IV Ciclosporin and IV cyclophosphamide were consecutively decided. Despite initial stabilization, patient was persistently pyrexial and lung infiltrates did not change. Following extensive multidisciplinary discussions, plasmapheresis was decided. Due to inadequate response and previous rituximab reaction, obinutuzumab was administered after multidisciplinary consensus and informed parental consent.

### Genetic variants leading to urticaria and angioedema and associated biomarkers [^fca251c1]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Advances in next generation sequencing technologies, as well as their expanded accessibility and clinical use over the past 2 decades, have led to an exponential increase in the number of identified single gene disorders. Among these are primary atopic disorders-inborn errors of immunity resulting in severe allergic phenotypes as a primary presenting feature. Two cardinal aspects of type I immediate hypersensitivity allergic reactions are hives and angioedema. Mast cells (MCs) are frequent primary drivers of these symptoms, but other cells have also been implicated. Even where MC degranulation is believed to be the cause, mediator-induced symptoms may greatly vary among individuals. Angioedema-particularly in the absence of hives-may also be caused by hereditary angioedema conditions resulting from aberrant regulation of contact system activation and excessive bradykinin generation or impairment of vascular integrity. In these patients, swelling can affect unpredictable locations and fail to respond to MC-directed therapies. Genetic variants have helped delineate key pathways in the etiology of urticaria and nonatopic angioedema and led to the development of targeted therapies. Herein, we describe the currently known inherited and acquired genetic causes for these conditions, highlight specific features in their clinical presentations, and discuss the benefits and limitations of biomarkers that can help distinguish them.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^0ac56c3b]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Definitions, diagnostic and therapeutic principles, and unmet needs in pediatric cough – literature review

In the literature review, key pediatric cough guidelines were identified from the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST), an Australian multidisciplinary expert committee, the British Thoracic Society (BTS), and the European Respiratory Society (ERS). These guidelines are summarized below, supplemented by relevant information from clinical studies and reviews. Of note, the definition of pediatric patients varies among cough guidelines, from up to 12–18 years (and in some cases is undefined). All guidelines separated cough into acute and chronic, and most guidelines focused on chronic cough.

Acute pediatric cough

Definitions, causes, and diagnosis of acute cough

Acute pediatric cough is defined as a cough lasting for < 2–3 weeks, depending on the guideline. Certain guidelines also define subacute or prolonged acute cough to describe 'the gray area' between acute and chronic cough, when symptoms may be slowly resolving (for example, for patients with pertussis or post-viral cough).

Acute cough is most commonly caused by a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Other possibilities include an inhaled foreign body, seasonal allergic rhinitis, or the first presentation of a chronic disease. Acute pediatric cough caused by URTI can be diagnosed from patient history and physical examination, and generally does not require further investigation.

Treatment of acute cough

Cough caused by URTI normally resolves spontaneously, without treatment. Parents may require education and reassurance that cough will subside given time.

There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines in acute cough (including antitussives, expectorants, mucolytics, and antihistamines) and, consequently, these are not recommended by pediatric treatment guidelines. The safety of OTC medicines in children has been questioned; however, the overall adverse event rate appears to be low. Though generally not mentioned in pediatric cough guidelines, certain phytomedicines have shown efficacy on acute cough severity in pediatric patients, with few adverse events. There is some evidence that honey is more effective than placebo in relieving acute cough in children. However, honey is not recommended in very young children (< 1 year) due to a risk of botulism. Antibiotics are not effective or recommended for treating URTIs. Bronchodilators are not effective for acute cough in children without asthma (asthma treatment is described below).

Chronic pediatric cough

A 7-year-old boy with a known medical history of eosinophilic esophagitis, allergic rhinitis with sensitization to tree, ragweed, and grass, and lentil food allergy presented to the clinic for follow-up. He had not been seen in the clinic for a while, and his mother mentioned that he had experienced a reaction to green peas at 18 months of age. The patient experienced facial angioedema and hives immediately after ingestion. His mother was unsure whether it was a "real" allergy, as she was not familiar with green peas being a food that can cause anaphylaxis. She had removed green peas from his diet out of caution but was not particular about reading labels. The boy's pea-specific serum IgE level was 73.4 kU/L.

Patient 4

A 15-year-old boy who was previously healthy and had no atopic comorbidities other than a known history of cashew food allergy presented to the clinic for evaluation of new reactions occurring immediately after ingestion of different pea-containing food products. He tolerates peanuts without reactions. His first reaction was to Ripple milk (Ripple Foods, Emeryville, Calif), which is a pea-based milk that does not contain any peanuts or tree nuts, as specified on the label. The second reaction was to Beyond Meat chicken nuggets, which had the same ingredients listed as for the burger consumed by patient 1. The packaging also listed an advisory for pea food allergy, as it did on the burger ingested by patient 1. His last reaction was to a pea-based protein powder. The patient was unsure of the name of the product but was certain that it did not contain tree nuts, given his allergy. His reaction to all 3 ingestions was immediate hives located over his face and neck. He self-treated with Diphenhydramine HCL, with resolution of his symptoms. His pea-specific serum IgE level was 6.10 kU/L.

Patient 5

A 2-year-old boy with a known allergy to peanut and no other atopic diseases presented for evaluation of a new allergic reaction associated with ingestion of a Chloe's Oat Milk Mint Chip Ice Cream bar (Chloe's Fruit, New York, NY). Immediately after ingestion of the ice cream bar, he experienced perioral hives that were followed by throat clearing and lip swelling. The possible allergens listed on the ingredient list were pea protein, tapioca, flaxseed, sunflower lecithin, and chocolate chips. The product did not have an allergen declaration statement other than a warning that it contained nonallergenic highly refined coconut oil. He was eating and tolerating all ingredients except tapioca and pea, both of which he had never consumed before. He tested negative for tapioca serum IgE. His pea-specific serum IgE level was 31kU/L.

5.3 Anaphylaxis and Angioedema

KEPPRA can cause anaphylaxis or angioedema after the first dose or at any time during treatment. Signs and symptoms in cases reported in the postmarketing setting have included hypotension, hives, rash, respiratory distress, and swelling of the face, lip, mouth, eye, tongue, throat, and feet. In some reported cases, reactions were life-threatening and required emergency treatment. If a patient develops signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis or angioedema, KEPPRA should be discontinued and the patient should seek immediate medical attention. KEPPRA should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established [see Contraindications (4)].

5.4 Serious Dermatological Reactions

Serious dermatological reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), have been reported in both pediatric and adult patients treated with KEPPRA. The median time of onset is reported to be 14 to 17 days, but cases have been reported at least four months after initiation of treatment. Recurrence of the serious skin reactions following rechallenge with KEPPRA has also been reported. KEPPRA should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered.

5.5 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity

Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including KEPPRA. These events can be fatal or life-threatening, particularly if diagnosis and treatment do not occur as early as possible. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. KEPPRA should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established [see Contraindications (4)].

SVT in pediatrics — panel certainty, applicability, and research needs: The guideline panel determined that there is very low certainty in the evidence for a net health benefit from using anticoagulation in pediatric patients with SVT, and although RCTs in adults may suggest benefit, there are no randomized trials in pediatric patients with SVT. Based on these considerations, the previous ASH 2018 guidelines could not recommend anticoagulation or no anticoagulation for managing such cases; more recent adult studies pointed toward an evolution favoring anticoagulation, and the panel identified a small desirable effect of anticoagulation. Applicability is limited because most pediatric SVTs are PIV or CVAD related and located in the upper extremity, with natural history differing from typical adult SVT. The panel highlighted research needs including studies on natural history and DVT/PE complications by patient and SVT characteristics and venous bed health, studies assessing ideal diagnostic methods and imaging protocols in SVT subgroups, and studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of anticoagulation of different intensities of pediatric SVT.

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^3dccb5c6]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Is it necessary to perform extensive diagnostic studies by complementary testing in all patients with CSU?

The indiscriminate search for underlying causes that may include an extensive battery of tests is discouraged – due to low cost-effectiveness. A careful and detailed medical history and physical examination are essential. Patient-oriented questions are helpful to establish the type of chronic urticaria and to define baseline laboratory studies and/or other complementary tests tailored to the individual patient (Table 2). In most cases, there is no need to order an extensive work-up unless data from the clinical history suggest an underlying disease. Table 3 lists the essential tests that should be performed.

Table 2
Recommended data to obtain from the patient's medical history

Table 3
Minimal work-up studies on chronic spontaneous urticaria *

Key point: Unless suggested by the clinical history, there is no need to perform extensive tests when examining a CSU patient.

What is the differential diagnosis to be established for a patient with CSU?

Apart from urticaria vasculitis for which diagnosis is made through biopsy, It can be difficult to differentiate hives from other dermatoses (Table 4). However, the natural course differs in these pathologies. Erythema multiform clears on its own within a maximum of 3 weeks; it is included in the differential diagnosis because of its severity and should always be ruled out at the onset of symptoms, when it can resemble chronic urticaria. Autoinflammatory syndromes have symptoms that may be confused with chronic urticaria, but they are rare, and although skin rashes are always associated with systemic symptoms, itching is not as striking a feature as it is in the case of chronic urticaria. Certain systemic diseases are associated with urticaria-like lesions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Schnitzler syndrome (IgM monoclonal gammopathy, urticaria, fever, lymphadenopathy and weight loss), mastocytosis and hypereosinophilic syndromes.

Table 4
Differential diagnosis of chronic urticaria

Key point: Chronic urticaria differs from other dermatosis on its duration, the evanescence of lesions and intense itching.

Two additional forms of recurrent angioedema without hives need to be considered. These are idiopathic non-mast cell-mediated angioedema (INMA; also called angioedema unknown type [AE-UNK] in the DANCE classification and previously referred to as idiopathic non-histaminergic angioedema) and acquired C1INH deficiency. INMA closely resembles HAE-nC1INH but is distinguished by both the lack of a family history and the lack of a known pathogenic variant. Given the variable penetrance of HAE-nC1INH, patients currently classified with INMA may ultimately be shown to have HAE-nC1INH based on discovery of new pathogenic variants or identification of affected family members. Acquired C1INH deficiency often closely resembles HAE-C1INH, except that patients develop angioedema later in life (usually after the age of 40), lack a positive family history of angioedema, often show low plasma levels of C1q, and frequently have (or will develop) an underlying disease (especially lymphoproliferative malignancies, monoclonal gammopathies, or autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus) or C1INH autoantibodies.

Clinical Features that May Differentiate HAE-nC1INH from other Forms of Angioedema

Table 2 summarizes the clinical features distinguishing mast cell–mediated angioedema, HAE-C1INH, HAE-nC1INH, and INMA. The diagnostic algorithm (see Fig. 1 and below) utilizes these features in evaluating patients with recurrent angioedema without hives.

### American Society of Hematology / International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2024 updated guidelines for treatment of venous thromboembolism in pediatric patients [^dfac3f8a]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Aims of these guidelines and specific objectives

The purpose of these guidelines is to provide evidence-based recommendations on the treatment of VTE in pediatric patients. The primary goals of these guidelines are to review, critically appraise, and implement evidence-based recommendations that will assist clinicians in deciding which pediatric patients with VTE require antithrombotic treatment and which agent/agents to use. Furthermore, the implementation guidance section aims to assist clinicians in optimizing the use of anticoagulants in pediatric patients. Through improved provider and patient education of the available evidence and evidence-based recommendations, these guidelines aim to provide clinical decision support for shared decision-making that will result in best care of pediatric patients with VTE.

The target audience includes patients, hematologists, general practitioners, pediatricians, other clinicians, and decision-makers. Policymakers interested in these guidelines include those involved in developing local, national, or international plans with the goal to improve the care of pediatric patients. This article may also serve as the basis for adaptation by local, regional, or national guideline panels.

Description of the health problem

Pediatric VTE is considered a major clinical problem because of the potential for associated mortality and significant complications including PE, cerebrovascular events, as well as PTS. VTE occurs when ≥ 1 components of the Virchow triad are activated: stasis of blood flow, injury to the endothelial lining, or hypercoagulability of blood components. Virchow triad remains the most useful pathophysiological construct for thinking about thromboembolism in children.

Since the publication of the 2018 ASH pediatric VTE treatment guidelines, there has been a dramatic increase in available information, knowledge, and expertise in relation to the appropriate diagnosis, prevention, and clinical management of VTE in pediatric patients. However, there remain many unknowns and large data registries, and ongoing studies will hopefully continue to improve our knowledge.

### Assessment of ED triage of anaphylaxis patients based on the emergency severity index [^42280d99]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To describe the emergency department (ED) triage of anaphylaxis patients based on the Emergency Severity Index (ESI), assess the association between ESI triage level and ED epinephrine administration, and determine characteristics associated with lower acuity triage ESI assignment (levels 3 and 4).

Methods

We conducted a cohort study of adult and pediatric anaphylaxis patients between September 2010 and September 2018 at an academic ED. Patient characteristics and management were compared between Emergency Severity Index (ESI) triage level 1 or 2 versus levels 3 or 4 using logistic regression analysis. We adhered to STROBE reporting guidelines.

Results

A total of 1090 patient visits were included. There were 26 (2%), 515 (47%), 489 (45%), and 60 (6%) visits that were assigned an ESI triage level of 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Epinephrine was administered in the ED to 53% of patients triaged ESI level 1 or 2 and to 40% of patients triaged ESI level 3 or 4. Patients who were assigned a lower acuity ESI level of 3 or 4 had a longer median time from ED arrival to epinephrine administration compared to those with a higher acuity ESI level of 1 or 2 (28 min compared to 13 min, p < .001). A lower acuity ESI level was more likely to be assigned to visits with a chief concern of hives, rash, or pruritus (OR 2.33 [95% CI, 1.20–4.53]) and less likely to be assigned to visits among adults (OR, 0.43 [0.31–0.60]), patients who received epinephrine from emergency medical services (OR 0.56 [0.38–0.82]), presented with posterior pharyngeal or uvular angioedema (OR, 0.56 [0.38–0.82]), hypoxemia (OR, 0.34 [0.18–0.64]), or increased heart (OR 0.83 [0.73–0.95]) or respiratory (OR 0.70 [0.60–0.82]) rates.

Conclusion

Patients triaged to lower acuity ESI levels experienced delays in ED epinephrine administration. Adult and pediatric patients with skin-related chief concerns were more likely to be to be assigned lower acuity ESI levels. Further studies are needed to identify interventions that will improve ED anaphylaxis triage.

### Liver transplantation as a novel strategy for resolution of congenital afibrinogenemia in a pediatric patient [^f20ce39b]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Following hospital discharge, the patient presented with two episodes of spontaneous hemarthroses affecting his right ankle and knee, requiring further cryoprecipitate infusions. Because of this bleeding phenotype, a prophylactic regimen was initiated with cryoprecipitate administered once every 2 weeks. At 2 years of age, the patient started developing severe urticarial skin reactions related to cryoprecipitate infusion for which he was transitioned to prophylactic treatment with HFC (RiaSTAP ®, CSL Behring LLC) at a dose of 70 mg/kg every 4 weeks. The regimen was eventually adjusted to 50 mg/kg every 2 weeks because of recurrent spontaneous hemarthroses.

Despite prophylactic treatment with HFC, the patient experienced an average annualized bleeding rate (ABR) of five to six bleeds over a period of 3 years. He also started to experience severe anaphylactic reactions similar to those experienced while on cryoprecipitate, characterized by the sudden onset of generalized hives and angioedema a few hours after the end of HFC infusions. Episodes persisted despite the use of premedication regimens with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine and postinfusion corticosteroids and antihistamines. At 7 years old, to avoid infusion‐related reactions, the patient switched to a new HFC (Fibryga) at a dose of 50 mg/kg every 2 weeks. On this regimen, better bleeding control was achieved, with an ABR of 0 to 1. The patient continued to receive premedication with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine, with no further reported infusion‐related adverse reactions.

### IV immunoglobulin is associated with epigenetic, ribosomal, and immune changes in pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome [^0a604037]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Participant Selection

Children (< 18 years of age) met criteria for PANS with abrupt, dramatic onset (within 48 hours) of OCD or severe food restriction. Patients had ongoing debilitating symptoms and were starting or continuing open-label IVIg.

Control Selection

Controls (n = 4) included children without neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric disorders, autoimmune diseases, or severe allergic conditions (median age 13.5 (IQR 12–15) years, 50% male).

Sample Collection

In children with PANS, blood samples were collected during cannulation and at the end of IVIg infusion (8–24-hour time interval). Patients and controls had no infections a month before blood collection.

HIVE scRNA-Seq

scRNA-seq was performed, using the HIVE platform, described in eMethods, and data were analyzed in the R environment with tidyverse and Seurat packages. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to obtain Gene Ontology (GO) pathways (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05) using the clusterProfiler package.

### Topical lidocaine and the effect on enoxaparin absorption in children: a pilot study [^a5eb629c]. Thrombosis Research (2010). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Enoxaparin, a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), is frequently used for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic complications in infants and children (Sutor et al., 2004 [1]). Injection pain and the fear and anxiety associated with needle phobia in the pediatric population are well documented. Best practice pediatric pain management standards of care recommend mitigating the child's pain experience whenever possible. The use of topical anesthetics such as liposomal-lidocaine 4% results in a rapid onset of anesthesia, minimal blanching, without vasoconstriction (Koh et al., 2004 [2]) or risk of methemoglobinemia. Topical lidocaine has been used to reduce the injection pain of enoxaparin, but there is no data available examining whether it will interfere with the absorption of LMWH.

Objective

To determine if the topical lidocaine, Maxilene, interferes with enoxaparin absorption as measured by peak anti-Xa levels.

Methods

Infants and children clinically prescribed enoxaparin were eligible for this study. Children in group 1 were pre-treated with Maxilene prior to enoxaparin injection on day 1 with no Maxilene pre-treatment on day 2. For group 2, the order was reversed. Peak anti-Xa levels were measured following each enoxaparin dose and were compared between the groups.

Results

26 children of ages 14d-16 y (median 6.7 months) were enrolled. Anti-Xa levels following topical lidocaine administration were 0.070 U/mL (95%CI 0.025; 0.114) lower than without prior topical lidocaine administration. Anti-Xa levels on the second day were on average 0.013 U/mL (95%CI -0.066; 0.040) higher compared to day one regardless of the order of topical lidocaine administration. There were no reported incidences of local reactions such as redness, hives or blanching.

Conclusions

Topical lidocaine (Maxilene) administration before enoxaparin injection results in a small, clinically non-significant, reduction in anti-Xa levels.

### A comprehensive management approach in pediatric and adolescent patients with hereditary angioedema [^0ad394db]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment Options for Pediatric Patients

The principles guiding pharmacologic management of HAE include the following:1

Availability of effective on-demand acute therapy for all patients;
Early treatment to prevent attack progression;
Treatment of attacks irrespective of the site of swelling;
Incorporation of long-term prophylaxis (LTP) based on shared decision-making.

Children with HAE should have access to ≥ 2 standard doses of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medicines to treat unpredictable angioedema episodes. While on-demand treatment alone can be sufficient for some patients, first-line prophylactic therapy together with on-demand treatment of breakthrough attacks may be indicated for others.

Currently, 7 products are approved by the FDA for use in pediatric populations: 3 are indicated for acute HAE attacks (on-demand treatment), and 4 are indicated for prophylaxis. Therapies approved in the United States for treatment of HAE in pediatric patients are listed in Table 2.

Table 2.
On-Demand and Prophylaxis Medications Approved in the United States and Recommended by Guidelines for Treatment of HAE in Pediatric Patients.

On-Demand Treatment

The goal of on-demand acute therapy for HAE is to minimize morbidity and prevent mortality from an ongoing swelling episode. While on-demand treatments prevent swelling from progressing, it may take between 30 minutes and 2 hours for swelling to resolve after the medication is administered. It is imperative to convey to parents that early treatment leads to better symptom control. A second dose generally is not needed unless the swelling continues to worsen.

Based on improved understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanism of swelling in HAE-C1-INH,3 products have been approved for on-demand treatment in pediatric populations (Table 2). Each product has been shown in randomized, controlled studies to be effective and safe,- and these findings have been confirmed in subsequent open-label extension studies and patient registries.-

Introduction: Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a severe systemic inflammatory disorder with features of autoinflammation. Disease onset is marked by profound neutrophilia, which is a marker for clinical response to IL-1 blockade. However, transcriptional activation of neutrophils persists even in clinically inactive disease.

Objectives: The objectives of this study were to define the transcriptional diversity of neutrophil subpopulations, including normal (NDG) and low-density granulocytes (LDG), in SJIA.

Methods: This protocol was approved by the CCHMC IRB and all patients/guardians provided informed consent. Neutrophils were analyzed for flow cytometry from whole blood. Alternatively, paired NDG and LDG populations were isolated using a two-step method. Total neutrophils were isolated by negative selection using the MACSxpress® Whole Blood human Neutrophil Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec). This population was then separated using density-gradient centrifugation to obtain purified NDG and LDG. Flow cytometric analysis was performed using the Aurora platform. Cell capture for scRNA-sequencing was performed using HIVES (Honeycomb). Libraries were sequenced using Novaseq. Initial alignment and quality control were performed using the beenet analyze pipeline. Cells with fewer than 200 genes or 400 transcripts were excluded. Downstream processing, integration, and label transfer were conducted using Seurat.

### Safety of power injector use in children as measured by incidence of extravasation [^95964177]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess the safety of power injector use in peripheral IV injections for CT examinations of children by measuring the incidence of contrast extravasation and to review the management of extravasation as reported in the literature.

Subjects and Methods

At a tertiary pediatric center, we prospectively collected data on 557 children undergoing CT with IV contrast injection by power injector through a peripheral venous line. Data collected included age, weight, angiocatheter size, location of venous access, flow rate, total contrast volume, maximum injector pressure, and incidence of extravasation. Adverse effects such as emesis, sensation of warmth, hives, and allergies and anaphylaxis also were recorded.

Results

The patients' ages ranged from 13 days to 20 years (mean, 9.8 years). The size of angiocatheter most commonly used was 22 gauge (n = 443). The dorsum of the hand was the most common site of venous access (n = 373). The mean flow rate was 1.48 mL/s. When the patients were divided into groups on the basis of reaction or no reaction, statistical differences between the groups were found with respect to flow rate (p = 0.016) and pressure (p = 0.017) needed for injection. There were two episode of extravasation (0.3%), which were treated conservatively.

Conclusion

The use of power injectors through 18- to 24-gauge angiocatheters in children is safe when meticulous technique is used and personnel are appropriately trained. Our study showed a similar rate of extravasation as has been reported in other studies.

### Hypersensitivity to total parenteral nutrition fat-emulsion component in an egg-allergic child [^daa28265]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergies affect 6% to 8% of children in the United States with symptoms ranging from localized hives to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Intravenous fat emulsions (IFEs) are a vital component of total parental nutrition, because they provide essential fatty acids. IFE is a sterile fat emulsion that contains egg-yolk phospholipids. Although egg allergy is listed as a contraindication, adverse reactions are uncommon. We report here the case of a hypersensitivity to IFE in a 2-year-old patient with previously undocumented egg allergy. Our patient was placed on total parental nutrition and a 20% IFE postoperatively and developed diffuse pruritus 14 days after initiation of therapy. She showed transient improvement with intravenous antihistamine, but her symptoms did not resolve until the IFE was stopped. On the basis of clinical history, including aversion to egg, we performed skin-prick testing, the results of which were positive for egg white allergy. Serum testing confirmed allergy to both egg yolk and egg white. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a pediatric patient with a history suggestive of egg allergy, positive skin-prick and serum testing to egg, and reaction to IFE infusion. Although ingestion of egg lecithin in cooked food is generally tolerated by egg-allergic people, administration of intravenous egg-containing lipid emulsions may cause significant adverse reactions.

### Applying the HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder diagnostic criteria to HIV-infected youth [^143c07c8]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to apply the HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) criteria for diagnosing HAND in HIV-infected adults, in a cohort of HIV-infected youth to thus establish whether this system is able to detect a spectrum of neurocognitive disorders (ND) in HIV-infected youth.

Methods

We used a comprehensive pediatric neurocognitive battery, an assessment of functional competence, and the American Academy of Neurology system for diagnosing ND in a cross-sectional study of HIV-infected youth (n = 86) and HIV-negative controls (n = 34) to establish whether this system could detect a spectrum of ND in HIV-infected youth (6–16 years).

Results

Compared to a well-matched control group of HIV-negative youth, HIV-infected youth performed significantly more poorly on tests of Verbal IQ, Full Scale IQ, processing speed, finger tapping, verbal memory, expressive language, cognitive flexibility, and inhibition. HIV-infected youth were also more likely to have impaired total competence on the Child Behavior Checklist. Using the criteria for HAND, we found that 45.35% of the 86 HIV-infected youth could be diagnosed with an ND. Furthermore, youth with HIV encephalopathy (HIVE) were 9.4 times more likely to have a diagnosis of a major ND compared to HIV-infected youth without HIVE.

Conclusions

The HAND criterion designed for adults was able to identify youth with important functional cognitive impairments who do not fit criteria for HIVE and would therefore not have been identified otherwise. This has major clinical implications regarding the importance of managing HIV-infected youth.

Regarding specific circumstances for autoimmune hepatitis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, treatment, ESPGHAN 2018 guidelines recommend to recognize that complete biochemical and immunological response and repeated liver biopsy showing absence of inflammation increase the chances for potential withdrawal of immunosuppression. Withdraw prednisolone/prednisone gradually, followed by azathioprine. Recognize that the chances for successful withdrawal are 20–40%.

### Pediatric drug eruptions [^c6169155]. Clinics in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Drug eruptions in children are common but in general less studied than their adult counterparts. Aside from having significant impact on the child's health and quality of life, these reactions can limit what medications the patient can receive in the future. Familiarity with pediatric drug eruptions is important for accurate diagnosis and to prevent future recurrence or ineffective therapy. Our current understanding of how drug reactions differ mechanistically between children and adults is poor. There are multiple factors that could be contributing to the differing incidence, presentation, and treatment modalities offered to pediatric versus adult patients. For many of these cutaneous drug reactions, the treatment regime is not standardized, being based primarily on case reports. Although not comprehensive, this review highlights common pediatric drug eruption patterns and discuss diagnostic mimickers. Five cutaneous adverse drug reactions in the pediatric population are presented: morbilliform (exanthematous) eruptions, urticarial eruptions, serum sickness-like reactions, fixed drug eruptions, and DRESS syndrome. Clinical features, diagnostic workup, and management are discussed with an emphasis on the pediatric population.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^c43ccea8]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study, comprising a literature review together with expert opinion obtained via an online survey, has highlighted a number of issues relating to the global management of pediatric cough. In particular, while there are numerous regional guidelines for the management of pediatric cough (16 were listed in the survey), there is no established international guideline for acute or chronic pediatric cough.

There is also a lack of consensus as to what defines a pediatric patient in relation to cough. In guidelines, 'pediatric' refers to patients aged up to 12–18 years, and among the international experts, 'pediatric' could refer to patients aged up to 10–21 years. The age of patients is an important consideration in their management as it determines whether pediatric or adult guidelines are used, impacting pediatric-specific issues and risk–benefit ratios. For example, whereas respiratory function tests are standard investigations in adults, data generated from such tests may be unreliable in young children. The optimal management of cough may also vary between babies, toddlers, and older children due to differing cough etiologies with age; a point that is not fully addressed by current guidelines. Furthermore, while all guidelines separated pediatric cough into acute and chronic, there were discrepancies in the duration of cough used to define these terms. Acute cough definitions ranged from < 2–3 weeks in guidelines and from < 3–5 days to < 6 weeks among experts; the equivalent definitions for chronic cough were > 4–8 weeks and > 2–8 weeks. Since acute and chronic cough are managed differently, these varying definitions mean that pediatric patients in different regions will receive differing standards of care for cough.

### Towards personalised therapy in chronic spontaneous urticaria: advancing from endotype to clinical response [^af5ec208]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a skin disorder characterised by recurrent hives and swellings that has a profound effect upon quality of life. Current guidelines for the management of CSU outline sequential use of standard dosing nonsedating H1 antihistamines, fourfold dose antihistamines and the anti‐IgE monoclonal antibody omalizumab. A proportion of patients will have partial response or no response to omalizumab despite uptitration of dose. Evidence suggests that nonresponders may represent a specific endotype of Type IIb autoimmune CSU and respond better to ciclosporin, a fourth line off‐licence treatment. Accurate and timely classification of CSU by endotype may enable personalised medicine for patients. Current attempts to classify CSU are based on distinct autoallergic and autoimmune pathways towards mast cell activation; Type I autoallergic urticaria as evidenced by IgE autoantibodies initiating FcεR1 crosslinking and Type IIb autoimmune urticaria as evidenced by IgG autoantibodies initiating FcεR1 crosslinking. However, recent data have demonstrated that the distinction between CSU endotypes is more nuanced, with overlap between categories whereby patients with Type IIb autoimmune CSU have been found to have coexistent IgE autoantibodies. A cohort of patients do not meet criteria for either endotype. Furthermore, there is recognition that laboratory parameters currently used to stratify patients are not widely available, hampering their practical use. This review seeks to summarise data on biomarkers associated with treatment response in CSU. While previous literature has focussed upon treatment response to antihistamines, our emphasis is on predicting treatment response to third and fourth‐line treatments, with further reference to emerging treatments that do not yet form part of guidelines for management of CSU. Understanding factors that influence clinical response to all agents is particularly important as treatment options for CSU rapidly expand. In the following sections, we will evaluate the biochemical and clinical parameters that have been explored in these patients as well as their potential utility in routine clinical practice.

### Comment on "An increase in dietary supplement exposures reported to US poison control centers" [^6f216aaf]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2018). Low credibility.

In the report by Rao et al. the authors' conclusions raise questions about the safety of dietary supplements (DS); however, there are important study limitations and context that must be considered before drawing conclusions regarding DS safety.

The current report purports to review exposures involving the FDA-regulated category of DS products. Yet, several product categories included in the analysis involved products clearly outside the scope of DS, including homeopathic products (representing 36% of the dataset), which are regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as drugs, and beverage versions of energy drinks, which are regulated as foods. Cultural medicines typically include substances that are outside of any regulated category of product. Ma huang products, which accounted for numerous reported exposures, have not been on the market for over a decade and are not relevant to today's 170 million consumers who take DS as part of their wellness efforts.

For those calls that involve exposure to properly categorized DS, it must be emphasized that reports of exposure are not synonymous with adverse events. Parents calling for reassurance subsequent to childhood ingestion of non-toxic amounts of these and other household products are routinely represented in the most recent American Association of Poison Control Centers' (AAPCC) annual report in which 89% of all pediatric (< 6 years) exposures in the database involve no reports of adverse effects following exposure. For the current report, asymptomatic exposures involve as many as 96% of all pediatric exposures and 99.6% when including minor outcomes.

There are also concerns with the manner in which medical outcomes were further categorized as "serious", which leads readers to equate those outcomes to life-threatening effects typically requiring life-saving therapeutic interventions, hospitalization, and potential residual disability. Yet, for this report, incidents coded with a moderate outcome were included in the "serious" outcome category. Moderate outcomes within the poison center dataset are, by definition, non-life threatening, leave no residual disability, and can include effects such as mild, self-limiting tachycardia, hives, or rash that require no therapeutic intervention. And, even for those serious events included in the PC data that involve allergy and/or anaphylaxis, confirmation that a DS was the cause with confirmatory allergy testing is rare. Removing the moderate outcome incidents from the report's serious outcome classification leaves only 0.2% as serious incidents as compared to 4.5% reported by the authors.

### Scratching the surface: a comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^ca1b403e]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute pruritus frequently arises from infectious causes, which should be strongly considered in the initial differential diagnosis. Common infectious causes that do not cause lesions and can be evaluated quickly are vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), bacterial vaginosis (BV), trichomoniasis (TV), chlamydia, and gonorrhea. Parasitic infestations such as public lice and pinworms should also be readily considered in patients with excoriations but no other visual lesions, particularly in children and sexually active individuals, especially those with risk factors such as contact with infected individuals or children with frequent exposure to other children. If there is suspicion for STI, HIV status should be evaluated, as affected individuals are prone to more severe or recurrent infection. If lesions are present, their appearance and associated symptoms should guide the differential diagnosis. Herpetic lesions, condylomas, molluscum contagiosum, scabies, and syphilis primary lesions all have distinctive appearances and can be confirmed with laboratory testing or biopsies.

Inflammatory dermatological conditions such as psoriasis, AD, lichen planus (LP), and contact dermatitis, frequently cause vaginal pruritus and should be on the differential for acute and chronic vulvovaginal itching due to their intermittent and relapsing and remitting nature. Psoriasis is a chronic cause of itch accompanying well-demarcated, erythematous red plaques limited to the labia majora often misdiagnosed as candida. In AD, the presence of poorly defined erythematous plaques, excoriations, and a history of itching and scratching are key diagnostic clues. LP results in erosive lesions and scarring of the vulva, and there is often extragenital involvement. Irritant contact dermatitis causes rapid onset burning sensations with localized vesicular plaques or scaly patches. For allergic contact dermatitis, intermittent symptoms and a lack of response to standard treatments may raise suspicion for an underlying allergen, warranting further evaluation such as a patch test.

Regarding specific circumstances for autoimmune hepatitis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, treatment, ESPGHAN 2018 guidelines recommend to initiate prednisolone/prednisone (2 mg/kg/day, up to 60 mg/day) as first-line therapy in pediatric patients with AIH, weaned down over 6–8 weeks to a maintenance dose of 5–7.5 mg/day, with monitoring of biochemical response (AST/ALT). Avoid using budenoside over the standard treatment as first-line therapy.

### Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza) [^56b9881b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity

Cases of anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema, and erythema multiforme have been reported in postmarketing experience with XOFLUZA. Appropriate treatment should be instituted if an allergic-like reaction occurs or is suspected. The use of XOFLUZA is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to XOFLUZA [see Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.2 Increased Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Resistance in Patients Less Than 5 Years of Age

XOFLUZA is not indicated in patients less than 5 years of age due to increased incidence of treatment-emergent resistance in this age group. In clinical trials, the incidence of virus with treatment-emergent substitutions associated with reduced susceptibility to baloxavir (resistance) was higher in pediatric subjects younger than 5 years of age (40%, 38/96) than in pediatric subjects ≥ 5 years to < 12 years of age (16%, 19/117) or subjects ≥ 12 years of age (7%, 60/842). The potential for transmission of resistant strains in the community has not been determined [see Indications and Usage (1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4), and Microbiology (12.4)].

5.3 Risk of Bacterial Infections

There is no evidence of efficacy of XOFLUZA in any illness caused by pathogens other than influenza viruses. Serious bacterial infections may begin with influenza-like symptoms or may coexist with, or occur as, a complication of influenza. XOFLUZA has not been shown to prevent such complications. Prescribers should be alert to potential secondary bacterial infections and treat them as appropriate.
