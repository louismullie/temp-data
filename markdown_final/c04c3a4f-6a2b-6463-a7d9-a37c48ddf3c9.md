## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about ECG findings across different clinical contexts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core principles of ECG interpretation and the universal approach to rhythm, intervals, axis, and morphology. Then, I should categorize ECG findings by major clinical scenarios: acute coronary syndromes, athletes, heart failure/cardiomyopathies, syncope/palpitations, noncardiac conditions, and special populations. Next, I will appraise the evidence hierarchy and highlight high-yield, guideline-backed patterns. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and explicitly state limitations and uncertainties that could change practice as new data emerge [^b88c412e] [^0128c090].

> Let me first confirm the foundational principles that apply regardless of context: interpret rate and rhythm, measure PR, QRS, and QT intervals, determine axis, and scrutinize P waves, QRS complexes, ST segments, T waves, and U waves for morphology and evolution; always compare with prior tracings when available, because serial change is more informative than a single snapshot and a normal or unchanged ECG does not exclude acute coronary syndrome, so I need to ensure I do not anchor on a single nondiagnostic study [^b88c412e] [^0128c090].

> Now, for acute coronary syndromes, I should verify the high-risk ECG signatures that mandate emergent reperfusion or invasive evaluation: ST-segment elevation in two contiguous leads, new LBBB with ischemic symptoms, posterior MI patterns with tall R waves and ST depression in V1–V2 prompting right-sided leads V7–V9, and diffuse ST depression with reciprocal ST elevation suggesting multivessel or left main disease; I also need to remember STEMI equivalents such as hyperacute T waves, de Winter T waves, and Wellens pattern, and I should double-check that serial ECGs are obtained when suspicion remains high despite a nondiagnostic initial tracing [^0128c090] [^9d90535d] [^0e3ad8d0] [^feda0a1a].

> Wait, let me verify the prognostic weight of admission ECG in NSTEMI: ST-segment depression at presentation consistently portends worse short- and long-term outcomes, whereas T-wave inversion has more variable prognostic implications; this reinforces why even subtle ST depression should heighten urgency and influence the threshold for early invasive management in NSTE-ACS [^9eeedd4e].

> Next, I will examine athletes, where physiologic remodeling complicates interpretation; I need to ensure I distinguish training-related changes from pathologic patterns using the International Consensus Criteria, which classify findings as normal, borderline, or abnormal, and mandate further evaluation for abnormal patterns such as T-wave inversion beyond V1–V2, pathologic Q waves, significant conduction disease, or pre-excitation; hold on, I should verify that T-wave inversion in the lateral leads is particularly concerning for cardiomyopathy and warrants echocardiography and sometimes CMR or genetic testing [^f94eb75e] [^4ef981f3] [^4770c890].

> I will now examine heart failure and cardiomyopathies; in suspected or established HF, a 12-lead ECG is recommended at baseline and for surveillance because it informs etiology and risk, with LVH patterns, bundle branch block, and atrial abnormalities offering clues; in dilated cardiomyopathy, ECG may reveal bundle branch block, pathologic Q waves, or arrhythmias, and in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, ECG is abnormal in over 90% and may show LVH, deep T-wave inversion, or pre-excitation; let me reconsider arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy: T-wave inversion in V1–V3, epsilon waves, and prolonged S-wave upstroke are classic and often precede structural changes, so I should confirm that these findings trigger imaging and family screening [^3400f6f7] [^003cc55a] [^e8f2c6b7] [^588a0187] [^146ea3e9] [^9be46809].

> For syncope and palpitations, I should confirm that a 12-lead ECG is indicated in essentially all patients, because an abnormal ECG meaningfully increases the risk of arrhythmic etiologies and adverse outcomes; if the ECG is normal but suspicion remains, ambulatory monitoring, exercise testing, or tilt testing may be needed, whereas a normal ECG with normal cardiac structure makes electrophysiology low yield and generally unnecessary [^8aa4eb5e] [^11206c8f] [^bc58107d] [^003c1f9c].

> But wait, what if the ECG abnormalities reflect noncardiac conditions; I need to check for electrolyte effects such as peaked T waves and sine-wave patterns with hyperkalemia, prolonged QT with hypokalemia or hypocalcemia, and diffuse ST elevation with pericarditis; in COVID-19, sinus tachycardia, AF, QT prolongation, and ischemic ST-T changes are common and correlate with severity, so I should confirm that these findings prompt closer monitoring and consideration of myocarditis or thrombotic complications [^a62c3d85] [^1c40b03b] [^8aa695a3] [^0e0e44cd].

> Let me consider special populations; in pediatrics, age-specific normals are essential because right ventricular dominance in infants and axis shifts with growth can mimic disease, and up to 20% of pediatric ECGs in acute settings may be abnormal, so I should double-check interval and axis norms by age before labeling a finding pathologic; in pregnancy, nonspecific ST-T changes are common but new arrhythmias or ischemic patterns warrant evaluation; in adults with congenital heart disease, surgical scars and residual hemodynamics create distinctive patterns that inform surveillance and risk stratification [^0a42a58a] [^117f1629] [^8d459d56] [^ac63df1c].

> Hold on, I should verify the evidence hierarchy so I do not overstate weaker data; high-credibility sources include contemporary ESC/ACC/AHA guidelines for ACS, HF, syncope, and chest pain, and the Universal MI definition, whereas many athlete ECG criteria are expert consensus and athlete-specific reviews are lower on the pyramid; I need to ensure that when I make strong claims, they are anchored to guidelines or high-quality studies, and when I cite lower-level evidence, I qualify it appropriately [^e83c6b07] [^0128c090] [^9fdd14d2] [^3400f6f7] [^8aa4eb5e] [^b88c412e] [^f94eb75e].

> Next, I should review a practical decision framework: if the ECG is diagnostic of STEMI or a high-risk NSTE-ACS pattern, proceed to reperfusion or invasive evaluation without delay; if the ECG is abnormal but nondiagnostic, correlate with symptoms, obtain serial ECGs, troponins, and consider imaging; if the ECG is normal, do not exclude ACS and continue diagnostic workup if suspicion persists; in athletes, apply consensus criteria and escalate to echocardiography or CMR for abnormal patterns; in syncope, use ECG abnormalities to guide risk stratification and testing; always compare with prior tracings and document evolution [^0128c090] [^b88c412e] [^f94eb75e] [^8aa4eb5e].

> I should double-check key uncertainties and limitations: minor ECG abnormalities in general populations associate with future cardiovascular events, but it remains unproven that routine ECG screening improves outcomes without targeted follow-up; in COVID-19, ECG abnormalities are frequent yet nonspecific, so clinical integration is essential; in athletes, false positives and false negatives occur, and expertise in interpretation materially affects downstream testing and eligibility decisions [^31c96cc6] [^8aa695a3] [^4ef981f3].

> In summary, I need to ensure my approach remains systematic and context-specific: master the basics of rhythm, intervals, axis, and morphology; prioritize life-threatening ischemic patterns; apply population-specific criteria, especially in athletes; leverage serial ECGs and comparison tracings; and align management with guideline-directed pathways, recognizing that ECG is a powerful triage tool but never a standalone arbiter of diagnosis or disposition [^b88c412e] [^0128c090] [^f94eb75e].

ECG findings are interpreted by assessing **rate, rhythm, axis, intervals, and morphology** against clinical context and prior tracings [^b88c412e]. Key abnormalities include arrhythmias (AF, VT, AV block), ischemia (ST elevation/depression, T-wave inversion, Q waves) [^e83c6b07], conduction delays (PR, QRS, QT prolongation) [^ef29ed16], and chamber hypertrophy/enlargement (LVH, RVH, atrial abnormality) [^91ab8450]. In athletes, distinguish physiologic from pathologic changes using international criteria [^f94eb75e] [^4ef981f3]. Always correlate with symptoms, risk factors, and serial ECGs; **repeat ECGs if symptoms persist or evolve** [^9fdd14d2] [^b88c412e].

## Common ECG abnormalities and their clinical significance

### Arrhythmias and conduction disturbances

- **Atrial fibrillation (AF)**: irregularly irregular rhythm; associated with stroke risk and heart failure [^notfound].
- **Ventricular tachycardia (VT)**: wide-complex tachycardia; life-threatening and requires immediate intervention [^da49f287].
- **Atrioventricular (AV) block**: PR interval > 0.20 s (first-degree); dropped beats (second-degree); complete dissociation (third-degree); may require pacing [^003c1f9c].
- **Bundle branch block**: QRS ≥ 0.12 s; right (RBBB) or left (LBBB); indicates conduction system disease [^notfound].

---

### Ischemic heart disease

- **ST-segment elevation**: acute coronary occlusion (STEMI); requires urgent reperfusion [^0128c090].
- **ST-segment depression**: ischemia (NSTEMI); indicates high risk and need for urgent evaluation [^9eeedd4e].
- **T-wave inversion**: ischemia, electrolyte disturbances, or structural heart disease [^notfound].
- **Q waves**: prior myocardial infarction; pathologic if ≥ 0.04 s and ≥ 25% of R wave [^notfound].

---

### Chamber hypertrophy and enlargement

- **Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)**: increased QRS voltage; associated with hypertension and heart failure [^91ab8450].
- **Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH)**: right axis deviation, prominent R in V1; suggests pulmonary hypertension or congenital heart disease [^8dbd4fe2].
- **Atrial enlargement**: prolonged or notched P waves (left atrial); peaked P waves (right atrial) [^cb35b0ef].

---

### Electrolyte disturbances and metabolic conditions

- **Hyperkalemia**: peaked T waves, widened QRS, sine wave pattern [^notfound].
- **Hypokalemia**: flattened T waves, U waves, prolonged QT [^notfound].
- **Hypercalcemia**: shortened QT interval [^notfound].
- **Hypocalcemia**: prolonged QT interval [^notfound].

## ECG findings in special populations

### Athletes

Athletes often show **sinus bradycardia, first-degree AV block, and early repolarization** as benign adaptations [^2082496a]. Pathologic findings — such as T-wave inversion beyond V2, pathologic Q waves, or prolonged QT — require further evaluation [^f94eb75e].

---

### Pediatric patients

Pediatric ECGs reflect developmental changes, including **right ventricular dominance in infants** and gradual left ventricular predominance with age [^0a42a58a]. Congenital heart disease may present with axis deviation, chamber hypertrophy, or conduction abnormalities [^117f1629].

---

### Pregnant patients

Pregnancy can cause **nonspecific ST-T changes** and sinus tachycardia; ischemic or arrhythmic findings warrant evaluation [^8d459d56].

---

## Clinical approach to ECG interpretation

- **Systematic analysis**: assess rate, rhythm, axis, intervals, and morphology [^notfound].
- **Clinical correlation**: integrate symptoms, history, and risk factors [^b88c412e].
- **Serial ECGs**: repeat if symptoms persist or evolve [^9fdd14d2].
- **Comparison**: use prior ECGs to identify new changes [^b88c412e].

---

## Limitations and pitfalls

- **Technical artifacts**: lead misplacement, poor contact, and interference can mimic arrhythmias [^2cc3c9dd].
- **Patient factors**: obesity, lung disease, and electrolyte imbalances can obscure or alter findings [^06a0a1d0].
- **Non-specificity**: many ECG changes are non-specific and require clinical correlation [^b88c412e].

---

ECG interpretation requires a **structured approach** that integrates rhythm, intervals, morphology, and clinical context. Recognizing key abnormalities — arrhythmias, ischemia, conduction delays, and chamber hypertrophy — guides diagnosis and management, while serial ECGs and comparison with prior tracings improve accuracy [^b88c412e].

### Abnormal electrocardiogram findings in athletes [^ea748a53]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Athletes commonly exhibit a series of electrical, structural, and functional physiological changes which may overlap with cardiac pathology. The last two decades have witnessed a progressive improvement in understanding what can be considered benign for athletes and what may be deemed as potentially pathological and require further investigations. However, diagnostic uncertainties in the cardiac assessment of athletes are often encountered. In particular, the clinical significance of some electrocardiogram (ECG) findings may be uncertain. While uncommon and suggestive of an underlying cardiac condition, they may be identified among healthy athletes without additional pathological findings to support a unifying clinical diagnosis. This creates significant dilemmas for clinicians charged with determining sports eligibility and those who have the responsibility to help athletes in the decision-making process regarding future competitive sports participation. Current guidelines, recommendations, and position papers provide a roadmap for the differential diagnosis between 'athlete's heart' and cardiac disease. However, managing ECG findings of uncertain clinical significance, especially when initial diagnostic evaluation reveals no supportive signs of pathology, has received comparatively less attention, in particular, the type of cardiac investigations, the extent of diagnostic work-up and the need for follow-up require clarification. This document aims to provide guidance based on published evidence and expert opinions to assist in the clinical decision-making regarding ECG anomalies that are common sources of uncertainty when managing asymptomatic athletes.

### The clinical value of the ECG in noncardiac conditions [^06a0a1d0]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

The ECG is an indispensable tool in the ICU for the detection and diagnosis of heart disease. ECG abnormalities however can be present in a wide variety of noncardiac conditions, complicating the differential diagnosis with primary cardiac pathology. This overview discusses the ECG abnormalities and their pathophysiologic basis in the most frequently encountered noncardiac conditions, such as electrolyte abnormalities, pulmonary embolism, CNS diseases, esophageal disorders, hypothermia, and drug-related and other conditions. Knowledge of the characteristic ECG changes may provide early clues to the presence of these disorders, the prompt recognition of which can be life saving.

### Electrocardiographic manifestations of COVID-19 [^8aa695a3]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a lower respiratory tract infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This disease can impact the cardiovascular system and lead to abnormal electrocardiographic (ECG) findings. Emergency clinicians must be aware of the ECG manifestations of COVID-19.

Objective

This narrative review outlines the pathophysiology and electrocardiographic findings associated with COVID-19.

Discussion

COVID-19 is a potentially critical illness associated with a variety of ECG abnormalities, with up to 90% of critically ill patients demonstrating at least one abnormality. The ECG abnormalities in COVID-19 may be due to cytokine storm, hypoxic injury, electrolyte abnormalities, plaque rupture, coronary spasm, microthrombi, or direct endothelial or myocardial injury. While sinus tachycardia is the most common abnormality, others include supraventricular tachycardias such as atrial fibrillation or flutter, ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, various bradycardias, interval and axis changes, and ST segment and T wave changes. Several ECG presentations are associated with poor outcome, including atrial fibrillation, QT interval prolongation, ST segment and T wave changes, and ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation.

Conclusions

This review summarizes the relevant ECG findings associated with COVID-19. Knowledge of these findings in COVID-19-related electrocardiographic presentations may assist emergency clinicians in the evaluation and management of potentially infected and infected patients.

### Abnormal electrocardiographic findings in athletes: recognising changes suggestive of primary electrical disease [^36c3aae8]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Cardiac channelopathies are potentially lethal inherited arrhythmia syndromes and an important cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young athletes. Other cardiac rhythm and conduction disturbances also may indicate the presence of an underlying cardiac disorder. The 12-lead ECG is utilised as both a screening and a diagnostic tool for detecting conditions associated with SCD. Fundamental to the appropriate evaluation of athletes undergoing ECG is an understanding of the ECG findings that may indicate the presence of a pathological cardiac disease. This article describes ECG findings present in primary electrical diseases afflicting young athletes and outlines appropriate steps for further evaluation of these ECG abnormalities. The ECG findings defined as abnormal in athletes were established by an international consensus panel of experts in sports cardiology and sports medicine.

Circulation (2009). Medium credibility.

AHA/ACCF/HRS recommendations—electrocardiogram changes associated with cardiac chamber hypertrophy—outline the importance of detecting hypertrophy and the characteristic electrocardiogram (ECG) findings. The report states that detection and assessment of cardiac chamber hypertrophy has long been an important objective of clinical electrocardiography and notes that hypertrophy can be reversed with therapy, with adverse clinical outcomes prevented or delayed. Terminology is clarified by using hypertrophy rather than enlargement, explaining that enlargement may imply increased chamber dimension that may not be present in concentric hypertrophy, and noting that distinctive P-wave abnormalities may occur even without atrial hypertrophy or dilation. The principal ECG changes associated with ventricular hypertrophy include increases in QRS amplitude and duration, changes in instantaneous axes and mean QRS vectors, abnormalities in the ST segment and T waves, and abnormalities in the P wave, and these ECG changes have been correlated with direct or indirect assessments of ventricular size or mass to establish diagnostic criteria. Historically, measurement of ventricular mass at autopsy or clinical features served as the reference standards to establish ECG criteria.

Circulation (2009). Medium credibility.

ST‑T abnormalities with left ventricular hypertrophy—‘strain’ and ‘typical strain’ are discouraged in favor of ‘secondary ST‑T abnormalities’; the presence of ST‑T abnormalities provides major support to a diagnosis of LVH and is associated with larger left ventricular mass and higher risks of cardiovascular complications and mortality than QRS voltage alone, but evidence is insufficient to determine whether the ‘typical strain’ pattern has greater clinical implications or whether ST‑T abnormalities should modify or replace QRS voltage criteria.

### The Brugada syndrome revisited [^c21ea289]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The Brugada syndrome is a rare but well-defined cause of sudden cardiac death. The key underlying abnormality is a decrease in net depolarising current due to a genetic defect, though recent evidence also implicates structural abnormalities in some patients. Diagnosis requires a Brugada-type ECG as well as typical clinical features: such clinical considerations are currently key in guiding risk stratification and hence management. Whilst pharmacological therapies are under investigation, the only intervention with a robust evidence base remains insertion of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Further research will be required to allow more effective risk stratification and hence more rational therapy.

### Electrocardiography in athletes: normal and abnormal findings [^4ef981f3]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Many sporting organisations recommend a pre-participation ECG to screen for disorders which predispose to sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). The ability of the ECG to perform accurately is dependent on the ECG criteria used and the experience of the operator. There have been several ECG criteria over the last decade, though these were recently superseded with the publication of the 'International Consensus Criteria for ECG Interpretation in Athletes'. These criteria use the latest evidence to improve specificity while maintaining sensitivity for ECG-detectable pathologies associated with SCA. Accordingly, this review describes the normal, borderline and abnormal ECG findings in an asymptomatic athlete aged 12-35 years.

### International recommendations for electrocardiographic interpretation in athletes [^f94eb75e]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is the leading cause of mortality in athletes during sport. A variety of mostly hereditary, structural, or electrical cardiac disorders are associated with SCD in young athletes, the majority of which can be identified or suggested by abnormalities on a resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Whether used for diagnostic or screening purposes, physicians responsible for the cardiovascular care of athletes should be knowledgeable and competent in ECG interpretation in athletes. However, in most countries a shortage of physician expertise limits wider application of the ECG in the care of the athlete. A critical need exists for physician education in modern ECG interpretation that distinguishes normal physiological adaptations in athletes from distinctly abnormal findings suggestive of underlying pathology. Since the original 2010 European Society of Cardiology recommendations for ECG interpretation in athletes, ECG standards have evolved quickly over the last decade; pushed by a growing body of scientific data that both tests proposed criteria sets and establishes new evidence to guide refinements. On 26-27 February 2015, an international group of experts in sports cardiology, inherited cardiac disease, and sports medicine convened in Seattle, Washington, to update contemporary standards for ECG interpretation in athletes. The objective of the meeting was to define and revise ECG interpretation standards based on new and emerging research and to develop a clear guide to the proper evaluation of ECG abnormalities in athletes. This statement represents an international consensus for ECG interpretation in athletes and provides expert opinion-based recommendations linking specific ECG abnormalities and the secondary evaluation for conditions associated with SCD.

### Normal electrocardiographic findings: recognising physiological adaptations in athletes [^2082496a]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Electrocardiographic changes in athletes are common and usually reflect benign structural and electrical remodelling of the heart as a physiological adaptation to regular and sustained physical training (athlete's heart). The ability to identify an abnormality on the 12-lead ECG, suggestive of underlying cardiac disease associated with sudden cardiac death (SCD), is based on a sound working knowledge of the normal ECG characteristics within the athletic population. This document will assist physicians in identifying normal ECG patterns commonly found in athletes. The ECG findings presented as normal in athletes were established by an international consensus panel of experts in sports cardiology and sports medicine.

### Recommendations for interpretation of 12-lead electrocardiogram in the athlete [^9b3ae7fb]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular remodelling in the conditioned athlete is frequently associated with physiological ECG changes. Abnormalities, however, may be detected which represent expression of an underlying heart disease that puts the athlete at risk of arrhythmic cardiac arrest during sports. It is mandatory that ECG changes resulting from intensive physical training are distinguished from abnormalities which reflect a potential cardiac pathology. The present article represents the consensus statement of an international panel of cardiologists and sports medical physicians with expertise in the fields of electrocardiography, imaging, inherited cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular pathology, and management of young competitive athletes. The document provides cardiologists and sports medical physicians with a modern approach to correct interpretation of 12-lead ECG in the athlete and emerging understanding of incomplete penetrance of inherited cardiovascular disease. When the ECG of an athlete is examined, the main objective is to distinguish between physiological patterns that should cause no alarm and those that require action and/or additional testing to exclude (or confirm) the suspicion of an underlying cardiovascular condition carrying the risk of sudden death during sports. The aim of the present position paper is to provide a framework for this distinction. For every ECG abnormality, the document focuses on the ensuing clinical work-up required for differential diagnosis and clinical assessment. When appropriate the referral options for risk stratification and cardiovascular management of the athlete are briefly addressed.

### Electrocardiographic interpretation in athletes: the 'Seattle criteria' [^4e253422]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is the leading cause of death in athletes during sport. Whether obtained for screening or diagnostic purposes, an ECG increases the ability to detect underlying cardiovascular conditions that may increase the risk for SCD. In most countries, there is a shortage of physician expertise in the interpretation of an athlete's ECG. A critical need exists for physician education in modern ECG interpretation that distinguishes normal physiological adaptations in athletes from abnormal findings suggestive of pathology. On 13-14 February 2012, an international group of experts in sports cardiology and sports medicine convened in Seattle, Washington, to define contemporary standards for ECG interpretation in athletes. The objective of the meeting was to develop a comprehensive training resource to help physicians distinguish normal ECG alterations in athletes from abnormal ECG findings that require additional evaluation for conditions associated with SCD.

### The pediatric ECG [^0a42a58a]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Knowledge of the basics of pediatric ECG interpretation is helpful in differentiating normal from abnormal findings. These basics include familiarity with the age-related normal findings in heart rate, intervals, axis, and waveform morphologies; an understand-ing of cardiac physiologic changes associated with age and maturation, particularly the adaptation from right to left ventricular predominance; and a rudimentary understanding of common pediatric dysrhythmias and findings associated with congenital heart diseases.

### The evolution of electrocardiographic changes in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^581fb29d]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a not uncommon diagnosis in the emergency department. During ST-segment elevation AMI (STEMI), the electrocardiogram (ECG) typically follows a progression of abnormality, beginning with hyperacute T waves and culminating with ST-segment elevation; pathologic Q waves can appear early and/or late in the process. Other findings include T-wave inversion and ST-segment depression which can occur before, during, or after the STEMI event. The evolution of ECG through these changes can occur rapidly after coronary artery occlusion. The emergency physician should be aware of the ECG findings that characterize the evolution of an STEMI with a sound understanding of the associated pathophysiology and clinical implication. This review discusses the changing ECG during an AMI. The pathogenesis of these findings is discussed. Finally, the clinical implications at each stage are reviewed.

### The electrocardiogram in the diagnosis and management of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy [^e8f2c6b7]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

The term dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) defines a heterogeneous group of cardiac disorders, which are characterized by left ventricular or biventricular dilatation and systolic dysfunction in the absence of abnormal loading conditions or coronary artery disease sufficient to cause global systolic impairment. In approximately one third of cases, DCM is familial with a genetic pathogenesis and various patterns of inheritance. Although the electrocardiogram (ECG) has been considered traditionally non-specific in DCM, the recently acquired knowledge of the genotype-phenotype correlations provides novel opportunities to identify patterns and abnormalities that may point toward specific DCM subtypes. A learned ECG interpretation in combination with an appropriate use of other ECG-based techniques including ambulatory ECG monitoring, exercise tolerance test and imaging modalities, such as echocardiography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance, may allow the early identification of specific genetic or acquired forms of DCM. Furthermore, ECG abnormalities may reflect the severity of the disease and provide a useful tool in risk stratification and management. In the present review, we discuss the current role of the ECG in the diagnosis and management of DCM. We describe various clinical settings where the appropriate use and interpretation of the ECG can provide invaluable clues, contributing to the important role of this basic tool as cardiovascular medicine evolves.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Turner syndrome, more specifically with respect to ECG, ESE/PES 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain a resting ECG at the time of diagnosis to assess for findings consistent with congenital heart disease, arrhythmia, or conduction abnormality. Obtain and review follow-up ECG by a cardiologist at intervals deemed appropriate based on baseline findings, underlying congenital heart disease, and clinical course.

### Fever-induced ST-segment elevation in a syncopal patient with Brugada syndrome [^bc88ae39]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Brugada syndrome (BS) is associated with life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Although a diagnosis of BS can be made by typical electrocardiographic (ECG) findings, these findings for BS vary depending on the patients' physiological conditions and are sometimes normalized or less evident. It is important for emergency physicians to recognize that the typical electrocardiographic findings of BS are not always manifested but sometimes are only unmasked in the presence of a specific condition.

Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) quickly spread throughout the world and caused a global pandemic. 1 Although clinical manifestations of COVID‐19 were mainly respiratory, cardiac injury, and arrhythmias were not uncommon and the association between cardiac injury and poor in‐hospital outcome had been determined. 2, 3 As a simple and easily obtainable tool to identify patients with acute or chronic cardiac disease, ECG is frequently performed in patients with cardiovascular disease and was also studied in pneumonia, 4 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 5 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). 6 However, systematic studies of ECG characteristics in COVID‐19 patients were limited 7, 8 and its prognostic significance remained to be fully elucidated. 9

The purpose of this study was to describe the electrocardiographic characteristics and to identify the prognostic significance of ECG findings at admission or during hospitalization in patients with COVID‐19.

### Routine electrocardiogram screening and cardiovascular disease events in adults [^31c96cc6]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Our findings highlight the potential role of baseline minor ECG abnormalities. We identified an association of the presence and number of minor ECG abnormalities with the risk of incident CVD and the development of new major ECG abnormalities over time in a more generalizable population, supported by previous studies performed in limited populations. Our analysis further enabled a comprehensive distinction between minor ECG abnormalities associated with clinical outcomes and those that were not. While some major ECG abnormalities, such as atrial fibrillation, have indications for further diagnostics and possibly treatment,minor ECG abnormalities have often been overlooked, and there is currently no guideline recommendation specifically addressing the management of multiple minor ECG abnormalities. Thus, our findings could shed new light on the clinical importance of minor ECG abnormalities incidentally detected in health screening settings.

The critical challenge persists on whether appropriate interventions following the identification of high-risk cases by ECG are available. Although our findings indicate an association between ECG results and CVD events, they do not imply that ECG results themselves or additional interventions based on the ECG results mitigate the outcomes of CVD. In addition, there is a possibility that the observed increased risk of all-cause mortality among individuals with ECG abnormalities could be partially due to overtreatment, such as potentially unnecessary invasive procedures. Furthermore, effective intervention is not necessarily available for most of the ECG abnormalities despite their association of higher risk for CVD. Considering the low follow-up rate even in the major ECG abnormality group, providing mandatory ECG tests without a suboptimal follow-up strategy may be inadequate. In this context, it is imperative to assess the effectiveness of workup strategies for individuals with ECG abnormalities. For instance, adopting a personalized approach that considers both baseline CVD risks and ECG findings, along with the optimal follow-up examinations (eg, active monitoring using ECG, Holter monitors, echocardiography, and wearable devices), could potentially maximize the utility of ECG findings, which should be the subject of future research.

Inflammatory disorders of the heart, although uncommon in the general population, often present initially to the emergency department. Symptoms and clinical manifestations are shared with other more common cardiopulmonary diseases, particularly acute coronary syndrome and congestive heart failure, making prompt diagnosis challenging. This review will highlight some of the clinical and electrocardiographic features that will help early diagnosis and differentiation of inflammatory cardiac disorders from other more common conditions.

### Previous ECG criteria (including STEMI criteria) overlook too (...) [^5fad2a0d]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

The article states that ECG findings on this initial ECG in the office that “…increase the likelihood of ACS include ST segment elevation, new-onset left bundle branch block, presence of Q waves, or new T-wave inversions. ” The single reference cited for this statement was written in 1983 and is outdated. 1, 2 Physicians must look for acute ECG changes of any kind that temporally occur in association with a history of new or recent chest pain. While impossible to fit into a single paragraph the constellation of ECG findings that suggest a patient with a history of “acute” chest pain requires immediate hospitalization to promptly rule out an acute event—the concept is to assess “patterns of leads, ” including ST segment depression, reciprocal changes in other lead areas, and a series of other ECG findings that, taken together, suggest recent or acute coronary disease.

1, 2 Limiting oneself to looking for ST elevation, new T-wave inversions, left bundle branch block, and/or Q waves misses a significant proportion of patients with “acute” chest pain who may have ACS and who need immediate evaluation. 1, 2. In Reply: We appreciate Dr. Grauer's comments. Our article intended to provide an overview of the most common causes of chest pain. Although a minority of patients presenting with chest pain to primary care clinics have a life-threatening cause, 1 ruling out acute coronary syndrome is essential. Twelve-lead electrocardiography is the most critical initial outpatient diagnostic test to evaluate patients presenting with chest pain. As indicated in Dr. Grauer's letter, several ECG patterns in addition to those we highlighted may be indicative of ACS, including reciprocal ST segment changes and ST segment depression.

Another ECG finding that could be important is Wellens syndrome, which is a biphasic or deeply inverted T-wave in the precordial leads. 2 Wellens syndrome may indicate critical stenosis of the left anterior descending artery. 3 The article notes that “…minor STE not fulfilling STEMI criteria, STE disproportionate to preceding QRS, unusual patterns with contiguous leads showing opposite ST deviations and some patterns not showing STE at all” may correlate with ACO. 3 Therefore, several ECG changes may indicate ACO.

### Electrocardiographic manifestations: pediatric ECG [^117f1629]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Interpretation of pediatric electrocardiograms (ECGs) can be challenging for the Emergency Physician. Part of this difficulty arises from the fact that the normal ECG findings, including rate, rhythm, axis, intervals and morphology, change from the neonatal period through infancy, childhood, and adolescence. These changes occur as a result of the maturation of the myocardium and cardiovascular system with age. Along with these changes, up to 20% of pediatric ECGs obtained in the acute setting may have clinically significant abnormal findings. This article will discuss the approach to the interpretation of ECGs in children, the age-related findings and alterations on the normal pediatric ECG, and those ECG abnormalities associated with pediatric cardiac diseases, including the variety of congenital heart diseases seen in children.

### Electrocardiographic diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction: current concepts for the clinician [^01ccd4ea]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Over the past 2 decades, the 12-lead electrocardiogram has attained special significance for the diagnosis and triage of patients with chest pain because timely detection of myocardial injury and a rapid assessment of myocardium at risk proved pivotal to implementing effective reperfusion therapies during acute myocardial infarction. However, this wealth of information could still be underutilized by clinicians who may restrict their diagnostic quest in patients with chest pain to the more classic electrocardiographic signs.

Methods

The medical literature on electrocardiographic manifestations of acute myocardial infarction was extensively reviewed.

Results

The widespread utilization of both coronary angiography and methods to determine myocardial function and metabolism in patients with acute myocardial infarction over the last 10 years has provided the means for rigorous comparisons with electrocardiographic information. We summarize these electrocardiographic signs and patterns in terms of their relevance to the clinician to help reduce the incidence of "nondiagnostic electrocardiograms" and improve timely decision-making.

Conclusions

The electrocardiogram continues to be an invaluable tool in the initial evaluation of patients with chest pain. The plethora of data currently available on electrocardiographic changes correlating with myocardial injury allows clinicians to make faster and better decisions than ever before.

Figure 1 
The spectrum of clinical presentations, electrocardiographic findings, and high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin levels in patients with acute coronary syndrome.

As noted, the initial ACS assessment includes the electrocardiogram, physical examination, clinical history, vital signs, and high‐sensitivity troponin trends. An ST elevation MI is readily apparent from the electrocardiogram, but patients with NSTE‐ACS should be divided into those with very high‐risk features and those without such very high‐risk features. Very high‐risk features include hemodynamic instability or cardiogenic shock; recurrent or ongoing chest pain, refractory to medical management; acute heart failure presumed secondary to ongoing myocardial ischemia; life‐threatening arrhythmias or cardiac arrest after presentation; mechanical complications ; or recurrent dynamic electrocardiographic changes suggestive of ischemia.

Patients with STEMI require immediate angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as appropriate (or thrombolysis if timely PCI is not feasible), as do the NSTE‐ACS patients with very high‐risk features. For NSTE‐ACS without very high‐risk features, angiography should be considered within the initial 24 h. The results of angiography determine the need for PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Then warranted is the consideration of long‐term medical therapy and lifestyle measures, with an emphasis on smoking cessation.

### Understanding electrocardiography in adult patients with congenital heart disease: a review [^ac63df1c]. JAMA Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Congenital heart disease in adults is still a relatively new concept for many cardiologists, and the complexity as well as diversity of cardiac phenotypes encountered necessitate that systematic, practical information be available for the nonspecialist. The analysis of the 12-lead electrocardiogram is an invaluable cornerstone in the clinical appraisal of these patients.

Observations

Consideration of the main anatomic and pathophysiological aspects of the various congenital heart conditions can shed light on their distinctive electrocardiogram patterns, which are an electrical reflection of intrinsic cardiac anatomy abnormalities, surgical scarring, and progressive cardiac remodeling attributable to hemodynamic perturbations. While congenital heart disease may be diagnosed or suspected on electrocardiogram observation in adults who are previously undiagnosed, specific markers have also been identified to optimize risk stratification in certain defects.

Conclusions and Relevance

This review outlines that main electrocardiogram patterns in adult patients with congenital heart disease can be appreciated by the understanding of the underlying pathophysiology. Periodic surveillance is of particular importance in this population to unmask early electric signs of disease evolution.

The electrocardiogram performed in the competitive athlete may manifest abnormal electrocardiographic findings; these findings may indicate either normal variant syndromes as well as true cardiac pathology. The normal variant syndromes include ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities, rhythm disturbances, and intraventricular conduction delay--it must be stressed that these electrocardiographic findings are, in fact, normal variants, not indicative of underlying pathology. Other presentations in these same competitive athletes describe significant cardiac pathology, including syndromes predisposing the patient to sudden cardiac death and other potentially dangerous dysrhythmias and diagnostic of acute coronary syndrome.

### Performance of emergency department screening criteria for an early ECG to identify ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^336cce38]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Despite decades of quality‐improvement efforts, the timely diagnosis of STEMI patients in the ED presents significant operational challenges. In managing the timely care of patients with STEMI, EDs encounter 3 distinct types of patients who differ on the screening, diagnosis, and treatment continuum. First are patients who have been prediagnosed with STEMI, who have had an ECG performed and interpreted by another provider. They are usually transferred to an ED or a hospital capable of definitive treatment, most often percutaneous coronary intervention. The expectation is that treatment will be initiated on arrival. Second are prescreened patients who have been evaluated by another provider and referred to the ED with an ECG concerning for ischemia. In these cases, the diagnosis needs to be confirmed with a repeat ECG or reinterpretation of the ECG on arrival. The burden of screening for STEMI from the report of symptoms has already been met in these 2 scenarios; however, treatment has not been initiated. Third are the patients at greatest risk of delays in care: those arriving in the ED with undifferentiated symptoms who are primarily screened by that ED. In these cases, timely STEMI diagnosis is dependent on the patient's condition and symptoms triggering ED intake staff to perform an early ECG. 4, 5 The ECG is often considered the screening test for STEMI. In the context of emergency care, however, treatment is initiated with ECG evidence of STEMI, making it a diagnostic test. 6 The true screening test is the criteria by which ED care providers initiate an ECG (Figure 2).

Overly comprehensive screening criteria for a rare disease like STEMI risks underutilization. The sole use of chest pain is user friendly but likely produces inadequate case capture. Overall, 20% to 30% of patients with STEMI will report atypical symptoms like shortness of breath and dizziness 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or will focus on associated symptoms like jaw, neck, or back pain. In addition, age positively influences the probability of STEMI, and elderly patients with STEMI more frequently report atypical symptoms. 12, 13, 14 Shorter time to reperfusion has been shown to improve outcomes. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 Door‐to‐ECG time interval is the first STEMI care target toward achieving timely intervention.

### Long-term outcomes of left anterior fascicular block in the absence of overt cardiovascular disease (...) [^f19b4d4a]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor: Left anterior fascicular block is considered a benign electrocardiographic finding, 1 but its long-term consequences have not been comprehensively studied. Conduction blocks occur due to conduction system fibrosis and are associated with myocardial fibrosis, even in the absence of other cardiovascular disease. 2, 3 Therefore, LAFB may be an immediately accessible marker of left heart fibrosis, a substrate for atrial fibrillation 4 and congestive heart failure. 5 We investigated the long-term outcomes of participants with LAFB in the absence of manifest cardiovascular disease in the Cardiovascular Health Study. We identified AF by study visit ECGs or hospital discharge diagnosis, and CHF was identified by physician diagnosis plus either pharmacological therapy or clinical findings. Deaths were identified from obituaries, the Social Security Death Index, Medicare claims, and participant proxies.

Outcomes were compared using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models. Sixteen participants with LAFB developed AF; 17, CHF; and 33 died. Through 10 years of annual ECGs, 0 LAFB participants developed left bundle branch block and 4 developed right bundle branch block, whereas 2 exhibited pacing. 02; IR, 3. 4 vs
1. 8), CHF, and death. Important limitations of this study include the small number of patients with LAFB and that this was an older cohort. Though CHS thoroughly identifies cardiovascular disease, it remains possible that LAFB is simply a marker of undetected underlying hypertension or coronary disease.

Given previous histopathological studies, 2, 3 these findings suggest that LAFB may be a clinically relevant marker of an individual's propensity to left heart fibrosis. Further research is needed to determine if LAFB is an important predictor of consequent adverse outcomes.

### Analyzing prominent T waves and ST-segment abnormalities in acute myocardial infarction [^a054226e]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperacute T waves and the non-concave appearance of the ST segment are early changes that may be seen on the electrocardiogram (ECG) in an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patient. There are specific morphological changes in these ECG findings that can help distinguish them from other conditions with similar ECG patterns. The differential diagnosis of prominent T waves and ST-segment elevation is well known, however, certain tools to distinguish ECG patterns with various etiologies have been developed and proven useful to the emergency physician.

Objectives

1) To discuss and review the more common differential diagnosis of prominent T waves and how to identify the hyperacute T wave of AMI. 2) To review the distinction and determination of a concave and non-concave ST segment that may be initially overlooked.

Case Report

A 42-year-old woman with minimal cardiac risk factors developed an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) that illustrates the evolution of early and classic ECG changes associated with her infarct.

Conclusions

The classic STEMI is ingrained in the emergency physician's mind, however, sometimes other lesser known and obvious ECG patterns can present early on in the evolution of disease, and these morphological patterns should be identified and treated accordingly.

### The ischemic electrocardiogram [^b0099639]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The electrocardiogram (EKG) is a useful diagnostic tool that allows clinicians to rapidly evaluate patients for acute coronary syndrome. With the high prevalence of heart disease in society, the EKG is crucial in the evaluation of chest pain and diagnosis of ischemia. Various guidelines provide criteria to aid in recognizing ischemia and help dictate patient management. Not all ischemic patterns requiring emergent management present within the classic definition of an STEMI. It is critical for clinicians to be able to accurately recognize these ischemic patterns to allow timely and appropriate cardiovascular care.

### ECG findings and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-AAFP (...) [^eab0ac2e]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

The legend for this figure reads as follows: “ECG from a 12-year-old girl with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Note the presence of sinus rhythm and wide, bizarre QRS complexes. The recording is at half standard, so the complexes are actually twice as large as displayed. The ECG is abnormal in over 90 percent of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The most common abnormalities are left ventricular hypertrophy, ST-segment alterations, T-wave inversion, large Q waves and the peculiar diminution of R waves in the lateral precordial leads seen in this patient. ”. Close inspection of lead V1 in this tracing shows a short PR interval, slurring of the intial portion of the QRS complex and QRS widening. Although delta waves are not well seen in many of the other leads in this tracing, I believe there is slurring of the initial part of the QRS in leads V4 and V5. In addition, the multiple deflections in the inferior leads may represent partially negative delta waves.

I therefore believe that this ECG is highly suggestive of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. While I fully agree that most patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have an abnormal ECG, I do not feel that the tracing shown in Figure 1 is representative of what one should expect to find with this abnormality, other than the slight increased association of a familial form of WPW that is seen with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. in reply: Dr. Grauer correctly points out that the ECG in Figure 1 of the second part of our review on common cardiovascular problems in the young appears to show preexcitation. The patient in question has marked septal hypertrophy and mild left ventricular outflow obstruction by echocardiography but has never complained of tachycardia. It illustrates our point that the ECG is almost always abnormal in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, with preexcitation being one of the abnormalities that may occur.

### The electrocardiogram in the ACS patient: high-risk electrocardiographic presentations lacking anatomically oriented ST-segment elevation [^69aecb94]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is defined as pathologic ST-segment elevation occurring in at least 2 anatomically contiguous leads in a patient with a clinical presentation consistent with acute myocardial infarction (AMI); these findings can suggest the need for urgent revascularization. Unfortunately, the electrocardiogram (ECG) may be nondiagnostic in a large portion of patients who initially present with AMI; furthermore, it is now recognized that ECG patterns that do not meet the traditional diagnostic criteria for STEMI may represent significant AMI--these patterns are generally referred to as the STEMI equivalent patterns in that they are caused by occlusion of an epicardial coronary artery, place significant portions of the left ventricle in jeopardy, and can result in a poor outcome if not recognized and treated appropriately.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) findings consistent with ischemia—In patients with ischemic symptoms, ST-segment elevation in lead augmented vector right with or without V1 combined with multilead ST-segment depression represents a high-risk pattern associated with high morbidity and mortality and often reflects diffuse ischemia from left main and/or 3-vessel disease; in approximately 10% of cases, acute coronary occlusion is present. Emergent coronary angiography should be considered in patients with persistent ischemic symptoms or ECG changes after treatment or if there is hemodynamic instability. Ischemic ST-segment depression is specific but not sensitive for ACS, and in the setting of ischemic symptoms it should prompt treatment consistent with the 2014 NSTE-ACS guidelines.

Use of medications for attention-deficit hyperkinetic disorder and preparticipation sports physical examination has led to an increase in number of electrocardiograms (ECG) performed during adolescence. Interpreting ECGs in children and young adults must take into account the evolutionary changes with age and the benign variants, which are usually not associated with heart disease. It is crucial for primary-care providers to recognize the changes on ECG associated with heart disease and risk of sudden death. In this article, the significance, sensitivity, specificity, and the diagnostic workup of these findings in the asymptomatic teenager are discussed.

### ECG manifestations: noncoronary heart disease [^1c40b03b]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The electrocardiogram reflects changes to the heart beyond those seen in acute myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndromes. Diseases of the pericardium and heart muscle such as pericarditis,myocarditis, and pericardial effusion have characteristic manifestations. Hypertensive heart disease is associated with a variety of changes on the electrocardiogram, as is valvular heart disease. Cardiac rhythm disturbances have been associated with the Brugada syndrome and the long QT syndrome, both of which have telltale findings on the electrocardiogram. The manifestations of dextrocardia, although rare, should be familiar to those who interpret electro-cardiograms. Transplanted hearts also feature classic changes, both in health and in stages of rejection. The various electrocardiographic manifestations of these noncoronary heart diseases are reviewed here.

Electrocardiogram—supportive considerations: When an ECG is nondiagnostic, it “should be compared with previous ECGs, if available,” and “a normal or unchanged ECG is reasonably useful but not sufficient at ruling out ACS,” so decision‑making “should not be based solely on a single normal or nondiagnostic ECG.” Masking conditions may occur, and “Up to 6% of patients with evolving ACS are discharged from the ED with a normal ECG,” therefore “serial ECGs should be performed and management should be guided by new electrocardiographic changes or other diagnostic testing.” When ST‑elevation is present on the initial ECG, “management should follow the prescribed STEMI treatment algorithms,” and if ST depression is identified, “management should follow the NSTE-ACS guidelines.” Because a normal ECG may accompany certain occlusions and posterior ischemia, which is “often ‘electrically silent’; therefore, right-sided ECG leads should be considered when such lesions are suspected.”

### Acute management of ventricular Arrhythmia in Patients with Suspected Inherited heart Rhythm Disorders [^da49f287]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2019). Medium credibility.

After the most common causes of sudden cardiac death including ischemic and structural heart disease have been ruled out, clinicians on the front lines of emergent medical care can be faced with unexplained and recurrent life-threatening arrhythmia episodes in children and adults. In these cases, an inherited arrhythmia syndrome should be suspected, and a departure from conventional advanced cardiac life support algorithms may be required. This review focuses on the electrocardiographic clues of an inherited arrhythmia syndrome that can be uncovered through a careful analysis of the baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) and classification of the presenting ventricular arrhythmia and its mode of onset. After presenting an informed working diagnosis and an explanation of the implied electrophysiologic mechanisms, discussion provides a protocol approach to acute and subacute management decisions. Careful attention to a patient's response to treatment and its ECG surrogates have the potential to facilitate tailored therapy based on the underlying arrhythmogenic substrate and pathophysiology.

Although "The noncaseating granuloma is the characteristic pathological lesion of sarcoidosis; however, these granulomas are not specific to sarcoidosis and can be the result of various infectious and noninfectious causes." Proposed criteria "rely on pathological demonstration of cardiac granulomas or noninvasive evidence of cardiac involvement in a patient with pathologically proven extracardiac sarcoidosis." Initial evaluation includes "a detailed history and physical examination, ECG, and chest radiograph." ECG abnormalities are described: "Abnormal electrocardiographic findings include bundle-branch block, new atrioventricular block, frequent premature ventricular complexes, ventricular tachycardia, pathologic Q waves, and ST-T changes." Conduction disturbances are emphasized: "First-degree heart block caused by disease of the conduction system is common and can progress to complete heart block," and "In patients with clinically evident cardiac sarcoidosis, complete heart block is a common finding." Moreover, "Complete heart block occurs at a younger age in patients with sarcoidosis than in patients with complete heart block attributable to other causes." Consequently, "Any of these electrocardiographic findings should prompt further investigation."

The electrocardiogram (ECG) continues to be a critical component of the evaluation of patients who have signs and symptoms of emergency cardiac conditions. This tool is now approximately 100 years old and has been a standard in clinical practice for more than half a century. Application of new signal processing techniques and an expansion in the use of additional leads allows clinicians to extract more and more information from the cardiac electrical activity. An understanding of the technology inherent in the recording of ECGs allows one to more fully understand the benefits and limitation of electrocardiography.

### Electrocardiographic findings in peripartum cardiomyopathy [^30f178bd]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

There is limited data on electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities and their prognostic significance in women with peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM). We sought to characterize ECG findings in PPCM and explore the association of ECG findings with myocardial recovery and clinical outcomes.

Hypothesis

We hypothesized that ECG indicators of myocardial remodeling would portend worse systolic function and outcomes.

Methods

Standard 12‐lead ECGs were obtained at enrollment in the Investigations of Pregnancy‐Associated Cardiomyopathy study and analyzed for 88 women. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was measured by echocardiography at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Women were followed for clinical events (death, mechanical circulatory support, and/or cardiac transplantation) until 1 year.

Results

Half of women had an “abnormal” ECG, defined as atrial abnormality, ventricular hypertrophy, ST‐segment deviation, and/or bundle branch block. Women with left atrial abnormality (LAA) had lower LVEF at 6 months (44% vs 52%, P = 0.02) and 12 months (46% vs 54%, P = 0.03). LAA also predicted decreased event‐free survival at 1 year (76% vs 97%, P = 0.008). Neither left ventricular hypertrophy by ECG nor T‐wave abnormalities predicted outcomes. A normal ECG was associated with recovery in LVEF to ≥50% (84% vs 49%, P = 0.001) and event‐free survival at 1 year (100% vs 85%, P = 0.01).

Conclusions

ECG abnormalities are common in women with PPCM, but a normal ECG does not rule out the presence of PPCM. LAA predicted lower likelihood of myocardial recovery and event‐free survival, and a normal ECG predicted favorable event‐free survival.

### Interpretation of T-wave inversion in physiological and pathological conditions: current state and future perspectives [^4770c890]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The presence of T‐wave inversion (TWI) at 12‐lead electrocardiogram (ECG) in competitive athletes is one of the major diagnostic challenges for sports physicians and consulting cardiologists. Indeed, while the presence of TWI may be associated with some benign conditions and it may be occasionally seen in healthy athletes presenting signs of cardiac remodeling, it may also represent an early sign of an underlying, concealed structural heart disease or life‐threatening arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies, which may be responsible for exercise‐related sudden cardiac death (SCD). The interpretation of TWI in athletes is complex and the inherent implications for the clinical practice represent a conundrum for physicians. Accordingly, the detection of TWI should be viewed as a potential red flag on the ECG of young and apparently healthy athletes and warrants further investigations because it may represent the initial expression of cardiomyopathies that may not be evident until many years later and that may ultimately be associated with adverse outcomes. The aim of this review is, therefore, to report an update of the literature on TWI in athletes, with a specific focus on the interpretation and management.

LIMITATIONS

A major limitation of this study is the heterogeneity of the input data because of differences in methodology, population, and ethnicity. Variabilities in the ascertainment of ECG markers and adjudication of the outcomes may affect the quality of the overall data.

Our systematic review considered the overall data of the published series. We didn't go into detail about specific issues regarding subgroups such as women and children, who have a very challenging risk profile. 53, 54, 55 In addition, many of the pathophysiological mechanisms proposed in these studies are hypothetical, that is, not based on experimental data. Therefore, further rigorous studies are needed to confirm these hypotheses.

Additional ECG findings consistent with acute coronary artery occlusion—diagnostic cues—note that the application of STEMI ECG criteria on a standard 12-lead ECG alone will miss a significant minority of patients who have acute coronary occlusion; therefore, the ECG should be closely examined for subtle changes such as hyperacute T waves or ST-segment elevation <1 mm, particularly when combined with reciprocal ST-segment depression, as concomitant reciprocal ST-segment depression may be visually more evident than ST-segment elevation; if present, these patients should be evaluated for emergent coronary angiography.

Circulation (2009). Medium credibility.

Right ventricular hypertrophy—interpretation and performance note that RVH causes “a displacement of the QRS vector toward the right and anteriorly” and “often causes a delay in the R-wave peak in right precordial leads,” so “the ability of the ECG to detect RVH may be expected to be low.” Sensitivity is “generally low,” though some criteria have “high specificity,” with accuracy greatest “in congenital heart disease,” intermediate “in acquired heart disease and primary pulmonary hypertension in adults,” and lowest “in chronic lung disease.” ECG patterns include one similar to incomplete RBBB and another with predominantly tall R waves in right precordial leads; both are “associated with right axis deviation,” and are frequently associated with ST depression and T-wave inversion in right precordial leads, better termed “secondary ST-T abnormality” than “strain.” In chronic nonobstructive lung disease there is often “right axis deviation and deep S waves in the precordial leads;” chronic obstructive pulmonary disease produces a characteristic pattern with “low voltage in the limb leads,” a frontal plane QRS axis that is “rightward, superior, or indeterminate,” a rightward P-wave axis “greater than 60 degrees,” “persistent S waves in all precordial leads,” and “low R-wave amplitude in V6,” and “RVH is suggested … only if R-wave amplitude in V1 is relatively increased.” For diagnosis, “Right axis deviation and prominent anterior forces in the right precordial leads should be required … in nearly all cases,” but “such features occur for various reasons other than RVH,” so “The use of ancillary clinical information, therefore, plays a greater role.”

### A straightforward guide to the basic science behind arrhythmogenesis [^4787a0dc]. Heart (2014). Low credibility.

The underlying mechanisms behind cardiac arrhythmias are described in this manuscript. In clinical practice, significant arrhythmias are unpredictable, and under some conditions, potentially life-threatening. How can basic science help improve our understanding of molecular entities and factors behind the arrhythmia to advance, develop, adapt or deliver available medications? Structural heart disease and remodelling (eg, heart failure, cardiomyopathy), the presence of modulating factors (ie, diabetes mellitus, autonomic nervous system), genetic predispositions (ie, channelopathies) are considerable preconditions, and influence the development of an arrhythmia. Cardiac arrhythmias may indeed share common basic mechanisms, while elements and substrates perpetuating these may be different and ultimately manifest as various ECG abnormalities. This article lists cellular and subcellular iatrogenic disorders responsible for abnormal impulse generation, or conduction disturbances, including the latest development in theories and biological research, for a better understanding of cellular disorders behind arrhythmogenesis.

Electrocardiogram—left atrial abnormality assessment notes that the product of the amplitude and duration of the terminal negative component of the P wave in lead V1 (P terminal force) has been used most frequently, but P-wave duration (120 ms or more) and a widely notched P wave (40 ms or more) appear to have equal value; several other criteria, including left axis of the terminal P wave (−30 to −90), are also useful. A purely negative P wave in V1 is suggestive but can occur without an increased P terminal force, and prolonged activation time indicated by total P-wave duration of 120 ms or more is present in a large majority of patients with electrocardiographic signs considered to represent left atrial abnormalities.

### How to evaluate premature ventricular beats in the athlete: critical review and proposal of a diagnostic algorithm [^4ca95e8b]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Electrocardiography

The ECG is an essential part of the evaluation of athletes with PVBs because concomitant repolarisation/depolarisation abnormalities may provide important information on a possible underlying cardiomyopathy or channelopathy.

The most relevant ECG abnormalities which are consistent with an at-risk heart muscle disorder include repolarisation abnormalities such as T-wave inversion and ST segment depression, pathological Q-waves, intraventricular conduction disturbances, ventricular pre-excitation and a long QT interval. These ECG abnormalities are classified by current recommendations for interpretation of the athlete’s ECG as abnormal and training-unrelated ECG findings that warrant additional investigation to exclude myocardial disease.The association between a PVB with a LBBB morphology and other ECG abnormalities such as T-wave inversion, prolonged S-wave upstroke (≥55 ms from the nadir of the S-wave to the end of the QRS complex in leads V1–V3) or a epsilon wave (small positive deflection or notch between the end of the QRS complex and onset of the T-wave in leads V1–V3) in the non-ectopic beats is highly suggestive of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy(figure 4). On the other hand, PVBs with an RBBB pattern >130 ms and negative T-waves in the left precordial leads (V5–V6) in the non-ectopic beats should raise the suspicion of a LV myocardial disease, such as dilated cardiomyopathy, non-ischaemic LV scar (figure 3), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, left-dominant arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy or arrhythmic mitral valve prolapse (figure 5).Athletes with PVBs and concomitant repolarisation/depolarisation abnormalities require an indepth cardiovascular evaluation aimed to confirm (or exclude) such heart muscle diseases.

### Myocardial infarction in neonates: a review of an entity with significant morbidity and mortality [^002dc1fa]. Pediatric Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Coronary artery disease is a global problem with high mortality rates and significant residual sequelae that affect long-term quality of life. Myocardial infarction (MI) in neonates is a recognized, uncommon entity, but the incidence and broad spectrum of the disease is unknown and likely underestimated due to limited reporting which in the majority is confined to acute ischemic events. The challenges involve clinical diagnosis which masquerades in the early phase as non-specific symptoms and signs that are commonly found in a host of neonatal disorders. Precise diagnostic criteria for neonatal MI are lacking, and management is driven by clinical presentation and hemodynamic stabilization rather than an attempt to rapidly establish the root cause of the condition. We conducted a review of the published reports of neonatal MI from 2000 to 2014, to establish an approach to the diagnosis and management based on the existing evidence. The overall evidence from 32 scientific articles stemmed from case reports and case series which were graded as low-to-very low quality. Neonatal MI resembles childhood and adult MI with features that involve characteristic ECG changes, raised biomarkers, and diagnostic imaging, but with lack of robust, standardized criteria to facilitate prompt diagnosis and timely intervention. The mortality rate of neonatal MI ranges from 40 to 50% based on inclusion criteria, but the short-term data reflect normal quality of life in survivors. An algorithm for the diagnosis and management of neonatal MI may optimize outcomes, but at the present time is based on limited evidence. Well-designed clinical studies focusing on the definition, diagnosis, and management of neonatal MI, backed by international consensus guidelines, are needed to alter the prognosis of this serious condition.

Recommendation-specific supportive text—unless a patient with suspected bradycardia or conduction disorder is symptomatic or bradycardic at the time of the recording, the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will not provide a rhythm correlation with symptoms. However, an abnormal initial ECG is predictive of adverse outcomes in patients presenting with syncope and near syncope, and a multicenter, prospective observational study concluded that electrocardiographic abnormalities were associated with increased all-cause mortality at 1 year. The prognostic value of an abnormal initial ECG is reflected in its inclusion in most published multivariate risk scores, and this risk does not necessarily correlate with pathological bradycardia because only approximately 10% of syncope can be attributed to bradycardia or a conduction disorder at the time of initial presentation; an additional 18% can be attributed to neurally mediated syncope.

### Performance of emergency department screening criteria for an early ECG to identify ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^bc00b082]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The diagnosis of ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the emergency department (ED) is made solely by ECG. Timely diagnosis is critical to achieving timely intervention. The goal is to achieve a door‐to‐ECG time of 10 minutes. 1 The first 10 minutes of an ED visit, however, are administrative. To achieve timely diagnosis of patients with potential STEMI, EDs use early ECG screening criteria for all ED patients on arrival and prior to the physician evaluation. Different EDs, however, have different criteria. The association of these criteria with missed STEMI cases and the impact of missed screening on myocardial ischemia time are unknown.

The first 10 minutes of an ED visit typically consist of intake processes (registration and triage) that usually occur well before a physician encounter (Figure 1). Consequently, ED registration and triage staff use preestablished screening criteria to identify patients that should receive an early ECG to diagnose STEMI (Figure 2). Given the time‐sensitive nature of STEMI care, failure to identify candidates for an early ECG during ED intake processes subjects patients to diagnostic and potential treatment delay. 1, 2, 3 Patients eventually diagnosed with STEMI present with a wide spectrum of symptoms. STEMI screening criteria are preestablished algorithms using a patient's arrival information. The criterion within the ED screening criteria falls on the spectrum of including only “chest pain” as the most typical symptom and variably includes consideration for more atypical symptoms or age. Identifying the most sensitive approach, balanced with specificity, could guide EDs in optimizing their STEMI screening performance.

Syncope and palpitations are common complaints for patients presenting to their primary care provider. They represent symptoms that most often have a benign etiology but rarely can be the first warning sign of a serious condition, such as arrhythmias, structural heart disease, or noncardiac disease.

This article introduces syncope and palpitations, with emphasis on the differential diagnoses, initial presentation, diagnostic strategy, and various management strategies.

### Prognostic value of admission electrocardiographic findings in non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^9eeedd4e]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most accessible and widely used diagnostic tool when patients are suspected to have acute coronary syndrome (ACS). 1 Admission ECG findings may also provide prognostic information and rapid risk assessment in ACS patients, 2, 3 especially those with non‐ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), a diagnosis applied to a heterogeneous group of patients with different clinical characteristics and outcomes. ECG findings of NSTEMI at presentation show several variations, including transient ST‐segment elevation (TSTE), ST‐segment depression (STD), T‐wave inversion (TWI), and no ischemic changes (NIC). Previous studies have shown that the presence of STD is associated with an increased risk of short‐ and long‐term cardiovascular (CV) events, 4, 5 but studies of TWI have shown inconsistent results. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 Limited data are available on patients with TSTE and NIC. Risk stratification remains crucial to selecting appropriate management strategies for NSTEMI patients. Therefore, systematically investigating these four ECG subgroups would help clinicians better risk‐stratify patients and yield additional insight into the selection of appropriate treatment. Furthermore, current guidelines for NSTEMI patients recommend invasive reperfusion to improve clinical outcomes, 12, 13 but the effect of invasive management on the prognostic value of admission ECG data in contemporary practice has not been studied. It is still unclear whether the prognostic value of admission ECG findings differs between patients with or without invasive management.

In this study, we performed a retrospective analysis of NSTE‐ACS patients in the Acute Coronary Syndrome Quality Improvement in Kerala (ACS QUIK) trial, comparing patient characteristics, treatments, and outcomes between four ECG subgroups with the aim of systematically assessing the prognostic value of qualitative ECG findings at presentation. We also performed a subset analysis of patients with or without invasive reperfusion in order to clarify the influence of such treatment on the prognostic value of admission ECG findings.

### Electrocardiographic abnormalities in elderly Chagas disease patients: 10-year follow-up of the bambui cohort study of aging [^b91a00cf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

In conclusion, ECG abnormalities are more frequent in T. cruzi ‐infected than in non‐infected, community‐dwelling elderly; a normal ECG is an uncommon finding in infected aged persons. Among ECG abnormalities associated with T. cruzi infection, RBBB, especially in association with left anterior hemiblock, is the most typical finding. ECG variables independently associated with prognosis in ChD included non‐sinus rhythm, frequent ventricular and supraventricular premature beats, atrial fibrillation, RBBB, old MI, possible old MI, and LVH. The presence of any major ECG abnormalities doubles the risk of death in ChD patients, but it also increases the risk in non‐ChD elderly; the risk of death increases with the number of major abnormalities in the same patient. ECG abnormalities are more common among elderly Chagas disease patients and strongly predict adverse outcomes.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^0128c090]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Electrocardiographic detection of myocardial infarction—an electrocardiogram (ECG) “should be acquired and interpreted promptly (ie, target within 10 minutes) after first medical contact,” and “prehospital ECGs reduce the time to diagnosis and treatment, and can facilitate the triage of STEMI patients… if within the recommended time interval (120 minutes from STEMI diagnosis).” For ongoing symptoms or a nondiagnostic tracing, “recording several standard ECGs… at 15–30 minute intervals for the initial 1–2 hours, or the use of continuous computer-assisted 12-lead ECG recording… is reasonable.” Certain patterns carry prognostic/diagnostic implications: “ST-segment depression ≥1 mm in 6 leads… is suggestive evidence of multivessel disease or left main disease,” while a comparison tracing helps but “should not delay the decision for treatment.” Early ischemic changes include “increased hyperacute T wave amplitude… in at least 2 contiguous leads,” and infarction evolution is reflected as “the development of new Q waves” indicating necrosis that “starts minutes/hours after the myocardial insult,” with “transient Q waves” sometimes seen during acute ischemia or “(rarely) during acute MI with successful reperfusion.”

### Electrocardiographic manifestations: electrolyte abnormalities [^a62c3d85]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Because myocyte depolarization and repolarization depend on intra- and extracellular shifts in ion gradients, abnormal serum electrolyte levels can have profound effects on cardiac conduction and the electrocardiogram (EKG). Changes in extracellular potassium, calcium, and magnesium levels can change myocyte membrane potential gradients and alter the cardiac action potential. These changes can result in incidental findings on the 12-lead EKG or precipitate potentially life-threatening dysrhythmias. We will review the major electrocardiographic findings associated with abnormalities of the major cationic contributors to cardiac conduction-potassium, calcium and magnesium.

Viral testing platforms and retesting considerations: The test platforms now available have different advantages and limitations, including differences in turnaround time and throughput, and fortunately, false positive rates are low for established viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. However, sensitivity of PCR-based viral testing varies among platforms, and significantly variable false negative rates from available test kits have been reported, which may be compounded by sampling limitations and variation in presence of virus at different sites during the course of the disease. These considerations may prompt repeat testing when there is evidence of exposure, typical symptoms, or clinical presentation (although atypical symptom presentations are well described).

ECGs can help to identify myocarditis, although the findings are not specific. For patients receiving ICI, one should consider the possibility of myocarditis if any of the following are noted: new prolongation of the PR interval, atrioventricular block, ventricular arrhythmias, frequent premature ventricular complexes, ST depression, or diffuse T‐wave inversions (Figure 2). Of course, other causes of these ECG abnormalities, such as acute coronary syndrome, must be ruled out. For patients admitted with suspected myocarditis, the use of telemetry monitoring early in the admission is helpful to identify intermittent arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, and increasing frequency of premature ventricular complexes. Atrial arrhythmias are also possible, with up to 30% of patients presenting with atrial fibrillation, as reported by Escudier et al. 10 Although baseline ECG abnormalities are not predictive of the risk of developing myocarditis, the baseline ECG is useful as a comparison to subsequent studies. 4

Figure 2 
ECG abnormalities: Presented is an example of ECG abnormalities encountered during immune checkpoint inhibitor myocarditis. The severe prolongation of the PR interval on presentation can be a harbinger of potentially serious rhythm abnormalities, such as complete heart block, which occurred in this patient. Top, Baseline ECG before initiating immune checkpoint inhibitors. Normal PR interval (red box with short double arrow) and no premature ventricular complexes. Bottom, After 4 doses of nivolumab, patient presented with dyspnea and decompensated heart failure. ECG reveals new prolongation in PR interval (red box with long double arrow) and frequent premature ventricular complexes (red ovals). The patient had a temporary pacemaker placed and progressed to advanced atrioventricular block, which later recovered, and PR interval returned to normal after initiation of steroids, plasmapheresis, and infliximab.

As with troponin assays, ECGs have been proposed for use in screening and surveillance. 4, 23 Lee Chuy et al used ECG in combination with troponin for 76 patients on combination ipilimumab and nivolumab but did not identify any with myocarditis. 31 As mentioned above, better predictors are needed to identify those who will benefit most from surveillance.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^dbfaf4a7]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Takotsubo syndrome (TTS)—clinical features, ECG, and biomarkers: TTS can mimic myocardial infarction (MI) and is found in 1% to 2% of patients presenting with suspected ST-elevation MI (STEMI); its onset is often triggered by intense emotional or physical stress such as bereavement, and over 90% of patients are postmenopausal women. Cardiovascular complications occur in 50% of patients, and the inpatient mortality is similar to STEMI (4% to 5%); ST-segment elevation is frequent (44%) and is usually widespread across the lateral and precordial leads beyond a single coronary artery distribution, whereas ST-segment depression occurs in <10% of patients and after 12 to 24 hours deep, symmetric T wave inversion and QTc prolongation are typically observed. There are usually transient elevations in cardiac troponin (cTn) levels (>95% of cases), but the peak cTn values observed are modest and contrast with the large territory of electrocardiogram (ECG) changes or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction.

### Sarcoidosis: evaluation and treatment [^c2e74c55]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for sarcoidosis, more specifically with respect to evaluation for cardiac involvement, ECG and TTE, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain baseline 12-lead ECG in patients with extracardiac sarcoidosis without cardiac symptoms to screen for cardiac involvement.

### 2015 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline for the management of adult patients with supraventricular tachycardia: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^3ab2c8c1]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) evaluation in SVT emphasizes obtaining a 12‑lead during tachycardia and sinus rhythm to define mechanism and characteristic P‑wave findings: a 12‑lead ECG obtained during tachycardia and during sinus rhythm may reveal the etiology of tachycardia; for a patient presenting in SVT, the 12‑lead ECG can potentially identify the arrhythmic mechanism; if the SVT is regular, this may represent AT with 1:1 conduction or an SVT that involves the atrioventricular (AV) node; SVTs that involve the AV node as a required component of the tachycardia reentrant circuit include AVNRT and AVRT; in these reentrant tachycardias, the retrogradely conducted P wave may be difficult to discern, especially if bundle‑branch block is present; in typical AVNRT, atrial activation is nearly simultaneous with the QRS with a pseudo S wave in inferior leads and pseudo R’ in V1; in orthodromic AVRT, the P wave can usually be seen in the early part of the ST‑T segment; in typical forms of AVNRT and AVRT, the tachycardias are referred to as having a “short RP.”

### Primary care sports medicine fellowship: AMSSM proposed standards of excellence [^a9ade005]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Electrocardiogram interpretation—training expectations are detailed: Currently, no universal standard for sports cardiology training exists for sports medicine physicians in the United States. Controversy exists regarding the most suitable approach for cardiovascular screening in athletes, which mainly involves the inclusion (or not) of an electrocardiogram (ECG). Regardless, however, it is critical for sports medicine physicians to be knowledgeable of both the ECG-associated physiologic adaptations to regular exercise and the conditions associated with sudden cardiac death (SCD). Free online training programs (http://learning.bmj.com/ECGathlete) are available to improve physician education in ECG interpretation and guide secondary testing for ECG abnormalities. Fellows should master and demonstrate sound knowledge of contemporary ECG interpretation standards in athletes (eg, 2016 International ECG Interpretation Standards) through mentored clinical experiences, didactic sessions, and/or formal courses.
