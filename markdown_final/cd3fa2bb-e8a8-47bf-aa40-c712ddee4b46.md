## Question

average glucose a1c

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to convert hemoglobin A1c to estimated average glucose, including the derivation, accuracy, limitations, and practical application of the eAG concept. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the physiological basis of A1c and what it truly measures. Then, I should verify the origin and equation used to derive eAG from A1c. Next, I will review the strength and limits of the correlation, including prediction intervals. After that, I need to check population applicability and confounders that can bias eAG. I will then examine discordance between eAG and self-monitored mean glucose and the hemoglobin glycation index. Finally, I will synthesize practical guidance for clinicians, including when to trust eAG, when to use CGM-derived metrics, and how to handle discordant results, anchoring to ADA Standards and contemporary guidance.

> Let me first confirm the physiological basis so I don't overstate what A1c represents. A1c reflects a time-weighted average of glycemia over approximately 2–3 months, driven by the irreversible glycation of hemoglobin and the lifespan of erythrocytes, which is why clinically meaningful changes can be seen in less than 120 days in some contexts, though the classic teaching remains roughly a 3-month window [^11683ts9] [^115fjCzy].

> Now, I should verify the derivation of the eAG equation. The ADAG study enrolled 507 adults with type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and without diabetes, collecting roughly 2,700 glucose measurements per participant over 3 months using CGM and frequent SMBG, and found a strong linear relationship between A1c and average glucose, yielding the widely used eAG formula: eAG (mg/dL) = 28.7 × A1c − 46.7, with R² ≈ 0.84 and a prediction error SD around 15.7 mg/dL. Importantly, the relationship was consistent across diabetes types, sex, age, and smoking status in that cohort [^111ALYeP] [^113mtm7X] [^113JYHGG].

> Wait, let me verify the reported correlation strength because different summaries cite different r values. The ADAG report itself emphasizes an R² of 0.84 and a prediction error SD of about 15.7 mg/dL, while ADA Standards tables often cite r ≈ 0.92 for the same dataset; these are compatible because r² ≈ 0.84 corresponds to r ≈ 0.92, and the tighter r reported in guidelines reflects the population-level correlation rather than individual prediction intervals, which are wider [^113mtm7X] [^115616qV].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about individual accuracy. I need to check the prediction intervals and real-world discordance. The ADAG analysis pre-specified that at least 90% of individual eAG estimates should fall within ± 15% of the regression line, and approximately 89.95% met this criterion; however, in clinical populations, discordance between eAG and self-monitored mean glucose can be clinically significant, with studies showing that about 20–33% of individuals have differences exceeding roughly 28–30 mg/dL, which corresponds to about a 1% A1c swing, underscoring that eAG is a population estimate with interindividual variability in glycation biology [^113mtm7X] [^112Ka6iA].

> I should confirm population applicability and confounders before recommending universal use. The ADAG cohort deliberately excluded conditions that alter erythrocyte turnover or hemoglobin structure, such as anemia, hemoglobinopathies, chronic kidney or liver disease, pregnancy, and recent blood loss or transfusion; moreover, the cohort was predominantly non-Hispanic White, limiting generalizability, and subsequent studies show that Black individuals, on average, have higher A1c for the same mean glucose, indicating a racial glycation difference of roughly 0.2–0.6 percentage points, which can bias eAG in opposite directions depending on the person's glycation phenotype [^116yZmRu] [^1144AW1A] [^116C9TmM].

> Let me consider the biological variability that drives discordance. The hemoglobin glycation index (HGI) quantifies individual propensity to glycate hemoglobin at a given glucose level; high-HGI individuals tend to have higher A1c than expected from their mean glucose, whereas low-HGI individuals have lower A1c, and this systematic bias persists within individuals over time, explaining why eAG can systematically over- or underestimate true mean glucose depending on HGI, with potential clinical consequences if therapy is titrated to a misleading eAG target [^113VrGFX] [^112KYKtz].

> Next, I should review how to apply this clinically without overinterpreting eAG. For most adults with stable diabetes and no confounders, eAG is a reasonable communication tool to translate A1c into glucose units patients understand, and ADA Standards endorse reporting eAG alongside A1c. However, I need to ensure that discordant cases trigger a check for assay interference, anemia or CKD, and consider alternative markers like fructosamine or CGM metrics when the clinical picture and A1c disagree, rather than intensifying therapy solely on a discordant A1c or eAG [^115Nz7rD] [^115QjVbY] [^114AQYxP].

> But wait, what if the patient uses CGM; should I rely on GMI instead of eAG? I should double-check the guidance here. Contemporary expert opinion and guidelines caution that GMI, calculated from CGM mean glucose, often diverges from laboratory A1c and should not replace A1c; instead, clinicians should interpret CGM using time-in-range, time above/below range, and mean glucose directly, recognizing that GMI and A1c are distinct measures and that discordance can signal assay issues, altered red cell turnover, or biological glycation differences, prompting individualized interpretation rather than automatic therapy changes [^113jBQBd] [^114JYUYZ] [^116RAbvn].

> I will now examine practical thresholds to anchor counseling. ADA Standards provide an A1c–eAG equivalence table with 95% prediction intervals. For example, A1c 7% corresponds to eAG about 154 mg/dL with a 95% CI of roughly 123–185 mg/dL, which I should present as a range rather than a point estimate to set expectations about uncertainty and to avoid overprecision in discussions with patients [^115Nz7rD].

> Let me reconsider the role of fasting glucose versus postprandial contributions to A1c, because this affects monitoring advice. While some literature suggests postprandial glucose predominates at lower A1c and fasting at higher A1c, the ADAG analyses indicate that preprandial values often track A1c more closely than isolated postprandial excursions, reinforcing the value of structured SMBG or CGM profiles that capture overnight, fasting, and premeal values when A1c and eAG appear discordant with the patient's self-monitoring pattern [^116PHnD6] [^115L4ftT].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: eAG is a validated population translation of A1c that improves patient understanding, but it is not a direct substitute for true mean glucose in individuals. Clinicians should use eAG as a communication aid, verify discordant cases for confounders and glycation variability, and integrate A1c with CGM or SMBG data to individualize therapy, avoiding medication changes based on a single discordant A1c or eAG value and aligning intensification with the broader clinical context and patient preferences [^115Nz7rD] [^115fjCzy] [^114AQYxP].

The average glucose A1c relationship is best described by the **ADAG equation** [^111ALYeP] eAG (mg/dL) = 28.7 × A1c − 46.7, with a strong correlation (r ≈ 0.84–0.92) [^115616qV] between A1c and average glucose. For example, A1c 7.0% corresponds to an eAG of ~154 mg/dL [^115Nz7rD]. Individual variability and assay limitations mean **eAG is an estimate** [^115YR1aV]; use it alongside SMBG or CGM for comprehensive assessment [^115fjCzy].

## Relationship between average glucose and A1c

- **Glycation of hemoglobin**: A1c forms when glucose irreversibly glycates hemoglobin, reflecting average glycemia over ~2–3 months [^115fjCzy].

- **Linear relationship**: The ADAG study [^111ALYeP] established a strong linear relationship between A1c and average glucose (eAG).

- **ADAG equation**: eAG (mg/dL) = 28.7 × A1c − 46.7 (eAG (mmol/L) = 1.59 × A1c − 2.59) [^113mtm7X].

- **Correlation**: The correlation coefficient (r) is ~0.84–0.92, indicating strong agreement between A1c and average glucose [^115616qV].

## Conversion table: A1c to average glucose

| **A1c (%)** | **Eag (mg/dl)** | **Eag (mmol/l)** |
|-|-|-|
| 5.0 | 97 | 5.4 |
| 6.0 | 126 | 7.0 |
| 7.0 | 154 | 8.6 |
| 8.0 | 183 | 10.2 |
| 9.0 | 212 | 11.8 |
| 10.0 | 240 | 13.4 |

---

These values are derived from the **ADAG study** [^111ALYeP] and are widely used in clinical practice [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications of the relationship

- **Glycemic control assessment**: A1c is the gold standard for assessing long-term glycemic control and guiding therapy adjustments [^111Cy3rP].

- **Risk of complications**: Higher A1c levels are associated with increased risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications [^111Pfq11].

- **Individualized targets**: A1c targets should be individualized based on patient characteristics, comorbidities, and risk factors [^114UCmQQ].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Individual variability**: There is interindividual variability in the relationship between A1c and average glucose, influenced by factors such as age, ethnicity, and medical conditions [^1144AW1A].

- **Assay limitations**: Certain conditions (e.g. anemia, hemoglobinopathies) can affect A1c accuracy [^114mu8U3].

- **Complementary monitoring**: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) provide additional insights into glycemic variability and hypoglycemia [^115fjCzy].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

The **ADA recommends** using A1c to assess glycemic control, with individualized targets based on patient characteristics [^114UCmQQ]. The **AACE advises** using CGM and SMBG alongside A1c for comprehensive assessment, especially in patients with variability or hypoglycemia risk [^notfound].

---

The relationship between average glucose and A1c is **strong and linear**, enabling reliable estimation of average glucose from A1c [^115616qV]. Clinicians should consider individual variability and use complementary monitoring methods to optimize glycemic control [^115fjCzy].

### Longitudinal changes in the relationship between hemoglobin A1c and glucose tolerance across pregnancy and postpartum [^1171cBVp]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To characterize the relationship between hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels and glucose tolerance across pregnancy and postpartum.

Design and Participants

In a longitudinal study of pregnant women with gestational diabetes risk factors (N = 102), we performed oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) and HbA1c measurements at 10–15 weeks of gestation, 24–30 weeks of gestation (N = 73), and 6–24 weeks postpartum (N = 42). Complete blood counts were obtained from clinical records. We calculated HbA1c-estimated average glucose levels and compared them with mean OGTT glucose levels (average of fasting, 1- and 2-hour glucose levels). Linear mixed effects models were used to test for longitudinal changes in measurements.

Results

Mean OGTT glucose increased between 10–15 and 24–30 weeks of gestation (β = 8.1 mg/dL, P = .001), while HbA1c decreased during the same time period (β = -0.13%, P < .001). At 10–15 weeks of gestation and postpartum the discrepancy between mean OGTT glucose and HbA1c-estimated average glucose was minimal (mean [standard deviation]: 1.2 [20.5] mg/dL and 0.16 [18.1] mg/dL). At 24–30 weeks of gestation, the discrepancy widened (13.2 [17.9] mg/dL, β = 12.7 mg/dL, P < .001, compared to 10–15 weeks of gestation, with mean OGTT glucose being higher than HbA1c-estimated average glucose). Lower hemoglobin at 24–30 weeks of gestation was associated with a greater discrepancy (β = 6.4 mg/dL per 1 g/dL lower hemoglobin, P = .03 in an age- and gestational age-adjusted linear regression model).

Conclusions

HbA1c accurately reflects glycemia in the 1st trimester, but underestimates glucose intolerance in the late 2nd trimester. Lower hemoglobin level is associated with greater underestimation. Accounting for gestational age and maternal hemoglobin may improve the clinical interpretation of HbA1c levels during pregnancy.

### The correlation of hemoglobin A1c to blood glucose [^114js3PP]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2009). Low credibility.

The understanding that hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) represents the average blood glucose level of patients over the previous 120 days underlies the current management of diabetes. Even in making such a statement, we speak of "average blood glucose" as though "blood glucose" were itself a simple idea. When we consider all the blood glucose forms-arterial versus venous versus capillary, whole blood versus serum versus fluoride-preserved plasma, fasting versus nonfasting-we can start to see that this is not a simple issue. Nevertheless, it seems as though HbA1c correlates to any single glucose measurement. Having more than one measurement and taking those measurements in the preceding month improves the correlation further. In particular, by having glucose measurements that reflect both the relatively lower overnight glucose levels and measurements that reflect the postprandial peaks improves not only our ability to manage diabetes patients, but also our understanding of how HbA1c levels are determined. Modern continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices may take thousands of glucose results over a week. Several studies have shown that CGM glucose averages account for the vast proportion of the variation of HbA1c. The ability to relate HbA1c to average glucose may become a popular method for reporting HbA1c, eliminating current concerns regarding differences in HbA1c standardization. Hemoglobin A1c expressed as an average glucose may be more understandable to patients and improve not only their understanding, but also their ability to improve their diabetes management.

4.1.3 Limitations of

Clinical states associated with altered rates of hemoglobin turnover or erythrocyte survival will affect HbA1c measurements and therefore clinical utility (Table 1). As HbA1c directly reflects average glucose levels, highly variable glucose levels with fluctuating hypo‐ and hyperglycemia can result in the same HbA1c measurement as an individual with stable glucose levels. This is important as glycemic variability predicts severe hypoglycemia, and there is a growing body of evidence that glycemic variability is an independent risk factor for short ‐ and long‐term complications. Arguably, CGM, by virtue of providing metrics for both average glucose, glucose out of target range and glycemic variability, as well as having a very high correlation with HbA1c, provides a better reflection of overall glycemia. CGM offers an alternative proxy for HbA1c [the Glucose Management Index (GMI)], however, there is some discordance between GMI and laboratory HbA1c, and hence, the term "estimated" HbA1c should be avoided. Evidence supports the association of diabetes complications and CGM derived measures, particularly time in range. However as widespread CGM uptake has been a more recent phenomenon, it will take time for large registry data to definitively connect CGM metrics with the development of micro‐ and macrovascular complications. However, where CGM data are not available, evaluation of fructosamine and/or 1,5‐anhydroglucitol (1,5‐AG) may be the only alternative when HbA1c is not truly reflective of glycemia (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Clinical states affecting erythrocyte turnover and their effects on HbA1c

Fructosamine is the generic term for plasma protein ketoamines or 1‐amino‐1‐deoxy‐D‐fructose, and more specifically is the measurement of the total stable irreversible serum glycated proteins at any given time. The half‐life of serum proteins is significantly shorter than that of erythrocytes, and the degree of glycation is therefore more reflective of shorter‐term alterations in plasma glucose concentrations that is estimated to be 2–3 weeks, which is consistent with the half‐life of albumin (20 days) which comprises 80% of total serum proteins.1,5‐AG has been proposed in the assessment of glycemic variability. Low 1,5‐AG values are indicative of both high circulating plasma glucose concentration, as well as fluctuations in plasma glucose concentrations (hyperglycemic excursions). 1,5‐AG concentration reflects plasma glucose concentrations over the preceding 2–14 days.

4.2 Continuous glucose monitoring

### Translating the A1c assay into estimated average glucose values [^116yZmRu]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

The ADAG study has a few limitations. In contrast to our intention and expectation, some ethnic/racial groups were underrepresented, primarily because of the withdrawal of one of the centers with a large Asian population and a limited number of subjects of African descent. In addition, the average glucose estimation was based predominantly on two methods: CGM and intermittent self-monitoring of capillary glucose. (The Hemocue measurements, recognized as providing values that are equivalent to laboratory measurements, were used primarily to calibrate the CGM.) To combine these measurements into a single calculated AG, the CGM and fingerstick capillary measurements had to be weighted to take into account the different number of measurements in a day; however, in separate analyses comparing the relationships between A1C and AG measured with CGM or fingerstick capillary measurements, there was no significant difference in the relationships. Finally, since only diabetic patients in stable control and without any suggestion of erythrocyte disorders were entered into the study, the current results are only directly applicable to this population. Children and pregnant women were also excluded; additional data in these groups are needed to confirm the established relationship. Of note, a recently published study compared the calculated mean glucose of 47 children with type 1 diabetes between the ages of 4 and 18 years who had at least one 24-h period of CGM in 6 of 13 weeks with the A1C at the end of the 13-week period. Although the authors also concluded that "A1C directly reflects mean glucose over time", they found substantially greater inter-individual variation in the relationship between AG and A1C than present in the current study. The potential sources of this variability can be identified by comparing the DirectNet study in children with ADAG and with the recent study in adults who were selected for stable glycemic control and performed CGM for 97% of the 12-week study period. The DirectNet study used a noncentralized A1C method with relatively poor correlation with a high-performance liquid chromatography method. Moreover, the children had highly variable glycemia and only performed CGM for 67% of the study period; this may have failed to accurately capture mean glycemia.

The current results support the reporting of the measured A1C as eAG. The interpretation of the A1C, analogous to reporting serum creatinine as a calculated glomerular filtration rate, should provide health care providers with a more useful index of chronic glycemia. A recently published consensus guideline has endorsed reporting A1C values along with the calculated eAG level, assuming that the results of the ADAG were acceptable.

### International expert committee report on the role of the A1c assay in the diagnosis of diabetes [^114mu8U3]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Limitations of A1C as the recommended means of diagnosing diabetes

The A1C assay is the test of choice for the chronic management of diabetes and is now being recommended for its diagnosis; however, there are parts of the world where the costs of providing the assay preclude its routine use. In such circumstances, clinicians should continue to use the previously recommended approaches to diagnose diabetes based on glucose measurements. The International Expert Committee encourages clinicians worldwide to move as quickly as possible to A1C testing using standardized methods and instrumentation. However, the decision to change to A1C assays as the means of diagnosing diabetes should take into account the performance of local A1C assays and the local prevalence of conditions that may interfere with the assay. (See below.)

Although the discussion above argues for using the A1C assay for the diagnosis of diabetes in nonpregnant individuals, there are patient conditions that either will require a specific A1C assay method or will preclude A1C testing. First, some hemoglobin traits, such as HbS, HbC, HbF, and HbE, interfere with some A1C assay methods. Currently, many assay methods can correct for the presence of the most common hemoglobin traits, and affinity assays that are unaffected by hemoglobin traits may be used. Second, any condition that changes red cell turnover, such as hemolytic anemia, chronic malaria, major blood loss, or blood transfusions, will lead to spurious A1C results. Clinicians must be aware of these conditions, particularly in populations in which they are more prevalent. As in the setting where A1C assays are unavailable, the traditional diagnostic tests (e.g. FPG, 2HPG) must be used in individuals in whom interpreting the A1C is problematic. Third, A1C levels appear to increase with age, but the extent of the change, whether it relates to factors other than glucose metabolism, and the effect of the age-related increases on the development of complications are not sufficiently clear to adopt age-specific values in a diagnostic scheme. Similarly, racial disparities in A1C, based on putative differences in the relationship between glucose levels and A1C, have been suggested; however, here too, their etiology and significance are unclear, and it is premature to establish race-specific diagnostic values. Finally, there are rare clinical settings, such as rapidly evolving type 1 diabetes, where the A1C level will not have had time to "catch up" with the acute elevations in glucose levels; however, in these very rare cases, diabetes should be diagnosable with typical symptoms and casual glucose levels > 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) despite a nondiagnostic A1C level.

### Translating the A1c assay into estimated average glucose values [^113mtm7X]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

For measuring the steady-state correlation between AG and A1C, the study was designed to include subjects with relatively stable glycemia. A1C values were generally stable, with 96% of the subjects maintaining A1C within 1 percentage point of their baseline value over the course of the study.

The relationship between the A1C level at the end of the 3-month study period and the calculated AG during the preceding 3 months, expressed as the simple linear regression AG mg/dl = 28.7 × A1C – 46.7 (AG mmol/l = 1.59 × A1C − 2.59), R 2 = 0.84, P < 0.0001, is shown in Fig. 1. The correlation has an SD of prediction error of 15.7 mg/dl (0.87 mmol/l). Based on the model described in the statistical analysis section, the estimated values are as follows: α = −41.4, 95% CI −48.8 to −33.5; β = 27.9, 26.7–29.0; β1 = 4.81, 2.18–15.33; β2 = 2.03, 1.42–2.59. This leads to an estimated error SD of 13.4, 15.7, and 18.0 mg/dl when A1C is 6, 7, and 8%, respectively. The Bayesian model–suggested regression line differs < 2 mg/dl from a simple linear regression line in the A1C range of 4–10%, which includes 98.5% of our samples; the prediction intervals widen (P < 0.05) as A1C values increase to 12%, but the difference between the Bayesian and simple linear regression is still < 5 mg/dl. A Bland-Altman type of analysis examining the difference between the estimated glucose and observed glucose over the range of glucose values is shown in online appendix 2. The 90% prediction limits for the AG, based on the varying SD model, were very close to the preset limits of ± 15% of the predicted mean over the full range of A1C; 89.95% of the samples fell within 15% of the calculated AG.

### Does glucose variability influence the relationship between mean plasma glucose and HbA1c levels in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients? [^116KSvp8]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The A1C-Derived Average Glucose (ADAG) study demonstrated a linear relationship between HbA(1c) and mean plasma glucose (MPG). As glucose variability (GV) may contribute to glycation, we examined the association of several glucose variability indices and the MPG-HbA(1c) relationship.

Research Design and Methods

Analyses included 268 patients with type 1 diabetes and 159 with type 2 diabetes. MPG during 3 months was calculated from 7-point self-monitored plasma glucose and continuous glucose monitoring. We calculated three different measures of GV and used a multiple-step regression model to determine the contribution of the respective GV measures to the MPG-HbA(1c) relationship.

Results

GV, as reflected by SD and continuous overlapping net glycemic action, had a significant effect on the MPG-HbA(1c) relationship in type 1 diabetic patients so that high GV led to a higher HbA(1c) level for the same MPG. In type 1 diabetes, the impact of confounding and effect modification of a low versus high SD at an MPG level of 160 mg/dL on the HbA(1c) level is 7.02 vs. 7.43 and 6.96 vs. 7.41. All GV measures showed the same tendency.

Conclusions

In only type 1 diabetic patients, GV shows a significant interaction with MPG in the association with HbA(1c). This effect is more pronounced at higher HbA(1c) levels. However, the impact of GV on the HbA(1c) level in type 1 diabetes is modest, particularly when HbA(1c) is close to the treatment target of 7%.

### Monitoring glycemic control: the importance of self-monitoring of blood glucose [^113DERQS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Several methods, each with differing utility and limitations, exist for monitoring glycemic control. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is considered the standard measure of long-term glycemic control, and HbA1c levels are strongly associated with complications of diabetes. However, HbA1c does not provide "real-time" information about individual hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic excursions. Urine glucose testing is noninvasive and inexpensive, but it is dependent on the patient's individual renal threshold and can only detect glucose concentrations above this threshold. As such, urine testing cannot be recommended for diabetes management that aims for near-normoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) complements HbA1c by providing real-time blood glucose data. It is an educational tool for both patients and their healthcare providers to understand the effects of diet, exercise, and medications on day-to-day glycemic control. However, guidelines from various international diabetes organizations vary in their level of specificity regarding the frequency and timing of self-monitoring. SMBG should be implemented for all patients as part of an overall diabetes management plan that includes specific instruction on how, when, and why to test.

### The glucose management indicator: time to change course? [^113jBQBd]. Diabetes Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Laboratory measurement of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) has, for decades, been the standard approach to monitoring glucose control in people with diabetes. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is a revolutionary technology that can also aid in the monitoring of glucose control. However, there is uncertainty in how best to use CGM technology and its resulting data to improve control of glucose and prevent complications of diabetes. The glucose management indicator, or GMI, is an equation used to estimate HbA1c based on CGM mean glucose. GMI was originally proposed to simplify and aid in the interpretation of CGM data and is now provided on all standard summary reports (i.e., average glucose profiles) produced by different CGM manufacturers. This Perspective demonstrates that GMI performs poorly as an estimate of HbA1c and suggests that GMI is a concept that has outlived its usefulness, and it argues that it is preferable to use CGM mean glucose rather than converting glucose to GMI or an estimate of HbA1c. Leaving mean glucose in its raw form is simple and reinforces that glucose and HbA1c are distinct. To reduce patient and provider confusion and optimize glycemic management, mean CGM glucose, not GMI, should be used as a complement to laboratory HbA1c testing in patients using CGM systems.

### An analysis of the assessment of glycated hemoglobin using A1cNow + point-of-care device compared to central laboratory testing – an important addition to pharmacist-managed diabetes programs? [^114wRshm]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2008). Low credibility.

The diabetes epidemic is accelerating rapidly. If no progress is made in early detection, then early intervention and treatment-to-goal diabetes care will become an overwhelming burden on our health care system. Better utilization of self-monitoring of blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes not on insulin could be achieved with regular review of hemoglobin A1c (A1C) values. Educating patients about the importance of diet, exercise, and medication compliance is enhanced when evidence of average blood glucose control can be presented to the patient directly. Affordable, accurate point-of-care testing of A1C with A1cNow+ (Bayer HealthCare, Terrytown, NY) utilized in pharmacist-managed outpatient diabetes programs may prove to be an important clinical tool for improving patient outcomes and reducing the cost of the expanding diabetes epidemic.

### Translating the A1c assay into estimated average glucose values [^115xCu1c]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

The A1C assay is widely accepted and used as the most reliable means of assessing chronic glycemia. Its close association with risk for long-term complications, established in epidemiologic studies and clinical trials, has lead to the establishment of specific A1C targets for diabetes care with the goal of preventing or delaying the development of long-term complications (,–). Diabetes treatment is adjusted based on the A1C results, expressed as the percentage of hemoglobin that is glycated. The vast majority of assays have been standardized worldwide, through the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program, to the assay used in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), which established the relationship between A1C levels and risk for long-term diabetes complications.

A new, more stable and specific method of standardization of the A1C assay, which is not intended for use in routine assays, has been developed and proposed to be used for global standardization by the International Federation of Clinical Chemists. However, the new method results in values that are 1.5–2.0 percentage points lower than current National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program values, potentially causing confusion for patients and health care providers. Moreover, the International Federation of Clinical Chemists results would be expressed in new units (millimoles per mole), which would add to the confusion. Chronic glycemia (A1C) is usually expressed as a percentage of hemoglobin that is glycated, whereas the day-to-day monitoring and therapy of diabetes are based on acute glucose levels expressed as milligrams per deciliter or millimoles per liter. This discrepancy has always been problematic. If we could reliably report chronic metabolic control and long-term management goals as average glucose (AG), i.e. in the same units of measurement as acute glycemia, it would eliminate these potential sources of confusion.

The relationship between A1C and chronic glycemia has been explored in several studies that have supported the association of A1C with AG levels over the preceding 5–12 weeks. However, the older studies have been limited, including relatively small homogeneous cohorts of patients, usually with type 1 diabetes. Moreover, almost all of the prior studies have relied on infrequent measures of capillary glucose levels, calling into question the validity of their assessment of chronic glycemia. We performed an international multicenter study to examine the relationship between average glucose, assessed as completely as possible with a combination of continuous glucose monitoring and frequent fingerstick capillary glucose testing, and A1C levels over time to estimate the relationship between the two.

### Associations between features of glucose exposure and A1c: the A1c-derived average glucose (ADAG) study [^116quyXS]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

Our study shows that no single blood glucose measurement during the day accurately predicts A1C. This is in accordance with previous studies showing that single or limited numbers of blood glucose measurements daily do not accurately reflect A1C levels. However, any insights into the specific timed glucose measurement or combination of measurements that have the largest effect on A1C can help patients and clinicians to plan optimal glucose-monitoring regimens.

Levels of FBG alone were not clear indicators of overall hyperglycemia. The correlation coefficients to indexes of hyperglycemia and average or postprandial blood glucose levels are between 0.60 and 0.70 in the present study. This adds to previous findings showing that A1C and postchallenge blood glucose are difficult to predict from FBG values alone. Bouma et al. found a correlation coefficient of 0.77 between A1C and FBG in 1,020 individuals with type 2 diabetes.

This study is based on frequent glucose monitoring during real-life activities in a large, heterogeneous population of people with diabetes and those without diabetes and provides the opportunity to assess reliably the different features of glycemia. The limitations of the study are that the ADAG study population was selected to exclude patients with severe renal/liver disease, pregnancy, and anemia. Therefore, the results may not be extrapolated to all patients with diabetes. However, patients were chosen to span a large range of A1C levels. Moreover, the ADAG study recruited a broad multicenter population, so we feel it is justifiable to draw general conclusions from our results.

The fact that participants had stable A1C (< 1% A1C change 6 months prior to study) could have lead to underestimation of glucose variability. However, high levels of glucose variability were seen among our subjects despite stable A1C levels. Even though type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes have different glucose patterns due to different disease mechanisms, the mechanism of hemoglobin glycation is likely to be the same. The correlation of the glycemic indexes were therefore calculated for the combined group. Limitations of the MiniMed CGM system include the inability to measure glucose values < 2.2 mmol/l (40 mg/dl) or > 22.2 mmol/l (400 mg/dl) (measurements outside this range were treated as 2.2 or 22.2 mmol/l, respectively, for the analyses). The mean FBG is derived from prebreakfast measurements and thus can contain blood glucose not preceded by 8 h of fasting.

### Relationship of A1c to glucose concentrations in children with type 1 diabetes: assessments by high-frequency glucose determinations by sensors [^113NdfjU]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Despite the standing of A1C as the most validated and widely used measure for average glycemic control over time, the relationship between A1C and glucose concentrations is not completely understood. The purpose of this Diabetes Research in Children Network (DirecNet) study was to use continuous glucose monitoring data to examine the relationship between A1C and glucose in type 1 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

Forty-eight youth enrolled in studies of the Navigator continuous glucose monitor were encouraged to wear the Navigator sensor at home continuously. A1C was measured at baseline, at 3 months, and at 6 months. Sensor glucose data were directly transmitted via the Internet, assuring that essentially all glucose values were analyzed.

Results

Subjects had a median of 112 h/week of Navigator data in the first 3 months and 115 h/week in the second 3 months. The slope of mean glucose over the previous 3 months versus A1C was only 18 mg/dl per 1.0% A1C. Individually, there was substantial variation in the relationship between mean glucose and A1C. A1C was not associated with glucose lability after controlling for mean glucose. Measures of an individual's rate of glycation were moderately correlated at the 3- and 6-month visits.

Conclusions

As the chemistry of glycation would predict, we found no evidence to contradict the simple hypothesis that A1C directly reflects mean glucose over time. There is, however, substantial variability in individual mean glucose concentrations for a given A1C. Transforming reliable A1C values into calculated mean glucose values would, when applied to an individual, introduce substantial error.

### The clinical use of hemoglobin A1c [^113c9PEV]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2009). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) has been accepted as an index of glycemic control since the mid-1970s and is the best marker for diabetic microvascular complications. Clinically, it is now used to assess glycemic control in people with diabetes. Assays are most reliable when certified by the National Hemoglobin Standardization Program but are subject to confounders and effect modifiers, particularly in the setting of hematologic abnormalities. Other measures of chronic glycemic control-fructosamine and 1,5-anhydroglucitol-are far less widely used. The relationship of HbA1c to average blood glucose was intensively studied recently, and it has been proposed that this conversion can be used to report an "estimated average glucose, eAG" in milligrams/deciliter or millimolar units rather than as per cent glycated hemoglobin. Finally, HbA1c has been proposed as a useful method of screening for and diagnosing diabetes.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^114AQYxP]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus — HbA1c assay and interpretation considerations state: "HbA1c assays should be based on the NGSP reference standard. Clinicians should obtain information regarding the coefficient of variation (CV) from the methodology used at their site". The "HbA1c range reflects an 'HbA1c average goal' over time" and "Intensification or relaxation of therapy should be undertaken based on individual clinical circumstances and treatment options". The guideline adds, "We discourage medication changes in response to a single HbA1c test that falls slightly outside target ranges, especially if it is discordant with self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) results". It notes "African Americans, on average, have HbA1c levels about 0.4% higher than Whites", and "The VA/DoD DM CPG does not recommend the use of estimated average glucose derived from HbA1c levels".

### HbA1c and mean glucose derived from short-term continuous glucose monitoring assessment do not correlate in patients with HbA1c > 8 [^114CFSYe]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Optimum therapy for patients with diabetes depends on both acute and long-term changes in plasma glucose, generally assessed by glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. However, the correlation between HbA1c and circulating glucose has not been fully determined. Therefore, we carefully examined this correlation when glucose levels were assessed by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).

Methods

Fifty-one patients (70% female, 30% male) were examined; among them were 28 with type 1 diabetes and 23 with type 2 diabetes. Clinically determined HbA1c levels were compared with blood glucose determined by CGM during a short time period.

Results

Changes in HbA1c levels up to 8.0% showed a clear and statistically strong correlation (R = 0.6713; P < .0001) with mean blood glucose levels measured by CGM, similar to that observed in the A1c-derived Average Glucose study in which patients were monitored for a longer period. However, we found no statistical correlation (R = 0.0498; p = 0.83) between HbA1c and CGM-assessed glucose levels in our patient population when HbA1c was > 8.0%.

Conclusion

Short-term CGM appears to be a good clinical indicator of long-term glucose control (HbA1c levels); however, cautions should be taken while interpreting CGM data from patients with HbA1c levels > 8.0%. Over- or underestimation of the actual mean glucose from CGM data could potentially increase the risks of inappropriate treatment. As such, our results indicate that a more accurate analysis of CGM data might be useful to adequately tailor clinical treatments.

### Tests of glycemia for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^11117rvm]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

This paper discusses tests of glycemia for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, with particular reference to the 1997 diagnostic criteria of the American Diabetes Association. The potential benefits of the lower diagnostic threshold for fasting plasma glucose are not well defined. However, the change in the diagnostic cut-off for diabetes mellitus affects as many as 1.9 million persons in the United States; therefore, the medical and social costs of the lower threshold may be considerable. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is defined by a threshold imposed on the continuous distribution of glycemic levels, typically with respect to risk for microvascular complications. However, the burden of type 2 diabetes relates more to macrovascular than microvascular complications. Because no clear threshold exists for macrovascular complications, a formal balancing of direct and indirect costs with both microvascular and macrovascular complications may be appropriate to establish glycemic thresholds. Because fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and the oral glucose tolerance test all predict diabetic complications yet test reliability is better for fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c than for the oral glucose tolerance test, we suggest an alternative diagnostic approach: If random plasma glucose is elevated (≥ 11.1 mmol/L [200 mg/dL]) and the hemoglobin A1c level is more than 2 SDs above the laboratory mean, then diabetes mellitus should be diagnosed, and management should be based on the hemoglobin A1c level. If the result of only one of these tests is positive, then fasting plasma glucose should be tested to evaluate the patient for impaired fasting glucose and diabetes mellitus. The glycemic threshold for type 2 diabetes should be established by cost-effectiveness analysis. The clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus could be streamlined by incorporation of hemoglobin A1c into established criteria.

### Is there a relationship between mean blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin? [^115Rn9Vv]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2011). Low credibility.

Measurement of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is considered the gold standard for monitoring chronic glycemia of diabetes patients. Hemoglobin A1c indicates an average of blood glucose levels over the past 3 months. Its close association with the risk for the development of long-term complications is well established. However, HbA1c does not inform patients about blood glucose values on a daily basis; therefore, frequent measurements of blood glucose levels are necessary for the day-to-day management of diabetes. Clinicians understand what HbA1c means and how it relates to glucose, but this is not the case with patients. Therefore, the translation of the HbA1c results into something more familiar to patients seemed a necessity. The scope of this article is to review the literature to search for enough scientific evidence to support the idea of a close relationship between HbA1c and mean blood glucose (MBG), and to justify the translation of HbA1c into something that reflects the MBG. Most studies confirm a close relationship between HbA1c and MBG, although different studies result in different linear equations. Factors affecting this relationship may limit the usefulness and applicability of a unique mathematical equation to all diabetes populations.

### Translating the A1c assay into estimated average glucose values [^111ALYeP]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

The A1C assay, expressed as the percent of hemoglobin that is glycated, measures chronic glycemia and is widely used to judge the adequacy of diabetes treatment and adjust therapy. Day-to-day management is guided by self-monitoring of capillary glucose concentrations (milligrams per deciliter or millimoles per liter). We sought to define the mathematical relationship between A1C and average glucose (AG) levels and determine whether A1C could be expressed and reported as AG in the same units as used in self-monitoring.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

A total of 507 subjects, including 268 patients with type 1 diabetes, 159 with type 2 diabetes, and 80 nondiabetic subjects from 10 international centers, was included in the analyses. A1C levels obtained at the end of 3 months and measured in a central laboratory were compared with the AG levels during the previous 3 months. AG was calculated by combining weighted results from at least 2 days of continuous glucose monitoring performed four times, with seven-point daily self-monitoring of capillary (fingerstick) glucose performed at least 3 days per week.

RESULTS

Approximately 2,700 glucose values were obtained by each subject during 3 months. Linear regression analysis between the A1C and AG values provided the tightest correlations (AG mg/dl = 28.7 × A1C − 46.7, R 2 = 0.84, P < 0.0001), allowing calculation of an estimated average glucose (eAG) for A1C values. The linear regression equations did not differ significantly across subgroups based on age, sex, diabetes type, race/ethnicity, or smoking status.

CONCLUSIONS

A1C levels can be expressed as eAG for most patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

### Elevated A1c in adults without a history of diabetes in the U.S [^1146F9Wo]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

It is unclear why nondiabetic non-Hispanic blacks have consistently higher A1C values even in the setting of normal fasting glucose levels and after adjustment for demographic and clinical characteristics. Further research should be conducted to determine whether this disparity stems from racial differences in postprandial glycemia or from racial differences in the tendency of hemoglobin to undergo glycosylation.

This study has several strengths including the large, nationally representative sample of healthy, nondiabetic individuals. We benefited from the rigorous measurement of risk factors using standardized protocols and strict quality control data collection and laboratory procedures in NHANES. Important limitations include the cross-sectional design, which limits our conclusions regarding the temporality of the observed associations. In addition, we had only a single measurement of fasting glucose. The American Diabetes Association recommends repeating an elevated fasting glucose measurement to confirm the diagnosis of diabetes. The use of a single measurement of fasting glucose rather than two will overestimate the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes. Nonetheless, interpretation of single measurements of fasting glucose and A1C as analyzed in this study reflects a common clinical decision-making setting. Although we cannot rule out the possibility of laboratory differences over time, calibration of A1C to account for the change in laboratories in 2005–2006 using a published equation did not appreciably alter our results. The lack of OGTT data in the fasting glucose subsample for all survey years is an important limitation of this study. Nonetheless, similar results were obtained in multivariable models using the OGTT measurements in the subgroup from the 2005–2006 NHANES.

To date, the diagnostic utility of A1C has largely been assessed by its accuracy (as measured by its sensitivity and specificity) to detect glucose-defined cases of diabetes. The concordance of A1C with fasting glucose is important and, as confirmed by our data, an A1C ≥ 6.5% is specific for the detection of undiagnosed diabetes defined by a single fasting glucose level. Thus, it seems reasonable to adopt a single elevated A1C value as being diagnostic for diabetes. However, the real test of utility for A1C as a screening or diagnostic test of diabetes is its association with long-term clinical outcomes in an initially nondiabetic population specifically in comparison with fasting glucose levels. To address this question we need large, observational studies of A1C in populations of individuals without diabetes.

### A1c versus glucose testing: a comparison [^117DDoTr]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

The source of the blood is another variable. Although not a substantial problem in the fasting state, capillary glucose concentrations can be 20–25% higher (mean of 30 mg/dL) than venous glucose during an OGTT. This finding has practical implications for the OGTT, particularly because the WHO deems capillary blood samples acceptable for the diagnosis of diabetes.

Analytical variation

Glucose is measured in central laboratories almost exclusively using enzymatic methods, predominantly with glucose oxidase or hexokinase. The following terms are important for understanding measurement: accuracy indicates how close a single measurement is to the "true value" and precision (or repeatability) refers to the closeness of agreement of repeated measurements under the same conditions. Precision is usually expressed as CV; methods with low CV have high precision. Numerous improvements in glucose measurement have produced low within-laboratory imprecision (CV < 2.5%). Thus, the analytical variability is considerably less than the biological variability, which is up to 8.3%. Nevertheless, accuracy of measurement remains a problem. There is no program to standardize results among different instruments and different laboratories. Bias (deviation of the result from the true value) and variation among different lots of calibrators can reduce the accuracy of glucose results. (A calibrator is a material of known concentration that is used to adjust a measurement procedure.) A comparison of serum glucose measurements (target value 98.5 mg/dL) was performed among ∼6,000 laboratories using 32 different instruments. Analysis revealed statistically significant differences in bias among clinical laboratory instruments, with biases ranging from −6 to +7 mg/dL (−6 to +7%) at a glucose concentration of 100 mg/dL. These considerable differences among laboratories can result in the potential misclassification of > 12% of patients. Similarly, inspection of a College of American Pathologists (CAP) survey comprising > 5,000 laboratories revealed that one-third of the time the results among instruments for an individual measurement could range between 141 and 162 mg/dL. This variation of 6.9% above or below the mean reveals that one-third of the time the glucose results on a single patient sample measured in two different laboratories could differ by 14%.

### Associations between features of glucose exposure and A1c: the A1c-derived average glucose (ADAG) study [^116PHnD6]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

As expected, A1C correlated well with average blood glucose from CGM, SMBG, and the two combined. When exploring the contribution of glucose levels from SMBG at different times of the day to average glycemia (Table 3), the preprandial glucose levels had a larger effect on A1C than postprandial glucose levels, presumably because they resemble the 24-h glucose levels (and thus the long-term exposure to glucose) more closely. This result was the same before and after including the nocturnal blood glucose index to the regression model, which, surprisingly, only lead to a small increase in the proportion of A1C variation explained.

The frequently cited article by Monnier et al. concludes that postprandial glucose levels are the dominant contributor to A1C levels in patients with A1C < 8.5%, while fasting glucose levels were the major contributor for patients with A1C > 8.5%. The calculations underpinning this conclusion were based on AUCs derived from meal-period measurements only, thus disregarding the contribution of glucose exposure outside meal periods to A1C.

Monnier et al. define postprandial glycemia as the AUC above each individual's fasting value, while preprandial glycemia is defined as the AUC between 6.1 mmol/l (110 mg/dl) and measured FBG for each individual. This approach introduces a bias when comparing the association between these two indexes and A1C. Individuals with A1C levels > 8.5% will strongly tend to also have high FBG. Their postprandial AUC values will therefore be small by artifact, as only excursions above these high individual FBG values are considered postprandial glucose exposure. Simultaneously, Monnier et al.'s definition yields larger preprandial AUCs in this same group, thus introducing the reported effect. This methodological problem might explain why Monnier et al.'s results differ from our findings and those of others.

### Estimated average glucose and self-monitored mean blood glucose are discordant estimates of glycemic control [^115UTu6y]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The A1C-Derived Average Glucose (ADAG) study recommended translating A1C into estimated average glucose (eAG) equivalents for monitoring glycemic control. Controversy persists over the underlying assumption that A1C levels depend exclusively on long-term previous blood glucose concentration. A number of studies have shown that biological variation in A1C is influenced by factors other than blood glucose concentration. This suggests that eAG may be a systematically biased estimate of self-monitored mean blood glucose (MBG).

### Relationship between average glucose levels and HbA1c differs across racial groups: a substudy of the GRADE randomized trial [^116C9TmM]. Diabetes Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether the relationship between average glucose (AG) levels and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) differs across racial/ethnic groups.

Research Design and Methods

We performed a prospective substudy of GRADE, a comparative effectiveness randomized trial conducted in 36 centers in the U.S. A total of 1,454 of the 5,047 participants in the GRADE cohort, including 534 non-Hispanic White (NHW), 389 non-Hispanic Black (NHB), and 327 Hispanic White patients and 204 patients of other racial/ethnic backgrounds, were included in the substudy. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) performed for 10 days was used to calculate AG10. Immediately after CGM, HbA1c and glycated albumin were measured. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glucose area under the curve (AUC) were derived from a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test.

Results

The relationship between AG10 and HbA1c was significantly different for NHB compared with NHW patients and those of other racial/ethnic groups. HbA1c levels were 0.2–0.6 percentage points higher in NHB than in NHW patients for AG10 levels from 100 to 250 mg/dL. For an HbA1c of 7%, AG10 was 11 mg/dL higher for NHW than for NHB patients. Similar findings were observed across races for relationships of FPG and AUC with HbA1c and for glucose measurements with glycated albumin levels. Differences in the relationship between AG10 and HbA1c across racial groups remained after adjustments for any demographic or other differences between racial/ethnic subgroups.

Conclusions

The relationship between several measures of glucose with HbA1c and glycated albumin consistently differed across races. These findings should be considered in setting treatment goals and diagnostic levels.

### Fasting plasma glucose concentrations for specified HbA1c goals in Korean populations: data from the fifth Korea national health and nutrition examination survey (KNHANES V-2, 2011) [^1176sKUF]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

To examine the correlation between the fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c levels using regression equation and to assess the average fasting plasma glucose levels for the specific HbA1c (A1C) goals in the patients with diabetes using each A1C-and fasting plasma glucose-based diagnostic criteria.

Methods

This study included data from 4481 participants with A1C and fasting plasma glucose, but with no diabetic medications in the Korean National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey 2011. The correlation between fasting plasma glucose and A1C was examined using linear regression models.

Results

The A1C levels corresponding to the fasting plasma glucose of 5.5 and 7 mmol/L were 5.75 and 6.42%. However, in the subjects with diabetes diagnosed by the A1C criteria only, 5.5 and 7 mmol/L in the fasting plasma glucose predicted A1C of 6.49 and 7.14% respectively. The average fasting plasma glucose levels to achieve specified A1C levels of 5.0–5.9, 6.0–6.9, 7.0–7.9, 8.0–8.9, and 9.0–9.9% were 5.1, 6.1, 7.7, 8.8 and 11.2 mmol/L, respectively.

Conclusions

The association between A1C and fasting plasma glucose levels is in concordance with the existing criteria for diagnosis of diabetes. However, the average fasting plasma glucose concentrations to achieve targeted A1C may be lower than those in western populations.

### Epidemiologic relationships between A1c and all-cause mortality during a median 3.4-year follow-up of glycemic treatment in the ACCORD trial [^1155qcKK]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Randomized treatment comparing an intensive glycemic treatment strategy with a standard strategy in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial was ended early because of an unexpected excess of mortality in the intensive arm. As part of ongoing post hoc analyses of potential mechanisms for this finding, we explored whether on-treatment A1C itself had an independent relationship with mortality.

Research Design and Methods

Participants with type 2 diabetes (n = 10,251 with mean age 62 years, median duration of diabetes 10 years, and median A1C 8.1%) were randomly assigned to treatment strategies targeting either A1C < 6.0% (intensive) or A1C 7.0–7.9% (standard). Data obtained during 3.4 (median) years of follow-up before cessation of intensive treatment were analyzed using several multivariable models.

Results

Various characteristics of the participants and the study sites at baseline had significant associations with the risk of mortality. Before and after adjustment for these covariates, a higher average on-treatment A1C was a stronger predictor of mortality than the A1C for the last interval of follow-up or the decrease of A1C in the first year. Higher average A1C was associated with greater risk of death. The risk of death with the intensive strategy increased approximately linearly from 6–9% A1C and appeared to be greater with the intensive than with the standard strategy only when average A1C was > 7%.

Conclusions

These analyses implicate factors associated with persisting higher A1C levels, rather than low A1C per se, as likely contributors to the increased mortality risk associated with the intensive glycemic treatment strategy in ACCORD.

### Translating the A1c assay into estimated average glucose values [^113JYHGG]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Linear regression of A1C at the end of month 3 and calculated AG during the preceding 3 months. Calculated AG mg/dl = 28.7 × A1C − 46.7 (AG mmol = 1.59 × A1C − 2.59) (R 2 = 0.84, P < 0.0001).

The translation of A1C to estimated AG (eAG) based on the linear regression is shown in Table 2, for conventional and SI units, and with the 95% prediction limits. Of note, the regression equation for A1C and AG using only the CGM results to calculate AG was AG CGM = 28.0 × A1C − 36.9 (R 2 = 0.82, P < 0.0001); the regression using only the seven-point fingerstick profiles to calculate AG was AG 7-POINT = 29.1 × A1C − 50.7 (R 2 = 0.82, P < 0.0001). The difference in the regressions was not statistically significant for slope and intercept combined (P = 0.11).

Table 2
Estimated average glucose

The relationship between A1C and AG was the same when only the diabetic subjects were included (linear regression eAG = 28.3 × A1C − 43.9 [R 2 = 0.79, P < 0.0001]) as that for the whole cohort. A comparison of the regression equations within the specified subgroups is shown in Table 3. There were no significant differences in the slope or intercept for the regression equations for any of the subgroup comparisons, and the SDs of the prediction error were all close to the 15.7 mg/dl (0.87 mmol/l) value for the entire study cohort.

### A1c: recommendations, debates, and questions [^113EwVhw]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The dilemma is the high interpatient variability of hemoglobin glycation, which is quite different from the high degree of tracking of mean blood glucose with A1C for each individual studied at multiple levels of glycemia. A related phenomenon of greater variability in groups of diabetic patients, but much stronger correlation within individuals, has been shown in the relationship between A1C and fructosamine. This phenomenon of variable degrees of hemoglobin glycation is well demonstrated in the DCCT 1-day, seven-sample capillary glucose versus A1C database of some 250,000 blood glucose and 72,000 A1C values, where participants could be divided into high, medium, and low glycators. Although studies of CGM might be expected to be more accurate, analysis of a pediatric population showed that while there was a strong correlation of A1C with mean glucose in the group, the use of A1C to estimate mean glucose in individuals would lead to error. Although the ADAG study group, as Nathan discussed, did find strong correlation between A1C and average glucose based either on self-monitored capillary glucose or CGM analysis and although this study was hailed editorially as "a key reference regarding the relationship between A1C and average glucose", I explained some important features of the study design that could bias it to overly support the relationship. Subjects with hemoglobinopathy, anemia, reticulocytosis, blood loss, and chronic renal or liver disease or those receiving high-dose vitamin C, transfusion, or erythropoietin treatment were excluded. Furthermore, of those entering the study, 23% subsequently were deleted from analysis for conditions that might increase the discordance between A1C and glycemia. Representation of a variety of ethnic groups was limited. Precisely those subjects most important for clinicians to identify, then, were not included. Furthermore, there were limited data for subjects with average glucose > 10 mmol/l. I speculated that the discrepancy between A1C and mean glucose might be clinically detrimental, potentially explaining the treatment effect on mortality in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study, because "high glycators" might, if assigned to a treatment protocol dictating additional medication for A1C regardless of glycemia, develop hypoglycemia with consequent adverse outcome. In a recent case report, a "low glycator" was allowed to have substantially poorer actual glycemic control than would be desirable because of misleadingly "good" levels of A1C.

### Estimated average glucose and self-monitored mean blood glucose are discordant estimates of glycemic control [^112KYKtz]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

The A1C-Derived Average Glucose study recommended reporting A1C in estimated average glucose (eAG) equivalents. We compared eAG with self-monitored mean blood glucose (MBG) to determine whether eAG is systematically biased due to biological variation in the relationship between MBG and A1C.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

MBG and A1C were recorded from charts of 202 pediatric type 1 diabetic patients at 1,612 clinic visits. Patients were divided into groups with low, moderate, or high A1C bias based on a hemoglobin glycation index (HGI).

RESULTS

The mean ± SD values for MBG versus eAG were as follows: total population, 194 ± 34 vs. 196 ± 36 mg/dl; low-HGI group, 186 ± 31 vs. 163 ± 20 mg/dl; moderate-HGI group, 195 ± 28 vs. 193 ± 19 mg/dl; and high-HGI group, 199 ± 42 vs. 230 ± 31 mg/dl.

CONCLUSIONS

eAG underestimated MBG in low HGI patients and overestimated MBG in high HGI patients. Disagreement between eAG and MBG downloaded from patient glucose meters will cause confusion if eAG is implemented for clinical use.

### Glycemic goals and hypoglycemia: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^115616qV]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Correlation between A1C and glucose monitoring (ADAG) — Table 6.1 provides rough equivalents of A1C and mean glucose levels based on the International A1C-Derived Average Glucose (ADAG) study, which assessed the correlation between A1C and frequent BGM and CGM in 507 adults (83% non-Hispanic White). The American Diabetes Association and the American Association for Clinical Chemistry determined that the correlation (r = 0.92) in the ADAG trial is strong enough to justify reporting both the A1C result and the estimated average glucose (eAG) when a clinician orders the A1C test, and clinicians should note that the mean plasma glucose numbers in Table 6.1 are based on ~2,700 glucose measurements using intensive capillary BGM and capillary glucose, intermittently, during a 3-month period.

### Diabetes treatment and measures of glycemia [^111Gek3V]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

A1C versus glucose

My colleagues and I have recently commented on various aspects of the imperfect overlap between A1C and other measures of glycemia. Choi et al. (abstract 401) pooled data from 621 insulin-treated type 2 diabetic individuals to analyze the relationship between A1C and capillary glucose, finding that among the 235 with a fasting A1C < 7%, mean 2-h postmeal glucose levels were < 100 and 140 mg/dl in 19 and 42%, respectively, while among the 95 with fasting glucose < 100 mg/dl, 46% had A1C < 7%. They concluded that A1C and fasting and postmeal glucose "provide distinct information that should be used together to assess individual patients and optimize insulin therapy". In a study of 88 type 1 diabetic individuals followed for 90 days, Dunn et al. (abstract 414) analyzed the relationships of mean capillary and FreeStyle Navigator CGM, comprising 33,464 and 752,571 observations, with A1C at the end of the observation period. For every 1% increase in A1C, mean capillary and CGM glucose levels increased by 19.0 and 20.5 mg/dl, with squared correlation coefficients of 0.38 and 0.52, respectively. The modest degree to which the variance in glucose is explained by A1C suggested to the authors "that individual differences in rates of protein glycation at a given blood glucose concentration may be an important factor when addressing glycemic control". Pani et al. (abstract 927) analyzed the relationships between age and A1C in 5,743 individuals and found that A1C increased by 0.10–0.14% per decade, with mean A1C increasing 0.5% from age < 40 to > 70 years among those with normal glucose tolerance. The authors wondered whether "current [A1C] goals may be too stringent for older subjects with diabetes". Ziemer et al. (abstract 983) measured A1C in 1,434 individuals having random, fasting, and 1- and 2-h post–75-g oral glucose determinations. After adjustment for age, sex, and glucose levels, A1C levels were 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4% higher in blacks than in whites with normal glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose or glucose tolerance, or diabetes, respectively; ethnicity and, presumably, a number of other factors, are thus important in interpreting A1C levels. A1C is certainly, of course, an important clinical measure. Kilpatrick et al. (abstract 817) analyzed data from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial and found that for every 1% increase in the SD for A1C there were 54 and 42% increases in development or progression of retinopathy and nephropathy, respectively, suggesting that those with intermittent periods of greater hyperglycemia had a worse outcome than those with stable glycemic control.

### Associations between features of glucose exposure and A1c: the A1c-derived average glucose (ADAG) study [^114vv7qx]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

Calculated indexes of glycemia.

Indexes of glucose variability and postprandial glucose levels were calculated from the glucose monitoring data. The average blood glucose and SD were calculated based on CGM data and the seven-point SMBG (LifeScan) data. A combined average blood glucose was calculated from CGM and SMBG, weighted by the days of monitoring for each. Indexes based on CGM were calculated after exclusion of the initial 2 h of monitoring, which is considered to be an unstable calibration period.

Two indexes of intraday glucose variability were calculated based on CGM: the mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) and the continuous overlapping net glycemic action (CONGA). MAGE is the mean of the differences between consecutive peaks and nadirs, only including changes of > 1 SD of glycemic values and thus capturing only major fluctuations. For the calculation of CONGA n, the difference of the current observation and the observation n hours previously is calculated for each observation after the first n hours. The CONGA n is the SD of these differences. We analyzed CONGA for 1, 2, and 4 h. Both high MAGE and CONGA values indicate high intraday glucose variability.

As an indicator of overall hyperglycemia, the 24-h cumulative exposure to glucose levels above different thresholds was calculated as the area under the curve (AUC) of CGM above levels of 7.0, 11.1, and 16.7 mmol/l (or 126, 200, and 300 mg/dl, respectively). This was done for the first 24 h of each CGM period after the initial calibration period. Indexes of nocturnal blood glucose were calculated as the mean blood glucose from the CGM period 6 h prior to the fasting blood glucose (FBG) measurement. Furthermore, for each individual, a mean of all 3:00SMBGs (HemoCue) was calculated. Also from CGM, a postprandial AUC (AUC pp) was calculated for periods of 2 or 4 h after a meal (without blood glucose thresholds), and the postprandial increment was calculated from the preprandial glucose level to the highest peak for periods of 2 or 4 h after a meal. Finally, pre- and postprandial measurements from SMBG (HemoCue) were used to calculate mean pre- and postprandial blood glucose, as well as pre- and postbreakfast, lunch, and dinner values. The prebreakfast blood glucose was used as the FBG.

### The fallacy of average: how using hbAAlone to assess glycemic control can Be misleading [^115YR1aV]. Diabetes Care (2017). Low credibility.

HbA 1c is a v aluable metric for comparing treatment groups in a randomized trial, for assessing glycemic trends in a population over time, or for cross-sectional comparisons of glycemic control in different populations. However, what is not widely appreciated is that HbA1cmay not be a good indicator of an individual patient's glycemic control because of the wide range of mean glucose concentrations and glucose profiles that can be associated with a given HbA1clevel. To illustrate this point, we plotted mean glucose measured with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) versus central laboratory-measured HbA1cin 387 participants in three randomized trials, showing that not infrequently HbA1cmay underestimate or overestimate mean glucose, sometimes substantially. Thus, if HbA1cis to be used to assess glycemic control, it is imperative to know the patient's actual mean glucose to understand how well HbA1cis an indicator of the patient's glycemic control. With knowledge of the mean glucose, an estimated HbA1c(eA1C) can be calculated with the formula provided in this article to compare with the measured HbA1c. Estimating glycemic control from HbA1calone is in essence applying a population average to an individual, which can be misleading. Thus, a patient's CGM glucose profile has considerable value for optimizing his or her diabetes management. In this era of personalized, precision medicine, there are few better examples with respect to the fallacy of applying a population average to a specific patient rather than using specific information about the patient to determine the optimal approach to treatment.

### Glycemic goals and hypoglycemia: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114UCmQQ]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Individualizing glycemic goals — glycemic goals and pharmacologic management should be individualized and not one size fits all, and glycemic goals should be individualized in the context of shared decision-making to address individual needs and preferences; more aggressive goals may be recommended if they can be achieved safely and with an acceptable burden of therapy and if life expectancy is sufficient to reap the benefits of stringent goals; less stringent goals, such as A1C up to 8% [64 mmol/mol], may be recommended when the benefits of an intensive goal may not be realized or when the risks and burdens outweigh the potential benefits.

### Redefining the diagnosis of diabetes using glycated hemoglobin [^114R3ZDQ]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The worldwide epidemic of type 2 diabetes continues unabated. Despite extensive efforts to educate providers, patients, and even the public at large as to the advantages of early identification and treatment to prevent complications, a large number of patients remain undiagnosed. A serious barrier to an enhanced detection of diabetes has been inadequate screening using tests somewhat inconvenient to patients and clinicians and therefore often not optimally implemented. In this issue of Diabetes Care, a joint American Diabetes Association, International Diabetes Federation, and European Association for the Study of Diabetes International Expert Committee examines diagnostic testing for diabetes, specifically, the role of A1C, and makes significant new recommendations. While this report has not yet been endorsed as a guideline by either of the associations (or other organizations), it does represent a step in that direction and thus deserves attention.

Clearly, no clinical diagnostic test is perfect. However, to be clinically useful, a test must be accurate, specific, standardized (or easily standardizable), handy, and, ideally, inexpensive. While plasma glucose testing meets some of these criteria, its use has been dogged by the need to obtain a sample in the fasting state (most people attend their outpatient visits in the fed state) or under standard carbohydrate challenge conditions, i.e. the oral glucose tolerance test. There also continues to be a degree of uncertainty concerning the diagnostic performance of fasting glucose testing versus that of the oral glucose tolerance test — the latter done rarely in clinical practice for obvious reasons: inconvenience and cost. In addition, considerable variability not only in 2-h postglucose load values but also in fasting glucose has been a problem. Appropriately, clinicians have long wondered why they cannot use another diagnostic index, such as A1C, an inherently attractive option because it recapitulates long-term ambient glycemia as opposed to a single point in time. With the recent introduction of the standardized global assay for the measurement of A1C, greater accuracy and precision than achieved with plasma glucose have been predicated. The overall edge of A1C over plasma glucose is accurately summarized in Table 1 of the International Expert Committee's report.

### Associations between features of glucose exposure and A1c: the A1c-derived average glucose (ADAG) study [^112iC8MT]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

Statistical analyses.

The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was computed for each pair of glycemic indexes. This was done including only the diabetic population, as the measurements from nondiabetic participants inflate the correlations. Scatterplots of all pairs are presented with an indicator of the Pearson correlation coefficient (r).

A1C was modeled by multiple linear regression using SMBG measurements at different times of the day as explanatory variables. The association to A1C was examined in three separate analyses, including glucose before and after main meals, mean of all pre- and postmeal glucose measures, and adding nocturnal (3:00) SMBG. These models were fitted for all individuals with diabetes and separately for type 1 and type 2 diabetes treated with and without insulin. We defined the proportion of A1C variation (SD) explained by each model as the difference between the A1C SD for each subgroup and the residual SD of the model divided by the SD.

### Implications of using hemoglobin A1c for diagnosing diabetes mellitus [^114HbEug]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Until 2010, the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was based solely on glucose concentration, but the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommendations now include a new criterion: hemoglobin A1C ≥ 6.5%. Because this change may have significant implications for diabetes diagnosis, we conducted a comprehensive literature review including peer-reviewed articles not referenced in the ADA report. We conclude that A1C and plasma glucose tests are frequently discordant for diagnosing diabetes. A1C ≥ 6.5% identifies fewer individuals as having diabetes than glucose-based criteria. Convenience of A1C test might increase the number of patients diagnosed, but this is unproven. Diagnostic cut-points for both glucose and A1C are based on consensus judgments regarding optimal sensitivity and specificity for the complications of hyperglycemia. A1C may not accurately reflect levels of glycemia in some situations, but in comparison with glucose measurements, it has greater analytic stability and less temporal variability. When choosing a diagnostic test for diabetes, the limitations of each choice must be understood. Clinical judgment and consideration of patient preference are required to appropriately select among the diagnostic alternatives.

### Translating the A1c assay [^114UYwyT]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

The A1C-diabetes story then shifted from clinical chemistry to clinical medicine. Koenig et al. were the first to show that A1C levels correlated well with fasting blood glucose, and they concluded that A1C levels "probably reflect… the mean daily blood glucose concentration… and may provide a better index of control of the diabetic patient". Indeed, soon after their report, many other investigators confirmed a strong association between A1C and glycemic control and that the measurement had clinical utility, clearly surpassing in utility what was then the conventional assessment of metabolic control over time (e.g. signs, symptoms, urine, and blood glucose levels).

The thorough biochemical experiments performed in the 1970s and 1980s, most notably by Mortensen and Christophersen, demonstrated that the fraction of A1C in a sample depends on the glucose levels over a previous period, along with red cell turnover, reaching a steady state sometime between 4 and 12 weeks. Such kinetics were supported by many clinical studies in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients where the A1C level was found to correlate well with glucose regulation or the mean blood glucose derived over time from multiple fingersticks (,–).

As the use of the A1C test gained traction, dozens of different analytical methods based on different assay principles (e.g. ion-exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, immunoassay, and electrophoresis) were used to measure glycated hemoglobin. Without a common reference method and in the absence of a standardized assay, results varied considerably when the same sample was tested by different laboratories or methods or even when the same sample was tested repeatedly by one methodology. It was quite common, for example, to have values ranging from 4.0 to 8.1% on the same blood sample. In addition, the assays used then (and even now) in clinical medicine not only measured A1C itself but also more or lesser amounts of the other glycated hemoglobin components, and results were reported as A1C, HbA 1, or total glycated hemoglobin. The results were also influenced by other interfering substances in the sample.

### Diabetes and employment [^115GuBY4]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

A1C and estimated average glucose.

Hemoglobin A1C (A1C) test results reflect average glycemia over several months and correlate with mean plasma glucose levels. Estimated average glucose (eAG) is directly related to A1C and also provides an individual with an estimate of average blood glucose over a period of time, but it uses the same values and units that are observed when using a glucose meter or recording a fasting glucose value on a lab report. A1C/eAG values provide health care providers with important information about the effectiveness of an individual's treatment regimen but are often misused in assessing whether an individual can safely perform a job. Because they identify only averages and not whether the person had severe extreme blood glucose readings, A1C/eAG results are of no value in predicting short-term complications of diabetes and thus have no use in evaluating individuals in employment situations.

The American Diabetes Association recommends that in most patients A1C levels be kept below 7%, or eAG below 154 mg/dL. This recommendation sets a target in order to lessen the chances of long-term complications of high blood glucose levels but does not provide useful information on whether the individual is at significant risk for hypoglycemia or suboptimal job performance and is not a measure of "compliance" with therapy. An A1C or eAG cut off score is not medically justified in employment evaluations and should never be a determinative factor in employment.

"Uncontrolled" or "brittle" diabetes.

Sometimes an individual's diabetes is described as "uncontrolled", "poorly controlled", or "brittle". These terms are not well defined and are not relevant to job evaluations. As such, giving an opinion on the level of "control" an individual has over diabetes is not the same as assessing whether that individual is qualified to perform a particular job and can do so safely. Such an individual assessment is the only relevant evaluation.

### A1c versus glucose testing: a comparison [^111M7sDX]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO VARIATION IN RESULTS

Before addressing glucose and A1C, it is important to consider the factors that impact the results of any blood test. While laboratory medicine journals have devoted some discussion to the sources of variability in results of blood tests, this topic has received little attention in the clinical literature. Factors that contribute to variation can conveniently be divided into three categories, namely biological, preanalytical, and analytical. Biological variation comprises both differences within a single person (termed intraindividual) and between two or more people (termed interindividual). Preanalytical issues pertain to the specimen before it is measured. Analytical differences result from the measurement procedure itself. The influence of these factors on both glucose and A1C results will be addressed in more detail below.

### A1c: recommendations, debates, and questions [^114qb4Fc]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

I concluded that A1C certainly reflects the phenomenon of hemoglobin glycation being proportional to mean glycemia and that the measurement is, of course, useful in understanding the glycemic exposure of subjects with diabetes, but that one should not expect all subjects to glycate hemoglobin to the same degree for a given level of glycemia, suggesting that it will be important to develop and validate new approaches to understanding glycemic exposure of subjects with diabetes. Any highly homogeneous population will be likely to show higher correlation between A1C and average glucose than is seen in the overall population of diabetic patients treated in clinical practice. Alternative A1C-derived indexes that include age, ethnicity, anemia, and renal function might, in fact, make A1C more useful and more clinically relevant. I further commented that these considerations call into question our current reliance on A1C as a "goal" and certainly lead one to be circumspect in recommending that it be used alone in diagnosis of diabetes in divergent populations, of varying age and ethnicity, and with underlying medical conditions affecting erythrocytes. Furthermore, these arguments suggest that glycemic self-monitoring of diabetic subjects not requiring insulin treatment would be likely to add considerably to A1C measurement in endeavoring to optimize the control of their diabetes.

Sacks reviewed the correlation of A1C with average glucose and suggested that laboratory information systems can be used to perform a variety of calculations, such as the estimated glomerular filtration rate. In a CAP survey of ∼3,000 laboratories in April 2009, 16.7% reported eAG, with 28.8% using the equation derived from the ADAG study, 22.6% using an equation derived from the DCCT A1C versus glucose dataset, and the remainder using other equations. He noted that the AACC recommendations in January 2009 "call on all labs in the U.S. to report eAG along with A1C" and suggested this to be reasonable for three reasons: first, because "healthcare providers find it useful", second, because the "ADA believes eAG facilitates communication", and, third, because its use is strongly supported by diabetes educators. He did not show information in support of these views.

### Hemoglobin A1c and mean glucose in patients with type 1 diabetes: analysis of data from the juvenile diabetes research foundation continuous glucose monitoring randomized trial [^116MZuJQ]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the relationship between mean sensor glucose concentrations and hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) values measured in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications laboratory at the University of Minnesota in a cohort of subjects with type 1 diabetes from the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation continuous glucose monitoring randomized trial.

Research Design and Methods

Near-continuous glucose sensor data (≥ 4 days/week) were collected for 3 months before a central laboratory-measured HbA(1c) was performed for 252 subjects aged 8–74 years, the majority of whom had stable HbA(1c) values (77% within ± 0.4% of the patient mean).

Results

The slope (95% CI) for mean sensor glucose concentration (area under the curve) versus a centrally measured HbA(1c) was 24.4 mg/dL (22.0–26.7) for each 1% change in HbA(1c), with an intercept of -16.2 mg/dL (-32.9 to 0.6). Although the slope did not vary with age or sex, there was substantial individual variability, with mean sensor glucose concentrations ranging from 128 to 187 mg/dL for an HbA(1c) of 6.9–7.1%. The root mean square of the errors between the actual mean sensor glucose concentration versus the value calculated using the regression equation was 14.3 mg/dL, whereas the median absolute difference was 10.1 mg/dL.

Conclusions

There is substantial individual variability between the measured versus calculated mean glucose concentrations. Consequently, estimated average glucose concentrations calculated from measured HbA(1c) values should be used with caution.

### Translating the A1c assay [^115JQG8m]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

In the ADAG study, the differences between various ethnic groups were not statistically significant. However, the study was not adequately powered to detect such differences and, in one group, the differences came close to being significant. Although other reports have shown an association between ethnicity and A1C at similar levels of glycemia, in all the studies, glucose measurements were very infrequent, the populations studied were not controlled for hemoglobinopathy, and there were no measures of the rate of glycation as it relates to ethnicity. Clearly, this is an area that needs further investigation.

It is important to note that the ADAG investigators attempted to study patients with "stable" glycemia — predefined as a change in A1C of < 1% during the study — and all but 4% were stable as so defined. It is not surprising that some change would occur, particularly since patients were doing considerably more self-monitoring than in real life. However, a 1% change with a baseline of 11% has implications different from those associated with a similar change at 7%. However, the investigators quite rightly chose the end-of-study A1C to relate to estimated average glucose (eAG); therefore, clinicians can have confidence that the average glucose reflects antecedent glycemia over a 3-month period.

### Glycemic goals and hypoglycemia: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^115fjCzy]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

A1C-based glycemic assessment — In people with diabetes, A1C reflects average glycemia over approximately 2–3 months, and measurement approximately every 3 months is used to determine whether glycemic goals have been reached and maintained. A1C does not provide a measure of glycemic variability or hypoglycemia, and for individuals prone to glycemic variability (especially type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes with insulin deficiency and/or intensive insulin therapy) glycemic status is best evaluated by the combination of results from blood glucose monitoring (BGM) or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and A1C, because discordant results between A1C and BGM or CGM can occur due to high glycemic variability, inaccurate BGM or CGM measurement, or inaccurate A1C.

### Associations between features of glucose exposure and A1c: the A1c-derived average glucose (ADAG) study [^112YoZjB]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

Various methods are used to quantify postprandial glycemia or glucose variability, but few have been compared and none are standardized. Our objective was to examine the relationship among common indexes of postprandial glycemia, overall hyperglycemia, glucose variability, and A1C using detailed glucose measures obtained during everyday life and to study which blood glucose values of the day provide the strongest prediction of A1C.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

In the A1C-Derived Average Glucose (ADAG) study, glucose levels were monitored in 507 participants (268 type 1 diabetic, 159 type 2 diabetic, and 80 nondiabetic subjects) with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) during 16 weeks. We calculated several indexes of glycemia and analyzed their intercorrelations. The association between glucose measurements at different times of the day (pre- and postprandial) and A1C was examined using multiple linear regression.

RESULTS

Indexes of glucose variability showed strong intercorrelation. Among postprandial indexes, the area under the glucose curve calculated from CGM 2 h after a meal correlated well with the 90-min SMBG postprandial measurements. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels were only moderately correlated with indexes of hyperglycemia and average or postprandial glucose levels. Indexes derived with SMBG strongly correlated with those from CGM. Some SMBG time points had a stronger association with A1C than others. Overall, preprandial glucose values had a stronger association with A1C than postprandial values for both diabetes types, particularly for type 2 diabetes.

CONCLUSIONS

Indexes of glucose variability and average and postprandial glycemia intercorrelate strongly within each category. Variability indexes are weakly correlated with the other categories, indicating that these measures convey different information. FBG is not a clear indicator of general glycemia. Preprandial glucose values have a larger impact on A1C levels than postprandial values.

### Relationship between A1c and glucose levels in the general Dutch population: the new hoorn study [^115BKC1E]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Fasting glucose levels and glucose levels 2 h after a glucose tolerance test (postload glucose levels) are used for diagnosis and management of diabetes. In addition, the A1C level is used to monitor glycemia in patients with diabetes because it has less day-to-day variability than glucose levels and is thought to reflect chronic glycemia.

In 2007, a consensus statement reported on the worldwide standardization of the A1C measurement. One of the conclusions was that glycemic goals in clinical practice should be expressed in three types of units, one of which is the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine standardized method. Use of this method implies that the unit of measurement of A1C will change from a percentage to millimoles per mole. The introduction of this new unit of measurement may be confusing for patients and health care providers. Therefore, the A1C-Derived Average Glucose (ADAG) Study Group investigated whether A1C can be translated into average blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes. A major advantage of using the average glucose level for chronic glycemia is that it has the same unit of measurement (millimoles per liter) as that for acute glycemia. The ADAG Study Group concluded that the average glucose level was strongly correlated with A1C and that the translation of A1C into average glucose levels was therefore possible. Moreover, Saudek et al. recommended 1) the use of an A1C level of ≥ 6.0% as a screening standard for the detection of individuals at high risk of developing diabetes, 2) an A1C level of ≥ 6.5% confirmed by a glucose test (fasting or oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT]) for the diagnosis of diabetes, and 3) A1C levels of ≥ 7.0% measured twice or confirmed by a glucose test for the diagnosis of diabetes. During the review process for the present article, a consensus statement from an International Expert Committee that recommended the use of A1C levels ≥ 6.5% for the diagnosis of diabetes instead of glucose measures was published. A1C levels between 6.0 and 6.5% are proposed to identify individuals at high risk of developing diabetes. It may, however, be questioned whether A1C is a good indicator of glucose in individuals with normal or moderately elevated glucose levels and whether it can therefore be used to identify those with intermediate hyperglycemia or undiagnosed diabetes. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the relationship between glucose and A1C in the general population and to evaluate the use of A1C for the screening and diagnosis of diabetes.

### A1c versus glucose testing: a comparison [^1143QmbE]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

PERSPECTIVE

Notwithstanding the use of glucose (FPG and/or the OGTT) as the "gold standard" for the diagnosis of diabetes for many years, glucose testing suffers from several deficiencies. The requirement that the subject be fasting at the time the blood is drawn is a considerable inconvenience. While our ability to measure glucose has improved, inherent biological variability can produce very large differences within and among individuals. In conjunction with lack of sample stability, which is difficult to overcome in clinical practice, these factors results in lack of reproducibility of glucose testing.

A1C, which reflects chronic blood glucose values, is routinely used in monitoring glycemic control and guiding therapy. The significant reduction in microvascular complications with lower A1C and the absence of sample lability, combined with several other advantages (Table 3), have led to the recommendation by some organizations that A1C be used for screening and diagnosis of diabetes. Accumulating evidence suggests that racial differences in A1C values may be present, and the possible clinical significance of this needs to be determined. Importantly, A1C cannot be measured in certain conditions. Despite these caveats, A1C can be measured accurately in the vast majority of people. A comprehension of the factors that influence A1C values and the conditions where it should not be used will produce accurate and clinically meaningful results. The convenience of sampling at any time without regard to food ingestion makes it likely that measurement of A1C will result in the detection of many of the millions of people with diabetes who are currently undiagnosed.

### Hyperglycemia and adverse pregnancy outcome (HAPO) study: associations of maternal A1c and glucose with pregnancy outcomes [^111UkgGa]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

We cannot determine why, with adjustment for glucose measures, A1C is associated with some pregnancy outcomes but not others. A1C reflects average glycemia over an interval of several preceding weeks. Since A1C was associated with cesarean delivery, preeclampsia, and preterm delivery, it might be speculated that risks of these outcomes are influenced by glycemia earlier in pregnancy, whereas anthropometric outcomes are more strongly associated with glycemia later in pregnancy.

Our findings are consistent with the new IADPSG recommendations. These findings, based on its associations with pregnancy outcomes with adjustment for glucose, suggest that measurement of A1C is not a useful alternative to an OGTT in pregnant women. Furthermore, the generally stronger associations between a single measure of glucose at an average of 28 weeks' gestation with pregnancy outcome than the associations of A1C with the same outcomes counter the concerns about basing the diagnosis of GDM on a single abnormal glucose measurement performed on only one occasion.

### A view beyond HbA1c: role of continuous glucose monitoring [^115Y2NRj]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) is used as an index of average blood glucose measurement over a period of months and is a mainstay of blood glucose monitoring. This metric is easy to measure and relatively inexpensive to obtain, and it predicts diabetes-related microvascular complications. However, HbA1c provides only an approximate measure of glucose control; it does not address short-term glycemic variability (GV) or hypoglycemic events. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is a tool which helps clinicians and people with diabetes to overcome the limitations of HbA1c in diabetes management. Time spent in the glycemic target range and time spent in hypoglycemia are the main CGM metrics that provide a more personalized approach to diabetes management. Moreover, the glucose management indicator (GMI), which calculates an approximate HbA1c level based on the average CGM-driven glucose level, facilitates individual decision-making when the laboratory-measured HbA1c and estimated HbA1c are discordant. GV, on the other hand, is a measure of swings in blood glucose levels over hours or days and may contribute to diabetes-related complications. In addition, addressing GV is a major challenge during the optimization of glycemia. The degree of GV is associated with the frequency, duration, and severity of the hypoglycemic events. Many factors affect GV in a patient, including lifestyle, diet, the presence of comorbidities, and diabetes therapy. Recent evidence supports the use of some glucose-lowering agents to improve GV, such as the new ultra-long acting insulin analogs, as these agents have a smoother pharmacodynamic profile and improve glycemic control with fewer fluctuations and fewer nocturnal hypoglycemic events. These newer glucose-lowering agents (such as incretin hormones or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors) can also reduce the degree of GV. However, randomized trials are needed to evaluate the effect of GV on important diabetes outcomes. In this review, we discuss the role of HbA1c as a measure of glycemic control and its limitations. We also explore additional glycemic metrics, with a focus on time (duration) in glucose target range, time (duration) in hypoglycemia, GV, GMI, and their correlation with clinical outcomes.

So what does this mean for clinical practice? At the simplest and most basic level, when clinicians explain to patients what A1C "means", they should have greater confidence that the common explanation that has essentially been in effect for decades — "it's your average blood glucose over the last few months" — is true. In addition, knowing one's average glucose level should be beneficial to clinicians and patients in that the measure of long-term glucose control (A1C) can reliably be conveyed in the same units as those provided to patients at the time of diagnosis and the values obtained from patient self-monitoring.

Finally, we have a new opportunity for (re)education on the importance of glycemic control and the seriousness of diabetes. Because the study results fulfilled the a priori criteria, the agreement forged in the consensus statement from the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, International Diabetes Federation, and IFCC will take effect. Thus, we hope that clinicians who order an A1C test will receive a lab report containing the familiar A1C value, an eAG derived from that measurement, and a likely-to-be-ignored IFCC unit (in millimoles per mol). The American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes are planning to begin a comprehensive educational effort on knowing one's average glucose and are publishing a new conversion table in guidelines that is based on the equation derived from the ADAG study.

Patients may still get confused that the "average" glucose on their own meters does not match the eAG. However, this is also an opportunity to educate patients about fluctuations in glucose that may occur at times different from their own testing schedules. In addition, the 95% CIs of eAG for any A1C value imply uncertainty of the "true" mean — and more so at very high A1C levels. But it should be remembered that every point estimate in medicine has uncertainty related to laboratory imprecision and inaccuracy and that this variation is almost always ignored. If necessary, however, these CIs give clinicians an opportunity to present patients a "range" in which their average glucose lies.

Another potential limitation of the study is the specific and careful exclusion of individuals with conditions likely to affect A1C, e.g. hemoglobinopathy. Inadequate recognition of the latter in clinical practice remains a limitation to the interpretation of A1C and will thereby limit the utility of discussing eAG in such patients.

Table 3 — estimates linking %TIR to A1C and estimated average glucose (EAG): The averaged mapping from Beck 2019 and Vigersky 2019 shows 50% %TIR corresponds to A1C 8.1 and EAG 185 mg/dL; 70% %TIR corresponds to A1C 6.9 and EAG 151 mg/dL; and 90% %TIR corresponds to A1C 5.6 and EAG 113 mg/dL. Study-specific rows include Vigersky 2019 — 70% %TIR: A1C 6.7, EAG 147 mg/dL — and Beck 2019 — 70% %TIR: A1C 7.0, EAG 154 mg/dL. The text reinforces that "observation of 70% of time spent in the 70 to 180 mg/dL range was found to be nearly equivalent to an average A1C value of 7.0%".

### Ethnic differences in glycemic markers in patients with type 2 diabetes [^117QBo9G]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Recent studies have reported hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) differences across ethnic groups that could limit its use in clinical practice. The authors of the A1C-Derived Average Glucose study have advocated to report HbA1c in estimated average glucose (AG) equivalents. The aim of this study was to assess the relationships between HbA1c and the mean of three 7-point self-monitored blood glucose (BG) profiles, and to assess whether estimated AG is an accurate measure of glycemia in different ethnic groups.

Research Design and Methods

We evaluated 1,879 participants with type 2 diabetes in the DURABLE trial who were 30 to 80 years of age, from 11 countries, and, according to self-reported ethnic origin, were Caucasian, of African descent (black), Asian, or Hispanic. We performed logistic regression of the relationship between the mean self-monitored BG and HbA1c, and estimated AG, according to ethnic background.

Results

Baseline mean (SD) HbA1c was 9.0% (1.3) (75 [SD, 14] mmol/mol), and mean self-monitored BG was 12.1 mmol/L (3.1) (217 [SD, 55] mg/dL). In the clinically relevant HbA1c range of 7.0–9.0% (53–75 mmol/mol), non-Caucasian ethnic groups had 0.2–0.5% (2–6 mmol/mol) higher HbA1c compared with Caucasians for a given BG level. At the mean self-monitored BG levels ≤ 11.6 mmol/L, estimated AG overestimated the actual average BG; at levels > 11.6 mmol/L, estimated AG underestimated the actual BG levels.

Conclusions

For a given degree of glycemia, HbA1c levels vary among different ethnic groups. Ethnicity needs to be taken into account when using HbA1c to assess glycemic control or to set glycemic targets. Estimated AG is not a reliable marker for mean glycemia and therefore is of limited clinical value.

### Translating the A1c assay [^111wrFq7]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

What emerged was not only the recommendation that DCCT-derived numbers should be maintained if possible but also that an international study should commence to look more closely at the relationship between A1C and mean blood glucose. If the study was "successful", at least we could adopt an A1C-derived unit (e.g. "estimated average glucose" in milligrams per deciliter or millimoles per liter) that would obviate the IFCC objection to having laboratory results expressed as a percentage. This path forward was then ratified in an official consensus statement issued by all four organizations.

The rationale for another study examining the relationship between mean blood glucose and A1C stemmed from the belief that the previously published reports used a variety of measures of glucose concentration, recruited only small numbers of subjects (and mostly those with type 1 diabetes), performed measurements over a relatively short time period, and, most notably, performed relatively infrequent sampling of blood glucose (mostly during the daytime). For example, the often-cited conversion table in the American Diabetes Association Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes — 2007 was based on very limited capillary glucose sampling in the DCCT, and the study was actually not intended to establish the relationship between average glucose and A1C. Thus, greater confidence was needed that A1C truly represents an average glucose.

The results of the international study are now reported and confirm and extend previous findings. The strengths of the study are that it examined the relationship between average glucose and A1C across a wide spectrum of A1C values — from ∼5% to as high as 13% — and in more people than ever before studied. Also, both normal subjects and subjects with type 1 and type 2 diabetes were enrolled in numbers sufficient to conclude that the relationship between the two variables was consistent between these subgroups and also in relation to other important variables (i.e. age, ethnicity, smoking). Finally, the study obtained ∼2,700 glucose measurements in each participant, which is far greater than the number obtained in nearly all previous studies. The results clearly support the hypothesis that there is a strong linear relationship between mean blood glucose and A1C, with a coefficient of correlation (R 2) of 0.84.

### The relationships between time in range, hyperglycemia metrics, and HbA1c [^11124ubq]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

As the use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) increases, there is a need to better understand key metrics of time in range 70–180 mg/dL (TIR 70–180) and hyperglycemia and how they relate to hemoglobin A1c (A1C).

Methods

Analyses were conducted utilizing datasets from four randomized trials encompassing 545 adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who had central-laboratory measurements of A1C. CGM metrics were calculated and compared with each other and A1C cross-sectionally and longitudinally.

Results

Correlations among CGM metrics (TIR 70–180, time > 180 mg/dL, time > 250 mg/dL, mean glucose, area under the curve above 180 mg/dL, high blood glucose index, and time in range 70–140 mg/dL) were typically 0.90 or greater. Correlations of each metric with A1C were lower (absolute values 0.66–0.71 at baseline and 0.73–0.78 at month 6). For a given TIR 70–180 percentage, there was a wide range of possible A1C levels that could be associated with that TIR 70–180 level. On average, a TIR 70–180 of 70% and 50% corresponded with an A1C of approximately 7% and 8%, respectively. There also was considerable spread of change in A1C for a given change in TIR 70–180, and vice versa. An increase in TIR 70–180 of 10% (2.4 hours per day) corresponded to a decrease in A1C of 0.6%, on average.

Conclusions

In T1D, CGM measures reflecting hyperglycemia (including TIR and mean glucose) are highly correlated with each other but only moderately correlated with A1C. For a given TIR or change in TIR there is a wide range of possible corresponding A1C values.

AACE diabetes technology — CGM data sufficiency, the glucose management indicator (GMI), and its relation to A1C are summarized as follows: It has been demonstrated that > 70% use of CGM over the most recent 14 days strongly correlates with 3 months of mean glucose, TIRs, and hypoglycemia metrics. The GMI is a new metric that replaces the estimated A1C and provides an estimate of the A1C based on an average of the CGM glucose levels an individual has been experiencing; Table 2 relates CGM-derived average glucose (mg/dL) to GMI (%) with examples 100→5.7, 150→6.9, 200→8.1, and 300→10.5. In a recent study of 641 individuals with T1D, 11% of participants had discordance between the A1C and the GMI of < 0.1%, although 50% and 22% had differences of ≥ 0.5% and ≥ 1.0%, respectively.

### Translating the A1c assay [^117XSgBY]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

The data from ADAG indicate that at any mean glucose or A1C level, there is some scatter (see Fig. 1 in the ADAG report), thereby conveying a less than perfect correlation. Is that primarily due to measurement error, or does it suggest that an A1C level reflects processes beyond a straightforward time and glucose concentration–dependent glycation of hemoglobin? Addressing this uncertainty would require an even larger study conducted ideally at only one site, with more diverse subjects, uninterrupted continuous glucose monitoring for months at a time, and, most important, a measurement error much lower than currently seen. The report by Nathan et al. in which 24,000 glucose measurements were done on each participant resulted in an R 2 (0.81) and regression equation very similar to that reported in the ADAG study, suggesting that performing more measurements will not in itself improve the correlation.

Thus, we have ∼16–19% of the variation unaccounted for, but given that there is a small measurement error in the determination of A1C (perhaps 2–5%), and a larger coefficient of variation in the measurement of glucose (10–20%), the constraints imposed by methodology can explain the residual variation.

We are unable, of course, to conclude from the study that the relationship holds for all populations. That is, many populations (e.g. Asians, Pacific Islanders, children) were not studied, and it is conceivable that the physiology of glycation differs in such groups, although there is no obvious reason why that would be so. A recent study that showed a relatively poor correlation between average glucose and A1C in children should not raise doubts about the translation of the ADAG study to other populations. In that report, it is unclear whether the A1C values were stable throughout the study and how many glucose measurements were obtained in each participant, and there are doubts regarding the precision and accuracy of the continuous glucose-monitoring system device used and other issues.

### Associations between features of glucose exposure and A1c: the A1c-derived average glucose (ADAG) study [^116qhSgz]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

New treatment regimens and guidelines have increasingly focused on postprandial hyperglycemia as an additional target beyond average glucose control. However, direct evidence for an effect of specifically controlling postprandial glucose (PPG) and glucose excursions (over and above the effect of reducing average glucose levels on long-term diabetes complications) is limited. The current debate about whether postprandial hyperglycemia and excessive glucose variability are associated with an increased risk of diabetes complications is largely based on epidemiological studies. Many of these findings (,–) are based on an extrapolation of glucose levels 2 h after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) as a model for the postprandial state rather than on "real-life" PPG measurements. Only a few studies have also measured the effect of A1C for comparison, and these show conflicting results.

Studies examining PPG control use various methods to quantify PPG, overall hyperglycemia, and glucose variability, without any standardization of methods. One approach to assess the role of PPG has been to examine the extent to which it contributes to overall glucose exposure, measured as A1C. Limited evidence suggests that postprandial glycemia is the dominant contributor to overall hyperglycemia in patients with good to moderate glycemic control (A1C < 8.5%), while fasting glucose levels represent the major contributor at higher A1C levels. These findings have been used to support the need to measure and treat PPG in order to reach clinical guideline levels of A1C. Measures of nocturnal glycemia are rarely used in the prediction of A1C. Available literature exploring the nocturnal glucose exposure is sparse and mostly focused on nocturnal hypoglycemia or assessment of glucose variability during glucose-lowering therapies.

Our aim was to examine the relationship among the most commonly used indexes of PPG, overall hyperglycemia, glucose variability, nocturnal glycemia, and A1C using glucose measures obtained during everyday activities from the A1C-Derived Average Glucose (ADAG) study. Additionally, we studied which blood glucose value(s) of the day provide the strongest prediction of mean blood glucose, as measured by A1C, especially focusing on pre- and postprandial glucose contributions to mean blood glucose levels.

### Translating the A1c assay into estimated average glucose values [^113ry3zY]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

We calculated an arithmetic mean glucose (AG) for each subject by combining the CGM measurement of interstitial glucose levels, corrected by a factor of 1.05 to be equivalent to capillary glucose levels in our study, and the Lifescan fingerstick measurements of capillary glucose. Because glucose levels were measured much more frequently on the CGM days (n ∼ 288 per day) than during the Lifescan days (n ∼ 7), the results were weighted so that each measurement was proportional to the inverse of the total number of measurements taken in the same day. Therefore, equal weight was attached to each day during which glucose levels were measured. Subjects with fewer than 7 days of CGM during the study were excluded from analysis. We applied linear and quadratic regression models to estimate the relationship between A1C and AG. The quadratic model did not provide a significant improvement over the linear regression model (P = 0.82). An exponential model was considered but not used, since the paucity of data in the higher A1C range led to highly variable estimates. Prediction intervals were calculated to represent the range of predicted AG at given A1C levels. To correct for heteroschedasticity, we fit a model where the variance of AG is an increasing function of A1C. As a result, the 90% prediction intervals for AG given A1C is given bywhere n = 507 and α = 0.1, which leads to.

The mathematical details of the Bayesian method are given in online appendix 1, available at.

For the overall study results to be considered acceptable, it was decided a priori that ≥ 90% of the individual patients' calculated AG would have to fall within ± 15% of the study-wide calculated AG.

We examined the influence of factors such as age, sex, race (Caucasian, African or African American, or Hispanic), and smoking history on the relationship between A1C and AG through a multivariate regression model. We compared the slopes and intercepts of the regression equations for the individual subgroups and calculated the SDs of the prediction error for each. Age was divided by tertiles separately for type 1 (< 40, 40–50, > 50 years) and type 2 diabetes (< 50, 50–60, > 60 years).

### Influence of glycemic variables on hemoglobin A1c [^115WRBLw]. Endocrine Practice (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the influences of a wide variety of glucose variables on hemoglobin A1c (A1C).

Methods

The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial database, restricted to volunteers whose 7-point daily capillary glucose profiles were complete in ≥ 80% of quarterly collections and who were in the study for ≥ 4 years, was used for analysis. Regression analyses were done to develop an equation for estimating A1C based on concurrent and prior mean blood glucose (MBG) values. The multivariate coefficient of determination (R2) was calculated for MBG, mean postprandial blood glucose, mean preprandial blood glucose, digestive glycemia, interdigestive glycemia, individual time points of the 7-point glucose profile, range of blood glucose, SD of blood glucose, M-value, and mean amplitude of glycemic excursions in relationship to A1C. By using regression analysis, the correlation between A1C and MBG within each study subject was determined.

Results

The most accurate prediction of A1C was obtained from the concurrent MBG. With use of univariate analysis, all glucose variables correlated significantly with concurrent A1C, the strongest correlation occurring with MBG. In multivariate analysis, the primary predictor of A1C was MBG; all other glucose variables added nothing to the models. Within-subject correlations between MBG and A1C showed considerable variation.

Conclusion

A1C correlates best with MBG derived from 7-point-daily capillary glucose profiles. The influences of glucose measured at specific time points during the day or various measures of glucose variability on A1C are less than that of MBG. Within the limitations of the intermittent glucose determinations, wide variations in the relationship of MBG to A1C among and within patients with type 1 diabetes remain unexplained.

### Associations between features of glucose exposure and A1c: the A1c-derived average glucose (ADAG) study [^115L4ftT]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Various methods are used to quantify postprandial glycemia or glucose variability, but few have been compared and none are standardized. Our objective was to examine the relationship among common indexes of postprandial glycemia, overall hyperglycemia, glucose variability, and A1C using detailed glucose measures obtained during everyday life and to study which blood glucose values of the day provide the strongest prediction of A1C.

Research Design and Methods

In the A1C-Derived Average Glucose (ADAG) study, glucose levels were monitored in 507 participants (268 type 1 diabetic, 159 type 2 diabetic, and 80 nondiabetic subjects) with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) during 16 weeks. We calculated several indexes of glycemia and analyzed their intercorrelations. The association between glucose measurements at different times of the day (pre- and postprandial) and A1C was examined using multiple linear regression.

Results

Indexes of glucose variability showed strong intercorrelation. Among postprandial indexes, the area under the glucose curve calculated from CGM 2 h after a meal correlated well with the 90-min SMBG postprandial measurements. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels were only moderately correlated with indexes of hyperglycemia and average or postprandial glucose levels. Indexes derived with SMBG strongly correlated with those from CGM. Some SMBG time points had a stronger association with A1C than others. Overall, preprandial glucose values had a stronger association with A1C than postprandial values for both diabetes types, particularly for type 2 diabetes.

Conclusions

Indexes of glucose variability and average and postprandial glycemia intercorrelate strongly within each category. Variability indexes are weakly correlated with the other categories, indicating that these measures convey different information. FBG is not a clear indicator of general glycemia. Preprandial glucose values have a larger impact on A1C levels than postprandial values.

### Contributions of basal and postprandial hyperglycemia over a wide range of A1c levels before and after treatment intensification in type 2 diabetes [^112n93cD]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the relative contributions of basal hyperglycemia (BHG) versus postprandial hyperglycemia (PPHG) before and after treatment intensification in patients with glycated hemoglobin A(1c) (A1C) > 7.0% while on prior oral therapy.

Research Design and Methods

Self-measured, plasma-referenced glucose profiles and A1C values were evaluated from participants in six studies comparing systematically titrated insulin glargine with an alternative regimen (adding basal, premixed, or prandial insulin, or increasing oral agents). Hyperglycemic exposure (> 100 mg/dL [5.6 mmol/L]) as a result of BHG versus PPHG was calculated.

Results

On prior oral therapy, 1,699 participants (mean age 59 years, diabetes duration 9 years) had mean fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of 194 mg/dL (10.8 mmol/L), and mean A1C was 8.7%. BHG contributed an average of 76–80% to hyperglycemia over the observed range of baseline A1C levels. Adding basal insulin for 24 or 28 weeks lowered mean FPG to 117 mg/dL (6.5 mmol/L), A1C to 7.0%, and BHG contribution to 32–41%. Alternative regimens reduced FPG to 146 mg/dL (8.1 mmol/L), A1C to 7.1%, and the contribution of BHG to 64–71%. BHG contributions for patients with A1C averaging 7.6–7.7% were 76% at baseline and 34 and 68% after adding basal insulin or other therapies, respectively.

Conclusions

When A1C is > 7.0% despite oral therapy, BHG routinely dominates exposure. Intensified therapy reduces A1C and changes this relationship, but BHG amenable to further intervention still accounts for one-third of total hyperglycemia after basal insulin treatment and two-thirds after alternative methods.

### Translating the A1c assay into estimated average glucose values [^111XYuEL]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Our results strongly support a simple linear relationship between mean glucose and A1C levels in a clinically relevant range of glycemia. Our data fulfilled the a priori quality criterion; i.e. 90% of the estimates fell within the ± 15% range of the regression line. This criterion was considered realistic, allowing for the imprecision of the A1C assay, CGM, and self-monitored blood glucose tests.

The large population allowed us to demonstrate that the relationship between A1C and AG was consistent across prespecified subgroups. The tight relationship and the consistency of the relationship across different subgroups suggest that for many, if not most, patients with diabetes, there are no important factors that affect the relationship between mean glucose levels and A1C. There was a suggestion (P = 0.07) that the regression line was different for African Americans such that for a given value of A1C, African Americans might have a slightly lower mean glucose level. This borderline result requires further study to be confident that there is no relationship between ethnicity and the relationship between mean glucose and A1C. There was also a suggestion that age may affect the relationship between AG and A1C; however, the effect was not monotonic. The regression lines for each age-group crossed at A1C of 7%, with the first and last tertile being similar and the middle tertile being different. We suspect that this is a spurious finding. There are other well-recognized clinical factors, such as anemia and altered erythrocyte turnover, which can affect A1C results measured with all assay methods, and hemoglobinopathies, which interfere with the measurement of A1C with specific methods. Potential subjects with these conditions were excluded from the study.

---

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2010 [^116HzUgf]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The A1C test is subject to certain limitations. Conditions that affect erythrocyte turnover (hemolysis, blood loss) and hemoglobin variants must be considered, particularly when the A1C result does not correlate with the patient's clinical situation. In addition, A1C does not provide a measure of glycemic variability or hypoglycemia. For patients prone to glycemic variability (especially type 1 diabetic patients, or type 2 diabetic patients with severe insulin deficiency), glycemic control is best judged by the combination of results of SMBG testing and the A1C. The A1C may also serve as a check on the accuracy of the patient's meter (or the patient's reported SMBG results) and the adequacy of the SMBG testing schedule.

Table 9 contains the correlation between A1C levels and mean PG levels based on data from the international A1C-Derived Average Glucose (ADAG) trial using frequent SMBG and CGM in 507 adults (83% Caucasian) with type 1, type 2, and no diabetes. ADA and the American Association of Clinical Chemists have determined that the correlation (r = 0.92) is strong enough to justify reporting both an A1C result and an estimated average glucose (eAG) result when a clinician orders the A1C test. In previous versions of the Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, the table describing the correlation between A1C and mean glucose was derived from relatively sparse data (one seven-point profile over 1 day per A1C reading) in the primarily Caucasian type 1 participants in the DCCT. Clinicians should note that the numbers in the table are now different, as they are based on ∼2,800 readings per A1C in the ADAG trial.

Table 9
Correlation of A1C with average glucose

In the ADAG trial, there were no significant differences among racial and ethnic groups in the regression lines between A1C and mean glucose, although there was a trend toward a difference between Africans/African Americans participants and Caucasians that might have been significant had more Africans/African Americans been studied. A recent study comparing A1C to CGM data in 48 type 1 diabetic children found a highly statistically significant correlation between A1C and mean blood glucose, although the correlation (r = 0.7) was significantly lower than in the ADAG trial. Whether there are significant differences in how A1C relates to average glucose in children or in African American patients is an area for further study. For the time being, the question has not led to different recommendations about testing A1C or different interpretations of the clinical meaning of given levels of A1C in those populations.

### Estimated average glucose and self-monitored mean blood glucose are discordant estimates of glycemic control [^113VrGFX]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The ADAG study concluded that A1C could be reliably translated into eAG based on the linear relationship between A1C and mean blood glucose measured by continuous glucose monitoring in a mixed population of diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. This conclusion assumes that all population variation in A1C is either random or due to variation in blood glucose concentration. However, numerous reports of biological variation in A1C indicate that this assumption is false. We previously developed HGI to quantify biological variation in A1C due to factors other than blood glucose concentration and showed that HGI was quantitatively consistent within individuals over time, different between individuals, normally distributed and positively correlated with risk for complications. The fact that many patients have HGI values that are always positive or always negative indicates that HGI measures systematic A1C bias between individuals. The present study clearly demonstrates that this systematic A1C bias makes eAG a systematically biased estimate of MBG downloaded from patient glucose meters in high- and low-HGI patients.

It is important to emphasize that the present study used routine A1C and MBG data typical of that available in most diabetes clinics. If A1C is reported as eAG, patients and clinicians will be confronted with significant discrepancies between eAG and self-monitored MBG, which will confound interpretation of glycemic control. Furthermore, treating patients based on eAG alone could result in inappropriate medical decisions. Based on Fig. 1, if low-HGI patients are intensively managed to a low eAG target, their MBG would presumably remain above the target, inadvertently leaving these patients at unnecessary risk for chronic complications. Conversely, intensive management could drive MBG in high-HGI patients below the eAG target, which presumably would increase their risk for hypoglycemia.

We conclude that translating A1C into eAG produced biased estimates of MBG downloaded from patient glucose meters in low- and high-HGI patients. However, because MBGI (the difference between eAG and MBG) was positively correlated with HGI, eAG derived using the carefully determined ADAG regression equation may have clinical value for assessing biological variation in A1C. Either HGI or MBGI could prove clinically useful for more comprehensive risk assessment and personalized patient care.

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^1123awg6]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Diabetes guidelines and organizations typically advocate a target glycated hemoglobin (A1C) value of 6.5–7.0% but highlight that glycemic management must be individualized. Whereas individualization of both glycemic targets and management is appealing to the clinician as a way of potentially maximizing benefit while minimizing risk, there is little evidence that such an approach will bring more patients to target. It may be argued that this approach could contribute to fewer patients attaining optimal glycemic targets. Nonetheless, the results of recent large outcome trials clearly highlight the fact that individual glycemic target achievement varied markedly, with some patients apparently deriving more clinical benefit and others deriving more harm. At the same time, there is ongoing evidence of a treatment gap in many surveys of clinical practice and a suggestion that algorithm-driven protocols may be more effective. Collectively, therefore, the currently available evidence suggests that algorithm-driven protocols that incorporate individualized targets based on patient characteristics designed to preserve a sound balance between the benefits and risk of good glycemic control may be an appropriate way of getting more patients to target in a safe and effective manner.

### Translating the A1c assay into estimated average glucose values [^115FJ2W5]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The results of the A1c-Derived Average Glucose (ADAG) study support the notion of a close relationship between A1C levels and AG for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The A1C assay plays a central role in the clinical management of diabetes. Treatment goals designed to reduce the development of long-term complications were adopted in the wake of the DCCT, and A1C assay methods have been standardized to the DCCT values in most of the world. A newly developed method of assay calibration, which is more stable and specific, should further improve the comparability of assays worldwide. Since this method measures a well-defined analyte of only one molecular species of glycated hemoglobin, the reference values are lower, compared with the previous DCCT-aligned assays. To avoid confusion and potential deterioration of glycemic control as a result of having to report lower A1C values, the current study set out to determine the relationship between A1C and AG. The ultimate aim was to determine whether the A1C index of chronic glycemia could be reported in the same units as used for day-to-day monitoring.

Previous studies of the relationship between A1C and average glycemia have generally been hampered by limited measurements of glucose values, casting doubt on the reliability of the estimates of AG. CGM provides the opportunity to measure all glucose levels. A recent study that included CGM for 3 months arrived at a relationship between A1C and AG very similar to that presented here, providing external validation, but included only 25 subjects, most of whom had type 1 diabetes. The current study provides a relatively complete assessment of day-to-day glycemia and establishes a strong enough relationship between A1C and AG levels to justify a direct translation from measured A1C to an easier-to-understand value that is in the same units as fingerstick monitoring. Of note, the regression equation in this study provides lower eAG values, compared with the widely used equation derived from the DCCT, and the scatter around the regression line is less wide. The most obvious explanation for the difference between AG calculated from the DCCT and that calculated in the current study is the difference in the frequency of glucose measurements used to calculate AG (a single seven-point profile with no overnight measurements during 3 months in the DCCT compared with numerous CGM and seven-point profile measurements that captured a median of 52 days in ADAG), providing a more complete and representative measure of average glucose in ADAG.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^11683ts9]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Standards of Care in Diabetes-2025 — A1C clinical characteristics note that "A1C has several advantages compared with FPG and OGTT, including greater convenience (fasting is not required), greater preanalytical stability, and fewer day-to-day perturbations during stress, changes in nutrition, or illness", yet there is "lower sensitivity of A1C at the designated cut point compared with an FPG of 126 mg/dL". A1C reflects erythrocyte life span "(~120 days)" yielding a weighted average, and "clinically meaningful changes in A1C can be seen in < 120 days".

### Clinically significant disagreement between mean blood glucose and estimated average glucose in two populations: implications for diabetes management [^112Ka6iA]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is highly correlated with mean blood glucose (MBG) levels and widely used in assessment of diabetes therapy. It has been proposed to report HbA1c in terms of an estimated average glucose (eAG) derived from the population regression of MBG on HbA1c. Pertinent to the clinical utility of eAG would be the degree of agreement between eAG and MBG estimated from multiple sampled glucose measurements over time.

Methods

We examined agreement between eAG and MBG by Bland-Altman analysis from two different populations of type 1 diabetes patients: 150 children at our clinic in New Orleans and publicly available data from 1440 participants in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). In New Orleans, MBG was derived from the mean of each patient's self-monitored glucose records over the 3 months before the HbA1c was obtained at the patient's clinic visit. Hemoglobin A1c was traceable to the DCCT. In DCCT participants, MBG was calculated from the patient's seven-sample glucose profile set submitted during each quarterly visit. Estimated average glucose was calculated from each individual's HbA1c using a previously reported regression equation of MBG versus HbA1c, eAG = (HbA1c * 28.7) - 47.7, derived from a continuous glucose monitoring protocol over a 12-week period.

Results

The analysis showed that there is frequent and clinically significant disagreement between MBG and eAG. Estimated average glucose over or under estimated MBG by 28.7 mg/dl or greater (HbA1c difference of 1% or greater) in approximately 33% of patients from both populations. The eAG overestimation of MBG was highest at lower MBG. The difference between eAG and MBG was skewed upward with increasing mean of eAG and MBG in the DCCT.

Conclusions

Frequent discordance between eAG and MBG in clinical practice will likely be confusing to patients and clinicians. In patients where eAG overestimates MBG, intensive management based on eAG alone will likely lead to greater frequency of hypoglycemic episodes. To overcome these limitations of eAG, a customized assessment of HbA1c with respect to a patient's MBG should be performed using directly monitored patient glucose levels over time.

### Assessment of the relationship between glucose and A1c using kinetic modeling [^1152SAUj]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2006). Low credibility.

Treatment goals for diabetic patients are directed towards lowering A1c values by controlling blood glucose concentrations (BGC), making it important to understand the relationship between the two parameters. Because findings from clinical trials about the relationship between BGC and A1c values show a profound variability around the obtained regression lines, they are difficult to apply to individual patients. Therefore, a model was developed and applied based on the kinetics of HbA1c formation and removal. It takes the instability of A1c and loss of hemoglobin into consideration. Data from clinical studies and hypothetical scenarios were used to test the model and to describe the relationship between A1c and BGC. A close agreement between experimental and calculated data was obtained in steady-state and non-steady-state conditions. Aside the erythrocyte life span, the chemical instability of A1c appears to affect A1c levels markedly and their changes due to therapy. A threefold increase in BGC over 30 days prior to A1c measurement can cause an increase in A1c value of about 120% as compared with 4% when it occurs 4 months prior to A1c measurement. Profound daily fluctuations in BGC result in minor changes in A1c. In conclusion, A1c provides information about a patient's glycemia, mainly over the past 2 months, and may not reflect well daily blood glucose fluctuations. This model might be suitable to identify individual differences in glycation rates.

### Associations between features of glucose exposure and A1c: the A1c-derived average glucose (ADAG) study [^115AET6A]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Based on frequent glucose monitoring during usual daily activities, we found, in a large set of individuals with type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, or those without diabetes, that many of the commonly used indexes of glycemic variability, average glycemia, and postprandial glycemia were strongly correlated within each category. Indexes of glucose variability (CONGA, SD of CGM or SMBG, and MAGE) were especially highly correlated. These findings indicate that the different methods of characterizing glucose variability tend to convey similar information.

The putative roles of glucose variability and PPG as risk factors for diabetes complications are based on 1) studies reporting an association between excessive PPG levels and factors that may lead to development of diabetes complications, 2) epidemiological studies associating 2-h post-OGTT values with increased mortality and cardiovascular disease, and 3) a few clinical trials in very specific subgroups (e.g. pregnant women and individuals with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes post-AMI), which have addressed the issue with different methods and have had conflicting results. The roles of PPG and glucose variability as risk markers need further exploration, and an understanding of the differences and similarities among the different measures of PPG, overall hyperglycemia, and glucose variability is critical.

### Translating "Nondiabetic" A1c levels to clinical practice: the art of medicine [^111Pfq11]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

It is well recognized that there is a significant delay from the time clinical research findings are first reported and when the results become an integral part of clinical care. With the understanding that the prevalence and incidence of diabetes is increasing worldwide, and that the resulting complications are a major contributor to morbidity and mortality, the need for more rapid clinical translation of research findings for diabetes could not be greater.

Specifically, a large amount of clinical research data has been reported in the recent past that is of great interest to the provider caring for individuals with diabetes. Much of the emphasis for research has been devoted to understanding the contribution of hyperglycemia and its treatment on macrovascular disease. For example, within the last decade, we have not only recognized the pivotal role that chronic hyperglycemia, as assessed with A1C levels, contributes to the development of microvascular complications, but we have recognized the importance of glycemia in contributing to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Observations from large-scale prospective trials over the last couple of years have reported that in high-risk subjects, intensive therapy to lower A1C levels below suggested targets may not be beneficial or may increase mortality. However, as observed from these studies, we also learned that certain subsets of patients with type 2 diabetes may actually benefit from intensive glycemic control. The most recent analysis, reported in May 2010, has now suggested that mortality may actually be greater for those who maintain a higher A1C level despite attempts at intensive glycemic management. Interestingly, the excess mortality in the group randomized to intensive glycemic management was only seen at A1C levels greater than 7%. Thus, the findings regarding A1C targets for selected patient populations with type 2 diabetes continue to evolve to this day and remain important data for clinicians.

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^1151qPSn]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Today's guidelines not only generally have the proviso that patients who do not meet the A1C goal be followed every 2–3 months to enable adjustment of the ongoing treatment regimen, but also indicate that clinical judgment should be individually tailored. However, this case-by-case approach may not be the best practice tactic for the vast majority of patients, since the progressive nature of diabetes demands prompt and consistent therapeutic attention.

A well-controlled A1C of < 7.0% with oral monotherapy for up to 3 years is typically achieved by ~50% of type 2 diabetic patients. It has been suggested that this unsatisfactory outcome is partly the consequence of first-line therapy being begun only after A1C reaches levels higher than those at which the expected glucose-lowering from monotherapy could be expected to return glucose control to target levels. This result has been attributed in part to physicians — both specialists and those in primary care — not being well prepared for early interventions and therefore often missing the critical window to launch effective management. Despite poor and worsening A1C, many people are kept on the same medications, thus aggravating their glycemic burden and risking worsening health problems. Interestingly, a recent survey of awareness and attitudes in eight countries found that 51% of patients had never heard of A1C and that > 10% of physicians measured it less than once a year.

Before the recent enhanced focus on more structured guidelines with specific recommended A1C targets, diabetes management with antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy was often inadequate, with appropriate changes in medical regimens implemented only when A1C levels were > 9.0% and/or several months to years after ascertaining that A1C readings were higher than acceptable. As a result of incremental treatment not keeping abreast with degenerating glycemic status (Fig. 2) and most individuals who managed to successfully achieve recommended A1C targets demonstrating an inability to maintain glycemic status, glycemic burden was unnecessarily extended in parallel with a substantial increase in CV risk. For example, Alvarez Guisasola et al. reported that 26% of the 2,025 people that they monitored from seven European countries had an average A1C of 7.2% after 2.6 years of metformin-sulfonylurea or metformin-thiazolidinedione combinations. After 5 years, 20% of the 176 patients with A1C assessments were under control (mean A1C 7.4%), with 30% of this subgroup on insulin, resonating the often-observed temporal decline in glycemic management.

### Hemoglobin A1c and mean glucose in patients with type 1 diabetes: analysis of data from the juvenile diabetes research foundation continuous glucose monitoring randomized trial [^1114rcLt]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Table 1
Mean glucose versus HbA 1c in subgroups

The slope of mean glucose concentration versus HbA 1c value did not vary meaningfully by age, sex, or type of CGM device (Table 1). Although only 42 of the 252 subjects were not insulin pump users, the mode of insulin delivery did not materially alter the slope. Reanalyzing the data using only the 195 subjects whose HbA 1c remained within ± 0.4% of the value obtained 3 months earlier or the 138 subjects whose HbA 1c remained within ± 0.2% did not materially alter the slopes.

Substantial individual variability existed in the relationship between HbA 1c and mean glucose concentration. For HbA 1c values between 6.9 and 7.1% (n = 46), the average sensor mean glucose concentrations ranged from 128 to 187 mg/dL. For HbA 1c values between 7.9 and 8.1% (n = 16), the average sensor mean glucose concentrations ranged from 154 to 223 mg/dL (Fig. 1). The root mean square of the errors between the actual mean sensor glucose concentration versus the value calculated using the regression equation was 14.3 mg/dL, whereas the median absolute difference was 10.1 mg/dL. A total of 91% of subjects had mean glucose concentrations within ± 15% of the calculated average glucose concentrations (calculated from HbA 1c).

### Glycemic goals and hypoglycemia: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^115QjVbY]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

American Diabetes Association glycemic assessment recommendations state to assess glycemic status by A1C and/or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) metrics such as time in range, time above range, and time below range, and that fructosamine or CGM can be used for glycemic monitoring when an alternative to A1C is required. Assess glycemic status at least two times a year, and more frequently (e.g., every 3 months) for individuals not meeting glycemic goals or with recent treatment changes, frequent or severe hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, or changes in health status, or during periods of rapid growth and development in youth.

### A1c: recommendations, debates, and questions [^111KGBWC]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Kilpatrick suggested that eAG is no more than "a consensus compromise" of multiple groups endeavoring to communicate the new methodology of A1C measurement. He reviewed the acceptance criteria used in the ADAG study that 90% of patients should have mean glucose within 15% of the eAG based on A1C, pointing out that these limits are "too wide". If we accept that 90% of patients said to have an eAG of 200 have actual mean glucose as low as 170 mg/dl or as high as 230 mg/dl (this in itself allows variability exceeding 25%), the mathematics of normal distributions (which are somewhat inaccurate for glycemia) would lead the 99% confidence limits to be within 24%, allowing a range from 152 to 248 mg/dl. Kilpatrick reviewed his analysis of variability of glycated hemoglobin in nondiabetic individuals, occurring in a fashion unrelated to mean glycemia. While individuals are quite consistent, the interindividual variability of the A1C in subjects not having diabetes suggested that A1C in diabetic subjects with similar mean glycemia would likely vary by 1–2%. Furthermore, he showed evidence of imprecision of A1C measurement between laboratories both in the U.K. and in the U.S. based on a CAP report from May 2009, so that the 99% confidence limits of an eAG of 200 might in actuality be from 135 to 265 mg/dl.

### Empirically establishing blood glucose targets to achieve HbA1c goals [^113JUWaC]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE To determine the average fasting, postprandial, and bedtime self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) concentrations associated with specified HbA1c levels using data from the A1c-Derived Average Glucose (ADAG) study. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The ADAG study was a multicenter observational study that used continuous glucose monitoring and SMBG testing to determine the relationship between mean average glucose and HbA1c. We used the SMBG data from 470 of the ADAG study participants (237 with type 1 diabetes and 147 with type 2 diabetes) to determine the average fasting, premeal, 90-min postmeal, and bedtime blood glucose (BG) for predefined target HbA1c groups between 5.5 and 8.5% (37–69 mmol/mol). t Tests were used to compare mean BG values between type 1 and type 2 diabetes groups. RESULTS The average fasting BG needed to achieve predefined HbA1c target levels of 5.5–6.49% (37–47 mmol/mol), 6.5–6.99% (48–52 mmol/mol), 7.0–7.49% (52–58 mmol/mol), 7.5–7.99% (58–64 mmol/mol), and 8.0–8.5% (64–69 mmol/mol) were 122 mg/dL with 95% CI 117–127, 142 mg/dL (135–150), 152 mg/dL (143–162), 167 mg/dL (157–177), and 178 mg/dL (164–192), respectively. Postmeal BG to achieve the HbA1c level of 6.5–6.99% (48–52 mmol/mol) and 7.0–7.49% (52–58 mmol/mol) were 139 mg/dL (134–144) and 152 mg/dL (147–157), respectively. Bedtime BG was 153 mg/dL (145–161) and 177 mg/dL (166–188), respectively. CONCLUSIONS We have determined the average BG at premeal, postmeal, and bedtime to achieve a variety of HbA1c targets. These results, based on empirical data, will help patients and providers set realistic day-to-day SMBG targets to achieve individualized HbA1c goals.

### Racial differences in the relationship of glucose concentrations and hemoglobin A1c levels [^1144AW1A]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Debate exists as to whether the higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels observed in black persons than in white persons are due to worse glycemic control or racial differences in the glycation of hemoglobin.

Objective

To determine whether a racial difference exists in the relationship of mean glucose and HbA1c.

Design

Prospective, 12-week observational study.

Setting

10 diabetes centers in the United States.

Participants

104 black persons and 104 white persons aged 8 years or older who had had type 1 diabetes for at least 2 years and had an HbA1c level of 6.0% to 12.0%.

Measurements

Mean glucose concentration, measured by using continuous glucose monitoring and compared by race with HbA1c, glycated albumin, and fructosamine values.

Results

The mean HbA1c level was 9.1% in black persons and 8.3% in white persons. For a given HbA1c level, the mean glucose concentration was significantly lower in black persons than in white persons (P = 0.013), which was reflected in mean HbA1c values in black persons being 0.4 percentage points (95% CI, 0.2 to 0.6 percentage points) higher than those in white persons for a given mean glucose concentration. In contrast, no significant racial differences were found in the relationship of glycated albumin and fructosamine levels with the mean glucose concentration (P > 0.20 for both comparisons).

Limitation

There were too few participants with HbA1c levels less than 6.5% to generalize the results to such individuals.

Conclusion

On average, HbA1c levels overestimate the mean glucose concentration in black persons compared with white persons, possibly owing to racial differences in the glycation of hemoglobin. However, because race only partially explains the observed HbA1c differences between black persons and white persons, future research should focus on identifying and modifying barriers impeding improved glycemic control in black persons with diabetes.

### A1c: recommendations, debates, and questions [^113F84CF]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Nathan took the position that such eAG reporting with A1C will serve a useful purpose. He began by commenting that "diabetes has always been sugar-centric" and noted that what was subsequently found to be glycated hemoglobin was first described as a minor hemoglobin fraction in 1958; Rahbar found an increase in levels with diabetes a decade later. The 1997 ADA Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus, the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), and the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) intervention trials, he said, "cement A1C as the means by which we measure our targets". The goal of treatment is, he continued, an A1C < 7%, observing that "we're guiding people based on A1C". This led him to question the use of both glucose and A1C, two different measures, in treating diabetes, suggesting that this might be confusing for patients, and he suggested that the use of eAG would allow all values discussed with patients to be expressed in the same units, which he considered desirable. Such conversions have been proposed by a number of investigators, beginning with a European study and one he carried out more than 25 years ago, with robust correlation of A1C with mean self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG). These considerations led to the A1C-derived average glucose (ADAG) study of more than 500 type 1 and type 2 diabetic and nondiabetic subjects, 83% of whom were Caucasian, 8% black, and 8% Hispanic, who performed continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) 2–3 days monthly as well as pre- and postprandial SMBG for 4 months, giving ∼2,500 CGM and 230 SMBG values per patient. Both forms of monitoring gave similar findings, with CGM leading to the following formula: [average glucose] = 2.87 × A1C − 46.7, with r 2 0.84. Nathan suggested that the correlation might have been even higher, but that there are always measurement errors and incomplete glucose monitoring, and he acknowledged that there may be variability among individuals in rates of erythrocyte formation and hemoglobin glycation. He commented that the study was carried out in a fashion designed to minimize variability and noted that "we had screened… to try to strip the population of these errors". He agreed that the study was therefore somewhat limited because there were few people of non-Caucasian ethnicity and no data in children, pregnancy, or renal disease and that "we also had people who were generally more stable". He concluded that the use of eAG would be greatly advantageous in helping more people to understand their level of glycemia and noted that only a quarter of diabetic individuals think that they know what their A1C is, and few of these are correct.

### Estimated average glucose and self-monitored mean blood glucose are discordant estimates of glycemic control [^114B4x7v]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The A1C-Derived Average Glucose study recommended reporting A1C in estimated average glucose (eAG) equivalents. We compared eAG with self-monitored mean blood glucose (MBG) to determine whether eAG is systematically biased due to biological variation in the relationship between MBG and A1C.

Research Design and Methods

MBG and A1C were recorded from charts of 202 pediatric type 1 diabetic patients at 1,612 clinic visits. Patients were divided into groups with low, moderate, or high A1C bias based on a hemoglobin glycation index (HGI).

Results

The mean ± SD values for MBG versus eAG were as follows: total population, 194 ± 34 vs. 196 ± 36 mg/dl; low-HGI group, 186 ± 31 vs. 163 ± 20 mg/dl; moderate-HGI group, 195 ± 28 vs. 193 ± 19 mg/dl; and high-HGI group, 199 ± 42 vs. 230 ± 31 mg/dl.

Conclusions

eAG underestimated MBG in low HGI patients and overestimated MBG in high HGI patients. Disagreement between eAG and MBG downloaded from patient glucose meters will cause confusion if eAG is implemented for clinical use.

### A critical evaluation of glycated protein parameters in advanced nephropathy: a matter of life or death: A1c remains the gold standard outcome predictor in diabetic dialysis patients. counterpoint [^1136JA7u]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Uremia may confound the association of A1C with time-averaged glucose concentration and the ability of A1C to predict clinical outcomes. These nondifferential alterations do not discredit A1C as a reliable long-term marker of glycemic control in dialysis patients as long as appropriate adjustments to interpret A1C values are made. Recent data from large cohorts of diabetic dialysis patients suggest a rather robust association between A1C and glucose concentration (r = 0.51–0.56) and U- or J-shaped A1C-mortality association with a shift to the right. Both very low (< 6%) and high (> 8%) A1C levels appear incrementally associated with higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in peritoneal and hemodialysis patients. These bimodal death risks are robust, especially when longitudinal A1C values are examined. Given the availability of inexpensive and routinely measured A1C assays in virtually all dialysis clinics and given inconsistent data to prove superiority of other glycemic markers such as glycated albumin, there is currently no compelling reason to abandon A1C testing. This article reviews the utility of A1C in diabetic dialysis patients and supports the notion that as long as dialysis patient–specific A1C outcome associations are taken into consideration, A1C meets the clinical criteria of an ideal test for long-term glycemic control in these patients.

### Associations between features of glucose exposure and A1c: the A1c-derived average glucose (ADAG) study [^112i78j1]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

MAGE has previously been described as the gold standard with which to measure variability. Our findings show that CONGA or the "simple" SD captures variability to a very similar degree as MAGE. Regarding the methods to assess PPG, we found that the postprandial AUC from CGM 2 h after a meal correlates well with SMBG postprandial measurements, with a correlation coefficient of 0.92. This suggests that a routine 90-min postprandial SMBG measurement contains much of the information about the glucose curve in the hours after a meal. The ADAG study also showed that seven-point profile SMBG levels, measured on average 3 days per week, and CGM, measured on 2 days per month, both over a 3-month period, predict average glucose and A1C similarly.

The postprandial increment in glucose levels (the difference from preprandial to highest postprandial value in a 2-h window) showed generally weak correlations with postprandial blood glucose levels (r = 0.45–0.51) and with indexes of average glycemia (r = 0.26–0.27). Postprandial increments have been used to assess glucose variability and PPG in other studies. The difference between the calculated increments (from CGM) and the difference between the pre- and postprandial measurements from SMBG (Table 1) might be because the latter is measured by the participant ∼90 min after eating (not necessarily capturing the highest postprandial value). One might expect large postprandial increments to reflect high glucose variability; however, the correlation with the variability measures was also only moderate (r = from 0.41 [SMBG SD] to 0.54 [CONGA 4]).

### Diabetes and employment [^115voRMn]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

A1C and estimated average glucose (eAG).

Hemoglobin A1C (A1C) test results reflect average glycemia over several months and correlate with mean plasma glucose levels. An eAG is directly related to A1C and also provides an individual with an estimate of average blood glucose over a period of time, but it uses the same values and units that are observed when using a glucose meter or recording a fasting glucose value on a lab report. A1C/eAG values provide health care providers with important information about the effectiveness of an individual's treatment regimen but are often misused in assessing whether an individual can safely perform a job. Because they identify only averages and not whether the person had severe extreme blood glucose readings, A1C/eAG results are of no value in predicting short-term complications of diabetes and thus have no use in evaluating individuals in employment situations.

The American Diabetes Association recommends that in most patients A1C levels be kept below 7%, or eAG below 154 mg/dl. This recommendation sets a target in order to lessen the chances of long-term complications of high blood glucose levels but does not provide useful information on whether the individual is at significant risk for hypoglycemia or suboptimal job performance and is not a measure of "compliance" with therapy. An A1C or eAG cut off score is not medically justified in employment evaluations and should never be a determinative factor in employment.

"Uncontrolled" or "brittle" diabetes.

Sometimes an individual's diabetes is described as "uncontrolled", "poorly controlled", or "brittle". These terms are not well defined and are not relevant to job evaluations. As such, giving an opinion on the level of "control" an individual has over diabetes is not the same as assessing whether that individual is qualified to perform a particular job and can do so safely. Such an individual assessment is the only relevant evaluation.

### A1c: recommendations, debates, and questions [^111bidT7]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Summary

A1C does reflect the phenomenon of greater hemoglobin glycation at higher mean glycemia and is certainly useful as an objective measure of long-term glycemia in subjects with diabetes. The related concepts that A1C can be used rather than the results of actual patient glucose measurements in accurately ascertaining mean glycemia and that A1C might be useful in the diagnosis of diabetes are therefore highly appealing. One should not, however, expect all subjects to glycate hemoglobin to the same degree for a given level of glycemia, given that a number of lines of evidence indicate that in clinical populations there is heterogeneity in the degree to which this occurs. A1C may not, then, be sufficiently accurate to allow its clinical use in the diagnosis of diabetes in populations of varying age and ethnic background and with illnesses affecting erythrocyte turnover. Moreover, caution appears reasonable before adoption of terminology such as eAG. We need to develop and validate new approaches to understanding glycemic exposure of subjects with diabetes and to develop better approaches to assessment of glycemia among subjects at risk of diabetes. As an example, individuals with increasing fasting glucose when monitored over time appear to be at particularly high risk of developing diabetes, and this may be a promising approach to diagnosis.

### Translating the A1c assay into estimated average glucose values [^114gKbcS]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The A1C assay, expressed as the percent of hemoglobin that is glycated, measures chronic glycemia and is widely used to judge the adequacy of diabetes treatment and adjust therapy. Day-to-day management is guided by self-monitoring of capillary glucose concentrations (milligrams per deciliter or millimoles per liter). We sought to define the mathematical relationship between A1C and average glucose (AG) levels and determine whether A1C could be expressed and reported as AG in the same units as used in self-monitoring.

Research Design and Methods

A total of 507 subjects, including 268 patients with type 1 diabetes, 159 with type 2 diabetes, and 80 nondiabetic subjects from 10 international centers, was included in the analyses. A1C levels obtained at the end of 3 months and measured in a central laboratory were compared with the AG levels during the previous 3 months. AG was calculated by combining weighted results from at least 2 days of continuous glucose monitoring performed four times, with seven-point daily self-monitoring of capillary (fingerstick) glucose performed at least 3 days per week.

Results

Approximately 2,700 glucose values were obtained by each subject during 3 months. Linear regression analysis between the A1C and AG values provided the tightest correlations (AG(mg/dl) = 28.7 x A1C - 46.7, R(2) = 0.84, P < 0.0001), allowing calculation of an estimated average glucose (eAG) for A1C values. The linear regression equations did not differ significantly across subgroups based on age, sex, diabetes type, race/ethnicity, or smoking status.

Conclusions

A1C levels can be expressed as eAG for most patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

### A1c: recommendations, debates, and questions [^111FC6u1]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Given these caveats, I asked whether it is possible to predict true mean or average glucose with a high degree of accuracy in a given person based on the A1C measurement. I reviewed Nathan's original study from 1984. Twenty-one diabetic subjects measured capillary glucose at least four times daily, both pre- and postprandially, for 2 months prior to A1C determination; the regression equation generated was used to show that 24% of practitioners' estimates of mean glucose differed by > 75 mg/dl from the estimate derived from A1C. However, the study was not able to answer the question whether a substantial number of subjects differ in average glucose from those A1C-derived estimates. In the analysis of 623 insulin-treated type 2 diabetic subjects who measured capillary glucose before and after breakfast, lunch, and dinner and at bedtime on 3 days during the 2 weeks prior to measurement of A1C, there was the expected excellent correlation of the two measures, but frequency analysis of glucose group versus A1C showed important differences between the measures. For example, of 224 patients with mean plasma glucose 110–140 mg/dl, 10% had A1C < 6.0% and 10% had A1C > 8.1%. Conversely, comparing A1C grouping with mean glucose, of 260 patients with A1C 6.5–7.5%, 10% had mean glucose < 115 mg/dl and 10% had mean glucose > 171 mg/dl (D. Shrom, E. Choi, L. Ilag, Z.T.B. unpublished data). Approximately 20% of eAG values, then, differed rather substantially from measured mean glucose values in the patients.

Recommendations

Perform the A1C test at least two times a year in patients who are meeting treatment goals (and who have stable glycemic control). (E)
Perform the A1C test quarterly in patients whose therapy has changed or who are not meeting glycemic goals. (E)
Use of point-of-care testing for A1C allows for timely decisions on therapy changes, when needed. (E)

Because A1C is thought to reflect average glycemia over several months, and has strong predictive value for diabetes complications, A1C testing should be performed routinely in all patients with diabetes at initial assessment and then as part of continuing care. Measurement approximately every 3 months determines whether a patient's glycemic targets have been reached and maintained. For any individual patient, the frequency of A1C testing should be dependent on the clinical situation, the treatment regimen used, and the judgment of the clinician. Some patients with stable glycemia well within target may do well with testing only twice per year, while unstable or highly intensively managed patients (e.g. pregnant type 1 women) may be tested more frequently than every 3 months. The availability of the A1C result at the time that the patient is seen (point-of-care testing) has been reported to result in increased intensification of therapy and improvement in glycemic control.

### Associations between features of glucose exposure and A1c: the A1c-derived average glucose (ADAG) study [^112qQ5Hu]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Glucose monitoring in the ADAG study was completed by 507 participants. Approximately 2,700 glucose values from each participant were available for analysis. We excluded 10 nondiabetic participants from the analyses of average SMBG and SDs due to missing LifeScan measurements and 1 participant with type 1 diabetes due to erroneous, extreme HemoCue measurements of pre- and postprandial values.

Characteristics of the study population are summarized in Table 1. A1C levels were higher among those with type 1 diabetes (7.3 vs. 6.8% for type 2 diabetes, P < 0.01). Also, the degree of variability, expressed as the SD of the CGM or SMBG measurements and the calculated MAGE and CONGA, was higher among individuals with type 1 diabetes compared with those with type 2 diabetes or nondiabetic individuals (P < 0.01).

TABLE 1
Clinical and glycemic characteristics

As an indicator of overall hyperglycemia, the 24-h cumulative exposure to glucose levels above selected glucose thresholds was calculated as the AUC of glucose (AUC [in hours × mmol/l]) by subgroups defined by type of diabetes and, for type 2 diabetes, insulin therapy. In each subgroup, a different proportion of participants reached each respective threshold at least at some point during the CGM period. While > 80% of those with type 1 diabetes and 63% of those with type 2 diabetes on insulin treatment reached a level of 16.7 mmol/l (300 mg/dl), only 31% of those with type 2 diabetes without insulin treatment did so. One individual without diabetes reached this level briefly. (These results can be seen in the online appendix Table, available at).

### Understanding the clinical implications of differences between glucose management indicator and glycated haemoglobin [^111Cy3rP]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Laboratory measured glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is the gold standard for assessing glycaemic control in people with diabetes and correlates with their risk of long-term complications. The emergence of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has highlighted limitations of HbA1c testing. HbA1c can only be reviewed infrequently and can mask the risk of hypoglycaemia or extreme glucose fluctuations. While CGM provides insights in to the risk of hypoglycaemia as well as daily fluctuations of glucose, it can also be used to calculate an estimated HbA1c that has been used as a substitute for laboratory HbA1c. However, it is evident that estimated HbA1c and HbA1c values can differ widely. The glucose management indicator (GMI), calculated exclusively from CGM data, has been proposed. It uses the same scale (% or mmol/mol) as HbA1c, but is based on short-term average glucose values, rather than long-term glucose exposure. HbA1c and GMI values differ in up to 81% of individuals by more than ± 0.1% and by more than ± 0.3% in 51% of cases. Here, we review the factors that define these differences, such as the time period being assessed, the variation in glycation rates and factors such as anaemia and haemoglobinopathies. Recognizing and understanding the factors that cause differences between HbA1c and GMI is an important clinical skill. In circumstances when HbA1c is elevated above GMI, further attempts at intensification of therapy based solely on the HbA1c value may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. The observed difference between GMI and HbA1c also informs the important question about the predictive ability of GMI regarding long-term complications.

### Associations between features of glucose exposure and A1c: the A1c-derived average glucose (ADAG) study [^112oMyx8]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

In summary, the role of glucose excursions and postprandial glycemia in day-to-day diabetes control and risk management is still debated. We found relatively weak correlations between variability indexes and indexes of fasting, postprandial, and mean glycemia, indicating that the variability indexes convey different information. Fasting glucose values had only a moderate correlation with other indexes, confirming that it is not a clear indicator of general glycemia. The mean of all preprandial glucose levels had a larger impact on A1C levels than postprandial glucose levels in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients.

### Assessing glycemia in diabetes using self-monitoring blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c [^112k9Mys]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

With the increasing prevalence of diabetes, successful management of blood glucose control is increasingly important. Current approaches to assessing glycemia include the use of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).

Objectives

To assess the evidence underlying the use of these 2 modalities, to evaluate confounders and sources of error in each test, to describe upcoming developments, and to reach evidence-based conclusions on their optimal use.

Data Sources, Study Selection, and Data Extraction

Reports identified from MEDLINE searches (1976–2005) using relevant terms were selected for quality and relevance to the stated questions. Particular attention was paid to larger cohort studies, clinical trials, meta-analyses, and established recommendations.

Data Synthesis

If used properly SMBG gives an acceptably accurate reflection of immediate plasma glucose levels. Study results vary, but in general, the evidence supports a positive effect of regular SMBG for improving glycemia, particularly in individuals treated with insulin. The best timing of SMBG and its frequency are controversial issues, but the clinical recommendation is for regular monitoring with frequency depending on the treatment and the instability of glycemia. In the relatively near term, SMBG could gradually be replaced by continuous glucose monitoring. HbA1c measures long-term glycemic control, reflecting a time-weighted mean over the previous 3 to 4 months. There are a number of physiologic and methodologic confounders that can affect HbA1c, but standardization of assays has been well established. The main value of HbA1c is its use as a predictor of diabetic complications and the proven effect of improved control of HbA1c on complication risk. A reasonable target value for HbA1c is less than 7%. A new method for measuring HbA1c may cause significant changes in the recommended levels, the numbers reported, and even the name of the test.

Conclusion

Assessing glycemia in diabetes can be a challenge, but approaches are available that promote successful management of blood glucose and may thereby lead to a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality related to diabetes.

The A1C test is subject to certain limitations. Conditions that affect erythrocyte turnover (hemolysis, blood loss) and hemoglobin variants must be considered, particularly when the A1C result does not correlate with the patient's clinical situation. In addition, A1C does not provide a measure of glycemic variability or hypoglycemia. For patients prone to glycemic variability (especially type 1 patients, or type 2 patients with severe insulin deficiency), glycemic control is best judged by the combination of results of SMBG testing and the A1C. The A1C may also serve as a check on the accuracy of the patient's meter (or the patient's reported SMBG results) and the adequacy of the SMBG testing schedule.

Table 8 contains the correlation between A1C levels and mean plasma glucose levels based on data from the international A1C-Derived Average Glucose (ADAG) trial utilizing frequent SMBG and continuous glucose monitoring in 507 adults (83% Caucasian) with type 1, type 2, and no diabetes The ADA and American Association of Clinical Chemists have determined that the correlation (r = 0.92) is strong enough to justify reporting both an A1C result and an estimated average glucose (eAG) result when a clinician orders the A1C test. The table in previous versions of the Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes describing the correlation between A1C and mean glucose was derived from relatively sparse data (one seven-point profile over 1 day per A1C reading) in the primarily Caucasian type 1 participants in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) trial. Clinicians should note that the numbers in the table are now different, as they are based on ∼2,800 readings per A1C in the ADAG trial.

In the ADAG study, there were no significant differences among racial and ethnic groups in the regression lines between A1C and mean glucose, although there was a trend toward a difference between African/African-American and Caucasian participants' regression lines that might have been significant had more African/African-American participants been studied. A recent study comparing A1C to CGM data in 48 type 1 children found a highly statistically significant correlation between A1C and mean blood glucose, although the correlation (r = 0.7) was significantly lower than in the ADAG trial. Whether there are significant differences in how A1C relates to average glucose in children or in African-American patients is an area for further study. For the time being, the question has not led to different recommendations about testing A1C or to different interpretations of the clinical meaning of given levels of A1C in those populations.
