## Question

How should endometriosis be managed in adolescents?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how endometriosis should be managed in adolescents. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why adolescent endometriosis is different. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach, including when to image and when to operate. Next, I will review first-line medical therapy and escalation strategies. After that, I need to examine surgical indications and techniques, including fertility considerations. Finally, I should integrate long-term suppression, multidisciplinary care, and special situations like fertility preservation and nonresponders, and close with a concise algorithm that aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why adolescent endometriosis warrants a distinct approach. Adolescents often present with dysmenorrhea and chronic pelvic pain that impair school attendance and activities, and endometriosis is the leading cause of secondary dysmenorrhea in this age group, with lesions that are frequently clear or red and easy to miss if not actively looked for, which contributes to diagnostic delay and undertreatment [^be498869] [^3c12756e] [^e752e6a9]. Hold on, I should verify prevalence signals: in adolescents with chronic pelvic pain or dysmenorrhea unresponsive to NSAIDs and hormones, laparoscopic series show high rates of endometriosis, around two-thirds or more, reinforcing the need to maintain a low threshold for evaluation and treatment [^58f75704] [^2e9483b6].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach and when to escalate. Wait, let me verify the first-line workup: for suspected primary dysmenorrhea, start with NSAIDs and hormonal suppression; if pain persists beyond 3–6 months or red flags emerge, evaluate for secondary causes with a focused history, exam as appropriate, and pelvic ultrasound, recognizing that ultrasound can miss subtle peritoneal disease but helps identify endometriomas or structural anomalies [^d8585717] [^38903037] [^11f50930]. I need to ensure I don't overstate imaging sensitivity; while transvaginal ultrasound is reasonable when appropriate, MRI becomes valuable when TVUS is inconclusive or not feasible, and ESHRE supports MRI as a first-line modality in adolescents when TVUS is not appropriate, with ESUR consensus endorsing MRI when TVUS is negative or inconclusive in a symptomatic patient [^5f5af145] [^fa6ecb16]. But wait, what if noninvasive tests are negative and symptoms persist? In that scenario, diagnostic laparoscopy is reasonable, ideally after shared decision-making that weighs benefits of confirmation and lesion treatment against surgical risks [^5c96c025] [^134f016e].

> I will now examine first-line medical therapy. NSAIDs remain foundational for pain relief and should be dosed proactively around menses; if NSAIDs alone are insufficient, combined hormonal contraceptives or progestogens are first-line hormonal options to suppress disease activity and pain, with ESHRE explicitly recommending CHCs or progestogens as initial therapy in adolescents with severe dysmenorrhea or endometriosis-associated pain [^3cad7bb4] [^9d59cd50] [^0790bc17]. Hold on, I should verify formulation choices: options include combined oral contraceptives, patch or ring, progestin-only pills, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, and the 52 mg levonorgestrel IUS, with selection tailored to contraceptive needs, side effects, and adherence considerations; continuous or extended regimens are often preferred to maximize suppression [^8742fee3] [^d3e35b80].

> Let me consider escalation when first-line therapy fails. I should confirm that GnRH agonists are reserved as second-line after failure of CHCs or progestogens, and that add-back therapy is mandatory from the outset to mitigate bone loss and hypoestrogenic symptoms; ESHRE and ACOG align on this, and a 2017 adolescent trial showed conjugated estrogen plus norethindrone add-back improved quality of life and bone preservation compared with norethindrone alone [^ea2cb1ea] [^d3e35b80]. Wait, I initially thought GnRH antagonists were broadly recommended as second-line in adolescents, but I should double-check; ESHRE notes insufficient evidence on dose and duration in adolescents, so while antagonists may be considered in select refractory cases, agonists with add-back remain the more evidence-based second-line choice in this population pending better data [^1fb3583e] [^aafbbeaa]. I need to ensure duration is sensible; typical courses are up to 6–12 months with reassessment, and bone health counseling with calcium, vitamin D, and weight-bearing exercise is essential during therapy [^d3e35b80].

> Now, I should review surgical indications and techniques. Surgery is not first-line in adolescents; it is indicated for diagnostic confirmation when noninvasive evaluation is negative and symptoms persist despite appropriate medical therapy, for treatment of refractory pain, or for suspected or confirmed endometriomas or obstructive anomalies, with laparoscopy performed by experienced surgeons and with a plan for concurrent lesion treatment and, when appropriate, placement of a LNG-IUS to minimize insertion pain [^5c96c025] [^5c96c025] [^e051f53d]. Hold on, I should verify lesion management: excision or destruction of visible lesions should be performed at the time of diagnostic laparoscopy, and subtle clear or red lesions warrant careful inspection and sampling; biopsy can be negative, so visual diagnosis with treatment is acceptable in context, and peritoneal stripping is not recommended in adolescents due to lack of benefit and potential harm [^91c7921f] [^4f5e71ad]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overstated that excision is universally superior to ablation; evidence quality varies, and in adolescents with predominantly superficial disease, both excision and ablation are used, but excision may offer more definitive histology and potentially lower recurrence when performed expertly, though comparative adolescent data are limited [^9d64771c].

> I need to ensure I address fertility considerations explicitly. Adolescents with endometriosis should be counseled that ovarian endometriomas and surgery can impair ovarian reserve, and while fertility preservation is not routine, ESHRE advises discussing options, especially in the presence of bilateral endometriomas or when repeated ovarian surgery is anticipated, even though evidence for benefit in adolescents remains limited [^02d4d250] [^1717ce24]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; routine oocyte cryopreservation is not indicated for all adolescents with endometriosis, but individualized counseling about risks and options is appropriate in higher-risk scenarios or when fertility goals are front and center [^1717ce24].

> Next, I should review long-term management and recurrence prevention. Endometriosis is chronic and progressive without suppression, so continuous hormonal therapy is recommended until childbearing is desired, with periodic reassessment of efficacy, side effects, and adherence; this approach aims to suppress disease activity, prevent progression, and protect future fertility [^d3e35b80] [^89cc8d28]. I should confirm that postoperative patients require ongoing suppression to reduce recurrence; case series and retrospective data suggest progression risk when medical therapy is discontinued, supporting the principle of combined surgical-medical care with maintenance therapy [^9b3283dd] [^678953f9].

> Let me integrate multidisciplinary and supportive care. Chronic pelvic pain in adolescents benefits from a biopsychosocial approach, including pain management strategies, cognitive-behavioral therapy, physical therapy, and education for patients and families; ACOG and pain-center perspectives emphasize these adjuncts to improve function and quality of life, and clinicians should avoid long-term opioids outside specialized programs [^6ff71d40] [^9d041b48] [^eb7f9c73]. I should double-check that we also screen for adherence barriers and provide culturally sensitive counseling, as adherence and engagement materially affect outcomes in this age group [^770dfa51].

> I will now examine special situations and nonresponders. For refractory pain despite appropriate NSAIDs, CHCs or progestogens, and a GnRH agonist with add-back, consider second-line options such as GnRH antagonists or aromatase inhibitors in combination regimens, recognizing limited adolescent-specific data and the need for careful monitoring and shared decision-making [^1fb3583e] [^01dd3c95]. But wait, what if imaging is negative and symptoms persist? In that case, diagnostic laparoscopy remains reasonable to confirm disease and treat lesions, with preoperative counseling about risks, benefits, and the possibility of negative histology despite clinically meaningful disease [^5c96c025] [^134f016e].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check it against guidelines. Start with NSAIDs and consider CHCs or progestogens as first-line hormonal therapy; reassess in 3–6 months and, if inadequate, obtain ultrasound and consider MRI when TVUS is not feasible or is negative but suspicion remains; if symptoms persist and no other etiology is identified, proceed to diagnostic laparoscopy with concurrent lesion treatment and consider LNG-IUS placement; postoperatively, continue suppressive hormonal therapy and coordinate multidisciplinary care, escalating to GnRH agonist with add-back if refractory, while counseling on fertility considerations and avoiding long-term opioids [^d8585717] [^9d59cd50] [^5f5af145] [^2e6abaf3] [^d3e35b80] [^eb7f9c73]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with both ACOG and ESHRE; yes, both emphasize early recognition, conservative surgery when indicated, and long-term suppression with judicious escalation, which matches this pathway [^a6589510] [^44745bb8].

> Finally, I need to ensure key pearls are explicit. Maintain a high index of suspicion in adolescents with persistent dysmenorrhea or chronic pelvic pain, especially with a family history or school absenteeism; remember that adolescent lesions are often clear or red and easily missed; avoid long-term opioids; and prioritize early, evidence-based therapy to reduce diagnostic delay, symptom burden, and potential progression, while individualizing choices to adolescent-specific needs and goals [^a6589510] [^3c12756e] [^eb7f9c73] [^e752e6a9].

Endometriosis management in adolescents centers on **early recognition and empiric medical therapy** [^d8585717] to control pain and suppress disease progression, with NSAIDs and hormonal suppression (combined oral contraceptives, progestins, or LNG-IUS) as first-line treatments [^3cad7bb4] [^9d59cd50]. If symptoms persist after 3–6 months, **diagnostic laparoscopy** [^5c96c025] with lesion excision or ablation is indicated, ideally by an experienced surgeon [^2e6abaf3], followed by continuous hormonal suppression to prevent recurrence [^44745bb8]. GnRH agonists with add-back are reserved for refractory cases due to bone health risks [^252d3ace] [^e13f9dbf]. Multidisciplinary care, fertility counseling, and education are essential, and long-term suppression is recommended until childbearing is desired [^6ff71d40] [^d3e35b80].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Adolescents with endometriosis typically present with:

- **Dysmenorrhea**: Often severe, progressive, and refractory to NSAIDs [^a6589510].
- **Chronic pelvic pain**: Cyclic or acyclic, often with nausea, dyschezia, dysuria, or dyspareunia [^73b384af].
- **School absenteeism**: Frequent absences due to pain are a red flag [^71542198].
- **Atypical lesions**: Clear, red, or white lesions are common and easily missed [^3c12756e] [^40371c76].

Diagnosis is **clinical**, supported by imaging (transvaginal ultrasound or MRI) when appropriate [^5f5af145] [^fa6ecb16], and confirmed by laparoscopy with histology if needed [^4f5e71ad]. Serum biomarkers (e.g. CA-125) are not recommended for diagnosis [^b7246fc8].

---

## Initial medical management

First-line therapy aims to **control pain and suppress endometriosis activity**:

| **Treatment** | **Indication** | **Dosage** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| NSAIDs | First-line for pain | Ibuprofen 800 mg load, then 400–800 mg every 8 hours; naproxen 440–550 mg load, then 220–550 mg every 12 hours | Start 1–2 days before menses; avoid opioids [^3cad7bb4] [^02bcb5f2] |
| Combined hormonal contraceptives | First-line hormonal therapy | Continuous or cyclic dosing | Suppresses ovulation and endometrial proliferation [^9d59cd50] [^0790bc17] |
| Progestins (norethindrone, medroxyprogesterone) | Alternative or adjunctive therapy | Norethindrone 5–10 mg daily; Depo-Provera 150 mg IM every 3 months | Useful when estrogen contraindicated [^9d59cd50] |
| Levonorgestrel IUS | First-line, especially with heavy bleeding | 52 mg LNG-IUS | Effective for pain and menstrual suppression [^9d59cd50] |

---

Empiric therapy should be continued for **3–6 months** [^d8585717]; if ineffective, evaluate for secondary causes and consider laparoscopy [^5c96c025].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is indicated for:

- **Refractory symptoms**: Persistent pain despite optimal medical therapy [^5c96c025].
- **Diagnostic uncertainty**: Negative imaging with ongoing suspicion [^5c96c025].
- **Endometriomas or deep disease**: Suspected or confirmed [^notfound].

Laparoscopy is the gold standard [^2e6abaf3]; excision or ablation of lesions is performed, and a **LNG-IUS may be placed at the time of surgery** to facilitate long-term suppression [^e051f53d]. Radical excision or peritoneal stripping is not recommended due to limited benefit and potential harm [^91c7921f] [^9d64771c].

---

## Postoperative management

Postoperative care emphasizes **continuous hormonal suppression** to prevent recurrence [^44745bb8]; options include combined hormonal contraceptives, progestins, or LNG-IUS [^9d59cd50]. GnRH agonists with add-back therapy are reserved for refractory cases, typically limited to 6–12 months due to bone health risks [^252d3ace] [^e13f9dbf].

---

## Special considerations

- **Bone health**: Monitor calcium and vitamin D intake; consider DEXA if prolonged GnRH therapy is used [^d3e35b80].
- **Fertility**: Counsel on potential impact and discuss fertility preservation when appropriate [^02d4d250] [^1717ce24].
- **Multidisciplinary care**: Involve pain management, psychology, and physical therapy as needed [^6ff71d40] [^9d041b48].

---

## Long-term outcomes

Early diagnosis and combined surgical-medical management can **reduce pain, improve quality of life, and potentially preserve fertility** [^678953f9] [^6ff71d40]. However, recurrence is common without ongoing suppression, underscoring the need for long-term follow-up [^4a7c5cf6].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Empiric medical therapy**: NSAIDs and hormonal suppression as first-line [^3cad7bb4] [^9d59cd50].
- **Escalation**: Consider laparoscopy if no improvement after 3–6 months [^5c96c025].
- **Postoperative suppression**: Continuous hormonal therapy to prevent recurrence [^44745bb8].
- **Individualized care**: Tailor therapy to symptoms, fertility goals, and patient preference [^a6589510].

---

Endometriosis management in adolescents requires a **stepwise, individualized approach** that balances symptom control, disease suppression, and fertility preservation, with early recognition and sustained suppression as key pillars of care [^a6589510].

### Evaluation and management of endometriosis in the adolescent [^a7c18d22]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is a chronic condition, with debilitating symptoms affecting all ages. Dysmenorrhea and pelvic pain often begin in adolescence, affecting school, daily activities, and relationships. Despite the profound burden of endometriosis, many adolescents experience suboptimal management and significant delay in diagnosis. The symptomatology and laparoscopic findings of endometriosis in adolescents are often different than in adults, and the medical and surgical treatments for adolescents may differ from those for adults as well. This Narrative Review summarizes the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of endometriosis in adolescents. Given the unique challenges and complexities associated with diagnosing endometriosis in this age group, it is crucial to maintain a heightened level of suspicion and to remain vigilant for signs and symptoms. By maintaining this lower threshold for consideration, we can ensure timely and accurate diagnosis, enabling early intervention and improved management in our adolescent patients.

Objectives

To review the etiologies, diagnosis, and treatment options of adolescent endometriosis.

Methods

Review of publications relating to adolescent endometriosis.

Results

Endometriosis occurs in adolescents as young as 8 years of age; furthermore, there have been documented cases of endometriosis occurring prior to menarche. Adolescents presenting with pelvic pain are treated with cyclic combination oral contraceptive pills and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. If the pain does not respond to these therapies, then in adolescents as in adults, an operative laparoscopy is recommended for the diagnosis and surgical management of endometriosis. The operating gynecologist should be familiar with the appearance of the complete spectrum of various morphologies of endometriosis, as adolescents tend to have clear, red, white, and/or yellow-brown lesions more frequently than black or blue lesions. Subtle clear lesions of endometriosis may be better visualized by filling the pelvis with irrigation fluid so that the clear lesions can be appreciated in a three-dimensional appearance. Young women who are found to have endometriosis by laparoscopy may present with acyclic, cyclic, and constant pelvic pain. Adolescents with pelvic pain not responding to conventional medical therapy have approximately a 70% prevalence of endometriosis. It is known that endometriosis is a progressive disease and since there is no cure, adolescents with endometriosis require long-term medical management until the time in their lives when they have completed childbearing. Psychosocial support is extremely important for this population of young women with endometriosis.

Conclusions

Endometriosis occurs in adolescents, and presenting symptoms may vary from those seen in adult women with the disease. All health care providers must be aware of the existence of adolescent endometriosis. They should also be aware of the presenting symptoms so that the adolescent can be appropriately referred to a gynecologist comfortable with medical and surgical treatment options in this patient population. If laparoscopy is to be undertaken, the gynecologist must be prepared not only to diagnose but to surgically manage endometriosis. In addition, the subtle laparoscopic findings of endometriosis in adolescents must be recognized for an appropriate diagnosis. Long-term medical therapy will hopefully decrease pain and the progression of the disease, thus decreasing the risk of advanced-stage disease and infertility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 760 — Initial management of suspected primary dysmenorrhea advises that when the patient's history suggests primary dysmenorrhea, empiric treatment should be initiated, and most adolescents who present with dysmenorrhea have primary dysmenorrhea and will respond well to empiric treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or hormonal suppression, or both. If a patient does not experience clinical improvement for her dysmenorrhea within 3–6 months of therapy initiation, the obstetrician–gynecologist should investigate for possible secondary causes and for treatment adherence, and during evaluation for secondary dysmenorrhea pelvic imaging with ultrasonography, regardless of findings on pelvic examination, also should be considered.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 760: dysmenorrhea and endometriosis in the adolescent [^a6589510]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 760 — Endometriosis in adolescents notes that endometriosis is the leading cause of secondary dysmenorrhea in adolescents and should be considered in patients with persistent, clinically significant dysmenorrhea despite treatment with hormonal agents and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, particularly if no other etiology has been identified based on history, physical examination, and pelvic ultrasonography. In adolescents, endometriotic lesions are typically clear or red and can be difficult to identify, endometriosis in adolescents is considered a chronic disease with potential for progression if left untreated, and the goals of therapy include symptom relief, suppression of disease progression, and protection of future fertility. Therapy must be individualized, and obstetrician–gynecologists should consider patient choice, the need for contraception, contraindications to hormone use, and potential adverse effects and counsel the adolescent and her family on treatment options.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 760: dysmenorrhea and endometriosis in the adolescent [^d3e35b80]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 760 — endometriosis in adolescents — medical management emphasizes continued hormonal suppression and appropriate use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. Because endometriosis is a chronic condition, patients should continue hormonal suppression unless they are actively trying to become pregnant, and options include a progestin-only agent or 52 mg of LNG- IUS. For pain refractory to conservative surgical therapy and suppressive hormonal therapy, patients often benefit from at least 6 months of GnRH agonist therapy with add-back medicine. Patients treated with GnRH agonists should begin add-back hormone therapy at the initiation of treatment to prevent bone loss and avoid the onset of menopausal symptoms, and in a 2017 trial in adolescents, add-back therapy using conjugated equine estrogen (0.625 mg) plus norethindrone acetate (5 mg) daily was superior to norethindrone acetate alone for quality of life and preservation of bone density. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanning is not needed before initiation of therapy, during GnRH agonist treatment of less than 12 months in duration, or after treatment; obstetrician–gynecologists should counsel patients on adequate dietary calcium and vitamin D intake and the benefits of weight-bearing exercise during GnRH agonist therapy. After leuprolide is discontinued, patients should begin continuous hormone-suppression therapy. Although serum CA 125 levels may be increased in patients with endometriosis, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists does not endorse using CA 125 to monitor treatment or screen for endometriosis; nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs should be the mainstay of pain relief for adolescents with endometriosis, and adolescents should not be prescribed narcotics long-term outside of a specialized pain management team.

### Treating endometriosis in adolescents: does it matter? [^e9532368]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Endometriosis has major physical and psychosocial impacts on teens, as well as long-term implications for their health. The hidden suffering of millions of adolescents worldwide calls on the medical profession to respond, despite the challenges. Given the increasing understanding of adolescent endometriosis, treating adolescents with endometriosis can be a most rewarding experience. Moreover, diagnosing and treating the disease early could prevent more complicated disease later, as well as comorbidities. Helping these girls may save them, their families, and their communities much physical and emotional pain, as well as lessen the huge burden on our health care systems and society.

### Adolescent endometriosis [^fc1e413a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterus, typically in the pelvis, is known as endometriosis. An adolescent with this diagnosis usually presents with chronic pelvic pain, and she and her family are anxious for an explanation of her symptoms. Traditionally, endometriosis had been thought to occur only rarely in adolescence, but with an increasing awareness of the disease among the medical community, it is being diagnosed more frequently. An outline of the disease and the issues surrounding its diagnosis and management in adolescents is the focus of this article.

### The prevalence of endometriosis in adolescents with pelvic pain: a systematic review [^2e9483b6]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Endometriosis is a recognized cause of pelvic pain in adolescents with menstrual symptoms that significantly affect education, activity, and social interactions. We aim to provide an updated systematic review of the prevalence of endometriosis in adolescents with pelvic pain presenting for gynecological investigation.

Data Sources

We searched Medline, Embase, and Cinahl from 2011 to July 2019.

Methods Of Study Selection

We included cohort studies of adolescents with pelvic pain undergoing gynecological investigation. Two authors independently selected studies and extracted study characteristics and prevalence data. Methodological quality was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program for cohort studies.

Results

This updated systematic review evaluated a total of 19 studies including 1243 symptomatic adolescents. In all, 648 of 1011 (64%) adolescents undergoing laparoscopy were found to have endometriosis. The prevalence ranged from 25% to 100%, with a mean prevalence of 64%. Thirteen studies including 381 participants categorized disease severity using the revised American Society of Reproductive Medicine classification. Among these, 53% of participants (201/381) had stage I, 28% (105/381) had stage II, 20% (76/381) had stage III, and 13% (49/381) had stage IV disease.

Conclusions

The prevalence of endometriosis among adolescents with pelvic pain symptoms is high. Endometriosis is treatable, and prompt recognition will help to ensure that adolescents are signposted earlier to appropriate specialists. The management of adolescents with suspected endometriosis should be consistent with best practice guidance. Despite recommendations to increase the awareness and knowledge of endometriosis in adolescence, minimal research has followed.

### Adolescent endometriosis [^5b96d42e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is a cause of chronic, pelvic pain in adolescents. Lack of response to NSAIDS and OCPs should prompt further investigation and subsequent treatment. The goal of therapy is to minimize pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea primarily through long-term, medical therapy. Surgical intervention is principally indicated to establish a diagnosis. The poor response to surgical therapy negates the need for repetitive or radical surgery. Much patience and care should be directed toward these patients to provide them with an understanding of their disease and to help enhance the quality of their life.

### Adolescent gynecology [^25a5b0c4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Given new developments in the field of adolescent reproductive health, this review focuses on highlighting new guidelines and practice patterns in evaluation and management of adolescent gynecologic problems. First, understanding the proper techniques for the initial examination is key to establishing a long-term relationship with this age group. Reservations about the first gynecologic examination are common, and the practitioner's goal is foremost to make the patient as comfortable as possible. Preventive health in this patient population is key, and practitioners should become comfortable with providing education about topics as diverse as sexuality, eating disorders, and dating violence. Furthermore, the frequency with which teenagers report sexual activity and the high unintended pregnancy rate in this age group makes counseling regarding effective contraception essential. Additionally, practitioners are encouraged to take the opportunity to discuss the availability of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine with adolescents. In 2007, adolescents were designated as a special population, given the frequency with which they acquire and clear mild HPV-related cervical dysplasia. More conservative treatment in this population is generally favored. During their transition through puberty, disorders of menstruation become the most common complaint requiring the attention of the gynecologist. Most commonly, anovulation serves as the cause behind such abnormal bleeding. Polycystic ovarian syndrome can develop in early puberty and carry its consequences into adulthood. Infertility, diabetes, and hirsutism mark the most important components of the syndrome and require age-appropriate management. Finally, the consequences of endometriosis on the future fertility of adolescents have brought early intervention to light. Recognition and prompt treatment are advocated to prevent the future implications of this disease.

Figure 1. Approach to the adolescent with dysmenorrhea — When history suggests primary dysmenorrhea, empiric treatment includes Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, Hormonal therapies, and Nonpharmacologic strategies (Exercise, Smoking cessation, Modification of diet, Acupuncture). If the patient responds to therapy, continue treatment for primary dysmenorrhea. If the patient does not respond to therapy or symptoms or history are suggestive of secondary dysmenorrhea, consider secondary dysmenorrhea and proceed to evaluation: consider pelvic examination and pelvic ultrasonography. With positive findings, treat etiology of secondary dysmenorrhea (eg, relieve obstruction). With negative findings, consider multidisciplinary chronic pelvic pain evaluation, consider laparoscopy, and consider endometriosis.

### Optimal management of endometriosis and pain [^2ba9c6f5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

The pathophysiology of endometriosis-associated pain involves inflammatory and hormonal alterations and changes in brain signaling pathways. Although medical treatment can provide temporary relief, most patients can achieve long-term sustained pain relief when it is combined with surgical intervention. Owing to its complexity, there is an ongoing debate about how to optimally manage endometriosis-associated pain. We believe optimal management for this condition requires: 1) possible egg preservation in affected young patients with and without endometriomas; 2) preoperative medical suppression to inhibit ovulation and to avoid removal of functional cysts that might look like endometriomas; and 3) postoperative hormonal suppression to decrease recurrence, but this treatment should be modified according to disease severity, symptoms, and fertility goals.

### Management of adolescent chronic pelvic pain from endometriosis: a pain center perspective [^9d041b48]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the options for the treatment of chronic pelvic pain in adolescents with endometriosis.

Methods

Review of publications and description of author's experience relating to adolescent endometriosis and pain treatment.

Results

Pain treatment services offer a multidisciplinary approach for the treatment of chronic pelvic pain consisting of analgesic trials, cognitive-behavioral therapy, physical therapy, and complementary and alternative therapies. Patients are also evaluated for other conditions that might contribute to their chronic pain. Medication trials of antidepressants, anticonvulsants, tramadol, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are frequently used; however, there are limited data on efficacy. Biobehavioral techniques such as relaxation and biofeedback can help patients modify their experience of pain. Cognitive behavioral therapy can improve coping skills and promote improved functioning, particularly in patients who are debilitated from chronic pain. Transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) and physical therapy approaches may be helpful in patients with musculoskeletal conditions that contribute to their pelvic pain. Complementary and alternative therapies are frequently used in the treatment of chronic pain; controlled trials are needed to assess efficacy.

Conclusions

An individualized, multidisciplinary approach may be effective in improving overall outcome in patients with chronic pelvic pain in reducing pain and normalizing function.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 760: dysmenorrhea and endometriosis in the adolescent [^11f50930]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of suspected secondary dysmenorrhea — Most adolescents who present with dysmenorrhea have primary dysmenorrhea and will respond well to empiric treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), hormonal suppression, or both; however, patients who present with symptoms suggesting secondary dysmenorrhea or who fail empiric treatment require further evaluation. Additionally, if a patient has pain for 3–6 months, a more comprehensive evaluation of chronic pelvic pain should be performed with a history and focused physical examination to assess potential gastroenterologic, urologic, musculoskeletal, and psychosocial etiologies of pain. A pelvic examination to evaluate potential etiologies of secondary dysmenorrhea should be considered, and with education and support many adolescents who are not sexually active are able to tolerate a pelvic examination. Pelvic imaging with ultrasonography, regardless of findings on pelvic examination, also should be considered during evaluation for secondary dysmenorrhea, and ultrasonography is the most appropriate initial imaging modality to identify potential etiologies, including obstructive reproductive tract anomalies, uterine myomas, and adnexal masses with endometriomas.

Historically thought of as a disease that affects adult women, endometriosis increasingly is being diagnosed in the adolescent population. This disorder, which was originally described more than a century ago, still represents a vague and perplexing entity that frequently results in chronic pelvic pain, adhesive disease, and infertility. The purpose of this Committee Opinion is to highlight the differences in adolescent and adult types of endometriosis. Early diagnosis and treatment during adolescence may decrease disease progression and prevent subsequent infertility.

### Dysmenorrhea in adolescents and young adults: etiology and management [^6f8cf215]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Dysmenorrhea is the most common gynecologic complaint among adolescent and young adult females. Dysmenorrhea in adolescents and young adults is usually primary (functional), and is associated with normal ovulatory cycles and with no pelvic pathology. In approximately 10% of adolescents and young adults with severe dysmenorrhea symptoms, pelvic abnormalities such as endometriosis or uterine anomalies may be found. Potent prostaglandins and potent leukotrienes play an important role in generating dysmenorrhea symptoms. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are the most common pharmacologic treatment for dysmenorrhea. Adolescents and young adults with symptoms that do not respond to treatment with NSAIDs for 3 menstrual periods should be offered combined estrogen/progestin oral contraceptive pills for 3 menstrual cycles. Adolescents and young adults with dysmenorrhea who do not respond to this treatment should be evaluated for secondary causes of dysmenorrhea. The care provider's role is to explain about pathophysiology of dysmenorrhea to every adolescent and young adult female, address any concern that the patient has about her menstrual period, and review effective treatment options for dysmenorrhea with the patient.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 760: dysmenorrhea and endometriosis in the adolescent [^2788126a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Adolescent endometriosis — diagnostic laparoscopy and treatment considerations include that if a patient is undergoing a diagnostic laparoscopy for dysmenorrhea or chronic pain, or both, consideration should be given to placing a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) at the time of laparoscopy to minimize the pain of insertion. Recommended treatment for endometriosis in adolescents is conservative surgical therapy for diagnosis and treatment combined with ongoing suppressive medical therapies to prevent endometrial proliferation. For pain refractory to conservative surgical therapy and suppressive hormonal therapy, patients often benefit from at least 6 months of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy with add-back medicine. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs should be the mainstay of pain relief for adolescents with endometriosis, and adolescents should not be prescribed narcotics long-term to manage endometriosis outside of a specialized pain management team. The appearance of endometriosis may be different in an adolescent than in an adult woman, and in adolescents, endometriotic lesions are typically clear or red and can be difficult to identify for gynecologists unfamiliar with endometriosis in adolescents.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 760: dysmenorrhea and endometriosis in the adolescent [^b59b4b3b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Dysmenorrhea, or menstrual pain, is the most common menstrual symptom among adolescent girls and young women. Most adolescents experiencing dysmenorrhea have primary dysmenorrhea, defined as painful menstruation in the absence of pelvic pathology. When the patient's history suggests primary dysmenorrhea, empiric treatment should be initiated. When a patient does not experience clinical improvement for her dysmenorrhea within 3–6 months of therapy initiation, her obstetrician-gynecologist should investigate for possible secondary causes and for treatment adherence. Secondary dysmenorrhea refers to painful menses due to pelvic pathology or a recognized medical condition. Endometriosis is the leading cause of secondary dysmenorrhea in adolescents. Endometriosis should be considered in patients with persistent, clinically significant dysmenorrhea despite treatment with hormonal agents and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, particularly if no other etiology for chronic pelvic pain or secondary dysmenorrhea has been identified based on history, physical examination, and pelvic ultrasonography. The appearance of endometriosis may be different in an adolescent than in an adult woman. In adolescents, endometriotic lesions are typically clear or red and can be difficult to identify for gynecologists unfamiliar with endometriosis in adolescents. Endometriosis in adolescents is considered a chronic disease with potential for progression if left untreated. The goals of therapy include symptom relief, suppression of disease progression, and protection of future fertility. Therapy must be individualized, and obstetrician-gynecologists should consider patient choice, the need for contraception, contraindications to hormone use, and potential adverse effects and counsel the adolescent and her family on treatment options.

### Progression of endometriosis in non-medically managed adolescents: a case series [^9b3283dd]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Endometriosis is considered a progressive disease that can cause chronic pelvic pain and infertility. A combined medical-surgical approach is the best method to slow the progression of endometriosis. Adolescents who are not maintained on a medical regimen postoperatively may be at risk for disease progression.

Cases

This is a case series of three adolescent patients who presented at 13 to 16 years of age with complaint of severe pelvic pain and were diagnosed with stage 1 endometriosis at the time of laparoscopy. They were then prescribed menstrual suppressive therapy but did not remain compliant with their regimens.

Results and Conclusions

Each patient returned to the operating room and underwent a second laparoscopy which revealed that each patient's disease had progressed to a higher stage. Without combined surgical-medical management, disease worsens, and places patients at risk for severe chronic pelvic pain as well as infertility.

ACOG adolescent primary dysmenorrhea — nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are first-line and patient education and dosing timing are emphasized, while opioids should not be used. "When the patient's history suggests primary dysmenorrhea, empiric treatment should be initiated". "Because NSAIDs interrupt cyclooxygenase-mediated prostaglandin production, they are considered a first-line treatment option", and "NSAIDs are significantly better than placebo in providing pain relief from primary dysmenorrhea". "Obstetrician–gynecologists should recommend NSAID dosage on an individual basis", with use "most effective when started 1–2 days before the onset of menses and continued through the first 2–3 days of bleeding", and taking with food and fluids may mitigate adverse effects. If inadequate relief occurs, "a different agent can be tried". Education is key because "patient education is essential" and "a brief educational intervention can result in enhanced medication knowledge and a decrease in pain associated with dysmenorrhea". Given risks, "opioids (including tramadol) should not be used as a treatment for dysmenorrhea", as dependence can occur "for as few as 7 days", hyperalgesia can result from repeated use, and these effects "make opioids an inappropriate treatment for adolescents with dysmenorrhea".

### Elevating and empowering reproductive futures: pediatric and adolescent gynecology's specialized care across the globe [^526f5b2d]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Pediatric and adolescent gynecology (PAG) is a vital medical specialty that addresses the unique reproductive health needs of adolescent girls, tackling issues such as high adolescent birth rates (42 per 1000 girls aged 15–19 years globally in 2021). It also addresses prevalent menstrual disorders such as dysmenorrhea affecting school attendance, and rising sexually transmitted infections (STIs), with nearly half of new cases occurring in 15‐ to 24‐year‐olds. By providing specialized and developmentally appropriate care, PAG experts empower girls and young women to navigate these challenges, fostering informed decision‐making and improved health outcomes. PAG providers are dedicated to the comprehensive care of young girls, adolescents, and their families. This specialty also adopts a biopsychosocial approach, emphasizing respect for diversity and inclusion. Furthermore, it addresses the emotional, psychological, social, and cultural aspects alongside medical needs.

Girls and adolescents may present with a wide range of gynecologic conditions requiring tailored expertise to ensure that their unique healthcare needs are met. Pediatric and adolescent gynecologists provide holistic and personalized care that goes beyond traditional gynecological treatment, ensuring that patients are supported in their physical health, mental well‐being, and social development.

This specialty spans various fields and actions, including the management of menstruation and sexual development and the diagnosis and treatment of congenital and acquired reproductive anomalies. This also includes sexual health education, prevention and management of STIs, and addressing psychosocial issues related to puberty and reproductive health and rights of the child. The interdisciplinary approach emphasizes close collaboration with mental health professionals, social workers, and other healthcare providers to serve the overall well‐being of the adolescent patient (Box 1).

### ACR appropriateness criteria® endometriosis [^87c0f61e]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is a common condition impacting individuals assigned female at birth. Though incompletely understood, the disorder is caused by endometrial-like tissue located outside of the endometrial cavity, associated with inflammation and fibrosis. Clinical presentation is variable, ranging from asymptomatic to severe pelvic pain and infertility. Treatment is determined by the patient's individualized goals and can include medical therapies to temporize symptoms or definitive surgical excision. Imaging is used to help diagnose endometriosis and for treatment planning. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Lack of data-driven treatment guidelines and wide variation in management of chronic pelvic pain in adolescents and young adults [^704db68d]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Current literature lacks data-driven guidelines for surgical treatment of adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with chronic pelvic pain. We hypothesized that there is a significant variation in treatment of these patients, which might be an indicator of over- or undertreatment by some providers.

Design and Setting

We completed a retrospective population-based analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 1998 to 2016.

Participants

We included AYA patients aged 9–25 years whose primary diagnosis was adenomyosis, endometriosis, or chronic pelvic pain. Patients who might have undergone pelvic or abdominal procedures for other primary diagnoses were excluded.

Interventions and Main Outcome Measures

Trends of inpatient surgical intervention were calculated. Logistic regression was performed to determine the likelihood of undergoing an intervention, adjusted for patient demographic characteristics.

Results

A total of 13,111 AYA patients were analyzed. Median age at diagnosis was 22 (interquartile range, 20–24) years. The overall inpatient intervention rate was 5879/13111 (45.0%) (2445/5897 (18.6%) for excision/ablation, 2057/5897 (15.7%) for hysterectomy, 1239/5897 (9.5%) for diagnostic laparoscopy, and 156/5897 (1.2%) for biopsy). Rate of hysterectomy increased in the late 2000s while rates of all other interventions decreased. Patients in the northeast were less likely to undergo an intervention than patients in the rest of the country. Rates of intervention also differed according to race, insurance status, and type of hospital.

Conclusion

There is wide variation in the use of surgical treatment for chronic pelvic pain in AYA patients across the country and between types of institutions. Of concern, the rate of hysterectomy has increased over time. There is a need for data-directed treatment guidelines for the management of AYA patients with chronic pelvic pain to ensure appropriate application of surgical treatments and expand high-value surgical care.

### Surgical management of endometriosis in adolescents versus adults: a national surgical quality improvement program study [^a3ce1945]. Fertility and Sterility (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the postoperative diagnoses and the types of surgical intervention, excluding hysterectomy, between adolescents and adults receiving endometriosis surgery.

Design

Retrospective cohort.

Subjects

Adolescents (aged < 18 years) and adults (aged 18–50) with a postoperative diagnosis of endometriosis (excluding adenomyosis/endometriosis of the uterus) based on International Classification of Diseases codes, who received endometriosis surgery in hospitals participating in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program adult and pediatric databases (2012–2021).

Exposure

Endometriosis surgery excluding hysterectomy, identified by Current Procedural Terminology codes.

Main Outcome Measures

Postoperative diagnoses, uterine-sparing endometriosis procedures, and 30-day postoperative complications between age groups.

Results

We identified 291 adolescents, median age 17 years (IQR 15–17), and 8785 adults, median age 34 years IQR 28–39), who underwent uterine-sparing surgery with a postoperative diagnosis of endometriosis. The majority of adolescents (78%) and adults (60%) were White, although adults were significantly more diverse across racial groups (p < 0.001) and ethnic groups (6% vs 10% p = .006). A higher proportion of surgeries in adolescents were for peritoneal endometriosis (65% vs. 35%), whereas more adults underwent surgery for endometrioma (10% vs. 26%) or other endometriosis subtypes (25% vs 39%) (p < 0.001). Laparoscopic excision/destruction of lesions was the most common procedure performed in adolescents (75%). While this remained the most common procedure in adults (59%), their endometriosis diagnoses were associated with a more diverse range of procedures. Diagnostic laparoscopy was more commonly performed in adolescents and rarely in adults (20% vs 2%) (p < 0.001). 30-day complications were rare in both groups.

Conclusion

Adolescents were more likely to undergo diagnostic laparoscopy or laparoscopic excision/destruction of lesions and be diagnosed with peritoneal endometriosis, whereas adults underwent a more diverse range of procedures for varied subtypes. Complications for endometriosis procedures were rare. Our findings support the notion of distinct variation in endometriosis between these age groups.

### Glycemic regulation as endometriosis adjunct treatment (GREAT) [^7b0a5713]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

Glycemic Regulation as Endometriosis Adjunct Treatment ClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview The goal of this pilot trial is to learn if a novel non-hormonal treatment, metformin hydrochloride, works to treat pelvic pain in young women with endometriosis. The main questions it aims to answer are:

- Is metformin superior to placebo in alleviating pain symptoms in young women with endometriosis.
- Does metformin alter systemic inflammatory markers over 6 months in young women with endometriosis. Endometriosis is a chronic illness defined by the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterine lining. While prevalence estimates vary depending on the population studied, endometriosis is thought to affect approximately one in ten reproductive aged women, up to 50% of women with infertility, and up to 70% of adolescents with chronic pelvic pain.

During these delays, women may suffer from debilitating symptoms interfering with school and social activities, and commonly experience reduced health-related quality of life and work productivity. When left untreated, endometriosis can progress significantly in over 50% of patients and result in a higher stage of disease. Therefore, timely intervention and maintenance of therapy is critical for preventing the progression of disease and patient burden. Therapeutic options for endometriosis include surgical and medical management. Because surgery is not curative, long-term medical therapy is often advised to prevent recurrence of symptoms and retard the progression of disease. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly used for endometriosis-related pain but do not remove or decrease deposits of ectopic endometrium.

Hormonal therapies are the mainstay of medical therapy as they can inhibit prostaglandin production that contributes to pain, and cause decidualization and atrophy of ectopic endometrial tissue. Unfortunately, hormonal treatments have varied degrees of success and no data support one treatment over another. Additionally, the treatment choice may be limited to medication side effects, availability, costs, and contraceptive needs. Hormonal treatments do not cure endometriosis; 11–19% of women may not experience any relief with medical therapy, and up to a third of women experience recurrence of pain symptoms after treatment cessation. Additionally, as endometriosis is predominantly a disease of young reproductive-aged women, patients may desire a treatment with a different mechanism of action that does not impact ovarian function and fertility. There remains an unmet clinical need among women with endometriosis for effective and well-tolerated medical therapies.

### Commentary: novel use of offset analgesia to assess adolescents and adults with treatment resistant endometriosis-associated pain [^96725bdf]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis and Pain

Endometriosis, a debilitating condition in which uterine tissue grows outside the uterus, affects approximately 176 million adults and adolescents worldwideand costs the US economy approximately $78 billion annually in pain-related disability. It has a deleterious impact on physical and emotional functioning, as well as quality of life, and is the leading cause of chronic pelvic pain (CPP). Following laparoscopic surgery, to both confirm the diagnosis and remove the ectopic tissue, patients are commonly managed with a hormonal regimen during the childbearing years. Despite these treatments, approximately 30% of women report no improvement in pain after surgery and many other patients report frequently recurring endometriosis-associated pain (EAP) without evidence of recurrent disease. With this high prevalence of pain and disease burden, there is a lack of effective treatments for this subset of treatment non-responders who continue to experience EAP. Endometriosis in adolescents is an even more challenging problem as it may present with a number of clinical and pathological differences that are not observed in adult women. Nevertheless, given the chronicity of the disease, the challenge is to avoid a delay in diagnosis, understand the disease, and direct effective therapies at an early age. Small pilot studies, in adult women have shown the maintenance and chronicity of EAP to be associated with structural and functional alterations in regions related to pain modulation suggesting that EAP is not explained by endometriosis alone, but alternatively may be explained by dysfunction in the Central Nervous System (CNS) either as a defective pain modulatory system or an increase in neuronal responsivity in central sensory and emotional pain pathways. Recent animal models have shown that the type of nerve that innervates the endometriosis lesion, as well as the location of the lesion, impact the CNS differently and thus dictate how the pain is modulated, such as peripherally, centrally, and by other central dynamic processes. As the onset of this condition may begin before menarche, and adult women report their symptoms beginning during adolescence, addressing early pre-symptomatic markers of pain chronification in the pediatric brain may change the prognosis by increasing the quality of life and protecting the health and reproductive system of adolescents with endometriosis. This can be accomplished by the novel use of a known method to better elucidate the neural mechanisms that may contribute to and maintain EAP – offset analgesia (OA). OA is increasingly used to measure endogenous pain inhibition, which is considered one of the central mechanisms facilitating (or preventing) pain and contributing to pain chronification.

### The effect of combined surgical-medical intervention on the progression of endometriosis in an adolescent and young adult population [^678953f9]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To evaluate the effect of combined surgical-medical treatment on endometriosis progression in adolescents as measured by disease stage.

Design

Retrospective chart review.

Setting

Two academic medical centers.

Participants

Sequential cases of young women identified on chart review with chronic pelvic pain unresponsive to dysmenorrheal treatment who underwent initial laparoscopy for diagnosis and surgical destruction of endometriosis. All patients were then treated with standard continuous medical therapy. Patients with exacerbation of pain on anti-endometriosis medical therapy who elected a subsequent laparoscopic procedure were eligible for this study.

Intervention

Retrospective chart review

Main Outcome Measures

Endometriosis stage and adhesions at subsequent laparoscopy as compared to the initial surgical procedure.

Results

90 patients met inclusion criteria. Eligible patients were 12 to 24 years of age at the time of the initial laparoscopy. The median endometriosis stage at first and second laparoscopy was I. No stage change was observed in 70% of patients, 19% improved by one stage, 1% improved by two stages, and 10% worsened by one stage. Regardless of initial stage, a trend toward disease progression was not observed. There was a significant likelihood for stage improvement at second laparoscopy, with those initially diagnosed as stage II or III most likely to exhibit improvement.

Conclusions

Based on the concept that endometriosis can be progressive, these data suggest that combined surgical-medical management retards disease progression in adolescents and young adults.

### Noninvasive diagnosis of endometriosis in adolescents and young female adults: a systematic review [^e4187a7d]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

Our aim was to review the evidence concerning the noninvasive diagnosis of endometriosis in adolescents.

Methods

A systematic review was written following the SWiM reporting guidelines. The study research was made across three databases (MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) to identify articles about the adolescent population and the diagnosis of endometriosis through noninvasive methods. The search included the keywords "endometriosis", "adolescents", "diagnosis", "ultrasound", and "MRI". Only English-language articles were considered, and those published prior to 2000 were excluded. The established outcomes focused on clinical symptoms, ultrasound (US), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings suggestive of endometriosis.

Results

We included 26 articles, mostly comprising case series and cross-sectional studies. The pooled analysis involved 2,299 female adolescents (age range 8–25 years old) with clinically suspected, imaged, and/or surgically confirmed endometriosis. The most frequently reported symptom was dysmenorrhea, followed by chronic pelvic pain. Among adolescents clinically suspected of endometriosis undergoing ultrasound (US), 32.8% exhibited at least one sign of endometriosis. Of the 167 patients with ultrasound-diagnosed endometriosis, 48.5% had deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE), and 45.5% had an endometrioma detected. Three studies assessed MRI findings, revealing that 49.8% presented with signs of endometriosis.

Conclusions

Dysmenorrhea and chronic pelvic pain stand out as key symptoms of adolescent endometriosis. Although their diagnostic accuracy varies, US and MRI have emerged as valuable tools for diagnosing the disease. While the US may have limitations, especially in detecting subtle lesions, MRI shows promise, even in cases with normal previous ultrasounds. Early recognition and proactive diagnosis are crucial for improving the management of endometriosis in adolescents.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 760: dysmenorrhea and endometriosis in the adolescent [^e752e6a9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG adolescent dysmenorrhea — evaluation of primary dysmenorrhea should include a focused history and selective examination, with attention to features of secondary causes and known diagnostic delays. Adolescents "may experience a longer time to diagnosis of pelvic pain (up to 5.4 years) compared with the time to diagnosis (1.9 years) in women whose symptoms began in adulthood", and "a delay in presentation, evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment is common for patients of all ages with dysmenorrhea". The "initial evaluation for all patients presenting with dysmenorrhea includes a medical, gynecologic, menstrual, family, and psychosocial history to determine whether the patient has primary dysmenorrhea or symptoms suggestive of secondary dysmenorrhea". "When a patient presents with symptoms only of primary dysmenorrhea, a pelvic examination is not necessary", but "a pelvic examination should be conducted if symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection are present". Clinicians "should suspect secondary dysmenorrhea" with severe dysmenorrhea immediately after menarche, progressive worsening, abnormal uterine bleeding, mid‑cycle or acyclic pain, infertility, lack of response to empiric treatment, family history of endometriosis, renal or other congenital anomalies, or dyspareunia; obstetrician–gynecologists "should be aware of cultural differences" and that "parental modeling also may play an important role" in symptom reporting and pain perception.

### Scientific investigation of endometriosis among adolescents [^7841d444]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

The scientific literature on endometriosis specific to the adolescent population is limited, and the existing data are retrospective and descriptive in nature. It is possible that the disease has a different pathophysiology in adolescents, but little epidemiologic or molecular data exist to support or refute this speculation. In addition, the limited literature does not yet confirm that intervening in the adolescent population prevents long-term sequelae such as pain and infertility as adults. Case-control and cohort studies to identify risk factors, as well as prospective observational and intervention studies to assess treatment outcome, are required to further knowledge about endometriosis in the adolescent population. The scientific literature on endometriosis specific to the adolescent population is limited, and the existing data are retrospective and descriptive in nature. This review summarizes studies that have been done to date and suggests areas for future investigation.

### Characteristics and preoperative management of adolescent patients with pathology-confirmed endometriosis: a multi-institutional study [^9c176339]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

This multi-institutional, observational, retrospective cohort study aimed to characterize the demographics and preoperative medical management of patients with pathology-confirmed endometriosis.

Methods

We reviewed patients < 22 years at 8 tertiary care pediatric hospitals in the Midwestern United States who underwent diagnostic laparoscopy and had biopsy-confirmed endometriosis. Patients were identified through pathology records. Demographics, medical history, clinical symptoms, and prior medical management were extracted. Descriptive statistics were computed.

Results

Among 305 patients, median age at first presentation to pediatric and adolescent gynecology (PAG) was 15.6 years (interquartile range: 14.2–17.1). Most patients were White (83.3%) and most had commercial insurance (70.5%). Only 4.3% had a diagnosis of endometriosis prior to their initial presentation to PAG. Common symptoms included progressive dysmenorrhea (76.7%), heavy menstrual bleeding (50.8%), missed school/activities due to dysmenorrhea (55.1%). Patients sought care for their symptoms from a range of providers in addition to PAG, including primary care/adolescent medicine (75.1%), gastroenterology (18.7%), adult gynecology (22.3%), and physical therapy (13.4%). Nearly all patients (92.8%) tried oral hormonal menstrual suppression prior to laparoscopy. Hormonal management included combined oral contraception (62.3%), medroxyprogesterone acetate injection (15.7%), ≤ 5mg daily norethindrone (14.8%), > 5mg daily norethindrone (13.4%), hormonal intrauterine system (13.1%), and contraceptive implant (5.3%).

Conclusions

Patients with pathology-proven endometriosis typically presented with progressive dysmenorrhea, missed school or activities, and heavy menstrual bleeding. They sought care from a variety of providers and while most tried hormonal management of symptoms, the method used varied.

Endometrial ablation in adolescents — Endometrial ablation destroys most or all of the endometrium and was designed for women who have completed childbearing to alleviate heavy cycles. The rates of amenorrhea range from 13% to 83%, and complications include pain, cramping, and continued bleeding as well as the need for additional procedures. Ablation leads to only relative infertility, and birth control is still recommended, because pregnancy after an ablation may have complications. There are no studies on use of ablation in adolescents including long-term consequences and outcomes, and therefore, endometrial ablation is not recommended for this age group.

### Shining a light on endometriosis: time to listen and take action [^652b09bc]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Therefore, we urgently need approaches towards better disease management, education, and awareness involving all relevant stakeholders to eliminate stigmatization and provide timely diagnosis and treatment. It is important to note that there is no cure at the moment. Still, good management options, including pain management, hormone therapy, or surgery, can significantly improve patients' lives. For example, studies suggest a 62.5% improvement or resolution of pain 6 months after laparoscopy, a standard surgical treatment to remove endometrial tissue, with 90% still improved 1 year post-surgery. However, the average time to diagnosis is lengthy, and it can take over 7 years for patients to receive a proper diagnosis and, thus, treatment.

Simple solutions seldom resolve complex problems. Improving the lives of patients with endometriosis will require a multifaceted approach that involves the scientific community, healthcare providers, and society at large by focusing on the following:
Research funding: We must invest in endometriosis research to build knowledge about the pathophysiology and develop new treatments. Advocacy groups and government agencies should be encouraged to fund studies to increase our understanding of the condition and provide better treatment options.
Medical education: Medical schools and residency programs should include more information about endometriosis and its symptoms to ensure that healthcare providers can recognize the condition earlier and provide timely and appropriate care.
Patient advocacy and public awareness campaigns: Support groups for people with endometriosis should be encouraged to share information and resources on various platforms, such as social media and blogs. Providing an open forum for exchange will help increase the chances of early diagnosis and alleviate patients' mental burden by making them feel heard and connected.

### Abstract… [^27d969ae]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Among symptomatic adolescents with dysmenorrhea, the prevalence of endometriosis is estimated at 50% to 70% for those with chronic pelvic pain and up to 75% for those with pain unresponsive to medical treatment. 1 Data for population distributions, disease manifestations, and risk factors are limited to patients who are successfully diagnosed, which may introduce bias related to access to care.

1. Surgical Treatment Surgical management is indicated if empiric therapy is ineffective, if medical management is not tolerated, or to immediately diagnose and treat the patient, as in the case of an adnexal mass or treatment of infertility. 16 From a cost perspective, surgical management after failure of three medications may be the most cost-effective approach; further delay may increase cost and decrease quality of life.
39. Surgical excision of endometriotic tissue for treatment of pain was thought to be effective.

However, based on limited evidence, an updated Cochrane review reported uncertainty about whether laparoscopic surgery improves endometriosis pain at six and 12 months compared with diagnostic laparoscopy alone. Complementary and Alternative Treatments Patients with endometriosis often ask about dietary changes or other interventions that might allow them to gain control of their symptoms. Alternative treatments for endometriosis such as acupuncture, exercise, and dietary changes may help improve pain symptoms, although there is limited evidence to support these alternatives. A meta-analysis of acupuncture treatment showed a reduction in pelvic pain compared with placebo; acupuncture treatments varied from once weekly for five weeks to twice weekly for eight weeks. 46 A systematic review showed inconclusive evidence regarding the effects of physical activity and exercise on symptoms of endometriosis.

47 An observational study evaluating dietary changes in patients with endometriosis found that some dietary modifications reduced perceived pain symptoms without identifying any association between diet and improvement in quality of life. 48 Another systematic review showed limited evidence of nutrient supplements improving symptoms of endometriosis.
49. 50 Patients with infertility do not benefit from diagnostic laparoscopy any more than patients with other symptoms of endometriosis, 44 although once infertility has been established and the patient desires pregnancy, laparoscopic surgery is an effective treatment for minimal to mild disease. In those with mild disease, laparoscopic surgery may improve spontaneous pregnancy and live birth rates compared with expectant management.

### Surgical management of superficial peritoneal adolescent endometriosis [^9d64771c]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Adolescent endometriosis typically presents as stage I with superficial peritoneal disease and less commonly as stage III or IV with deeply infiltrative disease. Endometriosis lesions can be destroyed (cautery or laser), cutting out the discrete lesion with excision and destroyed, or radically excised with removal of the lesion and surrounding tissue. It has been shown to be beneficial to excise deeply infiltrative disease to improve pain. Radical excision has been promoted by a subset of surgeons and involves removal of large areas of peritoneum with the promise/proposal of a cure and suggestion of no need for medical suppression of endometriosis. The best technique to manage superficial peritoneal disease has not yet been defined.

Case

A 15-year-old young woman with a history of 2 previous laparoscopies for pain and an ovarian cyst who underwent removal of a mucinous cystadenoma, presented to a local gynecologist with chronic pelvic pain. She underwent a third laparoscopy and was found to have superficial peritoneal endometriosis and filmy adhesions believed to be due to the previous ovarian surgery. The endometriosis was surgically destroyed with the use of cautery and the filmy adhesions were lysed. Months later she had a return of pain and was advised to have a fourth laparoscopy with radical excision by an "excisionalist" gynecologist. She was found to have superficial peritoneal disease with ASRM-defined stage I endometriosis and underwent radical excision of the peritoneum of the anterior cul de sac, posterior cul de sac, and both pelvic side walls. She was informed that she had been cured of her endometriosis and was thus not treated with postoperative hormonal suppression. Her pain did not improve and in fact worsened after the radical excisional surgery. She self-referred for care. She started menstrual suppression treatment with continuous estrogen/progestin therapy for medical treatment of endometriosis but after 6 months she was still having severe pain without bleeding. Eight months after the radical excisional surgery she elected to have a fifth laparoscopy to address potential adhesions. At that time she was found to have extensive pelvic adhesions with the uterus adherent to the anterior cul de sac, and adhesions in the posterior cul de sac. In addition, both ovaries were involved with adhesions and adherent to the pelvic side walls. She was found to have clear and red lesions of superficial peritoneal endometriosis. She underwent a lysis of adhesions, and excision of lesions, and destruction of endometriosis. Her pain improved postoperatively; menstrual suppression was continued and she has remained with a continued excellent quality of life with over 2 years of follow-up.

Summary and Conclusion

For this patient, radical excisional surgery resulted in increased pain and extensive adhesion formation. It was not curative because endometriosis was documented on follow-up surgery. In a previously published long-term follow-up report of adolescents with recurrent pain 2–10 years after destruction of superficial peritoneal disease, it was reported that there were no increased adhesions and no trend toward disease progression. Excisional gynecologists who perform this procedure should not suggest that radical excisional surgery is helpful and without increased risk, until studies have shown long-term benefit in the surgical management of superficial peritoneal endometriosis.

### Markers of adult endometriosis detectable in adolescence [^28f325f2]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Endometriosis, a disease of young females that is possibly a devastating ailment requiring surgery, appears to be associated with certain features encountered in adolescence. First among these symptoms is the history of severe and lasting dysmenorrhea at the time of adolescence and the need to use oral contraceptives (OCs) for alleviating dysmenorrhea that failed to respond to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Further awareness about existing associations between certain symptoms experienced at adolescence and the later development of endometriosis is important. Indeed, the possibility of diagnosing endometriosis earlier when suggested by clinical history could lead to less extensive surgery and thus, less damage. Experimental verification of this insight, however, is needed before the concept that early diagnosis means lesser destructive surgery can be ascertained.

### ESUR consensus MRI for endometriosis: indications, reporting, and classifications [^fa6ecb16]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The experts did not reach an agreement regarding the use of MRI in follow-up to monitor medical treatment response (50%, 10/20), even though this type of indication is becoming more established in clinical practice.

Statement 1: MRI is recommended when TVUS is inconclusive in diagnosing endometriosis or negative, in a symptomatic patient (Grade A, strong agreement), before surgery or interventional procedure, or after surgical treatment if symptoms persist (strong agreement).

When TVUS is not feasible (virgins, adolescents, and patients who are unable to undergo the transvaginal examination due to pain, vaginismus, or claustrophobia), MRI can be indicated as a first-line technique.

Classification and reporting

Usefulness of MR classifications

Disease staging is crucial for both clinical and research activities related to endometriosis. No single staging system is universally competent or applicable to all aspects of endometriosis care, and different approaches should be viewed as complementary. Multiple surgical and radiological classifications exist; however, a broad international consensus has not yet been reached to indicate which of these systems should be recommended for routine use.

Surgical classifications provide a comprehensive staging of DE and evaluate peritoneal, ovarian, and tubal involvement, as well as the presence of adenomyosis. Prominent among these are the American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists (AAGL), the revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine (rASRM), and the #Enzian classification. It is essential to recognize the distinction between the surgeon's operative perspective and the radiologist's imaging perspective in evaluating a given patient. The radiologist visualizes the entire pelvis in cross-section, encompassing all organs and anatomical spaces within a single visual field, in fact, in multiple anatomical orthogonal planes, which is the major advantage. In contrast, the surgeon, through laparoscopy, views the peritoneum and the external surface of underlying organs. Laparoscopic surgical classifications do not provide a comprehensive evaluation of pelvic endometriosis. The surgeon cannot initially visualize the internal structures of organs or retroperitoneal spaces, nor can they directly assess the depth of DE within organs or discern the boundaries between organs in cases of obliterated cul-de-sac or the precise location of DE lesions. Radiologists, therefore, must invest time and effort into understanding evolving disease concepts and treatment options and maintain effective communication with referring colleagues to ensure their knowledge remains current across medical fields beyond radiology. By integrating imaging expertise with an understanding of disease management, radiologists contribute significantly to patient care.
