## Question

treatment for tonsillitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment for tonsillitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify the presentation into acute versus recurrent disease. Then, I should verify the likely etiologies and how to distinguish viral from bacterial causes. Next, I will review diagnostic strategies, including Centor/McIsaac and testing. After that, I will outline treatment for acute viral tonsillitis, followed by acute bacterial tonsillitis, including antibiotic choices and durations. Then, I should consider adjunctive therapies like corticosteroids and analgesia. Next, I will examine management of recurrent tonsillitis, including watchful waiting, documentation, and surgical thresholds. Finally, I will address special populations and complications, and close with a concise decision algorithm and key takeaways, ensuring each step is supported by appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical classification, because management hinges on whether this is acute tonsillitis versus recurrent disease, and whether episodes meet established frequency thresholds. Recurrent disease is typically defined as at least 7 episodes in 1 year, 5 per year for 2 years, or 3 per year for 3 years, with documentation of clinical features such as fever, cervical adenopathy, exudate, or positive GAS testing, and this framing will guide whether watchful waiting or surgery is appropriate [^112qqLdB] [^1135uPKm] [^1161NMiE].

> I need to check the etiologic spectrum next. Most cases of acute tonsillitis are viral, roughly 70–95%, whereas group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus accounts for about 15–30% in school-aged children and 5–15% in adults, so I should avoid reflex antibiotics in the absence of bacterial features or testing, and I should remember that rapid antigen testing has imperfect sensitivity and that culture can be reserved for selected scenarios or negative RADT with high suspicion in children and adolescents [^112BrrDu] [^113noMib].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify the diagnostic approach using validated clinical decision rules and targeted testing, applying Centor or McIsaac criteria to stratify pretest probability, then using RADT in those with intermediate to high scores and confirming negative RADT with culture in children and adolescents when suspicion remains, while avoiding routine testing in very low-risk presentations and recognizing that some guidelines differ in their emphasis on microbiologic confirmation versus symptomatic management [^113noMib] [^111oj5uS] [^115iJUQZ].

> For acute viral tonsillitis, I will now examine supportive care as the cornerstone. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen for analgesia and antipyresis, hydration, rest, and saltwater gargles are appropriate, and I should avoid antibiotics given the lack of benefit and potential harms, reserving antivirals only for specific viral etiologies such as influenza when indicated, and I should counsel on expected course and red flags for deterioration [^112BrrDu] [^113noMib].

> For acute bacterial tonsillitis due to GAS, I should confirm first-line therapy as penicillin or amoxicillin because of efficacy, narrow spectrum, and low cost. Penicillin V 500 mg twice daily or four times daily for 10 days is standard, with amoxicillin 775 mg once daily for 10 days as an FDA-approved alternative in patients 12 years and older, and I need to ensure a full 10-day course to optimize eradication and reduce relapse risk [^111oj5uS] [^113Zj4kc] [^1111hcv5] [^113d21E2].

> Wait, let me verify whether shorter courses are acceptable. Randomized trials suggest penicillin V 800 mg four times daily for 5 days can be noninferior to 10-day regimens for clinical cure in selected patients with high Centor scores and confirmed GAS, but bacteriologic eradication may be lower and the evidence is less robust for preventing complications, so if I choose a 5-day course, I should select patients carefully and discuss trade-offs [^112C7jMv] [^114xemQF] [^114PoHuJ] [^115fzEtm].

> I should double-check alternatives for penicillin allergy. For nonanaphylactic reactions, first-generation cephalosporins are reasonable, whereas for anaphylaxis, macrolides such as azithromycin can be used with attention to local resistance patterns, noting that azithromycin 12 mg/kg once daily for 5 days is FDA-labeled for pediatric pharyngitis/tonsillitis and that some meta-analytic data suggest modest differences in relapse or symptom resolution across classes without clear superiority over penicillin overall [^113noMib] [^115HUdJt] [^117DGZeP] [^114AaBsW].

> Next, I should review adjunctive therapies. A single low dose of corticosteroid such as oral dexamethasone up to 10 mg can increase the likelihood of pain relief at 24–48 hours and shorten time to pain resolution by several hours, and I should consider offering it to patients with significant odynophagia after discussing limited benefit and uncertain risks with repeated dosing, while ensuring concurrent analgesia with acetaminophen or ibuprofen and maintaining hydration support [^114dQPo6] [^113GTnrG] [^111EoFQM] [^116kskpY].

> For recurrent tonsillitis, I need to ensure a structured watchful waiting approach with meticulous documentation of each episode's features and impact before considering surgery. Guidelines strongly recommend watchful waiting if frequency is below Paradise thresholds, and they emphasize that benefits of tonsillectomy are modest and largely confined to the first postoperative year, with diminishing returns thereafter, so shared decision-making is essential [^113WzV16] [^115ccByT] [^116WzsnV] [^1164M5yV].

> Let me reconsider the surgical threshold. Tonsillectomy may be considered for children who meet Paradise criteria with adequate documentation and at least one qualifying feature per episode, or for those with modifying factors such as multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerance, PFAPA, or more than one peritonsillar abscess, and I should confirm that adenoidectomy is not routinely indicated for recurrent infection alone unless there is concomitant obstructive pathology or specific indications [^112qqLdB] [^1135uPKm] [^1112P85x] [^1145CMwM].

> I should confirm the magnitude of benefit and risks. High-quality randomized data in children show a modest reduction in moderate/severe episodes in the first year, and contemporary adult randomized data demonstrate fewer sore throat days over 24 months with immediate tonsillectomy versus conservative care, but with a nontrivial bleeding risk, so I must balance expected gains against operative morbidity and the natural tendency toward spontaneous improvement in many patients [^111h4gkF] [^1135bRHv] [^1139QbJo] [^113zrmde].

> But wait, what if the patient has PFAPA? In that specific phenotype, tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy has high-quality evidence for dramatic reductions in episode frequency and severity, with an NNT around 2 for sustained resolution, so the threshold for surgery is substantially lower when PFAPA is confidently diagnosed and symptoms are impairing [^1145CMwM].

> I will now examine special populations and complications. In children under 3 years or with severe OSA, post-tonsillectomy monitoring is recommended, and codeine should be avoided after pediatric tonsillotmy, while peritonsillar abscess warrants urgent drainage and may lower the threshold for interval tonsillectomy if recurrences occur, and in patients with IgA nephropathy and recurrent GAS tonsillitis, tonsillectomy may be considered as part of disease-modifying care in nephrology contexts [^111JxXht] [^115Azyv2] [^117C9Y3z].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway. For acute presentations, I should classify severity, apply Centor/McIsaac, test appropriately, treat confirmed GAS with penicillin or amoxicillin for 10 days in most cases while considering a 5-day high-dose penicillin V regimen selectively, provide analgesia and consider a single dose of corticosteroid for significant pain, and for recurrent disease, I should verify frequency and documentation, pursue watchful waiting if below thresholds, and discuss tonsillectomy for those meeting Paradise criteria or with modifying factors, ensuring shared decision-making throughout [^113noMib] [^112C7jMv] [^114dQPo6] [^113WzV16] [^112qqLdB].

> Finally, I should double-check stewardship and follow-up. Antibiotics provide only modest symptom benefit even in confirmed GAS and should be reserved for appropriate candidates, documentation of episodes and their impact is critical to avoid unnecessary surgery, and patients should receive clear return precautions for airway compromise, dehydration, or persistent symptoms beyond 5 days despite therapy, with re-evaluation if clinical course deviates from expectations [^114AaBsW] [^111yKUAS] [^113noMib].

Tonsillitis treatment is tailored to etiology and severity: **most cases are viral** and need only supportive care (analgesics, hydration, rest) [^112BrrDu]; **bacterial cases** (GAS) require penicillin or amoxicillin for 10 days [^111oj5uS], with alternatives for allergy [^113noMib]. Corticosteroids can **shorten pain duration** when used with antibiotics [^114dQPo6] [^113GTnrG]. Tonsillectomy is reserved for **severe recurrent disease** (≥ 7/year, ≥ 5/year for 2 years, or ≥ 3/year for 3 years) with documentation [^112qqLdB] [^1135uPKm] or for complications (e.g. peritonsillar abscess) [^1112P85x]. Supportive care includes hydration, NSAIDs/acetaminophen, saltwater gargles, and rest; **avoid antibiotics unless bacterial infection is confirmed** [^112BrrDu] [^113noMib].

---

## Supportive care

Supportive care is the cornerstone of treatment for **viral tonsillitis** and is also recommended for bacterial cases alongside antibiotics [^112BrrDu]:

- **Hydration**: Encourage oral fluids to prevent dehydration [^notfound].

- **Analgesics and antipyretics**: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain and fever control [^113SCypi].

- **Saltwater gargles**: Provide symptomatic relief for throat discomfort [^notfound].

- **Rest**: Adequate rest to support recovery [^notfound].

---

## Antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are indicated for **confirmed or highly suspected bacterial tonsillitis**, particularly group A Streptococcus (GAS) [^113SCypi]:

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage and duration** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Penicillin V | 500 mg orally twice daily or 250 mg four times daily for 10 days | First-line treatment for GAS tonsillitis [^111oj5uS] |
| Amoxicillin | 775 mg once daily for 10 days | Alternative first-line treatment for GAS tonsillitis [^113noMib] |
| Azithromycin | 12 mg/kg once daily for 5 days | Alternative for penicillin-allergic patients [^113SCypi] |
| Cefuroxime axetil | 250 mg twice daily for 10 days | Alternative for penicillin-allergic patients [^notfound] |

---

Antibiotics provide modest benefits in symptom relief and reduce the risk of complications such as rheumatic fever and peritonsillar abscess [^114AaBsW] [^11749bsW].

---

## Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids may be considered as adjunctive therapy in **severe cases** of tonsillitis, particularly when significant inflammation and pain are present [^116kskpY]. A single dose of dexamethasone (maximum 10 mg) has been shown to **reduce pain severity and duration** without significant adverse effects [^113GTnrG].

---

## Surgical intervention (tonsillectomy)

Tonsillectomy is indicated in **chronic or recurrent tonsillitis** that significantly impacts quality of life or fails to respond to medical management. The following criteria are commonly used to guide surgical decision-making:

- **Frequency**: ≥ 7 episodes in one year, ≥ 5 episodes per year for two consecutive years, or ≥ 3 episodes per year for three consecutive years, with documentation of each episode [^112qqLdB] [^1135uPKm].

- **Severity**: Episodes are disabling, prevent normal functioning, or are associated with complications such as peritonsillar abscess or airway obstruction [^1112P85x].

- **Failure of medical therapy**: Multiple antibiotic allergies or intolerance, or persistent infections despite appropriate antibiotic therapy [^1112P85x].

Tonsillectomy has been shown to **reduce the frequency and severity of recurrent throat infections**, although the benefits must be weighed against surgical risks such as bleeding, infection, and anesthesia-related complications [^1139QbJo] [^1135bRHv].

---

## Management of complications

Complications of tonsillitis, such as peritonsillar abscess, airway obstruction, or systemic infections, require **specific interventions**:

- **Peritonsillar abscess**: Needle aspiration or incision and drainage, followed by antibiotic therapy [^115Azyv2].

- **Airway obstruction**: Immediate medical attention, possible hospitalization, and supportive measures to secure the airway [^notfound].

- **Systemic infections**: Intravenous antibiotics and supportive care in a hospital setting [^notfound].

---

## Patient education and prevention

Patient education plays a crucial role in managing tonsillitis and preventing recurrence. Emphasize **hand hygiene** to reduce transmission of infectious agents, and advise avoiding irritants such as smoking and alcohol. Reinforce adherence to prescribed antibiotic regimens to prevent recurrence and complications [^111oj5uS].

---

Tonsillitis treatment spans supportive care, antibiotics for bacterial cases, and surgery for severe or recurrent disease; **individualize care** based on etiology, severity, and patient factors, and use shared decision-making for surgical options [^112BrrDu] [^112qqLdB].

In a randomized, parallel-group, multi-center, double-blind, double-dummy study in adults and pediatrics (age ≥ 12 years) with tonsillitis and/or pharyngitis secondary to S. pyogenes, MOXATAG 775 mg QD for 10 days was non-inferior to penicillin VK 250 mg QID for 10 days.

Using strict evaluability and microbiologic response criteria 4–8 days post-therapy, the following bacteriological eradication rates and statistical outcomes in the per-protocol (PPb) and modified intent-to-treat (mITT) populations were obtained (Table 4). The mITT population included all randomized patients with a positive throat culture for S. pyogenes at baseline. The PPb population included mITT patients who had post-therapy cultures, were compliant with treatment, and didn't have major protocol violations.

### Tonsillectomy and adenotonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection in moderately affected children [^111d8Dng]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

In previous clinical trials involving children severely affected with recurrent throat infection (7 or more well-documented, clinically important, adequately treated episodes of throat infection in the preceding year, or 5 or more such episodes in each of the 2 preceding years, or 3 or more such episodes in each of the 3 preceding years), we found tonsillectomy efficacious in reducing the number and severity of subsequent episodes of throat infection for at least 2 years. The results seemed to warrant the election of tonsillectomy in children meeting the trials' stringent eligibility criteria but also provided support for nonsurgical management. We undertook the present trials to determine 1) whether tonsillectomy would afford equivalent benefit in children who were less severely affected than those in our earlier trials but who nonetheless had indications for tonsillectomy comparable to those in general use, and 2) whether, in such children, the addition of adenoidectomy would confer additional benefit.

Methods

We conducted 2 parallel randomized, controlled trials in the Ambulatory Care Center of Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. To be eligible, children were required to have had a history of recurrent episodes of throat infection that met standards slightly less stringent than the standards used in our earlier trials regarding either the frequency of previous episodes or their clinical features or their degree of documentation, but not regarding > 1 of those parameters. These reduced standards were nonetheless more stringent than those in current official guidelines, which list "3 or more infections of tonsils and/or adenoids per year despite adequate medical therapy" as an indication for tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy. Of 2174 children referred by physicians or parents, 373 met the current trials' eligibility criteria and 328 were enrolled. Of these, 177 children without obstructing adenoids or recurrent or persistent otitis media were randomized to either a tonsillectomy group, an adenotonsillectomy group, or a control group (the 3-way trial), and 151 children who had 1 or more such conditions were randomized to either an adenotonsillectomy group or a control group (the 2-way trial). Outcome measures were the occurrence of episodes of throat infection during the 3 years of follow-up; other, indirect measures of morbidity; and complications of surgery.

Results

By various measures, the incidence of throat infection was significantly lower in surgical groups than in corresponding control groups during each of the 3 follow-up years. However, even among control children, mean rates of moderate or severe episodes were low, ranging from 0.16 to 0.43 per year. Adenotonsillectomy was no more efficacious than tonsillectomy alone. Of 203 children treated with surgery, 16 (7.9%) had surgery-related complications of varying types and severity.

Conclusions

The modest benefit conferred by tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy in children moderately affected with recurrent throat infection seems not to justify the inherent risks, morbidity, and cost of the operations. We conclude that, under ordinary circumstances, neither eligibility criteria such as those used for the present trials nor the criterion for surgery in current official guidelines are sufficiently stringent for use in clinical practice.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^115q8DWH]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Tonsillar structure, immune function, and effects of tonsillitis/tonsillectomy — The palatine tonsils are lymphoepithelial organs located at the junction of the oral cavity and oropharynx, and the greatest immunologic activity of the tonsils is found between the ages of 3 and 10 years. While all 5 immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes are produced in the palatine tonsils, IgA is arguably the most important product of the tonsillar immune system. With recurrent tonsillitis, the controlled process of antigen transport and presentation is altered due to shedding of the M cells from the tonsil epithelium; nevertheless, there are no studies to date that demonstrate a significant clinical impact of tonsillectomy on the immune system.

### Novel findings on the development and immunological functions of palatine tonsils [^113Naznc]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

The palatine tonsils, positioned at the aerodigestive crossroads, serve as immunological sentinels orchestrating frontline defense through coordinated surveillance of inhaled and ingested antigens. As secondary lymphoid organs, palatine tonsils bridge innate and adaptive immunity via specialized microanatomical domains. Recent paradigm shifts now position the tonsils as dual-function immunological entities: while essential for pathogen surveillance and mucosal immunity, their dysregulated immune responses may paradoxically drive systemic inflammation. Concurrently, emerging evidence demonstrates therapeutic implications of tonsillar modulation, particularly through precision interventions such as tonsillectomy. This review examines recent advances in tonsillar anatomy and histology while critically evaluating novel insights into their pathogenic involvement in autoimmune diseases and other extra-tonsillar disorders. Furthermore, we analyze evolving perspectives on tonsil-targeted therapies as potential disease-modifying strategies. The synthesis underscores the tonsils' evolving status from regional lymphoid tissue to systemic immunomodulatory organ, bridging mucosal defense mechanisms with systemic inflammatory pathogenesis.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^114FXw6Y]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for tonsillectomy, more specifically with respect to indications for tonsillectomy, recurrent throat infections, AAO-HNS 2019 guidelines recommend to evaluate pediatric patients with recurrent throat infections not meeting criteria for tonsillectomy for modifying factors that may favor tonsillectomy, including but not limited to:

- multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerance

- periodic fever with aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis syndrome

- history of > 1 peritonsillar abscess.

### Improving antimicrobial prescribing practice for sore throat symptoms in a general practice setting [^11749bsW]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial resistance is a serious threat to health both at population and individual patient levels. A key driver of increasing resistance to antibiotics is their overuse worldwide.

The highest rates of antibiotic prescription in the UK takes place in general practice and most are for common respiratory tract infections (RTIs) such as sore throat. General practice is also where most antibiotic treatment failures for RTIs, due to resistance and adverse side effects, increasingly occur.

Sore throat symptoms is one of the most common presentations in general practice worldwide, ranging from 2–4 percent. Most are due to viral infections and 90% resolve in 7 days without antibiotics. Antibiotic use has modest benefit in shortening the duration of illness with pain only reduced by 16 hours. Although antibiotic therapy reduces the risk of very rare complications of Group A streptococcal pharyngitis such as rheumatic fever, otitis media, acute sinusitis and quinsythe number needed to treat to prevent these complications is very high. Furthermore, in clinical practice it is difficult to determine the bacterial aetiology of sore throat symptoms. Therefore, the current guidelines from NICE and PHE in the UK recommend antibiotic use should be avoided for sore throat symptoms. The guidelines further recommend that clinical assessment based on the four Centor criteria (Lymphadenopathy; No Cough; Fever; Tonsillar Exudate)should be used to decide antibiotic prescription. For Centor score three or four, 2 or 3-day delayed or immediate antibiotic prescription could be considered. Guidelines also state the parameters of antibiotic prescribing: antibiotic choice, dose, frequency and duration. The recommendation of the duration of antibiotic use is based on Randomised Control Trial (RCT) in < 18 year olds, that shows 10 days phenoxymethylpenicillin course had lower relapse rates. Furthermore, antibiotic resistance is more likely if patients received longer duration, incomplete courses and broad spectrum antibiotics such as clarithromycin. Therefore, the guidelines recommend that phenoxymethypenicillin should be used as treatment of choice and a short course of clarithromycin must be reserved for those with true penicillin allergy.

Antibiotic guidelines have introduced evidence-based recommendations to reduce inappropriate antimicrobial prescription in general practice. Thus, improving compliance with national policies will reduce antibiotic resistance and healthcare costs, it will also contribute to better patient care by reducing antibiotic-associated adverse side effects.

### The role of tonsillectomy in psoriasis treatment [^112JZZ5X]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic and immune-mediated skin disease with a considerable negative impact on quality of life. The link between psoriasis, especially guttate psoriasis, and streptococcal infections, namely tonsillitis, has been studied for several years. Some authors have also suggested an association with other types of psoriasis, such as plaque psoriasis, which is the most common. The role of tonsillectomy in the treatment of plaque psoriasis is not consensual. This case report aims to discuss this topic. The authors intend to highlight the growing evidence of a relationship between plaque psoriasis and an infectious pathology of the otolaryngology area. A clinical case of severe chronic plaque psoriasis with exacerbations linked to acute tonsillitis is described. The case was recalcitrant to dermatological treatment and tonsillectomy was included in the treatment options. After surgery, the skin disease was evidently controlled and significant improvement on the patient's quality of life was also evident.

### Infectious indications for tonsillectomy [^111rcuwg]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Tonsillectomy is the most common major surgery performed on children in the United States. Recurrent throat infections of either bacterial or viral etiology can cause significant morbidity and decreased quality of life, and potentially lead to life-threatening complications. When performed in the proper patient, tonsillectomy can be a highly effective procedure. Recent clinical trials have sought to better define the appropriate infectious indications for surgery. Despite the improved understanding gained from these studies, the decision to operate always must be made on an individual basis with the primary care physician, surgeon, patient, and family all involved in the decision-making process.

### Cefuroxime axetil [^1171B91i]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Pharyngitis/Tonsillitis

Cefuroxime axetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of adult patients and pediatric patients (13 years and older) with mild-to-moderate pharyngitis/tonsillitis caused by susceptible strains of Streptococcus pyogenes.

Limitations of Use

The efficacy of cefuroxime axetil tablets in the prevention of rheumatic fever was not established in clinical trials.
The efficacy of cefuroxime axetil tablets in the treatment of penicillin-resistant strains of Streptococcus pyogenes has not been demonstrated in clinical trials.

1.2 Acute Bacterial Otitis Media

Cefuroxime axetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients (who can swallow tablets whole) with acute bacterial otitis media caused by susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae (including β-lactamase–producing strains), Moraxella catarrhalis (including β-lactamase–producing strains), or Streptococcus pyogenes.

1.3 Acute Bacterial Maxillary Sinusitis

Cefuroxime axetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients (13 years and older) with mild-to-moderate acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis caused by susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae (non - β-lactamase–producing strains only).

Limitations of Use

The effectiveness of cefuroxime axetil tablets for sinus infections caused by β-lactamase–producing Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis in patients with acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis was not established due to insufficient numbers of these isolates in the clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

1.4 Acute Bacterial Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis

Cefuroxime axetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of adult patients and pediatric patients (aged 13 and older) with mild-to-moderate acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis caused by susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae (β-lactamase–negative strains), or Haemophilus parainfluenzae (β-lactamase–negative strains).

1.5 Uncomplicated Skin and Skin-Structure Infections

Cefuroxime axetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of adult patients and pediatric patients (aged 13 and older) with uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus (including β - lactamase–producing strains) or Streptococcus pyogenes.

### Influencing antibiotic prescribing by prescriber feedback and management guidelines: a 5-year follow-up [^114huZry]. Family Practice (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The extent of use of antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) prompted a previous study of an educational intervention based on prescriber feedback and management guidelines. This study demonstrated a reduction in antibiotic prescribing for URTI and a more appropriate choice of antibiotic for tonsillitis/streptococcal pharyngitis. There are few long-term follow-up studies of educational programmes of this kind.

Objectives

This follow-up study aimed to examine if the reduction in antibiotic prescribing observed in the intervention group of the original study remained present after 5 years, and how the prescribing behaviour of the GPs involved in the follow-up differed from a large national survey of GP prescribing.

Methods

Attempts were made to contact the 157 GPs involved in the original study. Of these, 121 were both located and currently working in general practice. Ninety-six consented to take part and, of these, 79 completed a morbidity and treatment survey of 100 patient encounters (response rate 65.3%).

Results

The intervention group (n = 37) maintained their pattern of prescribing of antibiotics for URTI and choice of antibiotic for tonsillitis/streptococcal pharyngitis, with no significant change between the completion of the original study and the 5-year follow-up. The control group (n = 42) showed a downward trend in antibiotic prescribing for URTI, with the effect that no significant differences remained between groups at the 5-year follow-up. At the 5-year follow-up, both groups prescribed significantly fewer antibiotics for URTI and showed greater adherence to prescribing guidelines for tonsillitis/streptococcal pharyngitis than participants in a large national GP survey (n = 984).

Conclusion

This study demonstrated maintenance of prescribing behaviour in the intervention group in the long term. However, the changes in prescribing observed in the control group and the power limitations of the study make it uncertain whether this was the result of a sustained effect of the educational intervention. The differences in both groups from the large national GP survey suggest that other influences on prescribing (such as participation in vocational training for general practice) were also having an important effect.

### Corticosteroids for pain relief in sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113NZKzB]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Search strategy and selection

We included only randomised controlled trials comparing systemic corticosteroids with placebo, in children or adults, in outpatient (ambulatory) settings. We also included studies of patients with clinical signs of acute tonsillitis or pharyngitis (inflammation of the tonsils or oropharynx) and patients with a clinical syndrome of "sore throat" (painful throat, odynophagia). We excluded studies of infectious mononucleosis, sore throat following tonsillectomy or intubation, or peritonsillar abscess.

We searched Medline (1966 to 2008), Embase (1983 to 2008), the Cochrane Library including the Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Database of reviews of effectiveness (DARE), and the NHS Health Economics Database from the beginning of each database until August 2008 using a maximally sensitive strategy. Terms used included "upper respiratory tract infection", "pharyngitis", "tonsillitis", "sore throat", and "corticosteroids" (including "dexamethasone", "betamethasone", "prednisone", and all variations of these terms) and viral and bacterial upper respiratory pathogens (full search strategy available from authors). Two authors independently reviewed the title and abstracts of electronic searches, obtaining the full articles to assess for relevance where necessary. Disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third author. We did citation searches of all full-text papers retrieved.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^111yKUAS]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Recurrent throat infection — watchful waiting implementation stresses monitoring and documentation to assess impact. The purpose of this statement is to avoid unnecessary intervention in children with recurrent throat infection who have a favorable natural history and are likely to improve without tonsillectomy. Watchful waiting does not imply inaction. Rather, patients should be closely monitored by regular clinic visits and episodes of pharyngotonsillitis accurately documented. Throat infections are treated most often by the primary care provider, but other clinicians may be involved (eg, health care providers at emergency departments or urgent care centers). The primary care provider should collate documentation of all such visits. The clinical characteristics of each episode should be recorded, including the symptoms, physical findings, rapid antigen detection testing, and/or culture results if performed, as well as days of school absence and any quality of life (QoL) issues. Only with this information can the clinician assess the significance of the impact of recurrent pharyngotonsillitis for the patient and caregiver.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute pharyngitis in adults: background [^113SCypi]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute pharyngitis apply to immunocompetent adults without complicated comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease, and history of rheumatic fever. They do not apply during known outbreaks of group A streptococcus.1. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) is the causal agent in approximately 10% of adult cases of pharyngitis. The large majority of adults with acute pharyngitis have a self-limited illness, for which supportive care only is needed.2. Antibiotic treatment of adult pharyngitis benefits only those patients with GABHS infection. All patients with pharyngitis should be offered appropriate doses of analgesics and antipyretics, as well as other supportive care.3. Limit antibiotic prescriptions to patients who are most likely to have GABHS infection. Clinically screen all adult patients with pharyngitis for the presence of the four Centor criteria: history of fever, tonsillar exudates, no cough, and tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy (lymphadenitis). Do not test or treat patients with none or only one of these criteria, since these patients are unlikely to have GABHS infection. For patients with two or more criteria the following strategies are appropriate: a) Test patients with two, three, or four criteria by using a rapid antigen test, and limit antibiotic therapy to patients with positive test results; b) test patients with two or three criteria by using a rapid antigen test, and limit antibiotic therapy to patients with positive test results or patients with four criteria; or c) do not use any diagnostic tests, and limit antibiotic therapy to patients with three or four criteria. 4. Throat cultures are not recommended for the routine primary evaluation of adults with pharyngitis or for confirmation of negative results on rapid antigen tests when the test sensitivity exceeds 80%. Throat cultures may be indicated as part of investigations of outbreaks of GABHS disease, for monitoring the development and spread of antibiotic resistance, or when such pathogens as gonococcus are being considered.5. The preferred antibiotic for treatment of acute GABHS pharyngitis is penicillin, or erythromycin in a penicillin-allergic patient.

### Tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy versus non-surgical treatment for chronic / recurrent acute tonsillitis [^1139QbJo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical removal of the tonsils, with or without adenoidectomy (adeno-/tonsillectomy), is a common ENT operation, but the indications for surgery are controversial. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 3, 1999 and previously updated in 2009.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of tonsillectomy (with and without adenoidectomy) in children and adults with chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis in reducing the number and severity of episodes of tonsillitis or sore throat.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ISRCTN and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 30 June 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing tonsillectomy (with or without adenoidectomy) with non-surgical treatment in adults and children with chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

This review includes seven trials with low to moderate risk of bias: five undertaken in children (987 participants) and two in adults (156 participants). An eighth trial in adults (40 participants) was at high risk of bias and did not provide any data for analysis. Good information about the effectiveness of adeno-/tonsillectomy is only available for the first year following surgery in children and for a shorter period (five to six months) in adults. We combined data from five trials in children; these trials included children who were 'severely affected' (based on the specific 'Paradise' criteria) and less severely affected. Children who had an adeno-/tonsillectomy had an average of three episodes of sore throats (of any severity) in the first postoperative year, compared to 3.6 episodes in the control group; a difference of 0.6 episodes (95% confidence interval (CI) -1 to -0.1; moderate quality evidence). One of the three episodes in the surgical group was the 'predictable' one that occurred in the immediate postoperative period. When we analysed only episodes of moderate/severe sore throat, children who had been more severely affected and had adeno-/tonsillectomy had on average 1.1 episodes of sore throat in the first postoperative year, compared with 1.2 episodes in the control group (low quality evidence). This is not a significant difference but one episode in the surgical group was that occurring immediately after surgery. Less severely affected children had more episodes of moderate/severe sore throat after surgery (1.2 episodes) than in the control group (0.4 episodes: difference 0.8, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.9), but again one episode was the predictable postoperative episode (moderate quality evidence). Data on the number of sore throat days is only available for moderately affected children and is consistent with the data on episodes. In the first year after surgery children undergoing surgery had an average of 18 days of sore throat (of which some - between five and seven on average - will be in the immediate postoperative period), compared with 23 days in the control group (difference 5.1 days, 95% CI 2.2 to 8.1; moderate quality evidence). When we pooled the data from two studies in adults (156 participants), there were 3.6 fewer episodes (95% CI 7.9 fewer to 0.70 more; low quality evidence) in the group receiving surgery within six months post-surgery. However, statistical heterogeneity was significant. The pooled mean difference for number of days with sore throat in a follow-up period of about six months was 10.6 days fewer in favour of the group receiving surgery (95% CI 5.8 fewer to 15.8 fewer; low quality evidence). However, there was also significant statistical heterogeneity in this analysis and the number of days with postoperative pain (which appeared to be on average 13 to 17 days in the two trials) was not included. Given the short duration of follow-up and the differences between studies, we considered the evidence for adults to be of low quality. Two studies in children reported that there was "no statistically significant difference" in quality of life outcomes, but the data could not be pooled. One study reported no difference in analgesics consumption. We found no evidence for prescription of antibiotics. Limited data are available from the included studies to quantify the important risks of primary and secondary haemorrhage.

Authors' Conclusions

Adeno-/tonsillectomy leads to a reduction in the number of episodes of sore throat and days with sore throat in children in the first year after surgery compared to (initial) non-surgical treatment. Children who were more severely affected were more likely to benefit as they had a small reduction in moderate/severe sore throat episodes. The size of the effect is very modest, but there may be a benefit to knowing the precise timing of one episode of pain lasting several days - it occurs immediately after surgery as a direct consequence of the procedure. It is clear that some children get better without any surgery, and that whilst removing the tonsils will always prevent 'tonsillitis', the impact of the procedure on 'sore throats' due to pharyngitis is much less predictable. Insufficient information is available on the effectiveness of adeno-/tonsillectomy versus non-surgical treatment in adults to draw a firm conclusion. The impact of surgery, as demonstrated in the included studies, is modest. Many participants in the non-surgical group improve spontaneously (although some people randomised to this group do in fact undergo surgery). The potential 'benefit' of surgery must be weighed against the risks of the procedure as adeno-/tonsillectomy is associated with a small but significant degree of morbidity in the form of primary and secondary haemorrhage and, even with good analgesia, is particularly uncomfortable for adults.

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^113CsrQF]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Sore throat is a common reason for prescribing antibiotics and accounts for about 11% of all antibiotic prescriptions in primary healthcare in Sweden, which is a low prescribing country. Among approximately 29 consultations per 1000 inhabitants for sore throat in 2013, about two thirds were labelled as tonsillitis, of which 80% received an antibiotic prescription. Group A streptococcus is the most common pathogen in acute tonsillitis and is present in about 33% of patients with acute sore throat, but other bacteria and viruses are also potential pathogens. The European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) Sore Throat Guideline Group and Swedish guidelines for the management of sore throat focus on patients who are more likely to benefit from antimicrobial treatment. These patients have a higher symptom burden and an infection caused by group A streptococcus. The recommendation is that antibiotic treatment should be offered to patients with three or four Centor criteria (fever, tender cervical lymph nodes, coatings of the tonsils, and lack of cough) and a positive rapid antigen detection test for group A streptococcus. In Sweden the recommended treatment regimen for adults is 1000 mg penicillin V three times daily for 10 days. This duration of treatment is similar to other countries, but the dosage and total exposure (30 g) are relatively high. The historical reason for antimicrobial treatment is mainly to avoid serious complications such as acute rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis. These conditions are currently extremely rare in high income countries. Today the main reason for treatment in high income countries is to speed up clinical resolution of symptoms, but treatment also prevents rare complications such as peritonsillitis, impetigo, cellulitis, otitis media, and sinusitis.

### Tonsillectomy for the treatment of tonsillitis-induced immunoglobulin A nephropathy [^113Ee6Pn]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2009). Low credibility.

Tubular occlusion from red blood cell casts secondary to immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is a rare, serious complication of tonsillitis that can cause acute renal failure, also referred to as acute kidney injury. IgAN is the most common primary glomerulonephritis with up to 20% of cases resulting in renal failure worldwide. Tonsillectomy is an effective treatment option for patients suffering from IgAN secondary to recurrent acute tonsillitis. Tonsillectomy alone or in combination with additional medical modalities improves renal function and can have a positive effect on long-term renal survival.

### Removal of stones and food for relief of pain… [^113GoEGM]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

I examined an adult patient whose tonsils were severely swollen with numerous large crypts, most with large amounts of debris. The patient was in obvious pain. I sprayed her throat with benzocaine and removed some of the debris. The patient called four hours later to thank me. She stated that she had never felt relief so quickly or thoroughly in all the years she has had sore throats. This encounter changed my approach to acute and chronic tonsillitis when cryptic debris or tonsilloliths are present. The first step to stone or debris removal is to explain the procedure to the patient. They should be warned that the material removed from the tonsils is foul-tasting. Next, the patient is given a warm, moist washcloth to wipe the debris from their mouth should they not wish to swallow it. Benzocaine is sprayed onto the tonsils. The patient is asked not to swallow for 15 seconds. This step is repeated.

The patient is placed in the sniffing position, leaning forward with their chin extended as though leaning forward to sniff a flower. A 4 × 4 inch gauze pad is used to grasp the tongue, which is pulled with slight pressure to maximally expose the oropharynx. With a light via a head mirror or lamp, an ear curette is used to remove the debris from each of the tonsillar crypts, similar to wax removal from the auditory canal. A tongue blade may be required to press the tongue down or the anterior tonsillar folds laterally to get total exposure. It is not unusual for blood-streaked pus to drain after debris removal. With a gloved hand, the index finger can apply mild pressure to the lateral edge of the tonsil and be swept medially. After clearing both tonsils, the patient is asked to gargle with cool water and spit out the residue until there is no more blood or pus. In Reply: Thank you for your interest in our article.

A recent literature search of PubMed did not find similar management recommendations for patients with tonsilloliths. As you are likely aware, patients should be discouraged from trying to remove tonsil stones on their own. Our article was accompanied by a patient handout on tonsil stones discussing potential treatment, including brushing teeth and gargling with salt water. 1 Note that this information was adapted from the Cleveland Clinic. 2 We appreciate your perspective and thank you for sharing your practice experience.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^114f3LHe]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

PANDAS and poorly validated indications — "Tonsillectomy has been considered for treating pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS), but evidence is anecdotal and the etiology poorly understood", and "A recent systematic review found no recommendations either for or against performing tonsillectomy specifically to treat PANDAS". Poorly validated indications listed include "chronic tonsillitis, febrile seizures, muffled ("hot potato") speech, halitosis, malocclusion of teeth, tonsillar hypertrophy, cryptic tonsils, and chronic pharyngeal carriage of GABHS", and "There is a substantial role for shared decision making with caregivers when considering tonsillectomy for ≥ 1 of these conditions".

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^113Ym1F8]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

History < 12 months and observation before tonsillectomy: There are currently no randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy of tonsillectomy for patients experiencing recurrent tonsillitis over a period < 12 months, and all required a minimum number of sore throats in the preceding 12 months; for example, in the study by Paradise et al, 62 (33%) of the 187 children who satisfied the Paradise criteria had ≥ 7 throat infections in the preceding 12 months. Because of this tendency to improve with time, at least a 12-month period of observation is recommended prior to consideration of tonsillectomy as an intervention, but this statement should not restrict access to tonsillectomy prior to 1 year of observation when patients may reasonably be considered in circumstances including complications of infection, such as ≥ 2 peritonsillar abscesses.

### Streptococcal pharyngitis: rapid evidence review [^113noMib]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis is a common infection responsible for more than 6 million office visits in the United States annually. Only 10% of adults seeking care for a sore throat have group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis; however, 60% or more are prescribed antibiotics. Guidelines recommend using clinical decision rules to assess the risk of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection, followed by rapid antigen testing if a diagnosis is unclear, before prescribing antibiotics. Fever, tonsillar exudate, cervical lymphadenitis, and patient ages of 3 to 15 years increase clinical suspicion. A cough is more suggestive of a viral etiology. The limited history used in these decision rules is amenable to virtual visits. After a negative rapid antigen test result, a throat culture is recommended in children and adolescents. Penicillin and amoxicillin are first-line antibiotics, with a recommended course of 10 days; first-generation cephalosporins are recommended for patients with nonanaphylactic allergies to penicillin. There is significant resistance to azithromycin and clarithromycin in some parts of the United States. Steroids are not recommended for symptomatic treatment. Patients with worsening symptoms after appropriate antibiotic initiation or with symptoms lasting 5 days after the start of treatment should be reevaluated. Tonsillectomy is rarely recommended as a preventive measure: seven episodes of streptococcal pharyngitis in 1 year, five episodes in each of the past 2 years, or three episodes in each of the past 3 years are commonly used thresholds for considering surgery.

### Tonsillectomy for periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and cervical adenitis syndrome (PFAPA) [^1145CMwM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and cervical adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome is a rare clinical syndrome of unknown cause usually identified in children. Tonsillectomy is considered a potential treatment option for this syndrome. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2010.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of tonsillectomy (with or without adenoidectomy) in children with PFAPA.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 30 October 2013.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing tonsillectomy (with or without adenoidectomy) with non-surgical treatment in children with PFAPA.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

Two trials were included with a total of 67 children randomised (65 analysed); we judged both to be at low risk of bias. One trial of 39 participants recruited children with PFAPA syndrome diagnosed according to rigid, standard criteria. The trial compared adenotonsillectomy to watchful waiting and followed up patients for 18 months. A smaller trial of 28 children applied less stringent criteria for diagnosing PFAPA and probably also included participants with alternative types of recurrent pharyngitis. This trial compared tonsillectomy alone to no treatment and followed up patients for six months. Combining the trial results suggests that patients with PFAPA experience less fever and less severe episodes after surgery compared to those receiving no surgery. The risk ratio (RR) for immediate resolution of symptoms after surgery that persisted until the end of follow-up was 4.38 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 30.11); number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 2, calculated based on an estimate that 156 in 1000 untreated children have a resolution). There was a large overall reduction in the average number of episodes over the total length of follow-up in these studies (rate ratio 0.08, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.13), reducing the average frequency of PFAPA episodes from one every two months to slightly less than one every two years. The severity, as indicated by the length of PFAPA symptoms during these episodes, was also reduced. One study reported that the average number of days per PFAPA episode was 1.7 days after receiving surgery, compared to 3.5 days in the control group. The proportion of patients requiring corticosteroids was also lower in the surgery group compared to those receiving no surgery (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.92). Both trials reported that there were no complications of surgery. However, the numbers of patients randomly allocated to surgery (19 and 14 patients respectively) were too small to detect potentially important complications such as haemorrhage. Other outcomes such as quality of life, number of days with pain after surgery and absence from school were not measured or reported.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence for the effectiveness of tonsillectomy in children with PFAPA syndrome is derived from two small randomised controlled trials. These trials reported significant beneficial effects of surgery compared to no surgery on immediate and complete symptom resolution (NNTB = 2) and a substantial reduction in the frequency and severity (length of episode) of any further symptoms experienced. However, the evidence is of moderate quality (further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate) due to the relatively small sample sizes of the studies and some concerns about the applicability of the results. Therefore, the parents and carers of children with PFAPA syndrome must weigh the risks and consequences of surgery against the alternative of using medications. It is well established that children with PFAPA syndrome recover spontaneously and medication can be administered to try and reduce the severity of individual episodes. It is uncertain whether adenoidectomy combined with tonsillectomy adds any additional benefit to tonsillectomy alone.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^115U8Rbv]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Recurrent throat infection — option for tonsillectomy and documentation: The policy level for the recommendation about documenting recurrent throat infection was an option; clinicians may recommend tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection with a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year, at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years, or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and ≥ 1 of the following: temperature ≥ 38.3°C (101°F), cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus.

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^114PoHuJ]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Methods

This phase IV, randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority, multicentre study with two parallel groups compared penicillin V 800 mg four times daily for five days with penicillin V 1000 mg three times daily for 10 days.

Study population and procedures

Consecutive patients with sore throat were assessed for inclusion in the study. Inclusion criteria were patients aged 6 years and over with three or four Centor criteria (fever > 38.5°C, tender lymph nodes, coatings of the tonsils (for children inflamed tonsils), and absence of cough), and a positive rapid antigen detection test for group A streptococcus. These criteria have been used in other studies in which the efficacy of the reference treatment has been established. The Centor criteria and the rapid antigen detection test for group A streptococcus are well known to primary care physicians in Sweden and have been used for several years in treatment guidelines. Before the start of the study, we did not provide any additional training about the use of Centor criteria or the rapid antigen detection test for group A streptococcus. The primary healthcare centres used the same rapid antigen detection test that they used in their normal clinical practice.

Patients were not eligible for inclusion when they showed signs of serious illness or had hypersensitivity to penicillins; when they were receiving immunomodulating treatment corresponding to at least 15 mg prednisolone; when they had received antibiotics for pharyngotonsillitis in the past month (relapse); or when they had received any antibiotic treatment within 72 hours of inclusion. We recruited patients from 17 primary healthcare centres in urban and rural regions of Sweden: Skåne, Kronoberg, Västra Götaland, and Södermanland.

Tonsillectomy in children — watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection: Clinicians should recommend watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection if there have been < 7 episodes in the past year, < 5 episodes per year in the past 2 years, or < 3 episodes per year in the past 3 years. Strong recommendation based on systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials with limitations and observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm.

### Pathogen shifts and changing cure rates for otitis media and tonsillopharyngitis [^113fCrs2]. Clinical Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine use has caused a decrease in the incidence of recurrent and refractory acute otitis media in the United States and a shift in the predominant pathogens. Now Haemophilus influenzae is the most commonly isolated organism (about 60% of the total), and more than half the strains make beta-lactamase, rendering them resistant to amoxicillin. Penicillin nonsusceptible pneumococci, the main target of antibiotic therapy in the 1990s, has become a much less common isolate (10%- 25% of the total). These changes impact antibiotic selection for acute otitis media. Penicillin treatment of group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis does not meet the minimum United States Food and Drug Administration standards for first-line treatment, which is 85% or greater eradication at the end of therapy. Recent results with amoxicillin suggest its efficacy is also waning. Cephalosporins have the highest bacteriologic and clinical efficacy. This has implications for optimal antibiotic therapy.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^114dQPo6]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Objective To estimate the benefits and harms of using corticosteroids as an adjunct treatment for sore throat.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised control trials.

Data sources Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), trial registries up to May 2017, reference lists of eligible trials, related reviews.

Study selection Randomised controlled trials of the addition of corticosteroids to standard clinical care for patients aged 5 or older in emergency department and primary care settings with clinical signs of acute tonsillitis, pharyngitis, or the clinical syndrome of sore throat. Trials were included irrespective of language or publication status.

Review methods Reviewers identified studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the evidence, independently and in duplicate. A parallel guideline committee (BMJ Rapid Recommendation) provided input on the design and interpretation of the systematic review, including the selection of outcomes important to patients. Random effects model was used for meta-analyses. Quality of evidence was assessed with the GRADE approach.

Results 10 eligible trials enrolled 1426 individuals. Patients who received single low dose corticosteroids (the most common intervention was oral dexamethasone with a maximum dose of 10 mg) were twice as likely to experience pain relief after 24 hours (relative risk 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 4.3; risk difference 12.4%; moderate quality evidence) and 1.5 times more likely to have no pain at 48 hours (1.5, 1.3 to 1.8; risk difference 18.3%; high quality). The mean time to onset of pain relief in patients treated with corticosteroids was 4.8 hours earlier (95% confidence interval −1.9 to −7.8; moderate quality) and the mean time to complete resolution of pain was 11.1 hours earlier (−0.4 to −21.8; low quality) than in those treated with placebo. The absolute pain reduction at 24 hours (visual analogue scale 0–10) was greater in patients treated with corticosteroids (mean difference 1.3, 95% confidence interval 0.7 to 1.9; moderate quality). Nine of the 10 trials sought information regarding adverse events. Six studies reported no adverse effects, and three studies reported few adverse events, which were mostly complications related to disease, with a similar incidence in both groups.

Conclusion Single low dose corticosteroids can provide pain relief in patients with sore throat, with no increase in serious adverse effects. Included trials did not assess the potential risks of larger cumulative doses in patients with recurrent episodes of acute sore throat.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^1161NMiE]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Paradise criteria for tonsillectomy — recurrent throat infection in children requires specified episode frequency plus qualifying clinical features, treatment, and documentation. Minimum frequency is Seven or more episodes in the preceding year, OR Five or more episodes in each of the preceding 2 y, OR Three or more episodes in each of the preceding 3 y. Clinical features that qualify an episode are Temperature > 38.3°C (> 101°F), Cervical lymphadenopathy (tender lymph nodes or > 2 cm), Tonsillar exudate, or Positive culture for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and sore throat plus the presence of ≥ 1 qualifies as a counting episode. Treatment requires that antibiotics had been administered in conventional dosage for proved or suspected streptococcal episodes. Documentation requires contemporaneous clinical record for each episode OR, if not fully documented, subsequent observance by the clinician of 2 episodes with consistent patterns; children who meet all other criteria may nonetheless qualify if the same pattern is observed and documented by the clinician in 2 subsequent episodes, and a 12-month period of observation is usually recommended prior to consideration of tonsillectomy as an intervention.

1. INDICATIONS AND USAGE

MOXATAG is a penicillin-class antibacterial indicated for the treatment of tonsillitis and/or pharyngitis secondary to Streptococcus pyogenes in adults and pediatric patients 12 years or older. (1)

Tonsillitis and/or Pharyngitis

MOXATAG is a penicillin-class antibacterial indicated for the treatment of tonsillitis and/or pharyngitis secondary to Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) in adults and pediatric patients 12 yrs and older.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of MOXATAG and other antibacterial drugs, MOXATAG should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Corticosteroids as standalone or add-on treatment for sore throat [^113GTnrG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sore throat is a common condition associated with a high rate of antibiotic prescriptions, despite limited evidence for the effectiveness of antibiotics. Corticosteroids may improve symptoms of sore throat by reducing inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. This review is an update to our review published in 2012.

Objectives

To assess the clinical benefit and safety of corticosteroids in reducing the symptoms of sore throat in adults and children.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (Issue 4, 2019), MEDLINE (1966 to 14 May 2019), Embase (1974 to 14 May 2019), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE, 2002 to 2015), and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (inception to 2015). We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared steroids to either placebo or standard care in adults and children (aged over three years) with sore throat. We excluded studies of hospitalised participants, those with infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever), sore throat following tonsillectomy or intubation, or peritonsillar abscess.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included one new RCT in this update, for a total of nine trials involving 1319 participants (369 children and 950 adults). In eight trials, participants in both corticosteroid and placebo groups received antibiotics; one trial offered delayed prescription of antibiotics based on clinical assessment. Only two trials reported funding sources (government and a university foundation). In addition to any effect of antibiotics and analgesia, corticosteroids increased the likelihood of complete resolution of pain at 24 hours by 2.40 times (risk ratio (RR) 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29 to 4.47; P = 0.006; I² = 67%; high-certainty evidence) and at 48 hours by 1.5 times (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.76; P < 0.001; I² = 0%; high-certainty evidence). Five people need to be treated to prevent one person continuing to experience pain at 24 hours. Corticosteroids also reduced the mean time to onset of pain relief and the mean time to complete resolution of pain by 6 and 11.6 hours, respectively, although significant heterogeneity was present (moderate-certainty evidence). At 24 hours, pain (assessed by visual analogue scales) was reduced by an additional 10.6% by corticosteroids (moderate-certainty evidence). No differences were reported in recurrence/relapse rates, days missed from work or school, or adverse events for participants taking corticosteroids compared to placebo. However, the reporting of adverse events was poor, and only two trials included children or reported days missed from work or school. The included studies were assessed as moderate quality evidence, but the small number of included studies has the potential to increase the uncertainty, particularly in terms of applying these results to children.

Authors' Conclusions

Oral or intramuscular corticosteroids, in addition to antibiotics, moderately increased the likelihood of both resolution and improvement of pain in participants with sore throat. Given the limited benefit, further research into the harms and benefits of short courses of steroids is needed to permit informed decision-making.

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^112C7jMv]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To determine whether total exposure to penicillin V can be reduced while maintaining adequate clinical efficacy when treating pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci.

Design

Open label, randomised controlled non-inferiority study.

Setting

17 primary healthcare centres in Sweden between September 2015 and February 2018.

Participants

Patients aged 6 years and over with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci and three or four Centor criteria (fever ≥ 38.5°C, tender lymph nodes, coatings of the tonsils, and absence of cough).

Interventions

Penicillin V 800 mg four times daily for five days (total 16 g) compared with the current recommended dose of 1000 mg three times daily for 10 days (total 30 g).

Main outcome measures

Primary outcome was clinical cure five to seven days after the end of antibiotic treatment. The non-inferiority margin was prespecified to 10 percentage points. Secondary outcomes were bacteriological eradication, time to relief of symptoms, frequency of relapses, complications and new tonsillitis, and patterns of adverse events.

Results

Patients (n = 433) were randomly allocated to the five day (n = 215) or 10 day (n = 218) regimen. Clinical cure in the per protocol population was 89.6% (n = 181/202) in the five day group and 93.3% (n = 182/195) in the 10 day group (95% confidence interval −9.7 to 2.2). Bacteriological eradication was 80.4% (n = 156/194) in the five day group and 90.7% (n = 165/182) in the 10 day group. Eight and seven patients had relapses, no patients and four patients had complications, and six and 13 patients had new tonsillitis in the five day and 10 day groups, respectively. Time to relief of symptoms was shorter in the five day group. Adverse events were mainly diarrhoea, nausea, and vulvovaginal disorders; the 10 day group had higher incidence and longer duration of adverse events.

Conclusions

Penicillin V four times daily for five days was non-inferior in clinical outcome to penicillin V three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci. The number of relapses and complications did not differ between the two intervention groups. Five day treatment with penicillin V four times daily might be an alternative to the currently recommended 10 day regimen.

### The safety, tolerability, and efficacy of DL-lactic acid syrup (tonsitin) in children with recurrent tonsillitis: a pilot study [^117J3dbM]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

To evaluate Tonsitin (10% DL-lactic acid) safety, tolerability, and efficacy, as a treatment for recurrent tonsillitis (RT) in children. This is a clinical prospective, randomized, double blind pilot study, to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Tonsitin in healthy children with RT. Safety evaluated in terms of adverse events (AEs), tolerability in terms of compliance, and efficacy in terms of tonsils' size and frequency of tonsillitis, and quality of life. The study included 51 children. The treatment regimen was tolerable among the participants. Six children experienced AEs, but mostly mild. Tonsil size declined in both groups, but these results did not reach statistical significance. Tonsillitis episodes' frequencies were random and not significant. Tonsitin treatment was found to be feasible in the clinical setup and was well tolerated, and appears to be safe. Study efficacy results did not reach statistical significance.

### Pharyngitis management: defining the controversy [^1149pYrX]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Despite numerous controlled trials, clinical practice guidelines and cost-effective analyses, controversy persists regarding the appropriate management strategy for adult pharyngitis. In this perspective, we explore this controversy by comparing two competing clinical guidelines. Although the guidelines appear to make widely diverging recommendations, we show that the controversy centers on only a small proportion of patients: those presenting with severe pharyngitis. We examine recently published data to illustrate that this seemingly simple problem of strep throat remains a philosophical issue: should we give primacy to relieving acute time-limited symptoms, or should we emphasize the potential societal risk of antibiotic resistance? We accept potentially over treating a minority of adult pharyngitis patients with the most severe presentations to reduce suffering in an approximately equal number of patients who will have false negative test results if the test-and-treat strategy were used.

### Implementing criteria-led discharge for acute admissions to facilitate the elective recovery from COVID-19: an example in acute tonsillitis [^116teCFD]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

This study is the largest trial of CLD for acute hospital admissions to date and the first study to trial CLD in acute adult admissions. This study also presents more detailed characteristics of the study cohort compared with existing published evidence, demonstrating safety in a wider population. The most significant limitation of this study is the modest adoption of the tonsillitis pathway compared with the number of eligible patients. The reason for poor pathway adoption is not known. There may be a degree mistrust about the pathway, the results of this study will be disseminated locally, particularly highlighting the reduction in length of stay but and that the pathway is safe. The modest population within the pathway group is likely contributing to the low readmission rate and also lead to those treated on the tonsillitis pathway having significantly more comorbidities compared with those who received standard treatment. While a limitation, we can still be confident that the reduced length of stay in the pathway group was not due to patients being less complex or less unwell. This also demonstrates that modest pathway adoption is not caused by clinicians imposing their own eligibility criteria or picking specific patients to be treated on the tonsillitis pathway. One potential reason is medical staff not seeing the increased length of stay as a 'real' problem, and therefore, a degree of apathy among medical and nursing staff when asked to adopt the pathway. With a mean length of stay around 30 hours prior to implementation of CLD, the length of stay of most patients with acute tonsillitis remains relatively short and therefore may not be considered a priority for discharge. This may be demonstrated in the reduction in length of stay between the initial practice audit and standard treatment group following CLD implementation. Through the process of conducting this study, staff were made aware of the impact tonsillitis admission on bed occupancy and the departmental effort to discharge them earlier, which may have led to patients on the standard treatment being discharged more quickly. Patients with acute tonsillitis are typically admitted by medical staff called senior house officers, with 1–4 years of clinical experience. While the value of engaging junior doctors in quality improvement and NHS management have been recognised and a number of national schemes have been created for self-selecting individuals, junior doctors are not often involved with healthcare management at a systems level. As a result, many junior doctors may not see the link between length of stay and discharge time of patients requiring acute inpatient treatment and the provision of elective care.

### Higher dosages of azithromycin are more effective in treatment of group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis [^114ahfKt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Azithromycin has become a frequent choice for the treatment of group A streptococcal (GAS) tonsillopharyngitis. In this study, our objective was to determine the optimal dose of azithromycin for treatment of GAS tonsillopharyngitis in children and adults by analyzing trials that used different dose regimens.

Methods

We performed a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials that involved bacteriological confirmation of GAS tonsillopharyngitis, random assignment to receive either azithromycin or a 10-day comparator antibiotic, and assessment of bacteriological eradication by throat culture after therapy. The primary outcomes of interest were bacteriological and clinical cure rates.

Results

Nineteen trials involving 4626 patients were included in the analysis. One trial used 10-day course of 2 different comparator antibiotics, and 2 trials compared 2 dose regimens of azithromycin with a 10-day course of comparator antibiotic; all other trials compared 1 dose regimen of azithromycin with a single 10-day course of comparator antibiotic. In children, azithromycin administered at 60 mg/kg per course was superior to the 10-day courses of comparators (P < .00001), with bacterial failure occurring 5 times more often in patients receiving the 10-day courses of antibiotics. Azithromycin administered at 30 mg/kg per course was inferior to the 10-day courses of comparators (P = 0.02), with bacterial failure occurring 3 times more frequently in patients receiving azithromycin. Three-day regimens were inferior to 5-day regimens (P = 0.002). In adults, no studies compared dosages by weight. Three-day regimens of 500 mg/day showed a trend favoring azithromycin over the 10-day courses of comparators (P = 0.14); 5-day regimens were inferior to 3-day regimens (P = 0.006). Clinical cure rates were significantly different for the different azithromycin regimens, with differences that resembled those for bacterial cure rate.

Conclusion

This analysis suggests that azithromycin administered at a dosage of 60 mg/kg in children or administered for 3 days at a dosage of 500 mg/day in adults is more effective than other treatment regimens in producing eradication and clinical cure of GAS tonsillopharyngitis.

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^115fzEtm]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Technical information

Patients or their guardians provided signed informed consent. Patients eligible for inclusion were assigned to treatment with penicillin V as an oral tablet, either 800 mg four times daily for five days or 1000 mg three times daily for 10 days. The dosages for children up to 40 kg were adjusted according to weight (10–20 kg: 250 mg per dose, 20–40 kg: 500 mg per dose, irrespective of treatment arm). Physicians prescribed penicillin V and the patients or their guardians obtained the drugs from the pharmacy after the inclusion visit. Patients or their guardians were asked to fill in a patient diary until the test of cure visit, which was scheduled five to seven days after the end of antibiotic treatment. We chose a test of cure visit based on last dose and not a fixed day after randomisation so that the duration without antibiotic protection was similar for both treatment groups.

Physicians' clinical judgment of throat status at inclusion and at the test of cure visit were recorded. Throat swabs for rapid antigen detection test and culture were performed at study inclusion and at the follow-up visit. To reduce the discomfort for children, we accepted a double swab if rotated against the tonsils. We regarded any growth of group A streptococcus as a positive outcome. A physician recorded adverse events in the case report form at the test of cure visit. Start and stop dates for each event were recorded, and the physician's assessment of intensity and the relation to the study drug. In addition, patients (or their guardians) self reported adverse events and side effects in the patient diary. Regional study nurses made follow-up telephone calls to patients (or their guardians) one month and three months after completion of antibiotic treatment. Throat symptoms, potential relapses or new tonsillitis, and complications were monitored, in addition to adverse events. When patients had complications, we collected details retrospectively from their medical records. Uppsala Clinical Research Center and the Center for Primary Health Care Research performed monitoring according to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice.

### Different antibiotic treatments for group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^114AaBsW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although their effectiveness increases in people with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated. This is an update of a review first published in 2010, and updated in 2013, 2016, and 2020.

Objectives

To assess the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in: (a) alleviating symptoms (pain, fever); (b) shortening the duration of the illness; (c) preventing clinical relapse (i.e. recurrence of symptoms after initial resolution); and (d) preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). To assess the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 3 September 2020: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946), Embase Elsevier (from 1974), and Web of Science Thomson Reuters (from 2010). We also searched clinical trial registers on 3 September 2020.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics, and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, or complications and/or adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data using standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies according to the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and used the GRADE approach to assess the overall certainty of the evidence for the outcomes. We have reported the intention-to-treat analysis, and also performed an analysis of evaluable participants to explore the robustness of the intention-to-treat results.

Main Results

We included 19 trials reported in 18 publications (5839 randomised participants): six trials compared penicillin with cephalosporins; six compared penicillin with macrolides; three compared penicillin with carbacephem; one compared penicillin with sulphonamides; one compared clindamycin with ampicillin; and one compared azithromycin with amoxicillin in children. All participants had confirmed acute GABHS tonsillopharyngitis, and ages ranged from one month to 80 years. Nine trials included only, or predominantly, children. Most trials were conducted in an outpatient setting. Reporting of randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding was poor in all trials. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence mainly due to lack of (or poor reporting of) randomisation or blinding, or both; heterogeneity; and wide confidence intervals. Cephalosporins versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference in symptom resolution (at 2 to 15 days) for cephalosporins versus penicillin (odds ratio (OR) for absence of symptom resolution 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.12; 5 trials; 2018 participants; low-certainty evidence). Results of the sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants differed (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; 5 trials; 1660 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if clinical relapse may be lower for cephalosporins compared with penicillin (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 50; 4 trials; 1386 participants; low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence showed no difference in reported adverse events. Macrolides versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference between macrolides and penicillin for resolution of symptoms (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.35; 6 trials; 1728 participants; low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants resulted in an OR of 0.79, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.09; 6 trials; 1159 participants). We are uncertain if clinical relapse may be different (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.03; 6 trials; 802 participants; low-certainty evidence). Azithromycin versus amoxicillin Based on one unpublished trial in children, we are uncertain if resolution of symptoms is better with azithromycin in a single dose versus amoxicillin for 10 days (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.05; 1 trial; 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis for per-protocol analysis resulted in an OR of 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.73; 1 trial; 482 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are also uncertain if there was a difference in relapse between groups (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.82; 1 trial; 422 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events were more common with azithromycin compared to amoxicillin (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.78 to 3.99; 1 trial; 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Carbacephem versus penicillin There is low-certainty evidence that compared with penicillin, carbacephem may provide better symptom resolution post-treatment in adults and children (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; NNTB 14.3; 3 trials; 795 participants). Studies did not report on long-term complications, so it was unclear if any class of antibiotics was better in preventing serious but rare complications. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are uncertain if there are clinically relevant differences in symptom resolution when comparing cephalosporins and macrolides with penicillin in the treatment of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Low-certainty evidence in children suggests that carbacephem may be more effective than penicillin for symptom resolution. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding the other comparisons in this review. Data on complications were too scarce to draw conclusions. These results do not demonstrate that other antibiotics are more effective than penicillin in the treatment of GABHS pharyngitis. All studies were conducted in high-income countries with a low risk of streptococcal complications, so there is a need for trials in low-income countries and Aboriginal communities, where the risk of complications remains high.

### Overdiagnosis paradigm: not suitable for decreasing the overuse of antibiotics [^113Ef6g3]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2019). High credibility.

The challenges of the diagnostic errors

Mislabelling or misdefinition, not considered as overdiagnosis under the definition of overdiagnosis of Brodersen et al, is an error during the diagnostic process. However, it is difficult to know whether mislabelling lead to overtreatment or vice versa. Due to the short time of the consultation in primary care, it is difficult to determine the logical order of the decision taken by the GP. Sometimes a GP mislabels the patient with another diagnosis to better justify the administration of antibiotic therapy, for which treatment is unnecessary. A clear example is the differentiation of a sore throat into two different labels (pharyngitis and tonsillitis). Patients are diagnosed with tonsillitis if the clinicians intend to treat a sore throat with antibiotics and they use the milder category of pharyngitis if they think that the infection has a viral cause. In extreme cases, GPs decide to prescribe antibiotics even before examining the patient. It goes against logical thinking as treatment should be the subsequent step after a systematic diagnostic process.

### Metaanalysis of short course antibiotic treatment for group a streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis [^116TsFVh]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare bacterial and clinical cure rates in patients with group A streptococcal (GAS) tonsillopharyngitis treated with oral beta-lactam or macrolide antibiotics for 4–5 days versus 10-day comparators.

Methods

Medline, Embase, reference lists and abstract searches were used to identify available publications. Trials were included if there was bacteriologic confirmation of GAS tonsillopharyngitis, random assignment to antibiotic therapy for a beta-lactam or macrolide antibiotic of a shortened course versus a 10-day comparator and assessment of bacteriologic outcome using a throat culture.

Results

Twenty-two trials involving 7470 patients were included in 4 separate analyses. Trials were grouped by a short course of cephalosporins (n = 14), macrolides (other than azithromycin) (n = 6) and penicillin (n = 2). Cephalosporin trials were further grouped by the comparator, penicillin or the same cephalosporin. Short course cephalosporin treatment was superior for bacterial cure rate compared with 10 days of penicillin [odds ratio (OR), 1.47; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.06–2.03]. For trials with short course macrolide therapy, OR = 0.79 (95% CI 0.59–1.06) neither the macrolides nor the 10-day comparators. Short course penicillin therapy was inferior in achieving bacterial cure versus 10 days of penicillin, OR = 0.29 (95% CI 0.13–0.63). Clinical cure rates mirrored bacteriologic cure rates.

Conclusion

Superior cure rates can be achieved with shortened courses of cephalosporin therapy, but 5 days is inferior to 10 days of penicillin treatment.

Recurrent throat infection — watchful waiting policy attributes emphasize evidence quality, benefits and harms, exclusions, and policy level. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A, systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials that fail to show clinically important advantages of surgery over observation alone; Grade C, observational studies showing improvement with watchful waiting. Level of confidence in evidence: High. Benefits: Avoid unnecessary surgery with potential complications of vomiting, bleeding, pain, infection, or anesthesia problems. Risks, harms, costs: Waiting may result in delayed treatment in patients who have unusually frequent and severe recurrent throat infections; potential direct cost of managing future throat infections. Benefits-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm. Value judgments: Panel consensus that tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection should be limited to circumstances for which clinically important benefits are shown in randomized controlled trials; emphasis on avoiding harm related to surgery or anesthesia in a condition that may be largely self-limited. Intentional vagueness: None. Role of patient preferences: None. Exclusions include patients with > 1 peritonsillar abscess, personal or family history of rheumatic heart disease, Lemierre's syndrome, severe infections requiring hospitalization, or numerous repeat infections in a single household ("ping-pong spread"). Policy level: Strong recommendation. Differences of opinions: None.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^111VrcL7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2011 guideline developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations on the pre-, intra-, and postoperative care and management of children 1 to 18 years of age under consideration for tonsillectomy. Tonsillectomy is defined as a surgical procedure performed with or without adenoidectomy that completely removes the tonsil, including its capsule, by dissecting the peritonsillar space between the tonsil capsule and the muscular wall. Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, with 289,000 ambulatory procedures performed annually in children < 15 years of age based on the most recent published data. This guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who interact with children who may be candidates for tonsillectomy.

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing children under consideration for tonsillectomy and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to educate clinicians, patients, and/or caregivers regarding the indications for tonsillectomy and the natural history of recurrent throat infections. Additional goals include the following: optimizing the perioperative management of children undergoing tonsillectomy, emphasizing the need for evaluation and intervention in special populations, improving the counseling and education of families who are considering tonsillectomy for their children, highlighting the management options for patients with modifying factors, and reducing inappropriate or unnecessary variations in care. Children aged 1 to 18 years under consideration for tonsillectomy are the target patient for the guideline. For this guideline update, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of nursing, anesthesiology, consumers, family medicine, infectious disease, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, and sleep medicine.

Key Action Statements

The guideline update group made strong recommendations for the following key action statements (KASs): (1) Clinicians should recommend watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection if there have been < 7 episodes in the past year, < 5 episodes per year in the past 2 years, or < 3 episodes per year in the past 3 years. (2) Clinicians should administer a single intraoperative dose of intravenous dexamethasone to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (3) Clinicians should recommend ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or both for pain control after tonsillectomy. The guideline update group made recommendations for the following KASs: (1) Clinicians should assess the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet criteria in KAS 2 for modifying factors that may nonetheless favor tonsillectomy, which may include but are not limited to multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerance, PFAPA (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis), or history of > 1 peritonsillar abscess. (2) Clinicians should ask caregivers of children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing and tonsillar hypertrophy about comorbid conditions that may improve after tonsillectomy, including growth retardation, poor school performance, enuresis, asthma, and behavioral problems. (3) Before performing tonsillectomy, the clinician should refer children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing for polysomnography if they are < 2 years of age or if they exhibit any of the following: obesity, Down syndrome, craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular disorders, sickle cell disease, or mucopolysaccharidoses. (4) The clinician should advocate for polysomnography prior to tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing in children without any of the comorbidities listed in KAS 5 for whom the need for tonsillectomy is uncertain or when there is discordance between the physical examination and the reported severity of oSDB. (5) Clinicians should recommend tonsillectomy for children with obstructive sleep apnea documented by overnight polysomnography. (6) Clinicians should counsel patients and caregivers and explain that obstructive sleep-disordered breathing may persist or recur after tonsillectomy and may require further management. (7) The clinician should counsel patients and caregivers regarding the importance of managing posttonsillectomy pain as part of the perioperative education process and should reinforce this counseling at the time of surgery with reminders about the need to anticipate, reassess, and adequately treat pain after surgery. (8) Clinicians should arrange for overnight, inpatient monitoring of children after tonsillectomy if they are < 3 years old or have severe obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 10 obstructive events/hour, oxygen saturation nadir < 80%, or both). (9) Clinicians should follow up with patients and/or caregivers after tonsillectomy and document in the medical record the presence or absence of bleeding within 24 hours of surgery (primary bleeding) and bleeding occurring later than 24 hours after surgery (secondary bleeding). (10) Clinicians should determine their rate of primary and secondary posttonsillectomy bleeding at least annually. The guideline update group made a strong recommendation against 2 actions: (1) Clinicians should not administer or prescribe perioperative antibiotics to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (2) Clinicians must not administer or prescribe codeine, or any medication containing codeine, after tonsillectomy in children younger than 12 years. The policy level for the recommendation about documenting recurrent throat infection was an option: (1) Clinicians may recommend tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection with a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year, at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years, or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and ≥ 1 of the following: temperature > 38.3°C (101°F), cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus.

Differences From Prior Guideline

(1)Incorporating new evidence profiles to include the role of patient preferences, confidence in the evidence, differences of opinion, quality improvement opportunities, and any exclusion to which the action statement does not apply. (2)There were 1 new clinical practice guideline, 26 new systematic reviews, and 13 new randomized controlled trials included in the current guideline update. (3)Inclusion of 2 consumer advocates on the guideline update group. (4)Changes to 5 KASs from the original guideline: KAS 1 (Watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection), KAS 3 (Tonsillectomy for recurrent infection with modifying factors), KAS 4 (Tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing), KAS 9 (Perioperative pain counseling), and KAS 10 (Perioperative antibiotics). (5)Seven new KASs: KAS 5 (Indications for polysomnography), KAS 6 (Additional recommendations for polysomnography), KAS 7 (Tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea), KAS 12 (Inpatient monitoring for children after tonsillectomy), KAS 13 (Postoperative ibuprofen and acetaminophen), KAS 14 (Postoperative codeine), and KAS 15a (Outcome assessment for bleeding). (6)Addition of an algorithm outlining KASs. (7)Enhanced emphasis on patient and/or caregiver education and shared decision making.

### Analysis of different recommendations from international guidelines for the management of acute pharyngitis in adults and children [^111oj5uS]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Streptococcal pharyngitis is a frequently observed condition, but its optimal management continues to be debated.

Objective

The goal of this study was to evaluate the available guidelines, developed at the national level, for the management of streptococcal pharyngitis in Western countries, with a focus on their differences.

Methods

A literature search was conducted of the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, TRIP, and MEDLINE databases from their inception (1993 for the Cochrane Library, 1980 for EMBASE, 1997 for TRIP, and 1966 for MEDLINE) through April 25, 2010. The following search terms were used: pharyngitis, sore throat, tonsillitis, pharyngotonsillitis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Group A β-haemolytic Streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcal pharyngitis. Searches were limited to type of article or document (practice guideline or guideline) with no language restrictions or language limits.

Results

Twelve national guidelines were identified: 6 from European countries (France, United Kingdom, Finland, Holland, Scotland, and Belgium), 5 from the United States, and 1 from Canada. Recommendations differ substantially with regard to the use of a rapid antigen diagnostic test or throat culture and the indications for antibiotic treatment. The North American, Finnish, and French guidelines recommend performing one timely microbiologic investigation in suspected cases, and prescribing antibiotics in confirmed cases to prevent suppurative complications and acute rheumatic fever. According to the remaining European guidelines, however, acute sore throat is considered a benign, self-limiting disease. Microbiologic tests are not routinely recommended by these latter guidelines, and antibiotic treatment is reserved for well-selected cases. The use of the Centor score, for evaluation of the risk of streptococcal infection, is recommended by several guidelines, but subsequent decisions on the basis of the results differ in terms of which subjects should undergo microbiologic investigation. All guidelines agree that narrow-spectrum penicillin is the first choice of antibiotic for the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis and that treatment should last for 10 days to eradicate the microorganism. Once-daily amoxicillin was recommended by 2 US guidelines as equally effective.

Conclusion

The present review found substantial discrepancies in the recommendations for the management of pharyngitis among national guidelines in Europe and North America.

### Azithromycin [^1156TZ8H]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Indications and Usage (1.2), and Dosage and Administration (2.2)]

Safety and effectiveness in the treatment of pediatric patients with acute otitis media, acute bacterial sinusitis and community-acquired pneumonia under 6 months of age have not been established. Use of azithromycin for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis and community-acquired pneumonia in pediatric patients (6 months of age or greater) is supported by adequate and well-controlled trials in adults.

Pharyngitis/Tonsillitis: Safety and effectiveness in the treatment of pediatric patients with pharyngitis/tonsillitis under 2 years of age have not been established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In multiple-dose clinical trials of oral azithromycin, 9% of patients were at least 65 years of age (458/4949) and 3% of patients (144/4949) were at least 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

Elderly patients may be more susceptible to development of torsades de pointes arrhythmias than younger patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^115ccByT]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Tonsillectomy in children — recurrent throat infection management: Clinicians should recommend watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection if there have been < 7 episodes in the past year, < 5 episodes per year in the past 2 years, or < 3 episodes per year in the past 3 years. Clinicians may recommend tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection with a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year, at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years, or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and ≥ 1 of the following: temperature > 38.3°C (101°F), cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. Clinicians should assess the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet criteria in Key Action Statement 2 for modifying factors that may nonetheless favor tonsillectomy, which may include but are not limited to: multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerance, PFAPA (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis), or history of > 1 peritonsillar abscess.

### Implementing criteria-led discharge for acute admissions to facilitate the elective recovery from COVID-19: an example in acute tonsillitis [^111ZDoJd]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Patients with acute tonsillitis are a good example of surgical department admissions requiring conservative management within otolaryngology. Acute tonsillitis is inflammation of the palatine tonsils in the lateral oropharynx. A common disease, is it predominantly caused by viral or bacterial infection. Symptoms typically include sore throat and tonsillar exudates but in more severe cases can present with odynophagia, dysphagia, fever and tender cervical lymphadenopathy. Patients require admission when they are no longer able to maintain oral intake including medications. Once admitted, patients are typically treated with a combination of intravenous antibiotics and analgesia and sometimes intravenous dexamethasone is added to reduce inflammation. Across the UK, mean length of stay for each patient with acute tonsillitis is 19.2 hours. In 2019–2020, there were over 73 000 NHS hospital admissions in England for acute tonsillitis representing over 58 000 bed days. A safe reduction in length of stay for patients with tonsillitis, particularly if discharged in the morning, would provide increased hospital capacity for surgical beds could assist with increased elective operating capacity as part of COVID-19 recovery plan.

### The role of tonsillectomy in reducing recurrent pharyngitis: a systematic review [^114mcFkM]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the evidence for efficacy of tonsillectomy in reducing the incidence of recurrent pharyngitis.

Data Sources

Literature databases consisting of PUBMED, SCOPUS, CINHAL AND OVID EMBASE including all languages.

Review Methods

Literature search of database by 2 authors with structured criteria using an online database. Selected studies evaluated with meta-analysis.

Results

In four randomized, controlled trials tonsillectomy was favored over medical therapy in reducing pharyngitis. The difference was statistically significant in only one study. Overall meta-analysis results were significant, indicating that tonsillectomy results in a reduction of about 43% in the incidence of pharyngitis. The number needed to treat with tonsillectomy to prevent one sore throat per month for the first year after surgery was 11 (95% CI; 7–23).

Conclusion

Tonsillectomy reduces the incidence of recurrent pharyngitis to a modest degree.

### Implementing criteria-led discharge for acute admissions to facilitate the elective recovery from COVID-19: an example in acute tonsillitis [^116R9sE4]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Methods

Study design

This study is a quality improvement project. A retrospective practice audit was initially undertaken. The results of the initial practice audit were used to develop a new patient pathway to both standardise treatment for those admitted under otolaryngology (ENT) with acute tonsillitis and introduce CLD.

Setting

The study was completed in a 28-bed surgical ward affiliated with the otolaryngology department at a tertiary NHS hospital. Patients were typically admitted to the ward under otolaryngology following referral from the emergency department and general practitioners. The study was conducted between January and March 2020 and October 2020 and April 2021. The study was suspended between March and October 2020 due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Population

Eligibility criteria

Diagnosis of acute tonsillitis.
Unable to maintain oral intake for hydration and medication.

Exclusion criteria

Complication of tonsillitis present, for example, peritonsillar abscess.
Alternative diagnosis likely, for example, pharyngitis or supraglottitis.
Evidence of septic shock.

Intervention

All patients who met the eligibility criteria to be treated using the new patient pathway introduced for acute tonsillitis (see figure 1).

Tonsillitis pathway

The acute tonsillitis patient pathway introduced as part of the intervention for this trial was adapted from the tonsillitis pathway published by Bird et al, with the addition of CLD. The pathway consisted of the following treatment: benzylpenicillin sodium intravenously, (clarithromycin intravenously for those allergic to penicillin), intravenous crystalloid fluids, intravenous paracetamol, ibuprofen solution orally and benzydamine 0.15% w/v mouthwash. Clinicians were advised to consider dexamethasone intravenously with blood glucose monitoring if appropriate. Initiation of treatment was conducted within 30 min of diagnosis. Protocols were created within the local electronic prescribing system. These protocols, called 'acute tonsillitis' and 'acute tonsillitis (Penicillin Allergy)' contained all medications forming the treatment intervention.

### A randomized, open-label, multicenter, comparative study of therapeutic efficacy, safety and tolerability of BNO 1030 extract, containing marshmallow root, chamomile flowers, horsetail herb, walnut leaves, yarrow herb, oak bark, dandelion herb in the treatment of acute non-bacterial tonsillitis in children aged 6 to 18 years [^1133MQQG]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2018). Low credibility.

Seventy to 95% of acute tonsillitis episodes are caused by viral infection, therefore why antibiotic therapy is not indicated in majority of cases. In such cases, acetaminophen or ibuprofen are used to alleviate the symptoms. The objective of this study was assessment of efficacy of phytoneering extract BNO 1030 (Imupret®) in patients with acute non-bacterial tonsillitis.

Methods

This randomized, open-label, multicenter, comparative study randomised 238 outpatients aged 6–18 years to receive either BNO 1030 (Imupret®) as a supplement to standard symptomatic therapy, or standard therapy. Assessment criteria were as follows: sore throat dynamics at rest and at swallowing, throat irritation associated with cough, general condition, day of withdrawal of antipyretics, the share of treatment responders, as well as assessment of "therapeutic benefit" from the use of BNO 1030.

Results

Decreased intensity of acute tonsillitis symptoms to 1 point and lower, assessed using 4-point scale starting from the day 5 of treatment (p < 0.005), alleviation of local symptoms and general condition starting from day 2 of the disease (р < 0.001), withdrawal of antipyretics starting from day 4 of treatment (p < 0.005), increase of the number of treatment responders to 81.6% (p < 0.005) versus the control were reported. "Therapeutic benefit" was 4.2 days. All patients tolerated phytotherapy well, and no adverse reactions were seen.

Conclusion

BNO 1030 (Imupret®) is a safe and effective product for treatment of acute non-bacterial tonsillitis in children aged 6–18 years, assuring therapeutic benefit when prescribed additionally to the standard symptomatic therapy.

### Tonsillectomy or adeno-tonsillectomy versus non-surgical treatment for chronic / recurrent acute tonsillitis [^113zrmde]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical removal of the tonsils, with or without adenoidectomy (adeno-/tonsillectomy), is a common ENT operation but the indications for surgery are controversial.

Objectives

To determine the effects of tonsillectomy, with and without adenoidectomy, in patients with chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2008, issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to 2008), EMBASE (1974 to 2008), bibliographies, and additional sources were searched for published and unpublished trials. The date of the last search was 11 April 2008.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing tonsillectomy, with or without adenoidectomy, with non-surgical treatment in adults and children with chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis. We included trials which used reduction in the number and severity of tonsillitis and sore throat as main outcome measures.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors applied the inclusion/exclusion criteria independently.

Main Results

This review includes five studies: four undertaken in children (719 participants) and one in adults (70 participants). Good information about the effects of tonsillectomy is only available for children and for effects in the first year following surgery. Children were divided into two subgroups: those who are severely affected (based on specific criteria which are often referred to as the 'Paradise criteria') and those less severely affected. For more severely affected children adeno-/tonsillectomy will avoid three unpredictable episodes of any type of sore throat, including one episode of moderate or severe sore throat in the next year. The cost of this is a predictable episode of pain in the immediate postoperative period. Less severely affected children may never have had another severe sore throat anyway and the chance of them so doing is modestly reduced by adeno-/tonsillectomy. For them, surgery will mean having an average of two rather than three unpredictable episodes of any type of sore throat. The cost of this reduction is one inevitable and predictable episode of postoperative pain. The 'average' patient will have 17 rather than 22 sore throat days but some of these 17 days (between five and seven) will be in the immediate postoperative period. Whilst the concept of the 'average' patient is attractive, in practice, wide variability is likely. One reason why the impact of surgery is so modest, is that many untreated patients get better spontaneously. There is a trade-off for the physician and patient who must weigh up a number of different uncertainties: what proportion of my throat symptoms are attributable to my tonsils, and will I get better without any treatment? Similarly, the potential 'benefit' of surgery must be weighed against the risks of the procedure.

Authors' Conclusions

Adeno-/tonsillectomy is effective in reducing the number of episodes of sore throat and days with sore throats in children, the gain being more marked in those most severely affected. The size of the effect is modest, but there may be a benefit to knowing the precise timing of one episode of pain lasting several days - it occurs immediately after surgery as a direct consequence of it. It is clear that some children get better without any surgery, and that whilst removing the tonsils will always prevent 'tonsillitis', the impact of the procedure on 'sore throats' due to pharyngitis is much less predictable.

### Tonsillitis and tonsilloliths: diagnosis and management [^112BrrDu]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Tonsillitis, or inflammation of the tonsils, makes up approximately 0.4% of outpatient visits in the United States. Tonsillitis is caused by a viral infection in 70% to 95% of cases. However, bacterial infections caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) account for tonsillitis in 5% to 15% of adults and 15% to 30% of patients five to 15 years of age. It is important to differentiate group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus from other bacterial or viral causes of pharyngitis and tonsillitis because of the risk of progression to more systemic complications such as abscess, acute glomerulonephritis, rheumatic fever, and scarlet fever after infection with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. A variety of diagnostic tools are available, including symptom-based validated scoring systems (e.g. Centor score), and oropharyngeal and serum laboratory testing. Treatment is focused on supportive care, and if group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus is identified, penicillin should be used as the first-line antibiotic. In cases of recurrent tonsillitis, watchful waiting is strongly recommended if there have been less than seven episodes in the past year, less than five episodes per year for the past two years, or less than three episodes per year for the past three years. Tonsilloliths, or tonsil stones, are managed expectantly, and small tonsilloliths are common clinical findings. Rarely, surgical intervention is required if they become too large to pass on their own.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^111EoFQM]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Other outcomes

The authors of one study reported a possible decrease in the likelihood of receipt of antibiotics in patients treated with corticosteroids (relative risk 0.83, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 1.13; moderate quality). Three studiessuggested a possible lower risk of recurrence/relapse of the symptoms (0.52, 0.16to 1.73; I² = 23%; moderate quality, table D in appendix 3, table 2).

Kiderman and colleagues reported that 22/40 (55%) patients treated with corticosteroids and 27/39 (69%) taking placebo took time off work because of sore throat (relative risk 0.8, 95% confidence interval 0.6 to 1.1). Marvez-Valls and colleagues reported that adult patients treated with corticosteroids missed an average of 0.4 (SD 1.4) days, whereas patients in the placebo arm missed an average of 0.7 (SD 1.4) days (mean difference −0.3 days, 95% confidence interval −0.87 to 0.27). None of the trials reported duration of bad/non-tolerable symptoms.

All studies except one sought information on adverse effects using different methods including standardised questionnaire (two studies), open ended questions or diaries to capture self reported adverse events (five studies), or a checklist of complications (two studies). Table 3provides details of adverse effects assessed and methods used for capturing them. Six studies reported no adverse effects, and three studies reported adverse events, in both steroids and comparator arms, which were mostly complications related to disease and occurred with similar frequency in the intervention and control groups (table 3). Hayward and colleagues reported two serious adverse events (admission to hospital for pharyngeal or peritonsillar abscess, tonsillitis, and pneumonia) in the corticosteroids group (0.7%) and three in the placebo group (1.1%). Olympia and colleagues reported one out of the 57 (1.8%) children in the corticosteroids group and two out of the 68 (2.9%) children in the placebo group developed a peritonsillar abscess (moderate quality, table 2and table 3).

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^115Lsdxr]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Randomized trial limitations and evidence grading — when weighing tonsillectomy for recurrent infection, limitations of the evidence include small randomized samples and incomplete follow-up, prompting a downgrade in evidence level. Limitations of the available randomized controlled trials must also be considered when assessing the benefits and harms of surgery. Paradise and colleagues randomized 91 children to surgery versus observation after screening thousands, only a small percentage met strict entry criteria and only about half of eligible children agreed to randomization, and in both studies only about half (46%-62%) of enrolled children completed all 3 years of follow-up. Although these limitations did not invalidate the trials, the panel downgraded the aggregate evidence level from A (randomized trials) to B (randomized trials with limitations).

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^114xemQF]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine whether total exposure to penicillin V can be reduced while maintaining adequate clinical efficacy when treating pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci.

Design

Open label, randomised controlled non-inferiority study.

Setting

17 primary healthcare centres in Sweden between September 2015 and February 2018.

Participants

Patients aged 6 years and over with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci and three or four Centor criteria (fever ≥ 38.5°C, tender lymph nodes, coatings of the tonsils, and absence of cough).

Interventions

Penicillin V 800 mg four times daily for five days (total 16 g) compared with the current recommended dose of 1000 mg three times daily for 10 days (total 30 g).

Main Outcome Measures

Primary outcome was clinical cure five to seven days after the end of antibiotic treatment. The non-inferiority margin was prespecified to 10 percentage points. Secondary outcomes were bacteriological eradication, time to relief of symptoms, frequency of relapses, complications and new tonsillitis, and patterns of adverse events.

Results

Patients (n = 433) were randomly allocated to the five day (n = 215) or 10 day (n = 218) regimen. Clinical cure in the per protocol population was 89.6% (n = 181/202) in the five day group and 93.3% (n = 182/195) in the 10 day group (95% confidence interval -9.7 to 2.2). Bacteriological eradication was 80.4% (n = 156/194) in the five day group and 90.7% (n = 165/182) in the 10 day group. Eight and seven patients had relapses, no patients and four patients had complications, and six and 13 patients had new tonsillitis in the five day and 10 day groups, respectively. Time to relief of symptoms was shorter in the five day group. Adverse events were mainly diarrhoea, nausea, and vulvovaginal disorders; the 10 day group had higher incidence and longer duration of adverse events.

Conclusions

Penicillin V four times daily for five days was non-inferior in clinical outcome to penicillin V three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci. The number of relapses and complications did not differ between the two intervention groups. Five day treatment with penicillin V four times daily might be an alternative to the currently recommended 10 day regimen.

### Review: known, emerging, and remerging pharyngitis pathogens [^1153gQxv]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Pharyngitis is an inflammatory condition of the pharynx and/or tonsils commonly seen in both children and adults. Viruses and bacteria represent the most common encountered etiologic agents-yeast/fungi and parasites are infrequently implicated. Some of these are predominantly observed in unique populations (eg, immunocompromised or unvaccinated individuals). This article (part 1 of 3) summarizes the impact of acute pharyngitis on the health care system and reviews the etiologic agents of acute pharyngitis, including both emerging and reemerging pathogens that health care providers should consider when evaluating their patients. Finally, it sets the stage for parts 2 and 3, which discuss the current and evolving state of diagnostic testing for acute pharyngitis.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^116WzsnV]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Recurrent sore throat outcomes and Paradise criteria: While tonsillectomy can reduce the recurrence rate of sore throat, missed school days, and health care utilization, this effect does not extend beyond the first year postoperatively, and benefits are significantly lessened for children with a mild disease burden; as a result, tonsillectomy is not cost-effective and does not provide clinically meaningful improvements in children who do not meet the "Paradise criteria" (7 episodes in the past year, 5 episodes per year in the past 2 years, or 3 episodes per year in the past 3 years).

### Implementing criteria-led discharge for acute admissions to facilitate the elective recovery from COVID-19: an example in acute tonsillitis [^116DxLHP]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Background

Healthcare systems face unprecedented numbers of patients waiting for elective treatments in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hospitals must urgently optimise patient pathways and build capacity to meet the populations health needs. Criteria-led discharge (CLD) is frequently used to optimise elective care pathways but may hold potential in discharging patients at the end of an acute hospital admission.

Methods

We conducted a quality improvement project to design and introduce a novel inpatient pathway using CLD for patients with severe acute tonsillitis. Our analysis compared the standardisation of treatment, length of stay, discharge time and readmission rate between those treated on the novel pathway compared with standard treatment.

Results

The study population included 137 patients admitted to a tertiary centre with acute tonsillitis. Introduction of the tonsillitis pathway using CLD resulted in a significant reduction in median length of stay from 24 hours to 18 hours. Of those treated on the tonsillitis pathway, 52.2% were discharged prior to midday compared with 29.1% who received standard treatment. No patient discharged using CLD required readmission.

Conclusion

CLD is safe and effective at reducing length of stay in patients requiring acute hospital admission for acute tonsillitis. CLD should be used and evaluated in further novel patient pathways across different areas of medicine to optimise care and build capacity for provision of elective healthcare services. Further research is required to investigate safe and optimal criteria which indicate patients are fit for discharge.

### The impact of national guidelines on the diagnostics of sore throat in children [^113TpHK9]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The Finnish treatment guidelines for sore throat were updated in June 2020. The aim of this study was to determine how the publication of these guidelines affected the treatment of pediatric patients, particularly through the use of the Centor criteria, C-reactive protein tests, and microbiological testing in the diagnosis of Group A β-hemolytic streptococci tonsillitis.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective single-center before-and-after cohort study in Finland from 2019 to 2022. We included all patients who visited the pediatric emergency department and were diagnosed with tonsillitis or pharyngitis.

Results

We included 246 patients who were admitted before the guidelines were updated and 219 patients after. Only two patients in the after group had a Centor score reported in their patient records. Rapid antigen tests were administered to 231 patients (93.9%) before the update and 202 patients (92.2%) after (proportion difference of 1.7%, CI -3.0–6.6%). C-reactive protein was taken from 193 patients (78.5%) before the update and 189 patients (86.3%) after (proportion difference of 7.8%, CI 0.1–14.7%).

Conclusions

Centor scores were not used as recommended in the guidelines and did not impact the use of microbiological or C-reactive protein testing. More education and examining the preconceptions of health care personnel is required to implement the updated treatment guidelines in clinical practice.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^1112P85x]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Statement 3 — tonsillectomy for recurrent infection with modifying factors: Clinicians should assess the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet criteria in Key Action Statement 2 for modifying factors that may nonetheless favor tonsillectomy, including but not limited to multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerance, PFAPA (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis), or history of > 1 peritonsillar abscess; the recommendation is based on randomized controlled trials and observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm.

### Conservative management versus tonsillectomy in adults with recurrent acute tonsillitis in the UK (NATTINA): a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial [^1135bRHv]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Tonsillectomy is regularly performed in adults with acute tonsillitis, but with scarce evidence. A reduction in tonsillectomies has coincided with an increase in acute adult hospitalisation for tonsillitis complications. We aimed to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of conservative management versus tonsillectomy in patients with recurrent acute tonsillitis.

Methods

This pragmatic multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial was conducted in 27 hospitals in the UK. Participants were adults aged 16 years or older who were newly referred to secondary care otolaryngology clinics with recurrent acute tonsillitis. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive tonsillectomy or conservative management using random permuted blocks of variable length. Stratification by recruiting centre and baseline symptom severity was assessed using the Tonsil Outcome Inventory-14 score (categories defined as mild 0–35, moderate 36–48, or severe 49–70). Participants in the tonsillectomy group received elective surgery to dissect the palatine tonsils within 8 weeks after random assignment and those in the conservative management group received standard non-surgical care during 24 months. The primary outcome was the number of sore throat days collected during 24 months after random assignment, reported once per week with a text message. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. This study is registered with the ISRCTN registry, 55284102.

Findings

Between May 11, 2015, and April 30, 2018, 4165 participants with recurrent acute tonsillitis were assessed for eligibility and 3712 were excluded. 453 eligible participants were randomly assigned (233 in the immediate tonsillectomy group vs 220 in the conservative management group). 429 (95%) patients were included in the primary ITT analysis (224 vs 205). The median age of participants was 23 years (IQR 19–30), with 355 (78%) females and 97 (21%) males. Most participants were White (407 [90%]). Participants in the immediate tonsillectomy group had fewer days of sore throat during 24 months than those in the conservative management group (median 23 days [IQR 11–46] vs 30 days [14–65]). After adjustment for site and baseline severity, the incident rate ratio of total sore throat days in the immediate tonsillectomy group (n = 224) compared with the conservative management group (n = 205) was 0·53 (95% CI 0·43 to 0·65; < 0·0001). 191 adverse events in 90 (39%) of 231 participants were deemed related to tonsillectomy. The most common adverse event was bleeding (54 events in 44 [19%] participants). No deaths occurred during the study.

Interpretation

Compared with conservative management, immediate tonsillectomy is clinically effective and cost-effective in adults with recurrent acute tonsillitis.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^115Azyv2]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Peritonsillar abscess and tonsillectomy — the role of tonsillectomy remains controversial, but "the threshold for surgery is lowered when a child with recurrent throat infection develops or has a history of peritonsillar abscess". After treatment with needle aspiration or incision and drainage, "the need for subsequent tonsillectomy is about 10% to 20%", a rate that "may not merit routine tonsillectomy unless a patient also has a history of frequent prior throat infections, especially when culture positive for GABHS", and "Some authors advocate 'quinsy' tonsillectomy" in active abscess when anesthesia is required or there is a history of tonsil disease.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^114ZVvvc]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Tonsillectomy in children — evidence-based statement categories define three levels with corresponding implied obligations: Strong recommendation — A strong recommendation means that the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms and that the quality of the supporting evidence is high, and clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Recommendation — A recommendation means that the benefits exceed the harms but the quality of evidence is not as high, and clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. Option — An option means that either the quality of evidence is suspect or well-done studies show little clear advantage to one approach versus another, and clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set bounds on alternatives; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.

### Different antibiotic treatments for group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^115PycgS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although effectiveness increases in participants with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated.

Objectives

We assessed the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics on clinical outcomes, relapse, complications and adverse events in GABHS tonsillopharyngitis.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Library, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2010, Issue 3) which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to July Week 4, 2010) and EMBASE (1974 to August 2010).

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, complications, adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data.

Main Results

Seventeen trials (5352 participants) were included; 16 compared with penicillin (six with cephalosporins, six with macrolides, three with carbacephem and one with sulfonamides), one trial compared clindamycin and ampicillin. Randomisation reporting, allocation concealment and blinding were poor. There was no difference in symptom resolution between cephalosporins and penicillin (intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis; N = 5; n = 2018; odds ratio for absence of resolution of symptoms (OR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.12). Clinical relapse was lower with cephalosporins (N = 4; n = 1386; OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.99); overall number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 50), but found only in adults (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.88; NNTB 33). There were no differences between macrolides and penicillin. Carbacephem showed better symptom resolution post-treatment (N = 3; n = 795; OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; NNTB 14), but only in children (N = 2; n = 233; OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.99; NNTB 8.3). Children experienced more adverse events with macrolides (N = 1, n = 489; OR 2.33; 95% CI 1.06 to 5.15).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence is insufficient for clinically meaningful differences between antibiotics for GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Limited evidence in adults suggests cephalosporins are more effective than penicillin for relapse, but the NNTB is high. Limited evidence in children suggests carbacephem is more effective for symptom resolution. Data on complications are too scarce to draw conclusions. Based on these results and considering the low cost and absence of resistance, penicillin can still be recommended as first choice.

### Recurrent throat infections (tonsillitis) [^112iL4tR]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diagnosis of acute tonsillitis is clinical, and it can be difficult to distinguish viral from bacterial infections. Rapid antigen testing has a very low sensitivity in the diagnosis of bacterial tonsillitis, but more accurate tests take longer to deliver results. Bacteria are cultured from few people with tonsillitis. Other causes include infectious mononucleosis from Epstein-Barr virus infection, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, HIV, hepatitis A, and rubella.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of tonsillectomy in children and adults with acute recurrent or chronic throat infections? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to November 2006 (BMJ Clinical evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found nine systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, cold steel tonsillectomy, diathermy tonsillectomy.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^115rpVFB]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Objective To estimate the benefits and harms of using corticosteroids as an adjunct treatment for sore throat. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised control trials. Data sources Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), trial registries up to May 2017, reference lists of eligible trials, related reviews. Study selection Randomised controlled trials of the addition of corticosteroids to standard clinical care for patients aged 5 or older in emergency department and primary care settings with clinical signs of acute tonsillitis, pharyngitis, or the clinical syndrome of sore throat. Trials were included irrespective of language or publication status. Review methods Reviewers identified studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the evidence, independently and in duplicate. A parallel guideline committee (BMJ Rapid Recommendation) provided input on the design and interpretation of the systematic review, including the selection of outcomes important to patients. Random effects model was used for meta-analyses. Quality of evidence was assessed with the GRADE approach. Results 10 eligible trials enrolled 1426 individuals. Patients who received single low dose corticosteroids (the most common intervention was oral dexamethasone with a maximum dose of 10 mg) were twice as likely to experience pain relief after 24 hours (relative risk 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 4.3; risk difference 12.4%; moderate quality evidence) and 1.5 times more likely to have no pain at 48 hours (1.5, 1.3 to 1.8; risk difference 18.3%; high quality). The mean time to onset of pain relief in patients treated with corticosteroids was 4.8 hours earlier (95% confidence interval -1.9 to -7.8; moderate quality) and the mean time to complete resolution of pain was 11.1 hours earlier (-0.4 to -21.8; low quality) than in those treated with placebo. The absolute pain reduction at 24 hours (visual analogue scale 0–10) was greater in patients treated with corticosteroids (mean difference 1.3, 95% confidence interval 0.7 to 1.9; moderate quality). Nine of the 10 trials sought information regarding adverse events. Six studies reported no adverse effects, and three studies reported few adverse events, which were mostly complications related to disease, with a similar incidence in both groups. Conclusion Single low dose corticosteroids can provide pain relief in patients with sore throat, with no increase in serious adverse effects. Included trials did not assess the potential risks of larger cumulative doses in patients with recurrent episodes of acute sore throat. Systematic review registration PROSPERO CRD42017067808.

### The impact of national guidelines on the diagnostics of sore throat in children [^113kQ7Qw]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute pharyngitis is a common reason for seeking medical advice. The majority of pharyngitis cases are caused by viruses, and approximately 24–37% of children's pharyngitis is caused by Group A β-haemolytic streptococci (GAS). In high-income countries, rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease are rare complications of GAS infections, but they still impose a large disease burden in low-income countries. GAS pharyngitis can lead to suppurative complications, such as peritonsillar and retropharyngeal abscess, as well as toxin-mediated complications, scarlet fever, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. These complications are rare in high-income countries, and GAS is usually self-limited; therefore, antibiotic treatment should not be started to only prevent suppurative complications or relieve symptoms in patients with mild symptoms.

The Finnish treatment guidelines for sore throat were updated in June 2020, and the Centor score was presented as a diagnostic tool for GAS pharyngitis. According to the Centor criteria, one point is given for each of the following symptoms and clinical findings: absence of cough, tender and swollen submandibular lymph nodes, tonsillar exudate or swollen tonsils, and fever ≥ 38˚C. In the guideline update Centor score is recommended to use to direct antibiotic treatment to patients with more severe symptoms and higher likelihood of GAS. Patients with mild symptoms and Centor score (0–2) are recommended to be treated symptomatically and patients with severe symptoms (3–4) are recommended to be treated based on microbiological test results. A new guideline for microbiological testing of GAS was also provided. The new guidelines recommend using a rapid antigen detection test in patients with a Centor score of 3 or more. Throat culture should only be used in patients with prolonged symptoms or in epidemic situations. The guidelines also recommend against using C-reactive protein (CRP) tests in the diagnosis of pharyngitis, as they are ineffective at distinguishing viral from bacterial pathogens.

The aim of this study was to determine how the publication of the updated Finnish Current Care Guidelines affected treatment for pediatric patients, particularly the use of the Centor criteria, CRP tests, and microbiological testing in the diagnosis of GAS tonsillitis.

### Review: known, emerging, and remerging pharyngitis pathogens [^114miVT2]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Pharyngitis is an inflammatory condition of the pharynx and/or tonsils commonly seen in both children and adults. Viruses and bacteria represent the most common encountered etiologic agents — yeast/fungi and parasites are infrequently implicated. Some of these are predominantly observed in unique populations (eg, immunocompromised or unvaccinated individuals). This article (part 1 of 3) summarizes the impact of acute pharyngitis on the health care system and reviews the etiologic agents of acute pharyngitis, including both emerging and reemerging pathogens that health care providers should consider when evaluating their patients. Finally, it sets the stage for parts 2 and 3, which discuss the current and evolving state of diagnostic testing for acute pharyngitis.

### Differences among international pharyngitis guidelines: not just academic [^116HrY17]. Annals of Family Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Many countries have national guidelines for the treatment of pharyngitis. We wanted to compare the recommendations and the reported evidence in national guidelines for the management of acute sore throat in adults.

Methods

Guidelines were retrieved via MEDLINE and EMBASE and through a Web-based search for guideline development organizations. The content of the recommendations and the underlying evidence were analyzed with qualitative and bibliometric methods.

Results

We included 4 North American and 6 European guidelines. Recommendations differ with regard to the use of a rapid antigen test and throat culture and with the indication for antibiotics. The North American, French, and Finnish guidelines consider diagnosis of group A streptococcus essential, and prevention of acute rheumatic fever remains an important reason to prescribe antibiotics. In 4 of the 6 European guidelines, acute sore throat is considered a self-limiting disease and antibiotics are not recommended. The evidence used to underpin these guidelines was different in North America and Europe. North American guidelines cited more North American references than did European guidelines (87.2% vs 48.0%; ods ratio, 4.6–11.9; P < .001).

Conclusion

Although the evidence for the management of acute sore throat is easily available, national guidelines are different with regard to the choice of evidence and the interpretation for clinical practice. Also a transparent and standardized guideline development method is lacking. These findings are important in the context of appropriate antibiotic use, the problem of growing antimicrobial resistance, and costs for the community.

### Implementing criteria-led discharge for acute admissions to facilitate the elective recovery from COVID-19: an example in acute tonsillitis [^111FtNcF]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Pathway results

There were 137 patient admissions for acute tonsillitis during the post pathway implementation period. Thirty-five patient admissions were excluded from the study as they did not meet the pathway eligibility criteria. These patients were either being readmitted (n = 8), too unwell (n = 14), for example, evidence of septic shock or had an uncertain diagnosis at the time of admission (n = 12). One individual was not placed on the pathway due to pregnancy but was not otherwise ineligible. Of the 102 patients deemed eligible, 23 were treated on the tonsillitis pathway and 79 received standard treatment (see figure 2). The number of comorbidities was the only significant difference between study groups with those on the pathway having more concurrent conditions than those who received standard treatment. There was no difference, in age, gender, ethnicity or incidence of EBV (Ebstein Barr Virus) positive tonsillitis. 95.7% of patients placed on the tonsillitis pathway were prescribed medications according to the locally published guideline (see table 1).

Characteristics of patients admitted with tonsillitis following the implementation of the tonsillitis pathway

Implementation of the tonsillitis pathway has demonstrated reduced length of stay (median:18 hours, IQR: 11.5) compared with those receiving standard treatment (median: 24 hours, IQR: 19.5, p = 0.002) (see figure 3). Of those treated on the tonsillitis pathway, 52.2% were discharged prior to midday compared with 29.1% who received standard treatment (p = 0.04). No patients treated on the tonsillitis patients required readmission compared with 3.8% who received standard treatment (p > 0.05).

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update)-executive summary [^111JxXht]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2011 guideline developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations on the pre-, intra-, and postoperative care and management of children 1 to 18 years of age under consideration for tonsillectomy. Tonsillectomy is defined as a surgical procedure performed with or without adenoidectomy that completely removes the tonsil, including its capsule, by dissecting the peritonsillar space between the tonsil capsule and the muscular wall. Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, with 289,000 ambulatory procedures performed annually in children < 15 years of age, based on the most recent published data. This guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who interact with children who may be candidates for tonsillectomy.

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing children under consideration for tonsillectomy and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to educate clinicians, patients, and/or caregivers regarding the indications for tonsillectomy and the natural history of recurrent throat infections. Additional goals include the following: optimizing the perioperative management of children undergoing tonsillectomy, emphasizing the need for evaluation and intervention in special populations, improving the counseling and education of families who are considering tonsillectomy for their children, highlighting the management options for patients with modifying factors, and reducing inappropriate or unnecessary variations in care. Children aged 1 to 18 years under consideration for tonsillectomy are the target patient for the guideline. For this guideline update, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of nursing, anesthesiology, consumers, family medicine, infectious disease, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, and sleep medicine.

Key Action Statements

The guideline update group made strong recommendations for the following key action statements (KASs): (1) Clinicians should recommend watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection if there have been < 7 episodes in the past year, < 5 episodes per year in the past 2 years, or < 3 episodes per year in the past 3 years. (2) Clinicians should administer a single intraoperative dose of intravenous dexamethasone to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (3) Clinicians should recommend ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or both for pain control after tonsillectomy. The guideline update group made recommendations for the following KASs: (1) Clinicians should assess the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet criteria in KAS 2 for modifying factors that may nonetheless favor tonsillectomy, which may include but are not limited to multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerance, PFAPA (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis), or history of > 1 peritonsillar abscess. (2) Clinicians should ask caregivers of children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing and tonsillar hypertrophy about comorbid conditions that may improve after tonsillectomy, including growth retardation, poor school performance, enuresis, asthma, and behavioral problems. (3) Before performing tonsillectomy, the clinician should refer children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing for polysomnography if they are < 2 years of age or if they exhibit any of the following: obesity, Down syndrome, craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular disorders, sickle cell disease, or mucopolysaccharidoses. (4) The clinician should advocate for polysomnography prior to tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing in children without any of the comorbidities listed in KAS 5 for whom the need for tonsillectomy is uncertain or when there is discordance between the physical examination and the reported severity of obstructive sleep-disordered breathing. (5) Clinicians should recommend tonsillectomy for children with obstructive sleep apnea documented by overnight polysomnography. (6) Clinicians should counsel patients and caregivers and explain that obstructive sleep-disordered breathing may persist or recur after tonsillectomy and may require further management. (7) The clinician should counsel patients and caregivers regarding the importance of managing posttonsillectomy pain as part of the perioperative education process and should reinforce this counseling at the time of surgery with reminders about the need to anticipate, reassess, and adequately treat pain after surgery. (8) Clinicians should arrange for overnight, inpatient monitoring of children after tonsillectomy if they are < 3 years old or have severe obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 10 obstructive events/hour, oxygen saturation nadir < 80%, or both). (9) Clinicians should follow up with patients and/or caregivers after tonsillectomy and document in the medical record the presence or absence of bleeding within 24 hours of surgery (primary bleeding) and bleeding occurring later than 24 hours after surgery (secondary bleeding). (10) Clinicians should determine their rate of primary and secondary posttonsillectomy bleeding at least annually. The guideline update group made a strong recommendation against 2 actions: (1) Clinicians should not administer or prescribe perioperative antibiotics to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (2) Clinicians must not administer or prescribe codeine, or any medication containing codeine, after tonsillectomy in children younger than 12 years. The policy level for the recommendation about documenting recurrent throat infection was an option: (1) Clinicians may recommend tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection with a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year, at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years, or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and ≥ 1 of the following: temperature > 38.3°C (101°F), cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus.

Differences From Prior Guideline

Incorporating new evidence profiles to include the role of patient preferences, confidence in the evidence, differences of opinion, quality improvement opportunities, and any exclusion to which the action statement does not apply. There were 1 new clinical practice guideline, 26 new systematic reviews, and 13 new randomized controlled trials included in the current guideline update. Inclusion of 2 consumer advocates on the guideline update group. Changes to 5 KASs from the original guideline: KAS 1 (Watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection), KAS 3 (Tonsillectomy for recurrent infection with modifying factors), KAS 4 (Tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing), KAS 9 (Perioperative pain counseling), and KAS 10 (Perioperative antibiotics). Seven new KASs: KAS 5 (Indications for polysomnography), KAS 6 (Additional recommendations for polysomnography), KAS 7 (Tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea), KAS 12 (Inpatient monitoring for children after tonsillectomy), KAS 13 (Postoperative ibuprofen and acetaminophen), KAS 14 (Postoperative codeine), and KAS 15a (Outcome assessment for bleeding). Addition of an algorithm outlining KASs. Enhanced emphasis on patient and/or caregiver education and shared decision making.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^111h4gkF]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Efficacy and effectiveness of tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection show short-term benefits that diminish over time. Evidence "suggest[s] a modest but statistically significant reduction in frequency of throat infection among severely affected patients undergoing tonsillectomy for 1 year but no longer". In a trial meeting strict episode criteria, "the tonsillectomy group experienced a mean rate reduction of 1.9 episodes per year in the first year of follow-up", whereas controls had "a mean rate reduction of 0.5 to 1 episodes per year". For moderate or severe episodes, controls had "1.2 episodes in the first year versus 0.1 in the surgical group".

### Tonsillitis [^117HEKjo]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The definition of severe recurrent throat infections is arbitrary, but recent criteria have defined severe tonsillitis as: five or more episodes of true tonsillitis a year; symptoms for at least 1 year; and episodes that are disabling and prevent normal functioning. Diagnosis of acute tonsillitis is clinical, and it can be difficult to distinguish viral from bacterial infections. Rapid antigen testing has a very low sensitivity in the diagnosis of bacterial tonsillitis, but more accurate tests take longer to deliver results. Bacteria are cultured from few people with tonsillitis. Other causes include infectious mononucleosis from Epstein-Barr virus infection, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, HIV, hepatitis A, and rubella.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of tonsillectomy in children and adults with acute recurrent or chronic throat infections? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 15 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: cold-steel tonsillectomy and diathermy tonsillectomy.

### What's new with tubes, tonsils, and adenoids? [^113WMGYs]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based recommendations are constantly being updated for various pediatric surgical procedures, including the role for tympanostomy tubes, as well as indications for adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy. With a growing body of research available on some of the most prevalent pediatric conditions, an update on the current concepts surrounding management is warranted.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^113F4qLU]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Clinical practice guideline — scope and limitations state that the guideline is not intended as an exhaustive source of guidance and is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies, is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals and may not provide the only appropriate approach, and that clinical indicators and guidelines are promoted as conditional and provisional proposals that are not absolute; guidelines are not mandates, do not purport to be a legal standard of care, and the responsible physician must determine the appropriate treatment based on the individual patient.
