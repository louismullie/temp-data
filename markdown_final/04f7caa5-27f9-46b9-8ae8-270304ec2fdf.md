## Question

Ssri and dementia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether SSRI antidepressants increase the risk of dementia and how to interpret the conflicting evidence for clinical decision-making. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why this question matters. Then, I should verify the methodological limitations that make causal inference hard, especially confounding by indication and reverse causation. Next, I will examine high-quality studies that used active comparators or robust designs. After that, I should review studies suggesting harm, including those in people with established dementia. Then, I will consider biological plausibility and dose–duration nuances. Finally, I will synthesize a balanced conclusion and translate it into practical, guideline-aligned recommendations with appropriate monitoring and risk mitigation strategies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why this is important. Depression is a recognized risk factor for dementia, and SSRIs are first-line pharmacotherapy for late-life depression; thus, any signal that SSRIs themselves increase dementia risk could materially change risk–benefit discussions in older adults, particularly those with prodromal cognitive symptoms or established mild cognitive impairment [^1176qQDH] [^117LjwnP].

> Wait, let me verify the key methodological limitations before drawing conclusions. Most observational studies compare antidepressant users to nonusers, which invites confounding by indication because depression severity itself predicts dementia; reverse causation is also common, as prodromal neurocognitive symptoms prompt antidepressant prescribing before dementia is diagnosed, inflating apparent risk; additionally, many datasets lack dose, duration, or depression severity, and some combine heterogeneous antidepressant classes, obscuring class-specific effects [^115A4zT8] [^116pq5oR] [^1114X4Hy].

> I will now examine the highest-quality evidence that attempted to mitigate these biases. The Rotterdam Study, a large prospective cohort with repeated cognitive testing and MRI, found no association between SSRI use and incident dementia, cognitive decline, or brain atrophy compared with never use, and only a modest, nonsignificant association for SSRIs overall that did not show a dose–response pattern, which argues against a causal effect in cognitively intact older adults [^112VgGzZ] [^115crUMm]. A large US veteran cohort starting from midlife MDD diagnoses, using time-varying exposure, likewise found no association between antidepressant exposure and subsequent AD/ADRD, further reducing concern for a causal signal in depression cohorts [^116w4xVU] [^114mpZQA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should also review studies suggesting harm. Several retrospective cohorts using active comparators reported that SSRI/SNRI use was associated with higher short-term dementia incidence versus psychotherapy in older adults with depression, with adjusted odds around 1.3–1.4; however, these analyses had only 2-year follow-up, lacked incident-user designs, and could not fully adjust for unmeasured confounding or competing risks, so causality remains uncertain [^117Nd9Jq] [^116Kyv7z] [^112hKSQc]. Let me double-check the magnitude and context: crude dementia incidence in those studies was high over 2 years, which may reflect ascertainment and short-window bias rather than true drug effect, and subgroup analyses showed no association in several strata, reinforcing the likelihood of residual confounding [^116YDd6K].

> Next, I should review evidence in people who already have dementia or MCI, because the risk–benefit calculus differs. Multiple cohorts and meta-analyses indicate antidepressants, including SSRIs, show little to no benefit for depression in dementia and may be associated with faster cognitive decline, higher risks of severe dementia, fractures, and mortality, particularly at higher doses; the HTA-SADD randomized trial found no improvement in depression scores with sertraline or mirtazapine versus placebo and more adverse events, and contemporary national cohorts corroborate faster MMSE decline with SSRIs in dementia, especially at higher dispensed doses [^1124jbSm] [^114YdPmC] [^115nWY2g] [^112yi42z]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought SSRIs might uniformly worsen cognition in dementia, but I should correct that: some signals vary by agent and population, and the clinical significance of the observed MMSE changes is small, yet the balance of evidence favors caution and close monitoring when treating depression in established dementia [^1164z2cn] [^113PWpyy].

> I need to check biological plausibility and dose–duration considerations. Preclinical and translational data suggest SSRIs can reduce amyloid-β production and have anti-inflammatory effects, and in MCI cohorts with a history of depression, long-term SSRI use has been associated with delayed progression to AD by roughly 3 years, although biomarker changes were not detected in that study, so the mechanism remains uncertain [^112CnuyM] [^1176qQDH]. Conversely, paroxetine has anticholinergic activity and has been linked to higher dementia risk in observational analyses, and some neuropathology studies associate SSRI use with higher tau tangles, though this likely reflects treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms in evolving neurodegeneration rather than a direct causal effect of SSRIs on tau pathology [^115TwwwW] [^116pbThm].

> Let me synthesize and ensure internal consistency. In cognitively intact older adults with depression, contemporary high-quality cohorts suggest no causal increase in dementia risk from SSRIs, whereas short-term observational comparisons against psychotherapy may show a spurious association due to residual confounding and short follow-up. In established dementia, SSRIs are largely ineffective for depression and may accelerate cognitive decline modestly, so the harm signal is more plausible and clinically relevant in that subgroup [^112VgGzZ] [^116w4xVU] [^1124jbSm] [^115nWY2g].

> I should now translate this into practical clinical guidance, but let me verify alignment with guidelines first. For late-life depression without dementia, SSRIs remain first-line given favorable tolerability; if concern about cognition is high, prefer agents with minimal anticholinergic burden and consider psychotherapy as an alternative or adjunct, while recognizing that short-term observational signals versus psychotherapy likely reflect confounding rather than causation [^117LjwnP]. For patients with dementia and depression, I need to ensure expectations are realistic: evidence for antidepressant efficacy is limited and harm signals exist, so start low, go slow, reassess early, and prioritize nonpharmacologic strategies; if an SSRI is used, monitor cognition and function closely and consider deprescribing if no clear benefit emerges [^1124jbSm] [^114YdPmC] [^112Ld8JV].

> But wait, what if the patient is on paroxetine or another more anticholinergic SSRI? Given the observed association with dementia risk and known anticholinergic effects, switching to a less anticholinergic SSRI such as sertraline or escitalopram is reasonable when clinically feasible, especially in older adults at risk for cognitive decline, while acknowledging that this is based on observational data and not randomized trials [^115TwwwW].

> Finally, I should confirm monitoring and risk mitigation steps. In older adults starting SSRIs, screen for hyponatremia, falls, and drug–drug interactions, and in those with established cognitive impairment, track MMSE or other standardized measures at intervals to detect early decline. If cognition worsens without mood benefit, taper and discontinue, and consider nonpharmacologic depression interventions such as behavioral activation, caregiver education, and environmental modifications, which carry fewer risks in dementia care contexts [^1124ttDS] [^112Ld8JV].

> In conclusion, I should double-check that my bottom line matches the weight of evidence: SSRIs do not appear to cause dementia in cognitively intact older adults with depression, whereas in people with established dementia, SSRIs are largely ineffective for depression and may modestly accelerate cognitive decline. Therefore, continue to use SSRIs appropriately for late-life depression with routine precautions, but exercise additional caution, lower dosing, and vigilant monitoring in dementia, and prioritize nonpharmacologic strategies whenever possible [^112VgGzZ] [^116w4xVU] [^1124jbSm] [^115nWY2g].

SSRIs are not clearly associated with increased dementia risk in older adults, but **conflicting evidence** exists. Some observational studies suggest a small increase in dementia risk with SSRI use, likely due to confounding by indication and depression severity [^116nwkGP] [^115A4zT8]. In contrast, other large cohorts found no association or even a protective effect, especially with long-term use [^112VgGzZ] [^112HZ5aL]. SSRIs are still **first-line for late-life depression** because untreated depression itself increases dementia risk; if used, start low, titrate slowly, and monitor cognition and falls [^117LjwnP] [^1124ttDS].

---

## Evidence linking SSRIs to dementia risk

### Studies suggesting increased dementia risk

- **Observational studies**: Several observational studies have reported an association between SSRI use and increased dementia risk, but these are likely confounded by indication and depression severity [^116nwkGP] [^115A4zT8].

- **Meta-analyses**: Meta-analyses report a modest association (OR ~1.14–1.21), but with substantial heterogeneity and confounding, limiting causal inference [^112UWRMQ].

- **Specific SSRIs**: Paroxetine, with anticholinergic effects, has been linked to higher dementia risk in older adults [^115TwwwW].

---

### Studies suggesting no association or protective effects

- **Rotterdam Study**: Large prospective cohort found no association between SSRI use and dementia, cognitive decline, or brain atrophy [^112VgGzZ] [^115crUMm].

- **Long-term use**: Long-term SSRI use (≥ 2 years) has been associated with reduced dementia incidence, particularly for escitalopram [^112HZ5aL].

- **MCI progression**: Long-term SSRI use may delay progression from MCI to Alzheimer's dementia by ~3 years [^112CnuyM].

---

## Biological mechanisms underlying SSRI use and dementia risk

SSRIs may influence dementia risk through **multiple mechanisms**:

| **Mechanism** | **Potential impact on dementia risk** |
|-|-|
| Serotonin modulation | - May promote neurogenesis <br/> - Reduce neuroinflammation <br/> - And enhance synaptic plasticity, potentially reducing dementia risk [^1176qQDH] |
| Anticholinergic activity | - Some SSRIs (e.g. paroxetine) have anticholinergic effects, which may impair cognition and increase dementia risk [^115TwwwW] [^111vMMtc] |
| Amyloid-beta processing | - SSRIs may reduce amyloid-beta production, potentially lowering Alzheimer's risk [^113cBmoK] [^112CnuyM] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines support **SSRI use in older adults** with depression, emphasizing careful selection, dosing, and monitoring:

- **First-line treatment**: SSRIs are first-line for late-life depression due to favorable tolerability and safety [^117LjwnP].

- **Dosing**: Start low, titrate slowly, and monitor for side effects, including hyponatremia and falls [^115HxuvK] [^1124ttDS].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess cognitive function, mood, and side effects during treatment [^112hzVdL].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

Given the mixed evidence, **clinicians should**:

- **Individualize treatment**: Consider patient-specific factors (age, comorbidities, cognitive status) when selecting SSRIs [^113hhdDq].

- **Prefer safer SSRIs**: Use SSRIs with minimal anticholinergic activity (e.g. sertraline, escitalopram) when possible [^1124ttDS].

- **Monitor closely**: Regularly assess cognitive function, mood, and side effects during treatment [^115nWY2g].

- **Balance risks and benefits**: Untreated depression increases dementia risk; SSRIs remain appropriate with careful monitoring [^1176qQDH].

---

SSRIs are not clearly linked to increased dementia risk; evidence is mixed and likely confounded. They remain **first-line for late-life depression**, and if used, clinicians should select agents with low anticholinergic burden, start low, titrate slowly, and monitor cognition and falls.

People with dementia and a major depressive disorder

Twenty two studies (1829 people with dementia) reported outcomes for interventions aimed at reducing symptoms of depression in people with dementia and a major depressive disorder. The greatest risk to review findings was from missing data: 73% of studies were at high risk of bias from missing data (see supplementary table 5b and figure 1b). Too few studies and anticipated substantial heterogeneity among study characteristics and interventions precluded pairwise meta-analysis or NMA (see supplementary tables 3b and 4b). Studies were conducted in both community and non-community settings and enrolled participants with Alzheimer's disease or unspecified types of dementia. Drug interventions included mirtazapine, sertraline, venlafaxine, fluoxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, desipramine, imipramine, clomipramine, amitriptyline, and paroxetine. Seven randomised controlled trials reported the comparative efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ie, sertraline, fluoxetine, citalopram, escitalopram) and placebo, with mixed conclusions. Neither mirtazapine nor venlafaxine were associated with improved symptoms of depression compared with placebo. Multidisciplinary care was found to be more efficacious than usual care in one randomised controlled trial, but evidence supporting the efficacy of other non-drug interventions — namely, psychotherapy and exercise — was mixed. Drug strategies for pain management (ie, paracetamol (acetaminophen) or buprenorphine) were not found to be superior to placebo.

### Antidepressant medications in dementia: evidence and potential mechanisms of treatment-resistance [^113AGrfR]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Effective development of treatments for depression in dementia will depend on refining phenotypes and integrating our understanding of the evolution of depression over time with the progression in dementia pathology. A personalised medicine approach using clinical and biological markers to identify different phenotypes and effective treatments is an important area of future research in this patient group. Recent work using existing large cohorts has identified different trajectories of depressive symptoms in older adults depending on AD biomarker status (Banning, Ramakers, Rosenberg, Lyketsos, & Leoutsakos).

The processes discussed above of why antidepressants don't work in dementia offer insights and perspective for the future development of treatments for patients living with depression and dementia. Methods such as theory-driven computational modelling and approaching depression in dementia as a complex system of interacting behavioural, cognitive and neurobiological parts will be needed. However, these tools now exist and if integrated into future trials and drug development in depression and dementia could offer hope for identifying effective antidepressants for this patient group. The alternative of using the same approaches but expecting a different answer is unlikely to lead to the desperately needed treatments patients living with depression and dementia deserve.

3.4 Pooled analyses

Overall, the pooled estimates from the five studies showed that the use of antidepressants was associated with a significant twofold increase in the odds of dementia/cognitive impairment (OR = 2.17; 95% CI: 1.41–3.33; I² = 84.9%) (Fig. 2). Approximately 85% of the variability of the estimates could be attributed to differences that existed between the studies. Subgroup analysis on factors determined a priori was carried out to further explore the potential reasons for between‐study variations. Regarding the study designs used, the only RCT included (OR = 2.12; 95% CI: 1.40‐3.21) (Goveas et al. 2012) and those with a cohort design (OR = 2.67; 95% CI: 1.71‐4.19; I² = 71.6%) (Angst et al. 2007; Cherbuin et al. 2009; Kessing et al. 2009) showed similar increments as those observed with the overall estimate. The only study that used a cross‐sectional design found no significant association between antidepressant use and some form of cognitive impairment (OR = 1.18; 95% CI: 0.71–1.96) (Sachdev et al. 2012). When considering the specific types of outcome, the studies with an outcome of dementia (Angst et al. 2007; Kessing et al. 2009) showed a pooled OR of 2.45 (95% CI: 1.29–4.64; I² = 85.8%) while those that focused on mild cognitive impairment or any other type of cognitive impairment (Cherbuin et al. 2009; Goveas et al. 2012; Sachdev et al. 2012) showed a pooled OR of 1.95 (95% CI: 1.14–3.35; I² = 67%).

Similar patterns can be found in the relevant animal literature. For example, acute SSRI regimens have been associated with neuroprotective profiles on pathological markers as well as cognition and memory in mouse models of AD‐like neuropathology (discussed in (Sierksma et al. 2016)), whereas a chronic SSRI regimen is associated with seizures and increased mortality, as observed in males of an AD‐related mouse model (Sierksma et al. 2016). The latter observation is consistent with our findings of a higher, albeit modest, effect estimate in the study with male predominance of participants (current study) as well as our previous report of a higher risk of mortality in demented male patients with a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis (Meng et al. 2012).

Mouse models also indicate an age‐dependent shift in toxicity profile associated with antidepressant drugs. Indeed, studies involving the Down syndrome Ts65DN mouse model (note that Down syndrome and AD share several neuropathological markers and cognitive phenotypes, including dementia and depression) indicate that the SSRI fluoxetine can restore the depletion of serotonin, which appears to prevent the loss of dendritic arborization (Guidi et al. 2013) and the diminished neurogenesis in hippocampus (Bianchi et al. 2010; Clark et al. 2006), and, in turn, mitigates cognitive deficits (Bianchi et al. 2010) in these mice. However, any benefit of SSRI/fluoxetine in these mice is lost with age, given that fluoxetine exacerbates neuropathological phenotypes in older mice (Heinen et al. 2012).

### Antidepressant use and cognitive decline in patients with dementia: a national cohort study [^113PWpyy]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this nationwide cohort study, we found that the current use of antidepressants was associated with faster cognitive decline in patients with dementia compared with non-use, and this association was driven mainly by patients with severe dementia. Higher dispensed doses of SSRIs were associated with more cognitive decline during follow-up, and higher risk of severe dementia, fracture, and all-cause mortality.

Previous studies of antidepressant use and cognitive decline in people with dementia have shown mixed findings. Most clinical trials reporting the effect of antidepressants on neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognition, did so as a secondary or safety outcome. In the majority of the cases reported, antidepressants had the same effect on cognition as placebo, but some reported a significant decline on the MMSE scores in antidepressant users. Many of the clinical trials were too small to provide precise estimates of the moderate benefits on cognition that might realistically be expected. A recently conducted RCT reported worsening of cognition in patients with AD who used citalopram over 9 weeks. In contrast, other RCTs in AD indicated that another two SSRIs, sertraline and escitalopram, had no effect on cognitive function. Individual antidepressants even within same class cannot be considered identical drugs. Evidence has shown some differences regarding the speed of onset of response and adverse events among individual SSRIs. Recent findings demonstrated that specifically sertraline, escitalopram, and mirtazapine had relatively higher responses and lower dropout profile compared to other antidepressants. These differences may influence medication choice for a given patient and may show varied effect on dementia progression. More studies are needed to explore the underlying mechanisms, optimal timing for intervention, and the types of patients who would benefit the most from these specific medications.

### The association of antidepressant drug usage with cognitive impairment or dementia, including Alzheimer disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114DRG6Q]. Depression and Anxiety (2017). Low credibility.

The overall pooled estimate for all five studies was OR = 2.17 (95% CI: 1.41–3.33; I² = 84.9%), which was similar to the pooled estimate of OR = 2.00 (95% CI: 1.21–3.29) obtained when the study with the greatest effect estimate (Cherbuin et al. 2009) was excluded. Similarly, excluding the study with the largest sample size (Kessing et al. 2009), yielded a pooled estimate of OR = 1.85 (95% CI: 1.28–2.69). Influential analyses done using Tobias' method (1999) showed that the pooled estimates obtained with the exclusion of one study at each turn always remained within the 95% CI of the overall estimates calculated for antidepressant use and some form of cognitive impairment. Thus, none of the studies had a significant individual, influential effect on the overall estimates.

Given the small number of studies included in this meta‐analysis, it was difficult to clearly ascertain the symmetry of the funnel plot. Thus, and in order to assess for publication bias, statistical testing for symmetry of the plot was completed using Begg's test (Begg & Mazumdar, 1994). The test was not statistically significant (adjusted Kendall's score = −4, P = 0.462) suggesting publication bias was unlikely. However, it should be noted that the statistical tests for funnel plot symmetry usually suffer from low power when the meta‐analysis includes a small number of studies (Sterne, Gavaghan, & Egger, 2000).

### Advances in pharmacotherapy of late-life depression [^117LjwnP]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2018). Low credibility.

This paper reviews recent research on late-life depression (LLD) pharmacotherapy, focusing on updated information for monotherapy and augmentation treatments. We then review new research on moderators of clinical response and how to use the information for improved efficacy.

Recent Findings

A recent review shows that sertraline, paroxetine, and duloxetine were superior to placebo for the treatment of LLD. There is concern that paroxetine could have adverse outcomes in the geriatric population due to anticholinergic properties; however, studies show no increases in mortality, dementia risk, or cognitive measures. Among newer antidepressants, vortioxetine has demonstrated efficacy in LLD, quetiapine has demonstrated efficacy especially for patients with sleep disturbances, and aripiprazole augmentation for treatment resistance in LLD was found to be safe and effective. Researchers have also been identifying moderators of LLD that can guide treatment. Researchers are learning how to associate moderators, neuroanatomical models, and antidepressant response. SSRI/SNRIs remain first-line treatment for LLD. Aripiprazole is an effective and safe augmentation for treatment resistance. Studies are identifying actionable moderators that can increase treatment response.

### The association of antidepressant drug usage with cognitive impairment or dementia, including Alzheimer disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111EoXbm]. Depression and Anxiety (2017). Low credibility.

Of all the subgroup analyses carried out, only the categorization by average age shows a significant difference, i.e. there is no overlap of the CI for the groups with an average age of 65 or older versus those less than age 65. Thus, age might be a significant interactor in the relationship between antidepressant drug usage and cognitive impairment. In both of these groups, there are increased odds noted, but the effect is more pronounced in those less than age 65. Though not statistically significant, there appears to be a stronger association between antidepressant drug use and dementia than that seen with antidepressant drug usage and mild cognitive impairment or any other type of cognitive impairment. As with the overall association, a stronger effect of antidepressants in older respondents may represent a causal effect of antidepressants on risk. However, other explanations cannot be ruled out. For example, if vascular disease in more elderly people leads more often to antidepressant prescriptions, subsequent worsening of cognition may be due to confounded effects of vascular disease and/or antidepressants.

The literature suggests an increasing burden of dementia with increasing age, most notably after age 65 (Richard et al. 2012; World Alzheimer Report, 2014). However, it is clear that AD/dementia, being a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder, likely develops from events, including depression, that are triggered well before the onset of any overt symptomatology (Emery, 2011; Green et al. 2003; Saczynski et al. 2010). Given the inevitable polypharmacy and long‐term antidepressant drug usage in any younger cohort with an early‐onset or persistent form of depression, a higher risk for off‐target biochemical effects of the drug(s) — with, for example, potential interactions with, or long‐term effects on, normal, age‐dependent metabolic, epigenetic and/or hormonal systems — and eventual iatrogenic cognitive phenotypes would not be unexpected. In keeping with this notion, a family history of an affective disorder can increase the likelihood of a depressive episode during the course of AD (Pearlson et al. 1990; Strauss & Ogrocki, 1996) and a younger age at onset of AD is associated with a greater depression (Lawlor et al. 1994), with depression worsening as AD progresses (Mega, Cummings, Fiorello, & Gornbein, 1996). It is clear that an effect of earlier age of onset of use may reflect longer use of an antidepressant or it may reflect a longer history of depression, so the issue of confounding remains a limitation here.

### Safety of pharmacologic interventions for neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115wbuzG]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

There are 50 million people worldwide living with dementia. Pharmacologic (e.g. antidepressants and antipsychotics) and nonpharmacologic (e.g. recreation therapy) interventions are administered as treatment for cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with dementia. In persons with dementia, pharmacologic interventions, most notably antipsychotics, have been associated with significant risk including cerebrovascular accidents and death. Studies show that as clinicians adopt recommendations of clinical practice guidelines and de-prescribing initiatives to taper and discontinue antipsychotics in persons living with dementia, alternative pharmacologic interventions (e.g. antidepressants, anticonvulsants) are prescribed to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms rather than nonpharmacologic alternatives, despite their demonstrated efficacy. Pharmacologic interventions continue to be prescribed by clinicians for many reasons, including perceived patient, staff, and system barriers to implementation of nonpharmacologic interventions in busy clinical settings.

Given the high prescription rates of pharmacologic interventions for cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia and the paucity of head-to-head randomized trials (RCTs) that knowledge users (e.g. patients, caregivers, and clinicians) can use to inform shared decision-making, we conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) to fill this critical knowledge gap. Our objectives were to: (1) determine the comparative risks of: fracture, mortality, cerebrovascular events, and falls associated with pharmacologic interventions dispensed for treating neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia; and (2) establish the safest pharmacologic interventions to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia.

### Association between first-line antidepressant use and risk of dementia in older adults: a retrospective cohort study [^117FxfSj]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

One out of ten older adults aged ≥ 65 years suffers from dementia in the United States (US), and the prevalence dramatically increases with age. The economic burden of dementia is estimated to be high, exceeding $321 billion (not including $272 billion in unpaid caregiving). As such, dementia is among the leading contributors to the global disease burden, which accounts for 4.3% of the number of years lost due to ill health, disability, or early death (i.e. disability-adjusted life years). Furthermore, depression affects approximately 8.4% of US adults, especially those aged 15–49 years. Patients with early-life depression (i.e. onset before the age of 60) have a 2- to 3-fold higher risk of developing dementia, probably through cerebrovascular changes, an increase in glucocorticoids and proinflammatory cytokines, and a decrease in nerve growth factors that lead to hippocampal atrophy and cognitive impairment.

Psychotherapy and antidepressants are considered the mainstay treatments for depression. Psychotherapy refers to talking with psychologists, psychiatrists, or other providers to relieve mental health issues, and thus is sometimes called "talk therapy". Antidepressants are drugs targeting certain neurotransmitters to modulate mood and behavior, of which the mechanism of action differs slightly by classes. Among the antidepressant classes, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI, e.g. fluoxetine) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI, e.g. venlafaxine) are considered first-line pharmacological pharmacotherapy due to fewer side effects compared to others such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs, e.g. amitriptyline).

Although antidepressants are beneficial for managing depressive symptoms, some studies reported the association between antidepressants and risk of dementia. For example, a meta-analysis found an increased long-term risk (follow-up > 1 year) of dementia associated with antidepressant use compared to no use among older adults. Kodesh et al. also suggested that antidepressant use was associated with a more than 3-fold increased risk of dementia compared to nonusers among older adults, probably due to their anticholinergic side effects. However, the findings were inconsistent in other studies. For instance, Eisch et al. suggested that antidepressants may have cognitive benefits owing to their anti-inflammatory and neurogenic properties in addition to reducing depressive symptoms. Jacob et al. also found that the use of antidepressants was associated with a reduced risk of dementia in patients with moderate or severe depression compared to nonusers of antidepressants.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^115HxuvK]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Antidepressant dosing in dementia — elderly patients: Low starting doses, small dose increases, and long intervals between increases are advised; citalopram is started at 5–10 mg/day and increased at several-week intervals to a maximum of 40 mg/day, and sertraline may be started at 12.5–25.0 mg/day and increased at 1–2-week intervals up to a maximum dosage of 150–200 mg/day. If initial agents are ineffective, venlafaxine can be started at 25 mg/day (extended release, 37.5 mg/day) and increased at approximately weekly intervals up to a maximum of 375 mg/day in divided doses (extended release, 225 mg/day), and if venlafaxine is prescribed, careful monitoring of blood pressure is indicated. Mirtazapine can be started at 7.5 mg at bedtime and increased by 7.5-mg or 15-mg increments to 45–60 mg at bedtime; lower dosages have been associated with sedation and appetite increase, and less sedation is found in dosages over 15 mg/day. Bupropion should be used in prescribing with caution for patients with liver dysfunction or renal impairment and for patients who develop signs of delirium; it can be started at 37.5 mg once or twice per day (sustained release, 100 mg/day) and increased slowly to a maximum dosage of 300 mg/day in divided doses (sustained release, 300 mg/day), and no more than 150 mg of immediate release bupropion should be given within any 4- hour period because of the risk of seizures. Duloxetine can be started at 20–40 mg/day and increased slowly to a maximum of 60–80 mg/day, typically in divided doses.

### Present algorithms and future treatments for Alzheimer's disease [^114seEbf]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THERAPIES FOR NEUROPSYCHIATRIC SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

Treatments for neuropsychiatric features are an integral part of AD management. Estimates are that over time, > 90% of patients with AD will develop behavioral/psychiatric changes. Although no agent is currently approved to treat these symptoms in the United States, antidepressants and antipsychotics are commonly used off label in patients with AD. In general, the use of antidepressants (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]) for the treatment of depressive symptoms associated with dementia is recommended (Table 3), although the available evidence is mixed. Similarly, treatment with antipsychotics should be undertaken with caution and only used for moderate or severe agitation, aggression, and psychosis that create significant distress or danger. The use of antipsychotics in frail elders with dementia is associated with serious complications, including cerebrovascular AEs and mortality. The mortality rates vary among first-generation (typical) and second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics, and 6-month mortality rates of up to 20% have been reported in patients with dementia (haloperidol, 20%; olanzapine, 13%; risperidone, 13%; quetiapine, 9%). Thus, the potential benefits with antipsychotic treatment should be weighed against risks.

The SSRI citalopram has shown treatment benefits at doses of 30 mg/day or greater. In patients with probable AD, citalopram significantly reduced agitation compared with placebo. However, citalopram 30 mg/day was associated with QT interval prolongation, and patients older than 60 should not exceed a daily dose of 20 mg per FDA safety warning, which limits the use of citalopram among patients with AD. A recent study reported that citalopram (60 mg) reduced the amyloid- β concentration in cerebrospinal fluid in healthy adults and blocked the growth of amyloid plaques in an animal model, suggesting that it may have a disease-modifying role in AD. Additionally, evidence suggests, but does not prove, possible behavioral benefits of donepezil and memantine. Further studies are needed to confirm these research findings and address their potential clinical relevance.

### Antidepressant medications in dementia: evidence and potential mechanisms of treatment-resistance [^115JaTZt]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Further trials of medications that treat depression as homogenous across dementia subtypes and stage of disease are likely to be ineffective. An alternative approach to understanding depression in dementia is to view it as a complex system of interacting depressive symptoms, which differ across dementia subtypes and stages of disease. Utilising this approach would promote tailored interventions for specific symptoms with greater importance at different stages of disease, development of depressive-symptom-network markers for each condition to guide interventions and diagnosis, and provide some mechanistic insights into the causes of depression.

### Association between first-line antidepressant use and risk of dementia in older adults: a retrospective cohort study [^114eDpth]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our findings provide valuable insight into the complex association among depression, antidepressants, and risk of dementia, providing additional evidence for clinicians while prescribing antidepressants for patients with depression. Future longitudinal studies are warranted to allow the identification of new users of antidepressants and the evaluation of long-term dementia risk.

### Antidepressant use and cognitive decline in patients with dementia: a national cohort study [^1164z2cn]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study showed significantly faster cognitive decline in patients with SSRIs (i.e. citalopram, sertraline, and escitalopram) compared to non-use. However, the magnitude of the effect of citalopram (0.41 points/year), sertraline (0.25 points/year), and escitalopram (0.76 points/year) appears to be lower than the minimum clinically significant change in MMSE score of 1–3 points. A meta-analysis that included 15 RCTs involving a total of 1616 patients with AD found that second-generation antidepressants had no effect on global cognition measured by MMSE, and this remained in subgroup analyses of duration of medication, drug classes, combination with anti-dementia medication, various NPS, and degree of AD. However, results from meta-analyses may be biased without adjustment for the clinical status of patients such as chronic physical disease and are not quantitatively assessed since most of the trials included used flexible doses of antidepressants. Sertraline and escitalopram are first hand choices for depression among older individuals in Sweden. However, antidepressants do not seem to work as well in patients with dementia, possibly because "depression in dementia is a different illness" than depression in people with intact cognition. Cognitive control dysfunction in dementia appears to decrease the effectiveness of some SSRIs. In our study, we found SSRIs were associated with a small negative impact on cognitive functioning, but its clinical significance is uncertain.

Evidence regarding the long-term effect of antidepressants on cognitive decline in VaD is lacking. In previous open-label studies in patients with VaD, MMSE score increased significantly in the fluoxetine (SSRI) group but not in the control group. Another study conducted in patients with vascular cognitive impairment without dementia found that, compared with controls, fluoxetine (SSRI) was associated with better performance on Ten Point Clock drawing test, indicating better cognitive functioning and greater ability to understand spatial relationships, plan, and execute tasks, but no significant differences in change of Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale score. In this study, we found that antidepressant use was associated with a significant decline in cognition in patients with VaD compared to non-use. Furthermore, we also observed a slower cognitive decline in younger (< 78 years) patients with FTD. In line with our observation, Laura et al. found that citalopram can partially restore the dysfunctional prefrontal cortical systems by increasing serotonergic neurotransmission in FTD. Future long-term studies are warranted to validate our findings.

### Antidepressant use and cognitive decline: the health and retirement study [^111DQnQM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Depression is associated with cognitive impairment and dementia, but whether treatment for depression with antidepressants reduces the risk for cognitive decline is unclear. We assessed the association between antidepressant use and cognitive decline over 6 years.

Methods

Participants were 3714 adults aged 50 years or more who were enrolled in the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study and had self-reported antidepressant use. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 8-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Cognitive function was assessed at 4 time points (2004, 2006, 2008, 2010) using a validated 27-point scale. Change in cognitive function over the 6-year follow-up period was examined using linear growth models, adjusted for demographics, depressive symptoms, comorbidities, functional limitations, and antidepressant anticholinergic activity load.

Results

At baseline, cognitive function did not differ significantly between the 445 (12.1%) participants taking antidepressants and those not taking antidepressants (mean, 14.9%; 95% confidence interval, 14.3–15.4 vs mean, 15.1%; 95% confidence interval, 14.9–15.3). During the 6-year follow up period, cognition declined in both users and nonusers of antidepressants, ranging from -1.4 change in mean score in those with high depressive symptoms and taking antidepressants to -0.5 change in mean score in those with high depressive symptoms and not taking antidepressants. In adjusted models, cognition declined in people taking antidepressants at the same rate as those not taking antidepressants. Results remained consistent across different levels of baseline cognitive function, age, and duration of antidepressant use (prolonged vs short-term).

Conclusions

Antidepressant use did not modify the course of 6-year cognitive change in this nationally representative sample.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Study selection

The initial search parameters identified 4,193 articles. Of these, 1,523 were removed as duplicates. The rest of the studies were carefully screened by title and abstract, and an additional 2,565 were removed for not being relevant to our study. This eventually yielded a pool of 105 articles; the full articles were then retrieved and further screened for relevance. Five of the articles were deemed relevant by both reviewers after the full article screening. These five articles underwent methodology quality review from which all five articles passed and were included in the meta‐analysis (Fig. 1).

3.2 Methodological quality

The methodological quality review of the studies is reported in Table 1. The main methodology deficit noted among the included studies was the absence of blinding among the assessors. Also, most of the studies did not explicitly state if any differences existed between participants included in their study and those not included. Strengths in the methodology of the included studies ranged from adequate description of the source population, adequate outcome data at follow‐up, proper assessment of outcome, avoidance of overfitting issues (i.e. at least 10 participants in the smallest group per predictor and outcome variable), proper statistical analysis, and consideration of important confounders.

### SSRI's and the rate of progression from MCI to dementia… [^114Q2qLd]. ClinicalTrials (2021). Medium credibility.

- 1. To determine if subjects treated with an SSRI for at least one year prior to the diagnosis of MCI or at least 6 months after the diagnosis of MCI will have a lower rate of progression to Alzheimer's disease dementia or have a lower rate of progression to other dementia conditions compared to subjects who are not treated with an SSRI.
- 1. To investigate correlations between the rate of conversion from MCI to dementia and other factors. This trial is investigating if serotonin reuptake inhibitor use in Mild Cognitive Impairment patients will lead to a lower rate of progression to dementia.

It's hypothesized that patients treated with an SSRI at the time of MCI diagnosis, without evidence of an active primary psychiatric condition other than neurocognitive disorder, will have a lower rate of progression to Alzheimer's disease dementia or to other types of dementia. Detailed Description. Whether SSRIs affect the progression of MCI to dementia is not well studied with longitudinal prospectively collected date. Any decrease in the incidence of the progression of MCI to Alzheimer's dementia would be beneficial to patients. This trial is investigating if serotonin reuptake inhibitor use in Mild Cognitive Impairment patients will lead to a lower rate of progression to dementia. This is a retrospective study of prospectively collected longitudinal data in patients followed at the Cognitive and Memory Disorders Center from 2010–2019.

There are 3 arms: subjects with an initial diagnosis of MCI who were treated with an SSRI for at least one year prior to the diagnosis of MCI subjects with an initial diagnosis of MCI who were started on an SSRI at the time of diagnosis and treated with it for at least 6 months after the diagnosis of MCI and subjects without SSRI use.

### Recommendations from others… [^116Xgt9a]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Which medications are effective at decreasing agitation in patients with dementia. Evidence-Based Answer Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and risperidone are moderately effective at decreasing agitation in all types of dementia. Olanzapine and risperidone reduce dementia-related agitation much longer than placebo. Dextromethorphan/quinidine may be effective at reducing agitation in patients with dementia.

1. Evidence Summary A 2018 meta-analysis examining medications used to alleviate agitation in all types of dementia included 36 RCTs with a total of 5, 585 participants. Two trials measured changes in Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory scores and found a slight yet statistically significant improvement with SSRIs compared with placebo. 3 The interventions were equally effective in treating agitation in patients with Alzheimer-type dementia and citalopram was associated with fewer adverse outcomes than quetiapine and olanzapine. The NPI scale assesses 12 items, each with a score of 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating worsening agitation.

Recommendations from Others The American Psychiatric Association supports the use of nonemergency antipsychotic treatment for behavioral/psychological symptoms of dementia after assessing for pain and exhausting nonpharmacologic options, and when symptoms are severe, dangerous, or cause significant distress to the patient. They recommend starting at a low dosage and discontinuing therapy for severe adverse effects or lack of improvement at four weeks. Even if treatment is effective, an attempt to taper should be made at four months. 5 Copyright © Family Physicians Inquiries Network. Used with permission.

### Antidepressant use in relation to dementia risk, cognitive decline, and brain atrophy [^115AMu8p]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

With respect to antidepressant types, SSRI use was not associated with dementia risk (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.81–1.54; Figure 1), irrespective of duration of use and cumulative dose (Figure 1, Table S1). Use of TCAs was associated with a mild to moderate increase in dementia risk (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.01–1.83), but without evidence of a dose–response relationship (Figure 1, Table S1). Use of a combination of antidepressants was not associated with dementia risk (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.60–1.38). The limited number of cases within this group prohibited stratification by dose or duration of use (Table S1).

Results were comparable for clinical AD only (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.82–1.35). Effect estimates for all‐cause dementia were higher for current use than for past use (HR 1.38, 95% CI 0.99–1.93, for current use; and for past use: HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.82–1.34). Associations of antidepressant use with dementia risk were broadly similar between participants with or without (a history of) depression (HR 1.15, 95% CI 075–1.76, with depression; and without depression: 1.15, 0.90–1.47).

### Olanzapine and fluoxetine [^11489hxm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AND BEHAVIORS and INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA-RELATED PSYCHOSIS

Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors — Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies. These studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior with antidepressant use in patients over age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressant use in patients aged 65 and older.

In patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy, monitor closely for worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Advise families and caregivers of the need for close observation and communication with the healthcare provider. Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules are not approved for use in children less than 10 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis — Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules are not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use, age-related neuropathology and cognition in late-life [^116pbThm]. Psychiatry Research (2023). Medium credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate an association of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use with late life cognitive decline and further investigate the association with brain pathology. Using the data are from two harmonized clinical-pathologic cohort studies with annual cognitive testing we found that SSRI use was associated with significantly faster global cognitive decline and this association was present in those with and without pre-existing cognitive impairment at the time of SSRI initiation. In separate analyses of persons who died during the study and underwent neuropathologic examination, SSRI use was related to higher level of paired helical filament tau tangles and faster rate of global cognitive decline. However, when SSRI use and tangles were included in the same model, the association of SSRI use with rate of global cognitive decline was reduced by more than 50% and no longer statistically significant. SSRI use was associated with higher postmortem level of tau tangles, possibly because SSRI are being used to treat neurobehavioral symptoms associated with dementia, and this relationship appears to partly account for the association of SSRI use with more rapid cognitive decline.

### Association between first-line antidepressant use and risk of dementia in older adults: a retrospective cohort study [^116Kyv7z]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Association between antidepressant use and the risk of dementia, main analysis

In Table 2, the crude incidence of dementia within two years was 16.4% in SSRI/SNRI users and 11.8% in the psychotherapy group. After adjusting for patients' baseline characteristics, the aOR was 1.36 (95% CI = 1.06–1.74), and the marginal effect suggested that receipt of SSRIs/SNRIs was associated with a 31.0% (95% CI = 6.6–55.3%) increased risk of dementia within two years compared to those receiving psychotherapy among older adults with depression after adjusting for the confounders (i.e. age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance type, marital status, region, poverty, education, PHQ-2 score, cognitive impairment, smoking, physical activity, access to healthcare information, comorbidities, and comedications).

Association between antidepressant use and the risk of dementia, subgroup and sensitivity analyses

Most subgroup analyses reported consistent results with the main analysis, except for patients who were aged < 65 years, male, Black, had a PHQ-2 score of 3–6, and had underlying cognitive impairment, for whom the adjusted ORs (95% CI) were 1.23 (0.93–1.62), 1.34 (0.95–1.90), 0.76 (0.48–1.19), 1.39 (0.90–2.15), and 1.06 (0.80–1.42), respectively. The sensitivity analyses yielded similar findings as the main analysis. The adjusted ORs (95% CI) were 1.27 (1.18–1.37) using the 1:1 PS matching and 1.12 (1.05–1.20) when removing comedications from the PS calculation.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data sources

We conducted a search for peer‐reviewed articles across databases such as Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of science, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane library. Gray literature search was carried out using google scholar. Searches were carried out with a combination of the following key words: Antidepressant, antidepressive agent, thymoleptic, depression medication, depression therapy, depression treatment, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressant, AD, dementia, demented, cognitive impairment, cognitive loss, cognitive deficit (see Fig. 1 for search strategy).

Figure 1
Flow diagram for included studies

The identification of eligible studies began with an examination of titles and abstracts to remove duplicates. Second, two of the authors (CN and JM) reviewed the full‐text articles for relevance and agreement guided by predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Third, methodologic quality was assessed by two reviewers (CN and JM) independently using the Quality of Prognosis Studies in Systematic Reviews (QUIPS) tool (Hayden, Cote, & Bombardier, 2006). There was full agreement between the two reviewers on which studies to include and the interrater variability was high (Cohen's kappa 0.88). If any disagreement was encountered, this was resolved by consensus‐seeking discussion.

2.2 Study selection

An article was included if it met the following inclusion criteria: (a) it was published in the English language, (b) full text was available, (c) it had a comparative design with two groups; one being exposed to antidepressant drug use and the other group being antidepressant naïve (as reported), (d) it was not older than 10 years, and (e) it had quantifiable odds ratios describing the effect size. Articles were excluded from analysis if: (a) it described a study with a single arm or without a comparison group, and/or (b) it did not describe a clear categorization of the outcome as dementia or cognitive impairment.

2.3 Data extraction

Odds ratios and their associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained (if given) or calculated (when not directly available) from the articles. Other relevant information extracted from each study included: the study design, presence of depression at baseline, specific type of outcome (dementia vs cognitive impairment), predominant sex of study participants, average age of study participants and the use of other psychotropic medications.

### The association of antidepressant drug usage with cognitive impairment or dementia, including Alzheimer disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115SvFbe]. Depression and Anxiety (2017). Low credibility.

2.4 Data analysis

The outcome of interest was the occurrence of dementia or any other cognitive disorder. Use of antidepressant drugs was the primary predictor of interest. The natural log of the odds ratios and the natural log of their associated 95% confidence intervals were computed for each study. The included studies were categorized for subgroup analysis based on the study duration into studies greater than or equal to 10 years and those less than 10 years. Categorizations were also made based on the average age of the included participants in the studies using a cut‐off point of 65 years of age.

Given the nature of the research question and the likelihood of clinical heterogeneity, a random effects model defined by the equation Yᵢ = μ + uᵢ + εᵢ, was used to obtain a pooled estimate of the effect (where μ = the average effect, uᵢ = variation from the average effect, and εᵢ = residual error). This allowed for an estimation of the amount of variation both within and between studies. We assumed a logit link function for binary outcome.

Statistical analysis for heterogeneity was carried out using Higgins I‐squared (Higgins & Thompson, 2002) and further explored with the use of subgroup analysis based on categorizations determined a priori. The robustness of the findings was assessed by determining the influence of each individual study on the overall pooled estimate using Tobias' method (1999). This involved a reestimation of the pooled estimate with each study omitted one after the other. Publication bias was graphically assessed with the use of a funnel plot and statistically by calculating Begg's test (Begg & Mazumdar, 1994). All analyses were performed with STATA version 13.1 using the "Metan" command with statistical significance determined by P values less than 5%.

### Antidepressant exposure and long-term dementia risk in a nationwide retrospective study on US veterans with midlife major depressive disorder [^116w4xVU]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Whether antidepressant exposure is associated with dementia risk has been explored, with conflicting results. Our study specifically looked at a cohort of midlife patients after their first‐ever diagnosis of MDD and implemented a time‐varying model design that accounted for many of the limitations of observational studies such as drug exposure and covariate changes during follow‐up. The large nationwide VA database allowed the evaluation of outcomes in a large population and over long follow‐up times. Our results do not identify an association between antidepressant exposure and subsequent AD/ADRD. A reduction in risk was suggested for women in a subgroup analysis; however, this observation should be interpreted with caution due to a small number of individuals. Considering the increased risk of AD/ADRD in women, this observation warrants further exploration and validation of our results in an external cohort with a larger representation of female patients.

### Antidepressant treatment and risk of dementia: a population-based, retrospective case-control study [^112FsDNg]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

We investigated the relationship between antidepressant use and the risk of subsequent dementia development.

Method

A population-based retrospective case-control analysis was conducted using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. From patients enrolled in the National Health Insurance program between 2005 and 2011, we identified 2 subsets: 5,394 cases, who had major depression in 1997–2004 and subsequently were diagnosed with dementia (ICD-9-CM code 290) in 2005–2011, and 5,232 controls, who had major depression in 2005–2011 but no dementia history. The proportional distributions of antidepressant use and comorbidities in the dementia case and nondementia control groups were compared. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs for the association between dementia and antidepressant use.

Results

The dementia patients were more likely to have diabetes, hypertension, stroke, and head injury. The adjusted OR for dementia was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.22–0.27) in patients using tricyclics. By contrast, the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (OR = 2.48; 95% CI, 2.27–2.71), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (OR = 1.86; 95% CI, 1.47–2.36), heterocyclic antidepressants (OR = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.32–1.57), and other antidepressants (OR = 2.05; 95% CI, 1.85–2.27) was associated with an increased risk of dementia. Furthermore, as the cumulative dose was increased, tricyclic antidepressants reduced the risk of dementia, whereas SSRIs, MAOIs, heterocyclic antidepressants, and other antidepressants increased the risk of dementia.

Conclusions

The incidence of dementia in patients is associated with antidepressant medication use. Treatment with tricyclic antidepressants was associated with a reduced risk of dementia, whereas treatment with SSRIs, MAOIs, heterocyclic antidepressants, and other antidepressants was associated with an increased risk of dementia.

### The association of antidepressant drug usage with cognitive impairment or dementia, including Alzheimer disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113K8QLi]. Depression and Anxiety (2017). Low credibility.

Significant efforts are being made to identify modifiable risk factors for AD, specifically any factor that influences the earliest stages of the disease process, when intervention would still provide therapeutic benefit. Although the causes of AD are not yet fully understood, it is believed that late‐onset AD results from an interaction of genetic (i.e. APOE ε4 status), lifestyle, and environmental risk factors (Glenner & Wong, 1984; Poirier et al. 1993; Tanzi, 2012).

Age and sex remain two of the primary risk factors for AD (Richard et al. 2012). Yet, neither a Canadian Study of Health and Aging report (Lindsay et al. 2002) nor the Framingham study (Bachman et al. 1993) found any sex‐dependent prevalence in AD. If one considers that there is a similar prevalence in males and females in the early stages of AD, but a strong female prevalence in severe cases, then this could be interpreted to suggest that males might die sooner after their AD becomes severe (Aguero‐Torres et al. 1998; Hy & Keller, 2000). In support of this, a previous study of ours based on provincial (Saskatchewan, Canada) health care utilization data found a higher risk of mortality in demented male patients with a comorbid psychiatric disorder when compared with demented patients (either male or female) with no psychiatric history (Meng et al. 2012).

Depression is now acknowledged as a risk factor for AD/dementia (Katon et al. 2012; World Health Organization, 2015 b). It has been proposed as one of the neuropsychiatric disorders that is a marker (Ismail et al. 2016), or potentially a prodrome (Schweitzer, Tuckwell, O'Brien, & Ames, 2002; World Alzheimer Report, 2014), for incident AD/dementia in certain cohorts, and can alter the risk for AD as much as twofold (Caraci, Copani, & icoletti, 2010; Geerlings et al. 2008; Masters, Morris, & Roe, 2015; Wuwongse, Chang, & Law, 2010), even if the diagnosis of depression is made 17 years (i.e. the Framingham study) (Saczynski et al. 2010) or 25 years (i.e. the MIRAGE study) (Green et al. 2003) prior to the onset of AD.

### Efficacy of antidepressants for depression in Alzheimer's disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1139qki5]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a primary neurodegenerative dementia and is one of the leading causes of disability in older people. While progressive cognitive impairment is the hallmark of the illness, neuropsychiatric symptoms affect almost all patients and are persistent. Depression is one of the most common neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD, associated with institutionalization and mortality. Up to 50% of AD patients experience depression or clinically significant depressive symptoms during the course of the disease. Major depressive disorder affects approximately 20% to 30% of people with AD, and personal or family history of depression, and younger age at onset of dementia are risk factors. Depressive symptoms are more common than clinical depression, and are highly persistent. Depression and depressive symptoms increase the risk of behavioral disturbance and accelerate functional decline.

Antidepressants remain the mainstay of treatment for AD patients with depression. This is driven by a lack of alternative treatment options and a perception that antidepressants are effective in this population. In line with a recent clinical review of the literature, there does not appear to be clear evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses to support this practice. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing antidepressants versus placebo have produced conflicting results. In an antidepressants withdrawal study, patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms showed a worsening of depressive symptoms compared to those who continued treatment.

There is conflicting evidence on the effects of antidepressants on cognition, with some studies reporting a beneficial effect and some harmful. Psychological therapies have also been studied for depression in AD, with a systematic review reporting that current evidence is limited due to the small number of trials and varying approaches used.

Use of antidepressants in AD is associated with significant side-effects including hyponatremia, cardiotoxicity and increased bleeding tendency. Effectiveness of antidepressants in AD has been evaluated by narrative reviews, whereas quantitative reviews and meta-analyses have examined effectiveness in all types of dementia but have not included latest studies conducted. In this review, we investigated efficacy and acceptability by conducting a comprehensive, recent, worldwide review of the literature of antidepressants for depression in AD.

### Association between first-line antidepressant use and risk of dementia in older adults: a retrospective cohort study [^116nwkGP]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Prior studies are limited by only comparing antidepressant exposure with no exposure, which may be subject to confounding by indication and severity. That is, patients taking antidepressants are likely to suffer from more severe depression than nonusers, while depression itself can be a risk factor for dementia, making separating the drug effect from depression severity challenging. In addition, TCAs are currently second-line pharmacotherapy for depression due to their higher anticholinergic burden that may increase multiple side effects (e.g. cognitive decline). It may not be appropriate to combine all the classes of antidepressants into one group when evaluating the risk of dementia. Therefore, we aimed to compare the risk of dementia among older adults using SSRIs/SNRIs (i.e. first-line pharmacological treatments) versus those on psychotherapy, adjusting for patients' demographics, socioeconomic status, comorbidities, comedications, and most importantly, the severity of depression to minimize confounding by indication.

### Antidepressant use in relation to dementia risk, cognitive decline, and brain atrophy [^116pq5oR]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Dementia is characterized by impairment in multiple cognitive domains, causing large burden on patients, caregivers, and society. Use of antidepressant medication has been suggested to contribute to dementia pathology through adverse anticholinergic and vascular effects, thereby accelerating cognitive decline and increasing incidence of dementia (dementia risk). Older adults may be more susceptible to these adverse effects due to age‐related alterations in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, including reduced acetylcholine‐mediated transmission in the brain and increased blood–brain barrier permeability. Approximately 10% of the population in high‐income countries use antidepressants, with more frequent use at older ages, and this percentage has more than doubled over past decades. Despite the frequent prescription of antidepressants, their long‐term effects remain uncertain, as short‐term follow‐up in clinical trials generally precludes the investigation of chronic use and long‐term adverse outcomes. Long‐term observational data are needed, but cohort studies to date have produced contrasting results. While various studies observed increased risk of dementia in antidepressant users, several others did not.,

These studies have been challenged methodologically by the close relation between depression and dementia. Depression is a well‐established risk factor of dementia, and the prescription of antidepressant medication in patients with depressive symptoms might link antidepressant use to dementia even in the absence of a true causal association (i.e. confounding‐by‐indication). In addition, depressive symptoms often occur in the prodromal phase of dementia, as a psychological reaction to cognitive impairment or due to shared neurobiological mechanisms between neurodegenerative diseases and depression. In this case, prodromal symptoms of neurodegeneration give rise to antidepressant use, which is commonly referred to as reversed causality. The concepts of confounding‐by‐indication and reversed causality make it difficult to distinguish between truly causal effects of antidepressants on neurodegeneration, and increased antidepressant prescription in response to a shared risk factor or prodromal neurodegenerative disease. This question of causality could be further investigated by determining drug effects on preclinical markers of neurodegeneration or by using an instrumental variable approach (e.g. markers of drug metabolism), but few published studies have examined the effect of antidepressant use on cognitive decline, and to our knowledge only one study examined the long‐term effects of antidepressant use on brain atrophy.

We, therefore, aimed to estimate the effect of antidepressant use on dementia risk, cognitive decline, and brain atrophy in a longstanding population‐based cohort study.

### Antidepressant exposure and long-term dementia risk in a nationwide retrospective study on US veterans with midlife major depressive disorder [^113cBmoK]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

Due to differences in study design, previous literature in this topic produced conflicting results. An early study using the large Danish registry identified a highest risk of dementia in patients who had previously purchased antidepressants. The same study, however, identified a lower risk associated with long‐term use. Similarly, another study looking at a prospective cohort from Israel determined that antidepressant exposure in late middle age was associated with increased risk after adjustment for potential confounders.

Several systematic reviews and meta‐analyses on the topic have also indicated that antidepressant use is associated with an increased risk of dementia. Contrarily, a study using large health insurance claims data in over 100 million records identified mirtazapine (a TCA antidepressant) as one of the medications associated with a reduction in the risk of dementia. Another retrospective study using data from a German registry, a 10‐year observation window, and a head‐to‐head comparison of antidepressants identified a risk reduction effect for antidepressants and suggested differences when comparing SSRI versus SNRI. A possibility for the conflicting results in retrospective studies is that the heightened risk identified in participants on antidepressants may be attributed to depression itself, rather than the result of a potential pharmacological action, so this and other clinical confounding factors need to be taken into account. In fact, this issue has been highlighted as a potential confounding when interpreting results of prior studies. An exception to this rule is a previous study that looked at this question in subgroups of patients diagnosed with depression specifically and identified an increased risk, although the sample size and levels of adjustment were smaller than our study. Our study addressed this issue by only looking at a cohort newly diagnosed with MDD and following them from MDD diagnosis forward in time for the incidence of AD/ADRD outcomes. In a clinical interventional study, improved mood and cognition were observed in relation to changes in brain areas associated with normalization of glucose metabolism after treatment with citalopram. A previous study combining antidepressant exposure and longitudinal biomarker measurements reported a protective effect of antidepressants mediated by a reduction in amyloid beta (Aβ) production in a dose‐dependent manner in both animal models and humans. Similarly, a study looking at this question using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) suggested that long‐term SSRI exposure may be associated with a delay in the progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD by 3 years; however, no changes in cerebrospinal fluid AD marker levels were apparent in response to treatment in this case.

### Update on SSRI treatment for neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia [^1122ytZp]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of dementia including agitation, depression, and psychosis are common and debilitating facets of the disease process. Despite the significant impact of these symptoms on both individuals with dementia and their caregivers, safe and effective treatment options are lacking. From a pharmacological approach, antipsychotics have historically been the treatment of choice, but these medications are only modestly effective with significant adverse effects. Behavioral and psychosocial interventions have been shown to be effective but are difficult to implement in routine clinical practice. SSRI medications have been investigated as an alternative psychopharmacological approach based on evidence that the serotoninergic system is involved in the etiology of NPS in dementia. The evidence base for using SSRI medications in the treatment of NPS is growing, but the applicability of research findings to the utility of SSRIs in general in routine clinical practice is not entirely clear at this point. Further studies of a variety of SSRI medications in targeting NPS are needed to make a more definitive assessment of the efficacy of these medications in the relief of NPS.

5 CONCLUSION

Our study, which was conducted in a large population with appropriate adjustment of confounders and used time‐varying covariates for drug exposure, did not find an association between antidepressant use and AD/ADRD risk. Our result suggesting a potential risk reduction in female patients should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size. Replication in an external population with a larger representation of female patients is needed.

### The association of antidepressant drug usage with cognitive impairment or dementia, including Alzheimer disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115HqDBo]. Depression and Anxiety (2017). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Our increasing lifespan has led to an increased prevalence of diseases of the brain, including Alzheimer disease (AD), a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder with significant cognitive and behavioral deficits, which accounts for almost 80% of cases of dementia (World Alzheimer Report, 2014; World Health Organization, 2015 a). In rare cases, AD is associated with autosomal dominant mutations in specific genes that enhance amyloid burden in the brain; however, the majority of cases are of unknown origin and are termed late‐onset given that symptomatology manifests in older individuals (Tanzi, 1999). The prevalence of AD at 65 years of age is 13% and doubles every 5 years thereafter (World Alzheimer Report, 2014). The World Health Organization estimates that globally there are 47.5 million cases of AD/dementia (Aguero‐Torres et al. 1998) that annually incur costs surpassing $604 billion USD (World Alzheimer Report, 2014). The economic and social burden of AD/dementia is expected to triple by 2050 (World Health Organization, 2015 a).

### Antidepressant medications in dementia: evidence and potential mechanisms of treatment-resistance [^114M8pJV]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Depression in dementia is common, disabling and causes significant distress to patients and carers. Despite widespread use of antidepressants for depression in dementia, there is no evidence of therapeutic efficacy, and their use is potentially harmful in this patient group. Depression in dementia has poor outcomes and effective treatments are urgently needed. Understanding why antidepressants are ineffective in depression in dementia could provide insight into their mechanism of action and aid identification of new therapeutic targets. In this review we discuss why depression in dementia may be a distinct entity, current theories of how antidepressants work and how these mechanisms of action may be affected by disease processes in dementia. We also consider why clinicians continue to prescribe antidepressants in dementia, and novel approaches to understand and identify effective treatments for patients living with depression and dementia.

### Antidepressant use and cognitive decline in patients with dementia: a national cohort study [^1142VV35]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Antidepressants are widely used in patients with dementia to improve neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, aggression, and sleep disorders. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are considered first-line pharmacotherapy for depression due to fewer side effects compared to other classes of antidepressants. However, older adults with depression receiving SSRIs/SNRIs were associated with an increased risk of dementia compared to psychotherapy.

The clinical efficacy of antidepressants on dementia progression is uncertain. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are anticholinergics and negatively impact cognition. In contrast, a beneficial impact of SSRIs on neurogenesis and pathologic biomarkers, including amyloid burden and tau deposits, has been reported, along with evidence suggesting they may delay the progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's dementia (AD) among persons with depression. The different cognitive effects of antidepressant classes may be due to the different mechanisms of action, driven by how these drugs proximally act on various neurotransmitters in the brain. Based on the national guidelines for care of depression and anxiety syndrome in Sweden, sertraline and escitalopram form the first-line of therapy for older patients. However, antidepressants do not seem to work as well in people with dementia, and dysfunctions of cognitive control in dementia appears to decrease the effectiveness of some SSRIs.

Findings from observational studies investigating the impact of antidepressant use on cognitive outcomes are inconclusive. Some longitudinal data observed slower declines in cognition with antidepressant use in patients with AD, while most of the cohort studies found no evidence for an association between antidepressant use and post-treatment cognitive decline, and negative associations of antidepressant use with subsequent cognitive impairment has been reported. Previous analyses were limited to the period before dementia diagnosis, a single population, such as patients with depression but not in patients with dementia, a short-term follow-up 11, and reporting the effect of antidepressants on cognition as a secondary outcome. There is a gap in understanding how different antidepressant classes, specific drugs, and doses affect the progression of cognitive decline in patients with dementia. Moreover, existing studies have not thoroughly explored how individual factors, such as age, sex, and dementia severity, may modify the association between antidepressant use and cognitive outcomes.

### Sertraline or mirtazapine for depression in dementia (HTA-SADD): a randomised, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114YdPmC]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

Depression is common in dementia but the evidence base for appropriate drug treatment is sparse and equivocal. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of two of the most commonly prescribed drugs, sertraline and mirtazapine, compared with placebo.

Methods

We undertook the parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Health Technology Assessment Study of the Use of Antidepressants for Depression in Dementia (HTA-SADD) trial in participants from old-age psychiatry services in nine centres in England. Participants were eligible if they had probable or possible Alzheimer's disease, depression (lasting ≥ 4 weeks), and a Cornell scale for depression in dementia (CSDD) score of 8 or more. Participants were ineligible if they were clinically critical (eg, suicide risk), contraindicated to study drugs, on antidepressants, in another trial, or had no carer. The clinical trials unit at King's College London (UK) randomly allocated participants with a computer-generated block randomisation sequence, stratified by centre, with varying block sizes, in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive sertraline (target dose 150 mg per day), mirtazapine (45 mg), or placebo (control group), all with standard care. The primary outcome was reduction in depression (CSDD score) at 13 weeks (outcomes to 39 weeks were also assessed), assessed with a mixed linear-regression model adjusted for baseline CSDD, time, and treatment centre. This study is registered, number ISRCTN88882979 and EudraCT 2006–000105–38.

Findings

Decreases in depression scores at 13 weeks did not differ between 111 controls and 107 participants allocated to receive sertraline (mean difference 1.17, 95% CI -0.23 to 2.58; p = 0.10) or mirtazapine (0.01, -1.37 to 1.38; p = 0.99), or between participants in the mirtazapine and sertraline groups (1.16, -0.25 to 2.57; p = 0.11); these findings persisted to 39 weeks. Fewer controls had adverse reactions (29 of 111 [26%]) than did participants in the sertraline group (46 of 107, 43%; p = 0.010) or mirtazapine group (44 of 108, 41%; p = 0.031), and fewer serious adverse events rated as severe (p = 0.003). Five patients in every group died by week 39.

Interpretation

Because of the absence of benefit compared with placebo and increased risk of adverse events, the present practice of use of these antidepressants, with usual care, for first-line treatment of depression in Alzheimer's disease should be reconsidered.

### To Be continued? Long-term treatment effects of antidepressant drug classes and individual antidepressants on the risk of developing dementia: a German case-control study [^112HZ5aL]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Given the need for disease-modifying therapies for dementia, drug repurposing appears to be a promising approach, at least as a risk reduction treatment. Preclinical studies suggest that antidepressants-in particular selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors-have beneficial effects on dementia-related biomarkers and functional outcomes, although clinical data are inconclusive. The present case-control study aimed to evaluate the effects of antidepressant drug classes and individual compounds with different treatment durations on the risk of developing dementia.

Methods

Analyses are based on data from the German Disease Analyzer database (owned and maintained by IQVIA) and included 62,317 subjects with an incident dementia diagnosis (ICD-10: F01, F03, G30, F06.7) and controls matched by age, sex, and physician between January 2013 and December 2017. Logistic regression analyses adjusting for health insurance status and comorbid diseases associated with dementia or antidepressant use were performed to investigate the association between dementia incidence and treatment with 4 major antidepressant drug classes and 14 of the most frequently prescribed individual substances.

Results

In 17 of 18 comparisons, long-term treatment (≥ 2 years) with any antidepressant was associated with a lower incidence of dementia than short-term treatment. Tricyclic and herbal antidepressants were associated with a decrease in dementia incidence, especially with long-term treatment. The lowest risks for dementia on an individual substance basis were identified for long-term treatment with escitalopram (odds ratio [OR] = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50–0.89) and Hypericum perforatum (OR = 0.6; 95% CI, 0.51–0.70).

Conclusions

Long-term treatment with tricyclic antidepressants, Hypericum perforatum, or escitalopram may be associated with reduced incidence of dementia. If antidepressant therapy is well tolerated, continuation-even if depressive symptoms have resolved-may be considered even beyond the purpose of relapse prevention. Future combined analyses of multinational registries and long-term clinical trials are needed to substantiate these findings.

### Systemic medications and dementia risk: a systematic umbrella review [^112UWRMQ]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Psychotropic medications

Three meta-analyses investigated the association between benzodiazepine use and dementia risk. Meta-analyses included between eight and 20 studies with participant numbers ranging from 66,177–2,342,896. Pooled ORs ranged from 1.33 (95% CI 1.19–1.49) to 1.78 (95% CI 1.33–2.38) (Table 2). I² was high (98–99%). Number of critical quality components met ranged from four to seven. There was 30% of overlap of studies between meta-analyses (Supplement 4).

Two meta-analyses, by AlDawsari and Wang, investigated the association between antidepressant use and dementia risk. AlDawsari et al. included 11 studies (n = 1,851,295) and Wang et al. six studies (n = 302,506). Pooled effect estimates were OR of 1.14 (95% CI 0.88–1.46) and RR of 1.21 (1.12–1.29), respectively (Table 2). I² was high (97%) and moderate (71%), respectively. Number of critical quality components met were six and four, respectively. There was no overlap of studies between meta-analyses (Supplement 4).

AlDawsari et al. also found no association between dementia risk and anticonvulsant use (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.85–1.13) in two studies (n = 46,787), and antipsychotic use (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.68–1.39) in five studies (n = 1,177,342) (Table 2). The same authors found a possible increased risk of dementia associated with Z-hypnotic drugs (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.17–1.74) in a meta-analysis of eight studies (n = 954,852).

Velosa et al. carried out a meta-analysis of five studies (n = 49,979), finding evidence of a possible reduced risk of dementia with lithium use (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.36–0.72) (Table 2). This review met five critical quality components.

Our GRADE assessment found very low certainty of an increased risk of dementia with benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and Z-drugs, and low certainty of a reduced risk of dementia with lithium (Table 3).

### Cumulative antidepressant use and risk of dementia in a prospective cohort study [^115TwwwW]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether antidepressant use is associated with dementia risk.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA), an integrated healthcare delivery system.

Participants

Community-dwelling individuals aged 65 and older without dementia and with 10 years or more of KPWA enrollment at baseline (N = 3,059).

Measurements

Primary exposures were selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (paroxetine vs other), tricyclic antidepressants, and serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors. Using health plan pharmacy data, we calculated cumulative medication exposure, defined as total standardized daily doses (TSDDs), over rolling 10-year windows. Exposure in the most recent year was excluded to avoid use related to prodromal symptoms. The Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument was administered every 2 years; low scores triggered clinical evaluation and consensus diagnosis procedures. Dementia risk was estimated according to medication use using Cox proportional hazards models.

Results

During a mean follow-up of 7.7 years, 775 participants (25%) developed dementia; 659 (22%) developed possible or probable Alzheimer's disease. Individual antidepressant classes were not associated with differences in dementia risk, although paroxetine use was associated with higher risk of dementia for all TSDD categories than no use (0–90 TSDDs: hazard ratio (HR) = 1.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.18–2.42; 91–365 TSDDs: HR = 1.40, 95% CI = 0.88–2.23; 366–1095 TSDDs: HR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.32–3.43; ≥ 1095 TSDDs: HR = 1.42, 95% CI = 0.82–2.46).

Conclusion

Most commonly prescribed nonanticholinergic depression medications used in late life do not appear to be associated with dementia risk. Paroxetine and other anticholinergic antidepressants may be exceptions in older individuals. Future studies are warranted to improve scientific understanding of potential associations in other settings and populations.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^112hzVdL]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease and other dementias — psychosis and agitation management emphasizes nonpharmacological interventions first with careful risk–benefit assessment. Clinicians must weigh the risk of not treating against the risks of active treatment and the consideration and use of behavioral, psychosocial, and psychotherapeutic treatments is particularly critical. If symptoms cause significant distress or are associated with behavior that may place the patient or others at risk, treatment with low doses of antipsychotic medication is indicated in addition to nonpharmacological interventions, and treatment with an antipsychotic is also indicated if a patient is agitated or combative in the absence of psychosis, with the use of these agents reevaluated and their benefit documented on an ongoing basis. When antipsychotics are ineffective, carbamazepine, valproate, or an SSRI may be used in a careful therapeutic trial, and a low-dose benzodiazepine may prove useful for symptoms limited to specific times or settings, noting problematic side effects in elderly patients. Although mood stabilizers and SSRIs are commonly used for agitation, delusions, and aggression, they have not been consistently shown to be effective or safe and should not be seen as having improved safety or comparable efficacy compared to antipsychotics. As illness evolves, the continued use of any intervention must be evaluated and justified on an ongoing basis, and periodic reevaluation and revision of the treatment plan, including a change in dose, a change in medication, or medication discontinuation, may be indicated, with patients whose initial symptom severity was relatively low potentially more easily withdrawn from psychotropics.

### The association of antidepressant drug usage with cognitive impairment or dementia, including Alzheimer disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111yz5is]. Depression and Anxiety (2017). Low credibility.

A decrease in serotonin availability within the synapse — a core feature of the monoamine theory of depression — can be reestablished by inhibiting monoamine oxidase (MAO, degrades serotonin and other monoamines) or by inhibiting serotonin reuptake/removal from the synapse. Depressed women tend to respond better to MAO inhibitors, while men tend to respond better to reuptake inhibitors (Davidson & Pelton, 1986). Interestingly, doses of SSRIs lower than the smallest available doses might still provide benefit, while reducing side effects and risk (Kauffman, 2009). In contrast, patient noncompliance and an effective "less than daily" dose could actually precipitate dementia and dementia‐related mortality (Rosness et al. 2016). It should be noted that AD/dementia is not associated with all classes of reuptake inhibitors. For instance, the older, tricyclic antidepressants, some of which function as serotonin uptake inhibitors, may be associated with a reduced risk (Lee et al. 2016) or no risk (Kessing et al. 2009) of dementia, whereas non‐SSRI antidepressant drugs, i.e. including MAO inhibitors and serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), have been reported to show an intermediate risk (Kessing et al. 2009; Lee et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2015). These tentative findings suggest that the treatment of the depression rather than depression itself may have a powerful impact on cognitive phenotypes.

### Antipsychotics, other psychotropics, and the risk of death in patients with dementia: number needed to harm [^117NhqsW]. JAMA Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Antipsychotic medications are associated with increased mortality in older adults with dementia, yet their absolute effect on risk relative to no treatment or an alternative psychotropic is unclear.

Objective

To determine the absolute mortality risk increase and number needed to harm (NNH) (ie, number of patients who receive treatment that would be associated with 1 death) of antipsychotic, valproic acid and its derivatives, and antidepressant use in patients with dementia relative to either no treatment or antidepressant treatment.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective case-control study was conducted in the Veterans Health Administration from October 1, 1998, through September 30, 2009. Participants included 90,786 patients 65 years or older with a diagnosis of dementia. Final analyses were conducted in August 2014.

Exposures

A new prescription for an antipsychotic (haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone), valproic acid and its derivatives, or an antidepressant (46,008 medication users).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Absolute change in mortality risk and NNH over 180 days of follow-up in medication users compared with nonmedication users matched on several risk factors. Among patients in whom a treatment with medication was initiated, mortality risk associated with each agent was also compared using the antidepressant group as the reference, adjusting for age, sex, years with dementia, presence of delirium, and other clinical and demographic characteristics. Secondary analyses compared dose-adjusted absolute change in mortality risk for olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone.

Results

Compared with respective matched nonusers, individuals receiving haloperidol had an increased mortality risk of 3.8% (95% CI, 1.0%-6.6%; P < .01) with an NNH of 26 (95% CI, 15–99); followed by risperidone, 3.7% (95% CI, 2.2%-5.3%; P < .01) with an NNH of 27 (95% CI, 19–46); olanzapine, 2.5% (95% CI, 0.3%-4.7%; p = 0.02) with an NNH of 40 (95% CI, 21–312); and quetiapine, 2.0% (95% CI, 0.7%-3.3%; P < .01) with an NNH of 50 (95% CI, 30–150). Compared with antidepressant users, mortality risk ranged from 12.3% (95% CI, 8.6%-16.0%; P < .01) with an NNH of 8 (95% CI, 6–12) for haloperidol users to 3.2% (95% CI, 1.6%-4.9%; P < .01) with an NNH of 31 (95% CI, 21–62) for quetiapine users. As a group, the atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone) showed a dose-response increase in mortality risk, with 3.5% greater mortality (95% CI, 0.5%-6.5%; p = 0.02) in the high-dose subgroup relative to the low-dose group. When compared directly with quetiapine, dose-adjusted mortality risk was increased with both risperidone (1.7%; 95% CI, 0.6%-2.8%; p = 0.003) and olanzapine (1.5%; 95% CI, 0.02%-3.0%; p = 0.047).

Conclusions and Relevance

The absolute effect of antipsychotics on mortality in elderly patients with dementia may be higher than previously reported and increases with dose.

### The association of antidepressant drug usage with cognitive impairment or dementia, including Alzheimer disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116DoEaC]. Depression and Anxiety (2017). Low credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

In conclusion, our meta‐analysis suggests that individuals with cognitive impairment or AD/dementia are more likely to have been prescribed an antidepressant drug and that this is more evident if antidepressant drug treatment began before the age of 65. This increased association is strong, is biologically plausible, and is consistent across the various studies examined. The risk‐benefit trade‐offs of antidepressant treatment cannot be fully understood until the etiological basis of this association is more fully elucidated.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^116xAqPi]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Antidepressants for depression in dementia — because as many as one-half of such persons do develop dementia within 5 years, caution is urged in ruling out an underlying early dementia in patients with both affective and cognitive symptoms, particularly when the first episode of depression is in old age. When treatment for depression is being considered, patients should be evaluated for conditions that may be causing or contributing to the depression, and clinical consensus supports a trial of an antidepressant in acutely clinically significant, persistent depressed mood in patients with dementia. SSRIs may be preferred because they appear to be better tolerated than other antidepressants, and when a rapid response is not critical a very gradual dosage increase may increase the likelihood that a therapeutic dosage will be reached and tolerated; after prolonged use, medications should be withdrawn gradually whenever possible, in order to avoid withdrawal symptoms. Treatment of depression may also reduce other neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with depression such as aggression, anxiety, apathy, and psychosis.

### The effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on memory functioning in older adults: a systematic literature review [^112DvUEf]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Dementia and other brain diseases

Results in patients with dementia were mostly pointing toward no effect of SSRI use on memory performance, but three studies indicated possible improvement of memory functioning (see). Interestingly, two studies reported impairment of memory functioning associated with SSRI use. Both studies were performed in dementia with frontal dysfunction. This underlying subtype could potentially be more prone to SSRI-associated memory impairment.

In post-stroke patients, reported improvement of global memory, episodic memory, and short-term memory. Two other studies failed to replicate this finding in global memory functioning.

Healthy controls

Five studies assessed the association between SSRI use and memory functioning in healthy older adults (see). The majority reported no association. however, reported an improvement in global memory functioning in older adults who did not have objective cognitive deficits, but did experience subjective cognitive decline. This could represent an early cognitive vulnerability. One study did report an impairment in global memory functioning. Interestingly, this study did only include women which could indicate a gender effect.

### Association between first-line antidepressant use and risk of dementia in older adults: a retrospective cohort study [^115Gva5f]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Study design

We conducted a retrospective cohort study restricted to adults aged ≥ 50 years with a depression diagnosis in round 1 or 2 of a two-year panel period to allow at least a 1-year follow-up time. Depression was identified using International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes (ICD-9: 296.20–296.25, 296.30–296.35, 300.4, 311; positive predictive value [PPV] = 92.0%; ICD-10: F32.0–32.9, F33.0–33.3, F33.8, F33.9, F34.1 & F41.2; PPV = 91.1%). We further included those receiving SSRIs/SNRIs or psychotherapy at rounds 1 or 2, with an index round defined as the round when the first SSRI/SNRI or psychotherapy was prescribed. We excluded patients who (1) concomitantly used SSRIs/SNRIs and psychotherapy at any round, (2) had missing cognitive impairment data at all rounds during 2010–2019, and (3) had a dementia diagnosis before the index round. We followed up patients until the dementia outcome occurred or the end of each survey panel period (i.e. two years). Figure 1 depicts the details of the study cohort selection.

Fig. 1
Study population selection. From the 2010–2019 MEPS data, we identified 17,040 patients diagnosed with depression at round 1 or 2, of which 10,215 patients used SSRI/SNRI at round 1 or 2. Each panel in MEPS data includes 5 rounds within 2 years. The reason for limiting to the first two rounds was to allow at least one year follow-up time for each patient. We excluded patients combining SSRI/SNRI with psychotherapy at any round (n = 2.842), aged < 50 years at round 1 (n = 4106), missed cognitive impairment data at any round (n = 29), and diagnosed with dementia before the index round (n = 528). There were 2,710 patients included in out analytical cohort, with 2,402 (89%) using SSRIs/SNRIs and 308 (11%) receiving psychotherapy.

### Analysis of the effects of selective serotonin (and noradrenaline) reuptake inhibitors on the risk of dementia in patients with depression [^116bG7n7]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous studies focusing on the association between antidepressant use and dementia have reported controversial findings.

Objective

This study aimed to compare the associations between the prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and the occurrence of dementia in patients with depression followed in Germany.

Methods

This study included 20,215 patients aged 70–90 diagnosed with depression and treated in general or neuropsychiatric practices in Germany between 2010 and 2015 (index date). The main outcome of the study was the rate of dementia within 10 years after the first prescription of SSRIs or SNRIs. For the first set of survival analyses, patients were followed until they received a dementia diagnosis or until the end of their antidepressant therapy, whereas for the second set of survival analyses, patients were followed until they received a dementia diagnosis or had their last documented visit to the practice.

Results

Ten years after the index date, the rate of dementia ranged from 17.3% in escitalopram users to 36.0% in citalopram users in the first analysis, and from 30.8% in fluoxetine users to 40.4% in citalopram users in the second analysis. In the first regression model, fluoxetine (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.58), venlafaxine (HR = 0.74), and duloxetine (HR = 0.74) were associated with a decreased dementia risk compared with citalopram. In the second model, only venlafaxine significantly decreased the odds of developing dementia (HR = 0.81).

Conclusion

SSRIs and SNRIs were differentially associated with the risk of dementia in patients with depression in Germany.

### Olanzapine and fluoxetine hydrochloride (Symbyax) [^111yJrgw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. SYMBYAX is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

In olanzapine placebo-controlled clinical trials of elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, the incidence of death in olanzapine-treated patients was significantly greater than placebo-treated patients (3.5% vs 1.5%, respectively).

Meta-Analysis of Antipsychotic Use in Dementia-Related Psychosis — Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of seventeen placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. SYMBYAX (olanzapine and fluoxetine) is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Cerebrovascular Adverse Events (CVAE), Including Stroke — Cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patients in trials of olanzapine in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. In placebo-controlled trials, there was a significantly higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo. Olanzapine and SYMBYAX are not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning].

### The association of antidepressant drug usage with cognitive impairment or dementia, including Alzheimer disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1134xCKM]. Depression and Anxiety (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine if antidepressant drug usage is associated with cognitive impairment or dementia, including Alzheimer disease (AD).

Method

We conducted a systematic search of Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library. An initial screen by abstracts and titles was performed, and relevant full articles were then reviewed and assessed for their methodologic quality. Crude effect estimates were extracted from the included articles and a pooled estimate was obtained using a random effects model.

Results

Five articles were selected from an initial pool of 4,123 articles. Use of antidepressant drugs was associated with a significant twofold increase in the odds of some form of cognitive impairment or dementia (OR = 2.17). Age was identified as a likely modifier of the association between antidepressant use and some form of cognitive impairment or AD/dementia. Studies that included participants with an average age equal to or greater than 65 years showed an increased odds of some form of cognitive impairment with antidepressant drug usage (OR = 1.65), whereas those with participants less than age 65 revealed an even stronger association (OR = 3.25).

Conclusions

Antidepressant drug usage is associated with AD/dementia and this is particularly evident if usage begins before age 65. This association may arise due to confounding by depression or depression severity. However, biological mechanisms potentially linking antidepressant exposure to dementia have been described, so an etiological effect of antidepressants is possible. With this confirmation that an association exists, clarification of underlying etiologic pathways requires urgent attention.

### Antidepressant use in relation to dementia risk, cognitive decline, and brain atrophy [^112VgGzZ]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

INTRODUCTION

We aimed to assess the effect of antidepressant use on dementia risk, cognitive decline, and brain atrophy.

METHODS

In this prospective cohort study, we included 5511 dementia‐free participants (Mini‐Mental State Examination [MMSE] > 25) of the Rotterdam study (57.5% women, mean age 70.6 years). Antidepressant use was extracted from pharmacy records from 1991 until baseline (2002–2008). Incident dementia was monitored from baseline until 2018, with repeated cognitive assessment and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) every 4 years.

RESULTS

Compared to never use, any antidepressant use was not associated with dementia risk (hazard ratio [HR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92–1.41), or with accelerated cognitive decline or atrophy of white and gray matter. Compared to never use, dementia risk was somewhat higher with tricyclic antidepressants (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.01–1.83) than with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.81–1.54), but without dose–response relationships, accelerated cognitive decline, or atrophy in either group.

DISCUSSION

Antidepressant medication in adults without indication of cognitive impairment was not consistently associated with long‐term adverse cognitive effects.

Highlights

Antidepressant medications are frequently prescribed, especially among older adults.
In this study, antidepressant use was not associated with long‐term dementia risk.
Antidepressant use was not associated with cognitive decline or brain atrophy.
Our results support safe prescription in an older, cognitively healthy population.

Depression in dementia — antidepressant trial evidence shows that over the last 15 years, eight placebo-controlled studies have been conducted, including four SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) trials (one citalopram, one fluoxetine, two sertraline), three trials of cyclic antidepressants (imipramine, maprotiline, clomipramine), and one monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI; moclobemide) trial; evidence is mixed overall, but SSRIs appear most promising with sertraline superior to placebo and citalopram improving affective symptoms, whereas cyclic antidepressants were either no more effective than placebo or caused significant side effects; head-to-head comparisons showed equal efficacy but better tolerability of SSRIs than cyclic antidepressants, and extrapolating efficacy from depressed elderly without dementia should be done cautiously.

### Association between first-line antidepressant use and risk of dementia in older adults: a retrospective cohort study [^112hKSQc]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this retrospective cohort study using nationally representative survey data in the US, we found that older adults with depression receiving SSRIs/SNRIs were associated with a 31% increased risk of dementia within two years compared to those receiving psychotherapy after adjusting for patient characteristics such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, depression severity, underlying cognitive impairment, comorbidities, and concomitant drugs. Most subgroup analyses yielded similar results, except for patients who were aged < 65 years, male, Black, had a PHQ-2 score of 3–6, and had underlying cognitive impairment, which did not show significant differences in the risk of dementia between SSRI/SNRI use and psychotherapy.

Unlike previous studies largely comparing antidepressant users with nonusers, our study adopted the active comparison group approach to reduce confounding by indication and severity in older adults with depression. Our findings were consistent with some of the prior studies. For example, a meta-analysis including observational studies with at least a 1-year follow-up period showed that SSRI use was associated with an increased risk of dementia compared to no SSRI use, with a pooled risk ratio (RR) of 1.75 (95% CI: 1.03–2.96). However, the heterogeneity in the meta-analysis was extremely high, and one out of five included studies suggested that SSRI use was associated with a lower risk of dementia (RR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.50–0.68). Another study by Lee et al. restricted to older adults with depression, found that SSRI use was associated with an increased risk of incident dementia, with an adjusted OR of 2.48 (95% CI: 2.27–2.71). Nonetheless, Peakman et al. 2020 and Goveas et al. 2012 pointed out that even though antidepressant use was found to be associated with the risk of dementia (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.32 [95% CI: 1.01–1.74] and 1.69 [95% CI: 1.21–2.35], respectively), an association was not found for SSRIs (adjusted HR: 1.07 [95% CI: 0.91–1.25] and 1.50 [95% CI: 0.89–2.53], respectively). Instead, this association may be attributed to TCAs, which were found to be associated with incident dementia (adjusted HR: 1.75 [95% CI: 1.05–2.91] reported by Goveas et al. 2012). Other reasons contributing to the conflicting findings from the existing studies include prior claim-based studies unable to include the severity of depression and cognitive impairment status in the analysis. Our survey data analysis addressed these issues by including patients' PHQ-2 score, co-use of other antidepressants, and underlying cognitive impairment.

### Antidepressants for treating depression in dementia [^1124jbSm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The use of antidepressants in dementia accompanied by depressive symptoms is widespread, but their clinical efficacy is uncertain. This review updates an earlier version, first published in 2002.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of any type of antidepressant for patients who have been diagnosed as having dementia of any type and depression as defined by recognised criteria.

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register, on 16 August 2017. ALOIS contains information on trials retrieved from databases and from a number of trial registers and grey literature sources.

Selection Criteria

We included all relevant double-blind, randomised trials comparing any antidepressant drug with placebo, for patients diagnosed as having dementia and depression.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors selected studies for inclusion and extracted data independently. We assessed risk of bias in the included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. Where clinically appropriate, we pooled data for treatment periods up to three months and from three to nine months. We used GRADE methods to assess the overall quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We included ten studies with a total of 1592 patients. Eight included studies reported sufficiently detailed results to enter into analyses related to antidepressant efficacy. We split one study which included two different antidepressants and therefore had nine groups of patients treated with antidepressants compared with nine groups receiving placebo treatment. Information needed to make 'Risk of bias' judgements was often missing. We found high-quality evidence of little or no difference in scores on depression symptom rating scales between the antidepressant and placebo treated groups after 6 to 13 weeks (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.26 to 0.06; 614 participants; 8 studies). There was probably also little or no difference between groups after six to nine months (mean difference (MD) 0.59 point, 95% CI -1.12 to 2.3, 357 participants; 2 studies; moderate-quality evidence). The evidence on response rates at 12 weeks was of low quality, and imprecision in the result meant we were uncertain of any effect of antidepressants (antidepressant: 49.1%, placebo: 37.7%; odds ratio (OR) 1.71, 95% CI 0.80 to 3.67; 116 participants; 3 studies). However, the remission rate was probably higher in the antidepressant group than the placebo group (antidepressant: 40%, placebo: 21.7%; OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.44 to 4.59; 240 participants; 4 studies; moderate-quality evidence). The largest of these studies continued for another 12 weeks, but because of imprecision of the result we could not be sure of any effect of antidepressants on remission rates after 24 weeks. There was evidence of no effect of antidepressants on performance of activities of daily living at weeks 6 to 13 (SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.25; 173 participants; 4 studies; high-quality evidence) and probably also little or no effect on cognition (MD 0.33 point on the Mini-Mental State Examination, 95% CI -1.31 to 1.96; 194 participants; 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence). Participants on antidepressants were probably more likely to drop out of treatment than those on placebo over 6 to 13 weeks (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.14; 836 participants; 9 studies). The meta-analysis of the number of participants suffering at least one adverse event showed a significant difference in favour of placebo (antidepressant: 49.2%, placebo: 38.4%; OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.98, 1073 participants; 3 studies), as did the analyses for participants suffering one event of dry mouth (antidepressant: 19.6%, placebo: 13.3%; OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.63, 1044 participants; 5 studies), and one event of dizziness (antidepressant: 19.2%, placebo: 12.5%; OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.98, 1044 participants; 5 studies). Heterogeneity in the way adverse events were reported in studies presented a major difficulty for meta-analysis, but there was some evidence that antidepressant treatment causes more adverse effects than placebo treatment does.

Authors' Conclusions

The available evidence is of variable quality and does not provide strong support for the efficacy of antidepressants for treating depression in dementia, especially beyond 12 weeks. On the only measure of efficacy for which we had high-quality evidence (depression rating scale scores), antidepressants showed little or no effect. The evidence on remission rates favoured antidepressants but was of moderate quality, so future research may find a different result. There was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about individual antidepressant drugs or about subtypes of dementia or depression. There is some evidence that antidepressant treatment may cause adverse events.

### Depression as a modifiable factor to decrease the risk of dementia [^112yfkRC]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

The number of men who developed dementia during the initial 5 years of follow-up was 234, from 5 to 10 years 516 and after 10 years 153. We stratified the data according to time of follow-up to investigate whether the risk of dementia associated with depression varied according to the duration of the follow-up period (Figure 3). All analyses were adjusted for age, and history of diabetes and stroke.

We then completed a series of post hoc analyses to investigate the contribution of individual antidepressant classes to dementia risk. The independent SHR of dementia associated with antidepressant use was 1.3 (95% CI = 1.0, 1.7). The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (non-selective) and other antidepressants was reported by 127 (2.6%), 132 (2.7%), 8 (0.2%) and 50 (1.0%) men. The SHRs of dementia associated with the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (non-selective) and other antidepressants were 1.4 (95% CI = 0.8, 2.1), 1.0 (95% CI = 0.7, 1.5), 1.2 (95% CI = 0.3, 5.0) and 2.2 (95% CI = 1.3, 3.8). These analyses were adjusted for age, history of diabetes and stroke, and history of depression (past or current).

### Antidepressant use and cognitive decline in patients with dementia: a national cohort study [^115nWY2g]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Dementia is associated with psychiatric symptoms but the effects of antidepressants on cognitive function in dementia are understudied. We aimed to investigate the association between antidepressants and cognitive decline in patients with dementia, and the risk of severe dementia, fractures and death, depending on antidepressant class, drug, and dose.

Methods

This is a national cohort study. Patients with dementia registered in the Swedish Registry for Cognitive/Dementia Disorders-SveDem from May 1, 2007, until October 16, 2018, with at least one follow-up after dementia diagnosis, and who were new users of antidepressants, were included. Antidepressant use as a time varying exposure defined during the 6 months leading up to dementia diagnosis or each subsequent follow-up. We used linear mixed models to examine the association between antidepressant use and cognitive trajectories assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. We used Cox proportional hazards models to calculate the hazard ratios for severe dementia (MMSE score < 10), fracture, and death. We compared antidepressant classes and drugs, and analyzed dose-response.

Results

We included 18740 patients (10 205 women [54.5%]; mean [SD] age, 78.2[7.4] years), of which 4271 (22.8%) received at least one prescription for an antidepressant. During follow-up, a total of 11912 prescriptions for antidepressants were issued, with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) being the most common (64.8%). Antidepressant use was associated with faster cognitive decline (β (95% CI) = -0.30(-0.39,-0.21) points/year), in particular sertraline (-0.25(-0.43,-0.06) points/year), citalopram (-0.41(-0.55,-0.27) points/year), escitalopram (-0.76(-1.09,-0.44) points/year), and mirtazapine (-0.19(-0.34,-0.04) points/year) compared with non-use. The association was stronger in patients with severe dementia (initial MMSE scores 0–9). Escitalopram showed a greater decline rate than sertraline. Compared with non-use, dose response of SSRIs on greater cognitive decline and higher risks of severe dementia, all-cause mortality, and fracture were observed.

Conclusions

In this cohort study, current antidepressant use was associated with faster cognitive decline; furthermore, higher dispensed doses of SSRIs were associated with higher risk for severe dementia, fractures, and all-cause mortality. These findings highlight the significance of careful and regular monitoring to assess the risks and benefits of different antidepressants use in patients with dementia.

### Comparative efficacy of interventions for reducing symptoms of depression in people with dementia: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112Ld8JV]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Fifty million people worldwide have a diagnosis of dementia. About 16% of people with dementia also have a diagnosis of a major depressive disorder, but 32% of those with dementia will experience symptoms of depression (as part of the neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia) without a formal diagnosis of a major depressive disorder. In people with dementia, symptoms of depression manifest clinically as physical (eg, poor appetite, low energy) and behavioural (eg, irritability, social isolation, sadness) signs. Although those with dementia and symptoms of depression might not fulfil all the criteria of a major depressive disorder, these symptoms nonetheless have an impact on people with dementia and their care givers. Symptoms of depression in people with dementia are associated with adverse health outcomes, including lower quality of life, functional decline, and increased risk of deathand are also associated with increased distress, burden, and depression in care givers.

Drug (eg, antidepressants, antipsychotics) and non-drug (eg, reminiscence therapy, exercise) interventions are used to treat both major depressive disorders and symptoms of depression in people with dementia. Increasing evidence of harm associated with antidepressant use in those with dementia (eg, from falls and fractures), and growing interest in social prescribing — linking patients with non-drug interventions in their community — as an effective treatment to combat symptoms of depression, loneliness, and isolation, has led to a renaissance for non-drug interventions. Randomised trials directly comparing the efficacy of drug and non-drug interventions are, however, rare, which creates uncertainty in clinical decision making about selection of optimal evidence based interventions for treating symptoms of depression in people with dementia.

We determined the comparative efficacy of drug and non-drug interventions for reducing symptoms of depression in people with dementia who were experiencing depression as a neuropsychiatric symptom of dementia or had a diagnosis of a major depressive disorder. Network meta-analysis (NMA) was used to fill this critical knowledge gap created by a paucity of head-to-head randomised controlled trials.

### Antidepressant medications in dementia: evidence and potential mechanisms of treatment-resistance [^113GZfgt]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1.
Reproduced forest plot of meta-analysis of included Cochrane review randomised controlled trials of antidepressants for depression in dementia. (Dudas et al.) (AD - Alzheimer's dementia, VD - Vascular dementia, M - mixed dementia, PDD - Parkinson's disease dementia, SSRI - selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, TCA - tricyclic antidepressant, SNRI - serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, NASSA - noradrenaline and specific serotonergic antidepressant).

In fact, antidepressant use in dementia is not only ineffective but potentially harmful, as it is associated with increased risk of falls, hospitalisation and higher risk of mortality (Banerjee et al; Johnell et al.).

Clearly further high-quality trials of antidepressants in dementia types other than AD are needed. To date only one randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) in 14 patients has been conducted in Lewy body dementia (LBD) which did not show efficacy and found high overall burden of side-effects (Culo et al.). Vascular dementia has similarly been neglected. Antidepressants are effective for post-stroke depression in patients without dementia (Li & Zhang). However, the overlap of vascular dementia with AD pathology (Attems & Jellinger,) and evidence that higher vascular risk factor scores predict reduced response to antidepressants in late life depression (Sheline et al.) does not suggest this patient group will buck the trend of a disappointing lack of efficacy of antidepressants in dementia. Even in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) where clinical use of SSRIs is widely advocated and seen as an effective therapy for depression and disinhibition in this patient group (Trieu et al.), the evidence supporting its use is mixed (Huey, Putnam, & Grafman; Kaye, Petrovic-Poljak, Verhoeff, & Freedman). Most studies in FTD are open-label or case series designs, and the only RCTs of SSRIs (RCTs) found opposing results in terms of efficacy (Deakin, Rahman, Nestor, Hodges, & Sahakian; Moretti, Torre, Antonello, Cazzato, & Bava,), though one trial of trazodone in 26 patients reported reduced depressive symptoms (Lebert, Stekke, Hasenbroekx, & Pasquier).

### Understanding the association between antidepressants and the risk of being diagnosed with dementia in older people: a self-controlled case series study [^1114X4Hy]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Given concerns about adverse outcomes for older people taking antidepressants in the literature, we investigated whether taking antidepressants elevates the risk of dementia.

Objective

This study aims to investigate the putative association of antidepressants with the risk of dementia.

Methods

We conducted a population-based self-controlled case series analysis of older people with dementia and taking antidepressants, using territory-wide medical records of 194,507 older patients collected by the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong, to investigate the association between antidepressant treatment and the risk of developing dementia in older people.

Results

There was a significantly higher risk of being diagnosed with dementia during the pre-drug-exposed period (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 20.42 (95% CI: 18.66–22.34)) compared to the non-drug-exposed baseline period. The IRR remained high during the drug-exposed period (IRR 8.86 (7.80–10.06)) before returning to a baseline level after washout (IRR 1.12 (0.77–1.36)).

Conclusion

The higher risk of dementia before antidepressant treatment may be related to emerging psychiatric symptoms co-occurring with dementia, which trigger medical consultations that result in a decision to begin antidepressants. Our findings do not support a causal relationship between antidepressant treatment and the risk of dementia.

Impact statement

We certify that this work is novel. This work is the first to compare first-line antidepressants (i.e. SSRI/SNRI) to an active comparator (i.e. psychotherapy) to reduce confounding by indication instead of comparing antidepressant use to no use in prior studies.

Dementia — agitation and psychosis management emphasizes first addressing reversible causes [I], using environmental measures if symptoms are not causing significant danger or distress [I], and considering behavioral measures [III]; if these are unsuccessful or behaviors are dangerous or distressing, judicious pharmacologic treatment may be used [II] with ongoing reevaluation and documentation [I]. Antipsychotic medications are recommended for psychosis [II] and agitation [II], can provide modest improvement in behavioral symptoms [I], and have evidence based mostly on 6–12-week trials with limited research beyond 12 weeks though clinical experience supports use [II]. Antipsychotics must be used with caution at the lowest effective dosage [I], with patients and families advised about potential benefits and risks, particularly mortality [I]; second-generation agents have a black box warning for increased mortality in elderly patients and first-generation agents carry at least a similar risk, with selection based on side-effect profile and patient characteristics [I]. Benzodiazepine benefit is modest but they may have a role for prominent anxiety [III] or on an as-needed basis for infrequent agitation or procedural sedation [II], with lorazepam and oxazepam preferable to longer half-life agents such as diazepam or chlordiazepoxide [III]. Anticonvulsants, lithium, and beta-blockers have minimal evidence and are generally not recommended except after other treatments have failed [III]; trazodone and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are not well studied for non-depressive symptoms but may be appropriate for nonpsychotic patients with agitation, especially with mild agitation or prior antipsychotic sensitivity [III].

Alternative antidepressants to SSRIs in dementia — alternative agents include but are not limited to venlafaxine, mirtazapine, and bupropion. The serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 system but does not induce or inhibit these enzymes and is less likely to interact with other drugs metabolized through the same system; one side effect more commonly seen with venlafaxine than other antidepressants is an elevation in blood pressure, which may be less likely with the sustained release formulation. Duloxetine is commonly used to treat major depression, but clinical experience with its use in geriatric patients with dementia is limited, and there are no published clinical trials to support its use. Mirtazapine can produce sedation and weight gain, especially at low doses, with rare but potentially serious side effects of liver toxicity and neutropenia. Bupropion has been associated with a risk of seizures, especially at high doses, in patients with anorexia or with structural neurological problems. Trazodone has sedative side effects and can be used when insomnia or severe agitation are prominent; at higher doses, significant side effects include postural hypotension and priapism.

### Risk of adverse outcomes associated with mirtazapine compared to sertraline use among older people living in long-term care facilities [^114Nx3GV]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study among residents of LTCFs found mirtazapine use following LTCF entry was associated with a 16% higher risk of all-cause mortality, compared to sertraline, and a lower risk of falls and fractures after 90 days. There was no difference in risk of falls and fractures in the short-term (≤ 90 days), or cardiovascular-, dementia- or delirium-related hospitalisations during any period. These findings provide clinicians with new evidence about adverse outcomes that are important to older people living in LTCFs, to inform shared decisions with residents and their families when considering treatment options for depression.

There are no prior LTCF-specific studies examining the association between mirtazapine use and mortality. In the general population, a higher risk of mortality has been observed with mirtazapine use compared to no antidepressant use or other antidepressant types or classes. However, individuals without dementia or aged ≥ 80 years had a lower risk of mortality compared to citalopram users. Another study found adults (n = 25 598) who augmented their treatment for depression or switched from an SSRI to mirtazapine had a higher risk of all-cause mortality within 2 years compared to initiating another SSRI and a higher risk ≥ 2 years when compared to another SSRI, amitriptyline or venlafaxine. There was also a higher risk of respiratory- and neoplasm-related mortality associated with mirtazapine compared to another SSRI within 2 years. These were common reasons for death in our analysis. However, causes of death were similar between mirtazapine and sertraline users and there was no difference in risk of cardiovascular events. It is possible that unmeasured confounding or prescribing and deprescribing cascades post-LTCF entry influenced the higher risk of mortality associated with mirtazapine compared to sertraline. Further investigation is needed to understand cause-specific mortality risks. The 16% higher risk of all-cause mortality associated with mirtazapine is concerning given it is the fifth most common medicine supplied in Australian LTCFs and received by one in five residents. The potential population-level risk of harm associated with mirtazapine use in LTCFs is considerable and clinicians should consider this in the context of the limited evidence of its effectiveness.

### Olanzapine and fluoxetine hydrochloride (Symbyax) [^113CcVxw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Olanzapine — Of the 2500 patients in premarketing clinical studies with olanzapine, 11% (263 patients) were ≥ 65 years of age. In patients with Schizophrenia, there was no indication of any different tolerability of olanzapine in the elderly compared with younger patients. Studies in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis have suggested that there may be a different tolerability profile in this population compared with younger patients with Schizophrenia. In placebo-controlled studies of olanzapine in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, there was a higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack) in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo. In 5 placebo-controlled studies of olanzapine in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis (n = 1184), the following adverse reactions were reported in olanzapine-treated patients at an incidence of at least 2% and significantly greater than placebo-treated patients: falls, somnolence, peripheral edema, abnormal gait, urinary incontinence, lethargy, increased weight, asthenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, dry mouth, and visual hallucinations. The rate of discontinuation due to adverse reactions was significantly greater with olanzapine than placebo (13% vs 7%). Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with olanzapine are at an increased risk of death compared to placebo. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]

Also, the presence of factors that might decrease pharmacokinetic clearance or increase the pharmacodynamic response to olanzapine should lead to consideration of a lower starting dose for any geriatric patient.

Fluoxetine — US fluoxetine clinical studies included 687 patients ≥ 65 years of age and 93 patients ≥ 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. SNRIs and SSRIs, including SYMBYAX, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17)].

Two studies involved participants with baseline depression (Angst et al. 2007; Goveas et al. 2012). The pooled OR for this group, OR = 1.92 (95% CI: 1.40–2.64; I² = 0%), was less than that for the groups without a documentation of depression at the start of the study, i.e. OR = 2.36 (95% CI: 1.19–4.67; I² = 87%); however, this difference was not statistically significant (Cherbuin et al. 2009; Goveas et al. 2012; Sachdev et al. 2012). All but one of the included studies had predominantly female participants (Angst et al. 2007; Goveas et al. 2012; Kessing et al. 2009; Sachdev et al. 2012). Grouping by this factor yielded a pooled effect of OR = 2.00 (95% CI: 1.21–3.29; I² = 88.7%) for the studies with predominant female participation. The single study (Cherbuin et al. 2009) which had a slight predominance of male participants had an OR = 3.39 (95% CI: 1.62–7.07). Studies that included participants with an average age greater or equal to 65 years old (Angst et al. 2007; Goveas et al. 2012; Sachdev et al. 2012) showed an increased odds of some form of cognitive impairment with antidepressant use OR = 1.65 (95% CI: 1.18–2.31; I² = 35.2%) whereas those with participants aged less than 65 years (Cherbuin et al. 2009; Kessing et al. 2009) revealed an even stronger association with pooled OR = 3.25 (95% CI: 3.19–3.32; I² = 0%). Studies that factored in the use of other psychotropic medications (Angst et al. 2007; Cherbuin et al. 2009) had a pooled OR of 2.23 (95% CI: 1.14–4.45; I² = 58.8%) while those that did not (Goveas et al. 2012; Kessing et al. 2009; Sachdev et al. 2012), had an estimate of OR = 2.10 (95% CI: 1.17–3.77; I² = 89.7%)

### Antidepressants for treating depression among older adults with dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112wWchg]. Psychiatry Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Depression and dementia represent significant health challenges in older adults. Despite guidelines recommending antidepressants, their efficacy in depressed patients with dementia remains undetermined.

Objective

This review, in following a living systematic review approach, primarily aims to determine the effect of any-type antidepressant on the level of depressive symptoms in older adults with dementia and secondly if there is an effect of any-type antidepressants on cognitive state, quality of life, and functionality in the old-age population with dementia.

Methods

Systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs from Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Register. Participants were ≥ 65 years, with both depression and any type of dementia. Certainty-of-Evidence was assessed through the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool and GRADE. Analysis involved standardized mean difference, with 95% confidence-intervals (CIs).

Findings

Of the 27,771 screened articles, 8 studies (617 participants), treated with SSRI, SSNRI, atypical, and tricyclic antidepressants were retained for quantitative synthesis. No evidence for an effect was found (SMD -0.10 [-0.26, 0.07]), nor when subgrouped based on depression severity or dementia level, nor for secondary outcomes.

Interpretation

This review did not find evidence of a clinical effect of antidepressants for treating depression in older adults with dementia. Methodological challenges might contribute to this finding.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^1124ttDS]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in dementia — compared to cyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), SSRIs tend to have a more favorable side-effect profile and generally have fewer anticholinergic and cardiovascular side effects; however, SSRIs can produce nausea and vomiting, agitation and akathisia, parkinsonian side effects, sexual dysfunction, weight loss, and hyponatremia, and some of these effects are more common with specific SSRIs than with the entire class. SSRI use is associated with an increased risk of falls in elderly patients, and physicians prescribing SSRIs should also be aware of the many possible medication interactions associated with the metabolism of these agents through the cytochrome P450 system.

### Antidepressant use in relation to dementia risk, cognitive decline, and brain atrophy [^115crUMm]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

We aimed to assess the effect of antidepressant use on dementia risk, cognitive decline, and brain atrophy.

Methods

In this prospective cohort study, we included 5511 dementia-free participants (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] > 25) of the Rotterdam study (57.5% women, mean age 70.6 years). Antidepressant use was extracted from pharmacy records from 1991 until baseline (2002–2008). Incident dementia was monitored from baseline until 2018, with repeated cognitive assessment and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) every 4 years.

Results

Compared to never use, any antidepressant use was not associated with dementia risk (hazard ratio [HR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92–1.41), or with accelerated cognitive decline or atrophy of white and gray matter. Compared to never use, dementia risk was somewhat higher with tricyclic antidepressants (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.01–1.83) than with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.81–1.54), but without dose-response relationships, accelerated cognitive decline, or atrophy in either group.

Discussion

Antidepressant medication in adults without indication of cognitive impairment was not consistently associated with long-term adverse cognitive effects.

Highlights

Antidepressant medications are frequently prescribed, especially among older adults. In this study, antidepressant use was not associated with long-term dementia risk. Antidepressant use was not associated with cognitive decline or brain atrophy. Our results support safe prescription in an older, cognitively healthy population.

### The association of antidepressant drug usage with cognitive impairment or dementia, including Alzheimer disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114hzA8R]. Depression and Anxiety (2017). Low credibility.

1 Objective

To determine if antidepressant drug usage is associated with cognitive impairment or dementia, including Alzheimer disease (AD).

2 Method

We conducted a systematic search of Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library. An initial screen by abstracts and titles was performed, and relevant full articles were then reviewed and assessed for their methodologic quality. Crude effect estimates were extracted from the included articles and a pooled estimate was obtained using a random effects model.

3 Results

Five articles were selected from an initial pool of 4,123 articles. Use of antidepressant drugs was associated with a significant twofold increase in the odds of some form of cognitive impairment or dementia (OR = 2.17). Age was identified as a likely modifier of the association between antidepressant use and some form of cognitive impairment or AD/dementia. Studies that included participants with an average age equal to or greater than 65 years showed an increased odds of some form of cognitive impairment with antidepressant drug usage (OR = 1.65), whereas those with participants less than age 65 revealed an even stronger association (OR = 3.25).

4 Conclusions

Antidepressant drug usage is associated with AD/dementia and this is particularly evident if usage begins before age 65. This association may arise due to confounding by depression or depression severity. However, biological mechanisms potentially linking antidepressant exposure to dementia have been described, so an etiological effect of antidepressants is possible. With this confirmation that an association exists, clarification of underlying etiologic pathways requires urgent attention.

### Impact of SSRI therapy on risk of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's dementia in individuals with previous depression [^112CnuyM]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Depression is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Research has shown that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram decreases amyloid-β generation and plaque load. The authors evaluated the impact of SSRI treatment on CSF biomarkers and progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's dementia.

Method

Data sets from 755 currently nondepressed participants from the longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and analyses of variance and covariance with ApoE4 status and age as covariates.

Results

In MCI patients with a history of depression, long-term SSRI treatment (> 4 years) was significantly associated with a delayed progression to Alzheimer's dementia by approximately 3 years, compared with short-term SSRI treatment, treatment with other antidepressants, or no treatment and compared with MCI patients without a history of depression. No differences in CSF biomarker levels were observed between treatment groups.

Conclusions

Long-term SSRI treatment may delay progression from MCI to Alzheimer's dementia.

### Depression-an underrecognized target for prevention of dementia in Alzheimer's disease [^1176qQDH]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Antidepressants and neurogenesis in humans

Antidepressants may have neuroprotective effects in humans as well and protect against hippocampal volume loss associated with cumulative episodes of depression. Evidence indicates that normalizing 5-HT activity in depression may have specific beneficial effects on cognition. Studies have shown that SSRIs may reduce the risk of AD in depressed individuals. A retrospective study of over 1.4 million individuals over a decade suggested that depressed individuals who were treated with an antidepressant only once or for a short period of time, had a greater risk of AD than those with chronic antidepressant treatment. Continued long-term antidepressant treatment was associated with a reduction in the rate of dementia, however, not to the same level as the rate for the general population.

It has also been suggested that treatment with an SSRI may improve cognitive function and daily living in MCI and AD patients. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials evaluating the effect of SSRIs on cognition in MCI patients and in AD reported a favorable and enhancing effect of Fluoxetine on memory and cognition in MCI patientsand Sertraline in AD patients.

Few studies investigated the influence of SSRI treatment on the progression from normal cognition to MCI and AD. A retrospective analysis in a population of cognitively healthy adults discharged from psychiatric healthcare service with a diagnosis of depression reported a lower rate of AD in patients receiving first-generation antidepressants compared with SSRI, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) and no treatment. A prospective longitudinal cohort study in non-depressed participants revealed, that in MCI patients with a history of depression, long-term SSRI treatment (> 4 years) was significantly associated with a delayed progression to AD by approximately 3 years. Thus, long-term SSRI treatment may delay progression from MCI to AD.

Therefore, long-term continued treatment with antidepressants might promote neurogenesis in the human hippocampus, thereby decrease the risk of developing dementia in cognitively healthy individuals and decelerate progression to dementia in MCI patients.

### Systemic medications and dementia risk: a systematic umbrella review [^115A4zT8]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

There were limited data on dementia subtype, with most meta-analyses reporting on all-cause dementia. Meta-analyses reporting results for AD only found a similar association in size and direction of effect to that seen with all-cause dementia for antihypertensives, NSAIDs, and vitamin E supplementation. For antacids, the only meta-analysis reporting exclusively on AD found a possible reduced incidence of dementia, in contrast to the other included meta-analyses. However, the study was small (n = 842) and CIs were very large and included the null (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.39–1.78).

Confounding by indication limits our ability to isolate individual drug's actions from the underlying condition in this review. Diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, depression and anxiety have been proposed as risk factors for dementia, which may affect risk of dementia regardless of drug treatments, especially if treatment is not wholly successful. The definition of systemic medication exposure through using recorded prescriptions of medications in health records presents a challenge to our interpretation of these results due to a lack of active comparators. This issue has previously been raised as an important limitation in dementia pharmaco-epidemiological studies. For example, AlDawsari et al. found that their effect estimate significantly changed for antidepressants when excluding one study that used an active comparator (paroxetine vs other SSRIs). All but one study in their meta-analysis of antidepressants relied on recorded prescriptions in health records, compared to people without a prescription. Comparing these two groups could lead to confounding by indication: as the comparator group would have included people without depression, leading to uncertainty as to whether the medication class or underlying condition alter dementia risk. Depression is a well-recognised risk factor for dementia. In addition, the lack of specificity around indication for systemic medications is an issue with population-level data. For example, antidepressants are routinely prescribed for pain relief, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, as well as for depression. Though many studies tried to control for indication, this was not always possible.

### Anticholinergic drug exposure and the risk of dementia: there is modest evidence for an association but not for causality [^111vMMtc]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Many observational studies published during the past 15 years have found an association between anticholinergic drug exposure and the risk of incident dementia. Animal data suggest plausible causal mechanisms for this finding. The results of a recent, large, and well-conducted study on the subject were widely disseminated by the lay and scientific media. This study addressed protopathic bias by examining anticholinergic drug exposure in time windows 1–11, 3–13, and 5–20 years before the identification of dementia. In brief, the study found that, pooling anticholinergic drug exposure across 11 drug categories, exposure in smallest to largest cumulative dosing groups was significantly associated with incident dementia risk, with an apparently dose-dependent relationship in unadjusted as well as adjusted analyses in all time windows prior to dementia identification. Whereas these findings appear compelling, there are at least 4 elephants in the room. First, only 3 of 11 anticholinergic drug categories were consistently associated with an increased risk of dementia; this suggests that anticholinergic activity may be an irrelevant common denominator. Second, for 2 of these 3 categories (antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs), confounding by indication seemed a distinct possibility. Third, in many analyses it seemed that exposure for as little as the equivalent of 1–90 days sufficed to increase the risk of dementia at a time interval of up to 20 years later; a causal mechanism here would need to have strong neurotoxic effects to result in the widespread brain changes that characterize dementia. Finally, the associations were almost uniformly stronger for vascular dementia than for Alzheimer's disease, making the identification of a causal mechanism even more challenging. Deprescribing anticholinergics to reduce state-dependent cognitive impairment, or to reduce the risk of delirium in vulnerable demographic and medical populations, is reasonable. Deprescribing anticholinergics to reduce the risk of future dementia is presently unwarranted.

### Brexpiprazole (Rexulti) [^116CKHxc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in the drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group.

Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. REXULTI is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis without agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

5.2	Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults

In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients and over 4,400 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in patients 24 years of age and younger was greater in antidepressant-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1,000 patients treated are provided in Table 2.

No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric studies. There were suicides in the adult studies, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about antidepressant drug effect on suicide.

It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance studies in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression.

Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing REXULTI, in patients whose depression is persistently worse or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^113hhdDq]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Dementia — treatment of depression calls for evaluation of suicide risk [I]; depressed mood may respond to improvements in living situation or stimulation-oriented treatments [II]; and despite mixed efficacy data, clinical consensus supports a trial of an antidepressant for clinically significant, persistent depressed mood [II]. Agent selection is based on side-effect profiles and patient characteristics [I], with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) potentially preferred for better tolerability [II]; bupropion, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine may also be effective [II], while agents with substantial anticholinergic effects (e.g., amitriptyline, imipramine) should be avoided [I]. Unilateral electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be effective for patients who do not respond to pharmacological agents [II]. Treatments for apathy are not well supported, but psychostimulants, bupropion, bromocriptine, and amantadine may be helpful [III], and psychostimulants are sometimes useful for depression in patients with significant general medical illness [III].

### The association of antidepressant drug usage with cognitive impairment or dementia, including Alzheimer disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111ntqyB]. Depression and Anxiety (2017). Low credibility.

Finally, as stated above, most cases of AD/dementia are influenced by factors such as advancing age (65+ years), biological sex and whether one carries the ε4 allele of the APOE gene (the only genetic risk unquestionably associated with the late‐onset form of AD). Interestingly, the APOE ε4 status is also associated with clinical depression, but only in women (Muller‐Thomsen et al. 2002), and particularly those with a history of depression prior to developing AD (Delano‐Wood et al. 2008). The interaction of ε4 genotype and depression further increases the risk of incident dementia (Geda et al. 2006). It would be interesting to revisit some of these larger population study datasets — for example, the extensive dataset associated with the Danish study (Meng et al. 2012) — to determine whether biological sex, APOE ε4 genotype (if described in the patient files) and specific antidepressant drug usage (including for off‐label indications (Wong et al. 2016)) interact to impart greater odds of developing a dementia‐related phenotype.

Limitations of note include the small pool of included studies, the presence of clinical and statistical heterogeneity, and the fact that some of the studies did not look at this association as their primary hypothesis. Thus, adjustments were not commonly made for other explanatory variables and therefore, it was difficult to confidently exclude the effect of within study confounding. This latter issue is particularly worrisome in pharmacoepidemiology, where confounding by indication and severity pose serious methodological challenges. Often, questions in pharmacoepidemiology can be addressed by meta‐regression, but such an analysis would normally require approximately 10 studies per determinant of heterogeneity. The paucity of relevant studies in the literature precludes any such study design. The best way to deal with the issue of confounding would be randomization, which, again, would rely on a greater number of studies. Often (when randomized studies are not feasible) advanced methods such as propensity score analysis are necessary to deal with these forms of bias. This is not possible in a meta‐analysis such as this one, in which only unadjusted estimates were consistently available for pooling. An association, in itself, does not confirm causation, but a strong association that is consistently observed, in which temporality of the association is clear and which is biologically plausible may represent an etiologic effect (Hill, 1965). The existence of an association, as confirmed here, creates an urgent need to explore the underlying issue of etiology.

### Depression in Alzheimer's disease: an alternative role for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors? [^116GgVwC]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Depression is a common co-morbidity seen in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the successful treatment of depressive symptoms in people with AD is rarely seen. In fact, multiple randomized controlled trials have shown selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the current best recommended treatment for depression, to be ineffective in treating depressive symptoms in people with AD. One explanation for this lack of treatment effect may be that depressive symptoms can reflect the progression of AD, rather than clinical depression and are a consequence of more severe neurodegeneration. This raises several questions regarding not only the efficacy of SSRIs in the treatment of depression in people with AD but also regarding the accuracy of diagnosis of depression in AD. However, there may be a rationale for the prescription of SSRIs in early AD. Even in the absence of depression, SSRIs have been shown to slow the conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD. This may be attributed to the effect of SSRIs on the processing of amyloid-β precursor protein, which may cause a reduction in the accumulation of amyloid-β. Thus, although SSRIs may lack efficacy in treating depression in people with AD, they may hold therapeutic potential for treating and delaying the progression of AD especially if treatment begins in the early stages of AD. This article reviews the current consensus for SSRI treatment of depression in people with AD and highlights the possibility of SSRIs being a treatment option for delaying the progression of AD.

### Association between first-line antidepressant use and risk of dementia in older adults: a retrospective cohort study [^117Nd9Jq]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Prior studies suggested that antidepressant use is associated with an increased risk of dementia compared to no use, which is subject to confounding by indication. We aimed to compare the dementia risk among older adults with depression receiving first-line antidepressants (i.e. SSRI/SNRI) versus psychotherapy, which is also considered the first-line therapy for depression.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study was conducted using the US Medical Expenditure Panel Survey from 2010 to 2019. We included adults aged ≥ 50 years diagnosed with depression who initiated SSRI/SNRI or psychotherapy. We excluded patients with a dementia diagnosis before the first record of SSRI/SNRI use or psychotherapy. The exposure was the patient's receipt of SSRI/SNRI (identified from self-report questionnaires) or psychotherapy (identified from the Outpatient Visits or Office-Based Medical Provider Visits files). The outcome was a new diagnosis of dementia within 2 years (i.e., survey panel period) identified using ICD-9/ICD-10 codes from the Medical Conditions file. Using a multivariable logistic regression model, we reported adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We also conducted subgroup analyses by patient sex, age group, race/ethnicity, severity of depression, combined use of other non-SSRI/SNRI antidepressants, and presence of underlying cognitive impairment.

Results

Among 2,710 eligible patients (mean age = 61 ± 8, female = 69%, White = 84%), 89% used SSRIs/SNRIs, and 11% received psychotherapy. The SSRI/SNRI users had a higher crude incidence of dementia than the psychotherapy group (16.4% vs. 11.8%), with an aOR of 1.36 (95% CI = 1.06–1.74). Subgroup analyses yielded similar findings as the main analyses, except no significant association for patients who were aged < 65 years (1.23, 95% CI = 0.93–1.62), male (1.34, 95% CI = 0.95–1.90), Black (0.76, 95% CI = 0.48–1.19), had a higher PHQ-2 (1.39, 95% CI = 0.90–2.15), and had underlying cognitive impairment (1.06, 95% CI = 0.80–1.42).

Conclusions

Our findings suggested that older adults with depression receiving SSRIs/SNRIs were associated with an increased dementia risk compared to those receiving psychotherapy.

### PTSD, psychotropic medication use, and the risk of dementia among US veterans: a retrospective cohort study [^116NfuK7]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the associations between PTSD, psychotropic medication use, and the risk for dementia.

Design

Retrospective cohort.

Participants

Nationwide sample of US veterans (N = 417,172) aged ≥ 56 years during fiscal year (FY) 2003 without a diagnosis of dementia or mild cognitive impairment at baseline (FY02–03) and ≥ 1 clinical encounter every 2 years during follow-up (FY04–12).

Measures

Demographic characteristics; diagnosis of PTSD, dementia, and medical and psychiatric comorbidity (defined by ICD-9 codes); and psychotropic medication use including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), novel antidepressants (NA), benzodiazepines (BZA), and atypical antipsychotics (AA). Cox proportional hazard models examined for associations between PTSD diagnosis, psychotropic medication use, and risk for a dementia diagnosis.

Results

PTSD diagnosis significantly increased the risk for dementia diagnosis (HR = 1.35; [95% CI = 1.27–1.43]). However, there were significant interactions between PTSD diagnosis and use of SSRIs (P < .001), NAs (P = 0.014), and AAs (P < .001) on the risk for dementia diagnosis. HR for dementia diagnosis among veterans diagnosed with PTSD and not using psychotropic medications was 1.55 [1.45–1.67]. Among veterans diagnosed with PTSD prescribed SSRI, SNRI, or AA, HR for dementia diagnosis varied by drug class use ranging from 1.99 for SSRI to 4.21 for AA, relative to veterans without a PTSD diagnosis and no psychotropic medication receipt. BZAs or SNRIs use at baseline was associated with a significantly increased risk for dementia diagnosis independent of a PTSD diagnosis.

Conclusion

PTSD diagnosis is associated with an increased risk for dementia diagnosis that varied with receipt of psychotropic medications. Further research would help to delineate if these findings are due to differences in PTSD severity, psychiatric comorbidity, or independent effects of psychotropic medications on cognitive decline.

### Antidepressants for agitation and psychosis in patients with dementia… [^116gJzAE]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

Main Results: Nine trials involving a total of 692 persons were included in the review. Five studies compared SSRIs with placebo, and two studies were combined in a meta-analysis for the outcome of change in Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory scores. There was a significant difference between antidepressants and placebo on measures of agitation as reported on the change in CMAI total score, although the results were heavily weighted by one large study. There were no significant differences in change in behavioral symptoms of dementia for SSRIs compared with placebo in the one study that reported on changes in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and Behavioral Pathology in Dementia scales.

One study comparing citalopram with placebo found a significant difference in neuropsychiatric symptoms as measured on the Neurobehavioral Rating Scale after controlling for baseline severity NBRS score, although the unadjusted mean difference was not statistically significant. Authors' Conclusions: Currently, there are relatively few studies of antidepressants for the treatment of agitation and psychosis in dementia. The SSRIs sertraline and citalopram were associated with a reduction in symptoms of agitation when compared with placebo in two studies. SSRIs and trazodone appear to be tolerated reasonably well when compared with placebo, typical antipsychotics, and atypical antipsychotics. Future studies involving more participants are required to determine if SSRIs, trazodone, or other antidepressants are safe and effective treatments for agitation and psychosis in dementia.

Persons with dementia who exhibit symptoms of psychosis or agitation are commonly treated with antipsychotic medications. SSRIs may cause serious adverse effects, including gastrointestinal bleeding, hyponatremia, falls, and fractures. 3 SSRIs were not significantly different from antipsychotic medications in trial withdrawals related to adverse effects — an important measure of overall tolerability — although citalopram resulted in fewer adverse effects than risperidone. 9 There is insufficient evidence on the long-term safety of antidepressant use for neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with dementia.

### The effect of treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in comparison to placebo in the progression of dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116AfFEv]. Age and Ageing (2016). Low credibility.

Background

selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may affect the neurodegenerative process of dementia, enhancing cognition. This systematic review aims to determine whether SSRIs influence cognitive performance, mood and function in people with any type of dementia.

Method

randomised placebo-controlled studies of SSRIs in people with dementia, which recorded cognitive outcomes, were identified in ALOIS (ALzheimer's and cOgnitive Improvement Studies register) in April 2013 and updated in January 2015. Data were extracted on cognition, agitation, mood, activities of daily living (ADLs) and adverse events. End of treatment statistics were calculated.

Results

twelve studies met inclusion criteria (1,174 participants), of which seven studies (710 participants) provided data for meta-analysis on cognition. There was no difference in MMSE score at end of treatment; mean difference (MD) was 0.28 (95% CI -0.83 to 1.39) (six studies, 470 participants). For change in MMSE scores, there was a small improvement; MD was 0.53 (95%CI -0.07 to 1.14) (three studies, 352 participants). The remaining studies showed no improvement in cognition. There was no statistically significant benefit of SSRIs on mood (four studies, 317 participants); standard mean difference (SMD) -0.10 (95% CI -0.39 to 0.2), agitation (three studies, 189 participants); SMD -0.01(95% CI -0.86 to 0.83), or ADLs at end of treatment (four studies, 336 participants); SMD -0.15(95% CI -0.45 to 0.15). There was no difference in mortality between the two groups. Study quality was mixed with concerns over incomplete data.

Conclusion

a small number of relatively low-powered studies showed no benefit or harm from SSRIs in terms of cognition, mood, agitation or ADLs. Large, methodologically robust studies are needed.

### Olanzapine and fluoxetine [^115huM8H]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules are not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

In olanzapine placebo-controlled clinical trials of elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, the incidence of death in olanzapine-treated patients was significantly greater than placebo-treated patients (3.5% vs 1.5%, respectively).

Meta-Analysis of Antipsychotic Use in Dementia-Related Psychosis – Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of seventeen placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules are not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Cerebrovascular Adverse Events (CVAE), Including Stroke — Cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patients in trials of olanzapine in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. In placebo-controlled trials, there was a significantly higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo. Olanzapine and olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules are not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning].

Effects of antidepressants on inflammation

Animal studies on antidepressants and inflammation

The induction of significant molecular changes by chronic stress leading to the increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines is generally reversed by antidepressants such as fluoxetine, imipramine, and tianeptine. Findings suggest that antidepressants possess significant anti-inflammatory properties – (Table 1). In addition to their effects on cells of the peripheral immune system, SSRIs can limit microglial and astroglial inflammatory processes. Fluoxetine acts on neurons and promotes the downregulation of genes involved in pro-inflammatory response pathways (e.g. expression of IL-6 signaling, NF-κb signaling, acute-phase response signaling) and of TNF signaling-related molecules in rats. Further, the dopamine enhancer bupropion is also known to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine production and to lower production of TNF-α and Interferon-γ in mice. Studies indicate that SSRIs (e.g. fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline) potently inhibit microglial TNF-α and NO production. SNRIs such as venlafaxine as well as the MAO inhibitor moclobemide possess anti-inflammatory properties in mixed glial cultures. Selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, which increase endogenous noradrenaline concentrations, can reduce neuroinflammation and partly rescue microglial functions.

Antidepressants and inflammation in human studies

In a 18F-FEPPA PET study microglial activation was greater in MDD patients with long periods of no antidepressant treatment than in MDD patients with short periods of no antidepressant treatment. Consistently, the yearly increase in microglial activation was no longer evident when antidepressant treatment was given. The specific biological mechanisms of SSRI to modulate the microglial inflammatory response have not yet been fully understood. A variety of possible mechanisms have been researched such as mediated effects via 5-HTT, cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling, transcription factor NF-κB, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.

Since depression and dementia are both associated with an inflammatory etiology and the risk for conversion from MCI to the dementia stage of AD is increased in patients with elevated concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, early antidepressant treatment might be an essential strategy in dementia prevention.

### Risk of dementia among antidepressant elderly users: a population-based cohort analysis in Spain [^112BT9i9]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

The use of antidepressants with anticholinergic effects has been associated with an increased risk of dementia. However, the results published are contradictory. The aim of the study is to compare the risk of developing dementia in elderly who were prescribed tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) versus those who were prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other antidepressants (OA). A prospective population-based cohort study was performed using the Spanish Database for Pharmacoepidemiological Research in Primary Care (BIFAP) data (from 2005 to 2018). The cohort study included 62,928 patients age ≥ 60 without dementia and with antidepressant long-term monotherapy. Patients were divided into exposure antidepressant groups based on ATC system [TCA, SSRIs users and OAs users]. The risk of dementia was calculated by Cox regression models, providing hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals. The Kaplan-Meier model was used for survival analysis. Chi2 test was used as association test. The results showed SSRI users had higher dementia risk than TCA users (HR = 1.864; 95%CI = 1.624–2.140). Moreover, OA users had also significant risk of dementia (HR = 2.103; 95%CI = 1.818–2.431). Several limitations are the variation of the trend in the prescription of antidepressants, the small number of patients that use some antidepressants, the lack of information related to the dose, or socioeconomic characteristics, the use of antidepressant drugs for other indications, or the therapeutic compliance. Our findings showed that older users of SSRI and OA have more risk of developing dementia than TCA elderly users. However, additional studies would be needed.

### Antidepressants and dementia [^112rkLgz]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Background

It has been suggested that antidepressants may have neuroprotective abilities but it has newer been investigated lately whether treatment with antidepressants reduces the risk of dementia.

Method

Linkage of registers of all prescribed antidepressants and diagnoses of dementia in Denmark during a period from 1995 to 2005.

Results

Persons who purchased antidepressants once (N = 687,552) had an increased rate of dementia compared to persons unexposed to antidepressants (N = 779,831). Nevertheless, the rate of dementia changed over time; thus during the initial prescription periods the rate increased with the number of prescriptions but continued long-term antidepressants treatment was associated with a reduction in the rate of dementia, however, not to the same level as the rate for the general population. This pattern was found for all classes of antidepressants (SSRIs, newer non-SSRI antidepressants and older antidepressants). All findings were replicated in sub-analyses with Alzheimer's disease as outcome.

Limitations

Methodological reasons for the findings cannot be excluded due to the non-randomized nature of data.

Conclusions

Continued long-term antidepressant treatment was associated with a reduced rate of dementia, however, not to the same level as the rate for the general population.

### Association between first-line antidepressant use and risk of dementia in older adults: a retrospective cohort study [^116YDd6K]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

In the subgroup analyses, we found that the association between SSRI/SNRI use and dementia risk did not exist in patients with a higher PHQ-2 score. Patients with a higher PHQ-2 score might reflect those with more severe depression or uncontrolled depression, which may confound the drug effect. That is, the progression of depression may play a critical role in the risk of dementia, and thus masking the effect of SSRIs/SNRIs. The association also did not exist in patients with underlying cognitive impairment, which is probably because clinicians are more concerned about the risk of dementia if patients have prior cognitive impairment, and thus psychotherapy is preferred to SSRI/SNRI use. However, this group of patients is at high risk of dementia, which may lead to mitigation of the risk in the SSRI/SNRI group. The association also did not exist in Black adults, probably because Black adults are less likely to receive SSRI/SNRI than White adults even though they have similar severity of depression, which may dilute the drug effect as well. Finally, the reason for no association among these subgroups could also be due to the small sample sizes after stratification.

There are some limitations in our study. First, we used MEPS data, which only follow a patient for at most 2 years, which may not be long enough for dementia to occur and underestimate the risk of dementia. However, in a population-based study with a mean follow-up of 8 years, the incidence of dementia was 13% among older adults with depression, similar to our findings. Second, we were unable to identify incident new users of SSRIs/SNRIs and psychotherapy due to the lack of a washout period. Therefore, we could not address the depletion of susceptibles, meaning that patients who were using SSRI/SNRI may be the ones who were less likely to incur dementia. Third, although we conducted several subgroup analyses to address potential heterogeneity in the drug effect across patient subgroups, we were unable to include potential confounders such as duration of depression. Fourth, death was a competing risk in our study (i.e. if patients died, then they would not experience dementia afterwards), yet we were unable to measure this using MEPS data. Fifth, dose and duration of SSRI/SNRI use may be associated with dementia risk, yet MEPS data does not provide such information.

### Antidepressant use and cognitive decline in patients with dementia: a national cohort study [^112yi42z]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this cohort study, use of antidepressants was associated with faster cognitive decline in patients with dementia, in particular SSRIs (i.e. citalopram, sertraline and escitalopram) and mirtazapine. These effects appeared to be more pronounced in patients with more severe dementia. Compared with sertraline, escitalopram presented faster cognitive decline, while citalopram was linked to a slower cognitive decline. Additionally, higher dispensed doses of SSRIs were associated with greater cognitive decline, as well as increased risks of severe dementia, all-cause mortality, and fracture. Our study cannot distinguish whether these findings are due to the antidepressants or the underlying psychiatric indication.

### Perphenazine and amitriptyline hydrochloride [^115ysunX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Perphenazine and amitriptyline hydrochloride is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis (see BOXED WARNING).

Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk

Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.

The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of nine antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1,000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of second-generation antidepressants for the treatment of older adults with depression: questionable benefit and considerations for frailty [^1121GRsA]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Frailty is associated with increased potential for adverse events. As such, the possibility of harm from antidepressants warrants careful consideration, as they may be less well tolerated in frailty compared to those without frailty. In this meta-analysis of older adults without frailty, 13% of subjects in the treatment arm withdrew because of adverse events compared to 5.8% with placebo (NNH = 14), with nausea reported most frequently (NNH = 11). No study reported the incidence of Q-Tc prolongation and only one study reported on hyponatremia, both of which are known adverse effects of antidepressants. The trials reported only short-term outcomes, which raises the possibility that adverse effects may have been underestimated. In a retrospective cohort study that followed 60,746 older adults with depression for a mean duration of 5.0 years (SD 3.3), adverse events were more frequent with all classes of antidepressants compared to no antidepressant, including mortality, falls and fractures.

Limitations

This review has several limitations. The focus on adults above age 65 could be viewed as an arbitrary cut-off. However, 65 years is generally accepted as a transition into older age, and the mean age of subjects included in the meta-analysis ranged from 71 to 82 years. Next, risks associated with under-treating high-risk depression were not fully considered, as most studies excluded those at risk of suicide. Third, the high degree of heterogeneity could indicate variable response to antidepressants based on duration of symptoms, severity, or number of recurrences. Fourth, several studies included older adults with dementia, which could negate the results for those without dementia, a concept supported by a Cochrane review, which concluded that available evidence "does not provide strong support for the efficacy of antidepressants for treating depression in dementia". However, in our sensitivity analysis of trials that excluded older adults with dementia, there was no statistically significant response or remission for antidepressants compared to placebo. Next, this meta-analysis compared anti-depressants to placebo. A network meta-analysis might find a difference between specific agents, which have not been tested in head to head clinical trials. Finally, the exploration of how frail older adults might respond to antidepressants is theoretical and not based on study data. Thus, it is not possible to reach definitive conclusions. The lack of evidence for the frail elderly is a call to action to include frail older adults in clinical trials so that evidence-based practice guidelines can be developed for this population.

### The association of antidepressant drug usage with cognitive impairment or dementia, including Alzheimer disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11776Gr2]. Depression and Anxiety (2017). Low credibility.

3.3 Characteristics of the pool

There were 48,267 instances of dementia or cognitive disorder and a combined total of 688,237 individuals had used antidepressant drugs (Table 2). A total of 1,477,626 participants were pooled from the five included studies (see Table 3). Participants were recruited from the general population in four of the studies (Angst et al. 2007; Cherbuin et al. 2009; Goveas et al. 2012; Kessing, Sondergard, Forman, & Andersen, 2009) and from hospital admissions in the other study (Sachdev et al. 2012). One of the studies was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) (Goveas et al. 2012), one was a prospective cohort study (Cherbuin et al. 2009), two were retrospective cohort studies (Angst et al. 2007; Kessing et al. 2009), and one was a cross‐sectional study (Sachdev et al. 2012). Exposure assessment (current antidepressant use) was obtained from the participants in three of the studies (Cherbuin et al. 2009; Goveas et al. 2012; Sachdev et al. 2012) and from existing records for the other two studies (Angst et al. 2007; Kessing et al. 2009). Outcome assessment was made for all five studies on the basis of using standardized diagnostic classifications such as ICD 9, ICD 10, and DSM IV (Table 2).
