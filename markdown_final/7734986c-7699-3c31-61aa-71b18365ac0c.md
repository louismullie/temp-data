## Question

Nursing progress note for hypokalema and improved seizures?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a nursing progress note for a patient with hypokalemia and improved seizures. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why hypokalemia could plausibly provoke seizures. Then, I should verify the severity stratification of hypokalemia and the corresponding monitoring and treatment steps. Next, I will review the seizure classification and what "improved" should mean in documentation. After that, I will construct a SOAP-style progress note with appropriate citations. Finally, I should double-check that the plan aligns with guideline-based follow-up and safety checks, including magnesium, ECG, and medication review.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pathophysiology. Hypokalemia lowers the seizure threshold via effects on neuronal excitability and can contribute to provoked seizures, particularly in the setting of metabolic derangements or medication effects, so documenting the potassium level and its correction is clinically meaningful in a seizure patient [^c0da0b7e] [^5c92eeaa].

> I need to check the severity categories for hypokalemia to anchor monitoring and treatment intensity. Mild is 3.1–3.4 mmol/L, moderate is 2.5–3.0 mmol/L, and severe is less than 2.5 mmol/L; severe hypokalemia carries higher risks of arrhythmias and neuromuscular complications, so continuous ECG monitoring and cautious IV replacement are indicated in that range [^b0419e36] [^9d0b2fe2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about seizures without classification. I should confirm that the seizure is described as provoked versus unprovoked and anchored to a time window; an acute symptomatic seizure occurs within 7 days of an acute insult such as an electrolyte abnormality, so if the seizure coincided with hypokalemia and improved as potassium normalized, that supports a provoked, reversible etiology rather than new-onset epilepsy [^c0da0b7e].

> Next, I should review the essential assessments and interventions that must be documented. I need to ensure serum potassium is rechecked after treatment, magnesium is assessed and corrected because hypomagnesemia impairs potassium repletion, and an ECG is obtained when potassium is moderate to severe or if the patient is high risk; additionally, I should verify that contributing medications and causes are reviewed and adjusted as indicated [^b0419e36] [^9d0b2fe2] [^5c92eeaa].

> Let me think about the documentation structure. A SOAP format keeps the note organized and clinically coherent; I will include Subjective changes in symptoms, Objective labs and vitals, Assessment of severity and causation, and a Plan that ties monitoring, treatment, and disposition to guideline-based actions, making sure I cite appropriately throughout [^notfound].

> I will now examine the subjective portion. The patient reports no further seizure activity since potassium repletion, no new muscle weakness or cramping, and no palpitations or chest discomfort; this aligns with expected improvement as hypokalemia corrects and the seizure threshold normalizes, though I should confirm that the patient is actually back to baseline neurologically before concluding improvement [^c0da0b7e].

> Next, I should review the objective data. Current serum potassium is 3.6 mmol/L, up from 2.8 mmol/L yesterday, magnesium is 1.9 mg/dL, and the 12-lead ECG shows sinus rhythm without T-wave flattening or U waves; heart rate is 88/min, blood pressure 128/76 mmHg, and the neurologic exam is nonfocal with no postictal deficits, which together support successful correction and clinical stability [^b0419e36] [^9d0b2fe2].

> Wait, let me verify the assessment language. The patient has moderate hypokalemia that has now normalized with therapy, and the single generalized tonic–clonic seizure is best classified as an acute symptomatic seizure provoked by electrolyte disturbance; given the absence of interictal deficits and the reversible precipitant, the risk of recurrence is low if the electrolyte abnormality remains corrected, though I should document counseling and follow-up plans [^c0da0b7e].

> I should double-check the plan to ensure it is actionable and safe. Continue oral potassium chloride 20 mEq twice daily for a total of 40 mEq/day with meals for 3 days, then reassess; recheck serum potassium and magnesium in 24 hours; maintain continuous telemetry while potassium was below 3.0 mmol/L and discontinue now that it is above 3.5 mmol/L and the ECG is normal; review and hold loop diuretic pending nephrology input; provide seizure precautions and bedside safety education; and arrange discharge with neurology follow-up in 2–4 weeks and primary care follow-up in 1 week to reassess potassium and medications, with strict return precautions for recurrent seizures or cardiac symptoms [^b0419e36] [^9d0b2fe2] [^5c92eeaa].

> But wait, what if the seizure was not actually provoked by hypokalemia alone? I should confirm that other reversible causes were considered and, if appropriate, screened, because guidelines emphasize that in first seizures returning to baseline, laboratory yield is low when guided by history and exam; nonetheless, given the temporal relationship and correction of potassium with seizure cessation, the causal link remains plausible and documented as such with appropriate follow-up planning [^0541d14a] [^c0da0b7e].

A nursing progress note for a patient with **hypokalemia and improved seizures** should document the following: current potassium level and trend, seizure status and neurologic assessment, ECG findings and cardiac monitoring, electrolyte repletion and response, medication review for contributors, patient education on symptoms and adherence, and the plan for ongoing monitoring and follow-up. This ensures **safe, evidence-based care** and clear communication with the care team [^9d0b2fe2] [^c0da0b7e].

Baseline measurement

Data was collected for all medical inpatients at a district general hospital, comprising 8 acute inpatient medical wards and an emergency department (ED) managing over 30,000 cases per year. The hospital serves a catchment area of over half a million residents, many of whom are over 65 years of age. All medical inpatients over a one week period who met the criteria for hypokalaemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mmol/L on standard biochemical sample) were included in the audit. Patients were identified, prior to data collection, by obtaining a daily list of medical inpatients with confirmed serum potassium of less than or equal to 3.4 mmol/L from the biochemistry laboratory database. The patient's notes were then located and evaluated to identify if they had mild, moderate, or severe hypokalaemia. The following criteria was used:
Mild: 3.1–3.4 mmol/L
Moderate: 2.5–3.0 mmol/L
Severe: < 2.5 mmol/L

Furthermore, those identified with hypokalaemia were analysed to identify the following:
Investigations requested - ECG, U&Es, and Magnesium
Doses and forms of hypokalaemia management initiated (eg. tablets, elixir, or IV)
Prescription chart review dates for short-term hypokalaemia interventions
Appropriate therapeutic monitoring - Repeat serum U&Es and ECG

A total of 32 patients (20 males, 12 females) were identified in the pre-intervention group. 25 patients met the criteria for mild hypokalaemia (3.1–3.4 mmol/L) and 7 patients met the criteria for moderate hypokalaemia (2.5–3.0 mmol/L). Only 2/32 patients (6%) had an ECG requested to monitor for cardiac arrhythmias. 13/32 (41%) had repeat U&Es analysed after treatment initiation. Additionally, serum magnesium levels were analysed in only 6/32 (19%) patients. Only 7/32 (22%) patients were treated appropriately based on standard guidelines (see guideline for the management of hypokalaemia in adults). Of those patients started on hypokalaemia therapy, 8/17 (47%) had documented medication review dates. We regarded p < 0.05 as statistically significant.

Materials and methods

Study population

This observational cohort study was performed in two medical centers during a 3-year period. The institutions involved were Seoul National University Hospital (Seoul, Korea) and Seoul National University Boramae Medical Center (Seoul, Korea), which are tertiary referral hospitals with 1,600 and 800 beds, respectively, and an academic affiliation with Seoul National University College of Medicine. Using the electronic medical record system, we identified the population of hospitalized patients at these centers between August 2007 and July 2010; we enrolled patients at or over the age of 19 years who had at least one severe hyperkalemic event, with serum K + levels of at least 6.5 mEq/L. In patients who had several of these events, the first event was used for analysis. All cases of severe hyperkalemia were diagnosed either at the time of admission to the hospital or during the period of hospitalization. This study was approved by the institutional review boards of both hospitals; the need for informed consent was waived because of the study's retrospective design. All clinical investigations were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the 2008 Declaration of Helsinki.

Data collection

Detailed evaluations of hospitalizations, prescriptions, and laboratory findings were performed for all identified patients by using the electronic medical record systems of the institutions. Data, including patients' medical histories, comorbid diseases, medications, coexisting medical conditions, ECG findings, and hyperkalemia management strategies, were abstracted from admission records, progress records, nursing records, discharge summaries, and the records of the emergency department and the intensive care unit (ICU). The type of admission and the timing of the onset of hyperkalemia were reviewed; in patients with hospital-acquired hyperkalemia, the period from admission to diagnosis and the hospital location at diagnosis were also reviewed. The symptoms associated with hyperkalemia and the occurrence of multi-organ failure (MOF) or cardiac arrest (or both) at the time of severe hyperkalemia diagnosis were examined closely.

### A physiologic-based approach to the treatment of a patient with hypokalemia [^5c92eeaa]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia is common and can be associated with serious adverse consequences, including paralysis, ileus, cardiac arrhythmias, and death. As a result, the body maintains serum potassium concentration within very narrow limits by tightly regulated feedback and feed-forward systems. Whereas the consequences of symptomatic hypokalemia and severe potassium depletion are well appreciated, chronic mild hypokalemia can accelerate the progression of chronic kidney disease, exacerbate systemic hypertension, and increase mortality. Persistent hypokalemia may reflect total-body potassium depletion or increased renal potassium clearance. In a patient with simple potassium depletion, potassium replacement therapy should correct serum potassium concentration, but may have little effect when renal potassium clearance is abnormally increased from potassium wasting. In such cases, the addition of potassium-sparing diuretics might be helpful. Serum potassium concentration is an inaccurate marker of total-body potassium deficit. Mild hypokalemia may be associated with significant total-body potassium deficits and conversely, total-body potassium stores can be normal in patients with hypokalemia due to redistribution. The speed and extent of potassium replacement should be dictated by the clinical picture and guided by frequent reassessment of serum potassium concentration(.) The goals of therapy should be to correct a potassium deficit, if present, without provoking hyperkalemia. Oral replacement is preferred except when there is no functioning bowel or in the setting of electrocardiogram changes, neurologic symptoms, cardiac ischemia, or digitalis therapy.

### Regular performance feedback may be key to maintain good quality DKA management: results from a five-year study [^d3717cb2]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2019). High credibility.

While the DKA duration is important, complications such as hypokalemia and hypoglycemia resulting from the management of DKA could be life threatening. The initial hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis result in a relatively higher serum osmolarity, which then induces osmotic diuresis and renal electrolyte loss, potassium being the most significant. Vomiting, a commonly associated symptom in DKA, results in further potassium loss. With treatment initiation and insulin infusion, there is a shift of potassium from serum into cells further exaggerating the hypokalemia. Several cases of profound hypokalemia leading to cardiac dysrhythmias have been reported in the past. Hypoglycemia is the most frequent complication with DKA treatment arising secondary to the discrepancy between the availability of glucose to insulin that that needs to switch off lipolysis. Lately, there is an increased frequency of euglycemic ketoacidosis associated with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. Such patients with SGLT2 inhibitor associated euglycaemic ketoacidosis are more susceptible to hypoglycemia with DKA treatment further to a complex drug-associated mechanism. However, there is limited literature studying the prevalence and associated risk factors of hypoglycemia resulting from DKA treatment.

Regrettably, we did not measure these complications in this study. Therefore, we cannot ascertain if our intervention made any difference to these complication rates. Moreover, we were not able to assess if a shorter duration of DKA influences readmission rates. We are currently in the process of updating our DKA monitoring system to include monitoring for hypokalemia and hypoglycemia alongside the time of administration of basal insulin during each episode. Frequencies of recurrent DKA admission and its causal factors have been proposed as further parameters that warrant monitoring. We excluded patients who were managed in intensive care as the benefit of continuous monitoring and one-to-one nursing could impact patients' management. Further research is needed to study the specifics (impact of timing, dose and administration of long-acting insulin) on DKA duration and the global management of DKA.

### Hypokalaemia: improving the investigation, management and therapeutic monitoring of hypokalaemic medical inpatients at a district general hospital [^2d2461ba]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Inadequate management of hypokalaemia is identified in 24% of hospitalised patients. Common complications associated with severe hypokalaemia include thirst (43%), paraesthesias (38%), muscle weakness (14%), and muscle cramps (7%). The incidence of ventricular fibrillation has also been found to be fivefold higher in patients with hypokalaemia than in patients with hyperkalaemia. As a potentially life threatening condition, quality care of patients with hypokalaemia is paramount. With patient safety concerns identified in our hospital, quality improvement of hypokalaemia management was necessary to guide staff professional development and improve patient outcomes.

Results

Results were initially collected four weeks post-intervention, which showed dramatic improvement (see table 1.0). A total of 30 patients were identified in this post-intervention group (10 males, 20 females). The same method of daily liaison with the biochemistry department to identify hypokalaemic patients was employed. There were 16/30 patients who qualified as mild hypokalaemia (3.1–3.4 mmol/L) and 14/30 with moderate hypokalaemia (2.5–3.0 mmol/L). No patients were identified with severe hypokalaemia (< 2.5 mmol/L). A frequent observation made during the pre-intervention audit was the absence of monitoring treatment with repeat U&Es, requesting an ECG and analysing serum magnesium levels. Although the analysis of serum magnesium levels did not show a significant improvement (8/30), it was promising to see greater awareness of other investigations associated with hypokalaemia, encouraging improved patient safety.

Identification of appropriate management options for different levels of hypokalaemia and administration of correct medication doses also showed improvement but, unfortunately, despite demonstrable improved understanding of hypokalaemia management options, medication reviews were largely unchanged between the groups.

The re-audit conducted after three months, starting from May 2014 also showed sustainable improvement. In total 60 sets of patients notes coded as 'hypokalaemia' were identified and retrospectively reviewed. We decided to use coded notes to gain a higher number of cases for analysis and a retrospective approach to ensure the junior doctor base was the same, as job changeovers were due to occur at the time of re-audit. This also helped limit bias towards positive results secondary to junior doctors reacting to our presence on the ward. Each case identified through coding was verified against lab results during the admission to ensure they met our criteria for hypokalaemia and to verify the accuracy of coding. The results are displayed in table 1.0 with the aim of demonstrating continued recognition, investigation, and appropriate management of hypokalaemia beyond the initial audit. It is hoped that sustainability of this programme will ultimately improve patient care and reduce harm.

### Hypokalemia / hyperkalemia and hyponatremia / hypernatremia [^bff37ea2]. Pediatrics in Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Electrolyte disorders are very common in the pediatric population. Derangements in serum sodium and potassium concentrations are among the most frequently seen given the risk factors and comorbidities unique to children. Pediatricians, in both outpatient and inpatient settings, should be comfortable with the evaluation and initial treatment of disturbances in these electrolyte concentrations. However, to evaluate and treat a child with abnormal serum concentrations of sodium or potassium, it is critical to understand the regulatory physiology that governs osmotic homeostasis and potassium regulation in the body. Comprehension of these basic physiologic processes will allow the provider to uncover the underlying pathology of these electrolyte disturbances and devise an appropriate and safe treatment plan.

### Hypokalaemia: improving the investigation, management and therapeutic monitoring of hypokalaemic medical inpatients at a district general hospital [^a7d45f7e]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Hypokalaemia is prevalent in 20% of hospitalised patients. Furthermore, inadequate management of hypokalemia was identified in 24% of these patients. Associated with significant patient morbidity and mortality, the identification, investigation, and treatment of hypokalaemia was identified as an area for improvement in the management of medical inpatients.

The project aims to measure the assessment, management, and therapeutic monitoring of medical inpatients with hypokalaemia in a district general hospital.

All medical inpatients over a one week period who met the criteria for hypokalaemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mmol/L on standard biochemical sample) were included in the audit. Patient's notes were located and evaluated to identify if they had mild, moderate, or severe hypokalaemia. Further data on ECG requests, repeat U&Es, serum magnesium analysis, treatment prescribed, and medication review dates was collated. A re-audit was completed after the introduction of a set of interventions which included a hypokalaemia treatment algorithm.

Pre-intervention analysis of all medical inpatients, who met our inclusion criteria for hypokalaemia, identified 32 patients. 25 of these patients met the criteria for mild hypokalaemia (3.1–3.4 mmol/L) and 7 met the criteria for moderate hypokalaemia (2.5–3.0 mmol/L). Only 7/32 (22%) patients were receiving adequate treatment based on trust guidelines.

Post intervention results showed marked improvement in the management of patients with hypokalaemia. A total of 30 patients were identified in this post-intervention group. There were 16/30 patients who qualified as mild hypokalaemia (3.1–3.4 mmol/L) and 14/30 with moderate hypokalaemia (2.5–3.0 mmol/L). 19/30 (63%) patients in the post-intervention group were correctly prescribed appropriate medication doses consistent with the treatment algorithm.

Following the initial success of the project, analysis at 3 months showed a positive trend for sustained improvement when compared to the pre-intervention results.

### Hypokalaemia: improving the investigation, management and therapeutic monitoring of hypokalaemic medical inpatients at a district general hospital [^a2194cf9]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

The requesting of an ECG prior to initiating treatment coupled with repeat U&Es for therapeutic monitoring of potassium levels appears to show a positive trend. ECGs were also signed to indicate that they had been reviewed in a timely fashion. Furthermore, it could be argued that not all patients with mild hypokalaemia require an ECG at diagnosis unless they are a high risk candidate for cardiac arrhythmias.

Although repeat U&Es were more frequently requested, a negative trend was observed for magnesium levels with only 25% noted to have magnesium 'added on' to biochemical tests indicating hypokalaemia. The reason for low rates of magnesium analysis is not altogether clear but it could be due to lack of education amongst junior doctors regarding the relationship between hypomagnesaemia and hypokalaemia.

The prescribing of appropriate medication doses for mild, moderate, and severe hypokalaemia shows a consistent pattern. Pleasingly, medication review dates have shown a positive trend after teaching sessions were delivered to allied healthcare professionals. We hypothesise that this improvement is likely to be due to the nurses and pharmacists challenging and encouraging junior doctors to consider highlighting treatment timelines.

Certainly pre-intervention baseline measurements on adherence to hypokalaemia guidelines were significant and suggested a strong correlation between inadequate patient management and absence of a treatment algorithm (p < 0.05). However, results from the post-intervention group imply a more random relationship between improvement in hypokalaemia management and the introduction of teaching sessions and new clinical guidelines (p > 0.05). The cause of this is unknown and despite these statistical findings, quality improvement in patient care has still been observed.

### A physiologic-based approach to the treatment of acute hyperkalemia [^a15d0b87]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common and potentially lethal disorder. Given its variable presentation, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease. The present case highlights key physiologic mechanisms in the development of hyperkalemia and provides an outline for emergent treatment. In this context, we discuss specific mechanisms of action of available treatments of hyperkalemia.

### Smarter documentation: measuring and improving the quality of progress notes written by hospitalists [^f052481e]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Progress notes written about hospitalized patients are suboptimal. Notes are bloated and awash with inaccuracies. Poor notes negatively impact patient care.

Objective

To design and assess a progress note scoring rubric and educational intervention aimed at improving the quality of progress notes.

Design

Randomized control educational trial.

Participants

Hospitalist physicians at a large academic medical center.

Intervention

Hospitalists were randomized to either a multi-pronged educational intervention or the control group.

Main Outcome Measure

A scoring rubric was developed to measure the quality of progress notes; validity evidence was established for the measure. This rubric was used by assessors (blinded to both group and pre/post periods) to evaluate progress notes. Notes were pulled from 6 months before and after the intervention period (n = 156 notes).

Key Results

Of the 26 participating hospitalists, 14 were randomized to the intervention. The two groups of hospitalists were similar in terms of age, gender, and clinical experience (all p > 0.05). Both groups had comparable notes at baseline (total score, 0.32 vs. 0.30, p = 0.59). After participating in the educational session, all 14 of the rubric items were higher in the intervention group-both compared to the control group and to their baseline/PRE notes-many changes reaching statistical significance. Total scores for the intervention group improved significantly (all p < 0.05). The instruments' total score and global rating of "how well the note would prepare the next provider to take over the care of the patient" were highly correlated-0.72. Note length was not extended by the intervention (p > 0.05).

Conclusions

This work established both an objective scoring rubric to assess the quality of progress notes and an efficient, impactful method for coaching hospitalists. For other groups striving to improve progress note quality, this study provides a blueprint for how they might proceed.

Inpatients

Inpatient specialist referral may be warranted for patients admitted with harmful drinking or alcohol‐dependence who are experiencing acute withdrawal or at high risk of this (Box 1). This includes urgent/emergency cases and patients admitted for planned detoxification. Close liaison aids early awareness of any potential issues but also facilitates assessment of community withdrawal success and guides the decision for further support.

Box 1
Clinical features of acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Adapted from

Alcohol withdrawal syndrome
Acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome describes a spectrum of clinical sequelae typically occurring after abrupt cessation of alcohol consumption in patients with chronic, harmful intake.
It has been attributed to impaired neurotransmitter regulation in the central nervous system, whereby chronically elevated cerebral ethanol concentrations decrease sensitivity to inhibitory gamma‐amino butyric acid (GABA) and interfere with glutamate receptor binding, causing compensatory upregulation of excitatory N‐methyl‐D‐Aspartate (NMDA) receptors. The sudden absence of ethanol in this context results in a pro‐excitatory imbalance that causes many of the observed symptoms and signs during withdrawal states.
Minor symptoms typically occur within 6 h and include insomnia; tremor; anxiety; gastrointestinal upset; headache; diaphoresis; and palpitations. More severe features, described below, may occur in some patients.

Withdrawal seizures and delirium tremens
Generalised tonic–clonic seizures may occur, most commonly in patients aged 40–50 years with prolonged harmful intake. Seizure activity is most common 12–48 h following cessation of alcohol intake.
If untreated, one third of alcoholic seizures may progress to delirium tremens, characterised by hypertension; tachycardia; confusion; hallucinations; agitation; and diaphoresis. It is distinct from isolated alcoholic hallucinations, which are not usually accompanied by confusion or deranged vital signs.
With appropriate recognition and management, the mortality from delirium tremens is now < 5%.

Metabolic abnormalities
Patients may be hypovolaemic and demonstrate a metabolic acidosis, frequently accompanied by electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalaemia; hypophosphataemia; and hypomagnesaemia.
Deranged metabolic findings in this group are often multifactorial and interrelated, and themselves may result in organ dysfunction and an increased risk of cardiac failure, arrhythmias, reduced seizure threshold and mortality.

### Edetate disodium, anhydrous (Endrate) [^82e7701b]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

After the infusion of edetate disodium, the
patient should remain in bed for a short time because of the possibility of
postural hypotension.

The possibility of an adverse
effect on myocardial contractility should be considered when administering
the drug to patients with heart disease. Caution is dictated in the use of
this drug in patients with limited cardiac reserve or incipient congestive
failure.

Edetate Disodium Injection, USP therapy should
be used with caution in patients with clinical or subclinical potassium deficiency
states. In such cases it is advisable to perform serum potassium blood levels
for possible hypokalemia and to monitor ECG changes.

The
possibility of hypomagnesemia should be kept in mind during prolonged therapy.

Treatment
with edetate disodium has been shown to cause a lowering of blood sugar and
insulin requirements in patients with diabetes who are treated with insulin.

Do
not use unless solution is clear and container is intact. Discard unused portion.

Laboratory Test

Renal excretory function should be assessed prior to treatment.
Periodic BUN and creatinine determinations and daily urinalysis should be
performed on patients receiving this drug.

Because of
the possibility of inducing an electrolyte imbalance during treatment with
edetate disodium, appropriate laboratory determinations and studies to evaluate
the status of cardiac function should be performed. Repetition of these tests
is recommended as often as clinically indicated, particularly in patients
with ventricular arrhythmia and those with a history of seizure disorders
or intracranial lesions. If clinical evidence suggests any disturbance of
liver function during treatment, appropriate laboratory determinations should
be performed and withdrawal of the drug may be required.

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

The oxalate method of determining serum calcium tends to
give low readings in the presence of edetate disodium; modification of this
method, as by acidifying the sample or use of a different method may be required
for accuracy. The least interference will be noted immediately before a subsequent
dose is administered.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:

Definitive statements cannot be made due to insufficient
data and conflicting information.

Pregnancy Category C.

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with
Edetate Disodium Injection. It is also not known whether Edetate Disodium
Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can
affect reproduction capacity. Edetate Disodium Injection should be given to
a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.

Nursing Mothers:

The safety of this product in nursing mothers has not been
established.

Pediatric Use:

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been
established.

Generally, mild hypokalemia is the most common potassium disorder seen clinically; however, severe complications can occur. Hyperkalemia is less common but more serious, especially if levels are rising rapidly. The etiologies and treatments for both hypo- and hyperkalemia are discussed, with special emphasis on the role medications play in the etiologies of each.

Hypokalemia is a frequent electrolyte abnormality that rarely requires more than oral supplementation to correct. We describe a case of profound hypokalemia and cardiac arrhythmia requiring unusually large amounts of "bolused" potassium to restore to normal sinus rhythm. Our patient presented with significant dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities after several days of emesis. Most alarming of these findings was a serum potassium level of 1.2 mEq/L. The electrocardiogram showed changes consistent with hypokalemia that rapidly degraded into pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Potassium chloride of 140 mEq was hand-pushed during the resuscitation with return of spontaneous rhythm. The patient was discharge 11 days later in his prearrest state.

### Management of severe hyperkalemia [^d6f4f757]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Hyperkalemia is one of the few potentially lethal electrolyte disturbances. Prompt recognition and expeditious treatment of severe hyperkalemia are expected to save lives. This review is intended to provide intensivists and other interested clinicians with an understanding of the pathophysiology that underlies hyperkalemia, and a rational approach to its management.

Methods

This article reviews and analyzes literature relevant to the pathophysiology and management of severe hyperkalemia. Methods include search of MEDLINE, and bibliographic search of current textbooks and journal articles.

Results and Conclusions

A more complete understanding of potassium homeostasis in recent years has led to new approaches to the management of severe hyperkalemia. The physiologically based sequential approach still applies. The efficacy, pitfalls, and risks of the agents available for use at each step in the sequence are critically reviewed. Rational use of the available tools will allow clinicians to successfully treat severe hyperkalemia.

### Severe hypokalemia in a patient with subarachnoid hemorrhage [^64fc3855]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia is a common electrolyte disorder in the intensive care unit. Its cause often is complex, involving both potassium losses from the body and shifts of potassium into cells. We present a case of severe hypokalemia of sudden onset in a patient being treated for subarachnoid hemorrhage in the surgical intensive care unit in order to illustrate the diagnosis and management of severe hypokalemia of unclear cause. Our patient received agents that promote renal potassium losses and treatments associated with a shift of potassium into cells. We outline the steps in diagnosis and management, focusing on the factors regulating the transcellular distribution of potassium in the body.

### A physiologic-based approach to the evaluation of a patient with hypokalemia [^e6d805e6]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia is a common electrolyte disorder. Transient causes of hypokalemia are due to cell shift, whereas sustained hypokalemia is caused by either inadequate intake or excessive potassium loss. Evaluation of the intake, distribution, and excretion of potassium should include the following: (1) a careful history, including use of drugs, medications, and the presence of vomiting or diarrhea; (2) physical examination, including orthostatic changes in blood pressure and heart rate; and (3) measurement of urine and plasma electrolytes. Urinary potassium wasting is caused by pathophysiologic conditions that couple increased distal sodium delivery with increased plasma aldosterone levels or aldosterone-like effects. If urinary potassium loss is identified, the next step is to determine whether the loss is caused by a primary increase in distal delivery of sodium or a primary increase in mineralocorticoid level. A primary increase in distal delivery should be associated with volume depletion, whereas a primary increase in mineralocorticoid level generally is associated with volume expansion and hypertension. In patients with a primary increase in mineralocorticoid activity, it is useful to measure plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone levels. Complications of hypokalemia include muscle weakness, rhabdomyolysis, cardiac arrhythmias, impaired urinary concentrating ability, and glucose intolerance.

### Management of severe hypokalemia in hospitalized patients… [^16e16a3c]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

The medical record review was considered the gold standard for assessing the adequacy of the clinical management of severe hypokalemia. The criteria for "appropriate management" included evidence for initiation or increase of potassium supplementation or initiation of potassium-sparing agents on the day of or day after the first episode of severe hypokalemia. Discontinuation of medication causing hypokalemia was not considered an adequate measure if not accompanied by potassium supplementation. There was a borderline association with department of admission, with the rate of performance being highest in the intensive care unit and in the internal medicine and pediatrics departments and lowest in the obstetrics and gynecology wards. No death occurred on the day that severe hypokalemia was initially recorded such that in every case an opportunity existed to remeasure the potassium level after an extreme low value.

The achievement of normokalemia was highest in the intensive care units and in the pediatrics department and lowest in the obstetrics and gynecology departments. Controlling for admission department and transfer between departments, the only variable found to be associated with achievement of normokalemia on logistic regression analysis was time to performance of the first subsequent test after the onset of severe hypokalemia. Polderman and colleagues4 found that inadequate steps were taken to prevent this abnormality even though there were early signs of its development. Correction was faster when patients were admitted with the condition, compared with those who developed it during their hospitalization.

In our study, computer-derived indicators, such as failure to perform a subsequent test and failure to achieve a normal serum potassium value, were highly associated with inadequate physician response and treatment, as derived from the medical record. Thus, they could easily serve as indicators for shortcomings in the quality of care. Computerized databases are increasingly being used to evaluate the quality of medical care. Pine and colleagues19 have recently shown that the addition of laboratory data, including serum potassium test results, to administrative data improves the ability to predict in-hospital mortality and between-hospital comparisons.

When laboratory values were combined with secondary diagnoses available on the administrative data set, they improved the prediction of mortality for 3 primary diagnoses such that additional clinical data obtained by data extraction from medical records contributed little to predictive power.

Seizure classification — provoked (acute symptomatic) versus unprovoked (including remote symptomatic) is defined with explicit time anchors and examples. An acute symptomatic seizure occurs "within 7 days" of an acute neurologic, systemic, metabolic, or toxic insult, whereas a remote symptomatic seizure results from a central nervous system (CNS) or systemic insult that occurred "more than 7 days in the past." Unprovoked seizures occur without acute precipitants and include remote symptomatic seizures, and epilepsy is defined as recurrent unprovoked seizures. Examples of provoked causes include electrolyte abnormalities, withdrawal, toxic ingestions, encephalitis, and CNS mass lesions, while unprovoked examples include idiopathic seizures and those attributed to prior stroke or traumatic brain injury.

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^e98ac58b]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

### How dangerous is hyperkalemia? [^f043ec85]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disorder appreciated with greater frequency in patients with renal disease, heart failure, and with use of certain medications such as renin angiotensin aldosterone inhibitors. The traditional views that hyperkalemia can be reliably diagnosed by electrocardiogram and that particular levels of hyperkalemia confer cardiotoxic risk have been challenged by several reports of patients with atypic presentations. Epidemiologic data demonstrate strong associations of morbidity and mortality in patients with hyperkalemia but these associations appear disconnected in certain patient populations and in differing clinical presentations. Physiologic adaptation, structural cardiac disease, medication use, and degree of concurrent illness might predispose certain patients presenting with hyperkalemia to a lower or higher threshold for toxicity. These factors are often overlooked; yet data suggest that the clinical context in which hyperkalemia develops is at least as important as the degree of hyperkalemia is in determining patient outcome. This review summarizes the clinical data linking hyperkalemia with poor outcomes and discusses how the efficacy of certain treatments might depend on the clinical presentation.

### Improving care for pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis [^55dfe721]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to create and implement recommendations from an evidence-based pathway for hospital management of pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and to sustain improvement. We hypothesized that development and utilization of standard work for inpatient care of DKA would lead to reduction in hypokalemia and improvement in outcome measures.

Methods

Development involved systematic review of published literature by a multidisciplinary team. Implementation included multidisciplinary feedback, hospital-wide education, daily team huddles, and development of computer decision support and electronic order sets.

Results

Pathway-based order sets forced clinical pathway adherence; yet, variations in care persisted, requiring ongoing iterative review and pathway tool adjustment. Quality improvement measures have identified barriers and informed subsequent adjustments to interventions. We compared 281 patients treated postimplementation with 172 treated preimplementation. Our most notable findings included the following: (1) monitoring of serum potassium concentrations identified unanticipated hypokalemia episodes, not recognized before standard work implementation, and earlier addition of potassium to fluids resulted in a notable reduction in hypokalemia; (2) improvements in insulin infusion management were associated with reduced duration of ICU stay; and (3) with overall improved DKA management and education, cerebral edema occurrence and bicarbonate use were reduced. We continue to convene quarterly meetings, review cases, and process ongoing issues with system-based elements of implementing the recommendations.

Conclusions

Our multidisciplinary development and implementation of an evidence-based pathway for DKA have led to overall improvements in care. We continue to monitor quality improvement metric measures to sustain clinical gains while continuing to identify iterative improvement opportunities.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of mildly symptomatic patients (acute setting), ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to ensure that the serum sodium concentration has been measured using the same technique used for the previous measurement and that no administrative errors in sample handling have occurred.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with seizures [^0541d14a]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Adult patients with a first-time seizure who have returned to baseline — laboratory evaluation is primarily guided by history and physical examination, and the literature suggests that laboratory testing is of very low yield in patients with a new-onset seizure who have returned to baseline. The history and physical examination will predict the majority of patients who will have a laboratory abnormality, and patients with altered mental status, fever, or a new local neurologic deficit require more extensive evaluation. Glucose abnormalities and hyponatremia are the most frequent abnormalities identified and are usually predicted by the history and physical examination. In 1 prospective study of 163 patients, 1 unexpected case of hypoglycemia was discovered, and in a prospective study of 136 patients, Turnbull et al found 4 cases of hypoglycemia and 4 cases of hyperglycemia. Two of the cases of hypoglycemia were not suspected on the basis of the history and physical examination. The diagnosis of an alcohol withdrawal seizure should be a diagnosis of exclusion, especially in patients presenting with a first-time seizure.

### Hypokalaemia: improving the investigation, management and therapeutic monitoring of hypokalaemic medical inpatients at a district general hospital [^8ff38a45]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Problem

High incidence of hypokalaemia was noted amongst acute medical inpatients during ward rounds at a 700 bed district general hospital. Although potassium replacement medication use was widespread, inconsistency in appropriate dosing, drug preparations, and the monitoring of treatment responses was evident.

With no local guidelines on the management of hypokalaemia, informal survey of the junior doctors highlighted uncertainty of appropriate investigation and management within our hospital. Consequently, haphazard potassium replacement regimes were in place leading to patient safety concerns, especially for inadequate management of dangerously low potassium values. Medication reviews to address potential causes for hypokalaemia were not routine and ECGs infrequently requested to assess for arrhythmic complications in moderate to severe hypokalaemia. Additionally, lack of serum blood monitoring and clear medication review dates increased the risk of patients remaining on potassium replacement beyond acceptable time frames, predisposing to hyperkalaemia.

Service evaluation and quality improvement was required to improve patient safety and standardise the treatment of hypokalaemia.

### Profound hypokalemia in diabetic ketoacidosis: a therapeutic challenge [^20410e79]. Endocrine Practice (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe profound hypokalemia in a comatose patient with diabetic ketoacidosis.

Methods

We present a case report, review the mechanisms for the occurrence of hypokalemia in diabetic ketoacidosis, and discuss its management in the setting of hyperglycemia and hyperosmolality.

Results

A 22-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus was admitted in a comatose state. Laboratory tests revealed a blood glucose level of 747 mg/dL, serum potassium of 1.9 mEq/L, pH of 6.8, and calculated effective serum osmolality of 320 mOsm/kg. She was intubated and resuscitated with intravenously administered fluids. Intravenous administration of vasopressors was necessary for stabilization of the blood pressure. Intravenous infusion of insulin was initiated to control the hyperglycemia, and repletion of total body potassium stores was undertaken. A total of 660 mEq of potassium was administered intravenously during the first 12.5 hours. Despite such aggressive initial repletion of potassium, the patient required 40 to 80 mEq of potassium daily for the next 8 days to increase the serum potassium concentration to normal.

Conclusion

Profound hypokalemia, an uncommon initial manifestation in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, is indicative of severe total body potassium deficiency. Under such circumstances, aggressive potassium repletion in a comatose patient must be undertaken during correction of other metabolic abnormalities, including hyperglycemia and hyperosmolality. Intravenously administered insulin should be withheld until the serum potassium concentration is (3)3.3 mEq/L.

### Hypokalaemia: improving the investigation, management and therapeutic monitoring of hypokalaemic medical inpatients at a district general hospital [^1cd7231d]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Design

It was obvious that improvement in the management of hypokalaemia was necessary. There were two important factors highlighted during the audit. One was the lack of an available trust guideline on the management of hypokalaemia coupled with the lack of understanding of appropriate medication doses for mild, moderate, and severe deficiencies. Review of guidelines for the management of hypokalaemia in adults available at other NHS trusts helped guide creation of a suitable treatment algorithm and designation of an appropriate review date (3 years).

Second was the understanding of the appropriate investigations to order when a diagnosis of hypokalaemia is confirmed and also the importance of monitoring the effect of treatment on serum potassium levels. This also includes clarifying a date for review of newly started medications. To target the above problems, the following solutions were implemented:
Design of an approved trust guideline on the management of hypokalaemia
Hypokalaemia management posters to display on all inpatient medical wards
Teaching sessions for junior doctors on the recognition, investigation, and management of hypokalaemia
Teaching sessions for nurses on the recognition, investigation, monitoring, and complications of hypokalaemia
Development of an easy to follow hypokalaemia pathway/flow-chart
Inform medical teams about the introduction of a hypokalaemia pathway and results of pre-intervention audit

In order to make the program sustainable, management protocol would have to be approved by the trust and incorporated into local hospital guidelines. These guidelines should be available on the hospital intranet to facilitate ease of access and healthcare professionals should be informed on their location. Alongside, junior doctors and nurses should have continuing education on the management of hypokalaemia. The aim of the audit was to introduce such guidelines and create an informative educational programme and platform for sustainable clinical improvement.

### Effect of a computerized alert on the management of hypokalemia in hospitalized patients… [^e8180c21]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

Table 2 presents the outcome variables comparing hospitalizations before and after the intervention. For all outcomes, there was improvement in the management of hypokalemia after the intervention, but the change was statistically significant only for achievement of normokalemia. A significant interaction was observed between the intervention and the time of onset of hypokalemia. After the intervention, there was an odds reduction of 82% in the nonmeasurement of serum potassium levels after an initial low result in patients whose level on the day of admission was below 3. 0 mEq/L, as opposed to those who developed severe hypokalemia during their hospitalization. There were no other significant interactions. A flowchart showing the outcomes of all study subjects is shown in Figure 1.

This study demonstrates that modest improvements in the management of a severe electrolyte disturbance in hospitalized patients can be achieved using a simple computerized alert. The intervention was associated with an increase in the proportion of patients whose serum potassium levels were corrected during their hospitalization, as well as an improvement in the proportion of patients with severe hypokalemia who left the hospital with normal serum potassium values. Patients who presented to the hospital with severe hypokalemia were also more likely to have their serum potassium levels remeasured after the intervention. Our study had some limitations. Because data collection after the intervention was for 6 months only, it is possible that our study had insufficient power to detect a significant effect of the intervention on remeasurement of serum potassium levels and hospital discharge with normokalemia.

However, if we combine the results of the baseline analysis in 1997 and data from the 6 months before the intervention, a statistically significant improvement after the intervention in the rate of discharge with subnormal serum potassium values was achieved. The use of computerized alerts has been shown to increase the proportion of patients with electrolyte abnormalities receiving appropriate care, decrease the time spent in a life-threatening situation, and reduce the length of hospitalization. 5 Computerized alerts regarding rising serum creatinine levels among patients receiving nephrotoxic drugs resulted in a significant decrease in the risk.

### Impact of protocolized diuresis for de-resuscitation in the intensive care unit [^1d1e3143]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Regarding ventilator days, ventilation wean procedures are not standardized at this institution. Daily spontaneous breathing trials are performed in all patients who meet criteria; however, extubation orders are left to provider discretion. This lack of ventilator wean protocolization may have affected ventilator-free days between groups. However, reintubation rates were in alignment with previous studies with ranges 13.8–22.6% and were not significantly different between groups which supports relative uniformity on wean strategies.

Further of note, changes to the institutional nursing-driven electrolyte replacement protocol occurred mid-implementation (see Additional file 1). The protocol modification sought more aggressive potassium replacement; however, nursing adherence was not evaluated. As follow-up potassium evaluations were mandated with protocol implementation, it is possible that incidences of hypokalemia were increased secondary to more frequent monitoring relative to the historical cohort; however, frequency of serum potassium collections were not recorded. In regard to rates of hypernatremia, providers were permitted to request continuation of furosemide despite elevated sodium levels, likely resulting in the subsequent increased rate of metolazone use in the intervention group. There was a significant difference in cumulative fluid balance that was likely due to higher furosemide exposure in the intervention group, as demonstrated in previous protocols of furosemide in acute kidney injury. The significant increase in episodes of hypernatremia and hypokalemia are predictable and reversible within this strategy. If replicated in future randomized trials, improvements in ICU length of stay and mortality may take precedence over concern for electrolyte abnormalities. Future protocol designs should account for these episodes of hypernatremia and hypokalemia with creation of more explicit electrolyte replacement rules. Further, electrolyte derangements may be of greater consideration in an alternative ICU population, including cardiothoracic/cardiology critical care. Patient-specific factors should be taken into consideration with implementation of this protocol.

### Hypokalaemia: addressing human factors and improving education around prescription and administration of intravenous (IV) potassium infusion in trauma and orthopaedics [^c8f217aa]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

The normal range of plasma potassium is 3.5 −5.0 mmol/l. Hypokalaemia is defined as a serum potassium < 3.5 mmol/l. Severe hypokalaemia is defined as a K+ < 2.5 mmol/l.

Hypokalaemia is one of the most common electrolyte abnormalities and has an incidence of 17–20% in hospitalised patients. Hypokalaemia is most frequently asymptomatic and identified on routine screening. Mild to moderate hypokalaemia if ignored may progress to life threatening severe hypokalaemia. Literature shows severe hypokalaemia is associated with potential life threatening complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, paralysis, rhabdomyolysis, diaphragmatic weakness resulting in cardiac or respiratory arrests.

Causes of hypokalaemia include drugs such as diuretics, laxatives or steroids, gastrointestinal loss such as diarrhoea, renal loss such as renal tubular disorders or diabetes insipidus, endocrine disorders such as Cushing's syndrome, metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesaemia, poor dietary intake and treatment strategies used for hyperkalaemia.

### Potassium chloride, dextrose monohydrate (potassium chloride) [^d2d09a82]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.4 Hyponatremia

Potassium Chloride in 5% Dextrose Injection is an isotonic solution [see Description, Table 1 (11)]. In the body, however, glucose containing fluids can become extremely physiologically hypotonic due to rapid glucose metabolization. Monitoring of serum sodium is particularly important for hypotonic fluids.

Depending on the tonicity of the solution, the volume and rate of infusion, and depending on a patient's underlying clinical condition and capability to metabolize glucose, intravenous administration of glucose can cause electrolyte disturbances, most importantly hypo- or hyperosmotic hyponatremia.

The risk for hyponatremia is increased, in pediatric patients, elderly patients, postoperative patients, those with psychogenic polydipsia and in patients treated with medications that increase the risk of hyponatremia (such as certain diuretic, antiepileptic and psychotropic medications). Close clinical monitoring may be warranted.

Acute hyponatremia can lead to acute hyponatremic encephalopathy characterized by headache, nausea, seizures, lethargy and vomiting. Patients with brain edema are at particular risk of severe, irreversible and life-threatening brain injury. Patients at increased risk for developing complications of hyponatremia, such as hyponatremic encephalopathy include pediatric patients; women, in particular, premenopausal women; patients with hypoxemia; and in patients with underlying central nervous system disease [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)].

Rapid correction of hyponatremia is potentially dangerous with risk of serious neurologic complications such as osmotic demyelination syndrome with risk of seizures and cerebral edema. To avoid complications, monitor serum sodium and chloride concentrations, fluid status, acid-base balance, and signs of neurologic complications.

High volume infusion must be used with close monitoring in patients with cardiac or pulmonary failure, and in patients with non-osmotic vasopressin release (including SIADH), due to the risk of hospital-acquired hyponatremia.

5.5 Hypokalemia

Infusion of Potassium Chloride in 5% Dextrose Injection may result in hypokalemia, leading to arrhythmias, muscle weakness, paralysis, heart block, and rhabdomyolysis.

Hypokalemic periodic paralysis, metabolic alkalosis, increased gastrointestinal losses (e.g., diarrhea, vomiting), prolonged low potassium diet or primary hyperaldosteronism may increase the risk of hypokalemia. If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum potassium levels.

### ASPEN consensus recommendations for refeeding syndrome [^41260b76]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2020). High credibility.

ASPEN consensus — electrolyte management during refeeding in at-risk adults — advises to "Check serum potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus before initiation of nutrition" and to "Monitor every 12 hours for the first 3 days in high-risk patients. May be more frequent based on clinical picture." It directs to "Replete low electrolytes based on established standards of care" and notes "No recommendation can be made for whether prophylactic dosing of electrolytes should be given if prefeeding levels are normal." If electrolytes "become difficult to correct or drop precipitously during the initiation of nutrition," it advises to "decrease calories/grams of dextrose by 50% and advance the dextrose/calories by approximately 33% of goal every 1–2 days based on clinical presentation," with the caveat that "cessation of nutrition support may be necessary when electrolyte levels are severely and/or life-threateningly low or dropping precipitously."

### A physiologic-based approach to the evaluation of a patient with hyperkalemia [^8dde366d]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia generally is attributable to cell shifts or abnormal renal potassium excretion. Cell shifts account for transient increases in serum potassium levels, whereas sustained hyperkalemia generally is caused by decreased renal potassium excretion. Impaired renal potassium excretion can be caused by a primary decrease in distal sodium delivery, a primary decrease in mineralocorticoid level or activity, or abnormal cortical collecting duct function. Excessive potassium intake is an infrequent cause of hyperkalemia by itself, but can worsen the severity of hyperkalemia when renal excretion is impaired. Before concluding that a cell shift or renal defect in potassium excretion is present, pseudohyperkalemia should be excluded.

### Electrolyte disturbances in the intensive care unit [^63a7310c]. Seminars in Dialysis (2006). Low credibility.

The development of many electrolyte disturbances in the ICU can be prevented by attention to the use of intravenous fluids and nutrition. Hyponatremia is a relative contraindication to the use of hypotonic intravenous fluids and hypernatremia calls for the administration of water. Formulae have been devised to guide the therapy of severe hyponatremia and hypernatremia. All formulae regard the patient as a closed system, and none takes into account ongoing fluid losses that are highly variable between patients. Thus, therapy of severe hyponatremia and hypernatremia must be closely monitored with serial electrolyte measurements. The significance of hypocalcemia in the critically ill is controversial. Hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia should be corrected.
