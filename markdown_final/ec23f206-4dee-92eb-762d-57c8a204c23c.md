## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a 50-word explanation of the classic symptoms of diabetes mellitus and their diagnostic significance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which symptoms are truly classic and most predictive. Then, I should verify the diagnostic thresholds and when symptoms alone suffice. Next, I will consider age-related nuances and when to suspect type 1 versus type 2. Finally, I should confirm the need for confirmatory testing and cite the highest-quality sources to keep this concise and accurate.

> Let me first confirm the classic triad: polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss are the hallmark symptoms that, when present with hyperglycemia, strongly suggest diabetes mellitus and warrant prompt evaluation and treatment, especially if accompanied by fatigue or blurred vision [^5eb155a8] [^f2f336e8].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic threshold tied to symptoms: a random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) in the presence of classic symptoms confirms diabetes and does not require a second test, whereas in the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, two abnormal results from different tests or the same test on separate days are needed for confirmation [^5eb155a8] [^927c9798].

> I need to check age-related patterns next: in children and adolescents, the classic triad is common at presentation, and the presence of symptoms plus random glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL supports diagnosis. In older adults, symptoms may be subtle or atypical due to higher renal thresholds and blunted thirst, so clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion when polyuria or polydipsia are reported [^7da9e471] [^e900f2ab].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about type: in children, the abrupt onset of polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss with marked hyperglycemia raises concern for type 1 diabetes and the risk of DKA, so urgent insulin and metabolic stabilization are indicated. In adults, a more gradual course suggests type 2, but overlap exists and autoantibody testing can help when the phenotype is unclear [^f2f336e8] [^497960d9].

> I should double-check the principle of confirmation: even when symptoms are compelling, if there is no unequivocal hyperglycemia, repeat testing with FPG, A1C, or OGTT is required to establish the diagnosis reliably and avoid misclassification or transient hyperglycemia errors [^5eb155a8] [^bbf43d9f].

> In summary, the classic symptoms of diabetes mellitus are polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss. When these coexist with a random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL, diabetes is diagnosed and treatment should begin, with confirmatory testing pursued when presentation is equivocal or to distinguish type 1 from type 2 diabetes [^5eb155a8] [^f2f336e8].

Polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss are the **classic triad** of diabetes mellitus, reflecting osmotic diuresis, dehydration, and catabolism from insulin deficiency or resistance [^b6c18ff8]. These symptoms, especially when acute, should prompt **immediate glucose testing** [^5eb155a8] and consideration of diabetic ketoacidosis [^34c57fa9]. In children, enuresis and fatigue are common; in older adults, symptoms may be subtle or absent [^e900f2ab]. Recognizing this triad enables early diagnosis and prevents complications [^5a706558].

---

## Pathophysiology of classic symptoms

### Polyuria (frequent urination)

Polyuria results from **osmotic diuresis**: when blood glucose exceeds the renal threshold (~180 mg/dL), glucose is excreted in urine, drawing water and causing large-volume, dilute urine [^notfound]. This leads to **dehydration** and compensatory polydipsia [^b6c18ff8].

---

### Polydipsia (excessive thirst)

Polydipsia arises from **dehydration** due to polyuria, triggering thirst and increased fluid intake [^b6c18ff8]. Hyperglycemia also increases plasma osmolality, further stimulating thirst [^notfound].

---

### Weight loss (unintentional)

Weight loss reflects **caloric loss** from glycosuria and **catabolism** from insulin deficiency or resistance, which increases lipolysis and protein breakdown [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance of classic symptoms

These symptoms are **highly specific** for diabetes and strongly suggest it when present with hyperglycemia [^5eb155a8]. Their presence warrants **prompt testing** — fasting plasma glucose, random plasma glucose, A1C, or oral glucose tolerance testing — to confirm the diagnosis and guide therapy [^927c9798].

---

## Variations in symptom presentation

### Age-related differences

- **Children**: polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss are common; enuresis and fatigue are frequent [^7da9e471].
- **Adults**: symptoms may be less pronounced or attributed to other causes, delaying diagnosis [^e900f2ab].
- **Elderly**: symptoms may be subtle or absent due to altered renal thresholds and reduced thirst sensation [^e900f2ab].

---

### Type 1 vs. type 2 diabetes

Type 1 diabetes typically presents acutely with **marked hyperglycemia**, polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, and risk of ketoacidosis [^f2f336e8]. Type 2 diabetes often has a more **insidious onset**, with milder or intermittent symptoms and frequent detection during routine screening [^b6c18ff8].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and clinical guidelines

According to the ADA, diabetes can be diagnosed by any of the following; in the presence of classic symptoms, a **random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL** suffices and does not require confirmation [^5eb155a8]:

| **Test** | **Diagnostic threshold** |
|-|-|
| Hemoglobin A1C (A1C) | ≥ 6.5% |
| Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) | ≥ 126 mg/dL |
| 2-hour plasma glucose during OGTT | ≥ 200 mg/dL |
| Random plasma glucose | ≥ 200 mg/dL with classic symptoms |

---

## Clinical implications and management

Recognizing these symptoms enables **early diagnosis**, reducing the risk of acute complications (e.g. DKA, HHS) and chronic microvascular/macrovascular disease [^5a706558]. Initial management includes confirming the diagnosis, classifying diabetes type, initiating appropriate therapy, and educating patients on symptom recognition and self-monitoring [^5eb155a8].

---

Polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss are the **hallmark symptoms** of diabetes mellitus, reflecting osmotic diuresis, dehydration, and catabolism. Their presence should trigger prompt glucose testing and confirmation of diabetes to enable early treatment and prevent complications [^5eb155a8].

Special considerations/patients

In the setting of severely uncontrolled diabetes with catabolism, defined as fasting plasma glucose levels > 13.9 mmol/l (250 mg/dl), random glucose levels consistently above 16.7 mmol/l (300 mg/dl), A1C above 10%, or the presence of ketonuria, or as symptomatic diabetes with polyuria, polydipsia and weight loss, insulin therapy in combination with lifestyle intervention is the treatment of choice. Some patients with these characteristics will have unrecognized type 1 diabetes; others will have type 2 diabetes with severe insulin deficiency. Insulin can be titrated rapidly and is associated with the greatest likelihood of returning glucose levels rapidly to target levels. After symptoms are relieved and glucose levels decreased, oral agents can often be added and it may be possible to withdraw insulin, if preferred.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^f2f336e8]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Classification of diabetes — Recommendation 2.5 and distinguishing features: Recommendation 2.5 states to classify people with hyperglycemia into appropriate diagnostic categories to aid in personalized management (E). The classification encompasses 1) Type 1 diabetes (due to autoimmune β-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency, including latent autoimmune diabetes in adults); 2) Type 2 diabetes (due to a nonautoimmune progressive loss of adequate β-cell insulin secretion, frequently on the background of insulin resistance); 3) Specific types of diabetes due to other causes (e.g., monogenic diabetes syndromes, diseases of the exocrine pancreas, and drug- or chemical-induced diabetes); and 4) Gestational diabetes mellitus. People with type 1 diabetes often present with polyuria/polydipsia, and approximately half present with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Features most useful for determining type 1 diabetes include younger age at diagnosis (< 35 years) with lower BMI (< 25 kg/m2), unintentional weight loss, ketoacidosis, and plasma glucose > 360 mg/dL (> 20 mmol/L) at presentation.

Current Criteria for the Diagnosis of Diabetes

Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥ 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l). Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 h
Symptoms of hyperglycemia and a casual (random) plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l). Casual (random) is defined as any time of day without regard to time since last meal. The classic symptoms of hyperglycemia include polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss.
2-h plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The test should be performed as described by the World Health Organization, using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water.

Classification and Diagnosis

Type 1 diabetes has traditionally been diagnosed based on clinical catabolic symptoms suggestive of insulin deficiency: polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, and marked hyperglycemia that is nonresponsive to oral agents. It is classified as an autoimmune disease with progressive β-cell destruction, resulting in a physiological dependence on exogenous insulin. Recent studies have broadened our understanding of the disease, but have made diagnosis more complex.

There is tremendous variability in the initial presentation of type 1 diabetes in both youth and adults. Children often present acutely, with severe symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and ketonemia. However, in adults, type 1 diabetes presents with a more gradual onset, with a clinical presentation that may initially appear consistent with type 2 diabetes. Distinguishing between type 1 and type 2 diabetes presents diagnostic challenges. Traditionally, progressive β-cell destruction has been the hallmark of type 1 diabetes, but residual C-peptide (a surrogate marker for insulin secretion) may be detected over 40 years after initial diagnosis, regardless of whether the initial diagnosis was made in childhood or in adulthood.

Clinical Clues

Much of the diagnosis will depend on clinical clues, but the rising incidence of overweight/obesity has also confounded the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. A lean individual presenting with clinical symptoms without a first-degree relative with diabetes (but often with a history of distant relatives with type 1 diabetes or other autoimmune disease) is generally suggestive of type 1 diabetes. An overweight individual (of any age) with metabolic syndrome and a strong family history of type 2 diabetes may be assessed only for the development of type 2 diabetes, even though type 1 diabetes is on the differential diagnosis. Obesity does not preclude that autoimmunity and hyperglycemia will occur even amid the relatively higher levels of endogenous insulin secretion observed in obesity. In young patients aged 10–17 years with phenotypic type 2 diabetes, 10% have evidence of islet autoimmunity suggesting that type 1 diabetes was the likely diagnosis. Thus, although leaner individuals are more likely to be diagnosed as having type 1 diabetes, the potential for type 1 diabetes exists in those who phenotypically appear to have type 2 diabetes. If hyperglycemia persists after treatment with noninsulin agents, which is unusual in the treatment of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, then type 1 diabetes should be considered.

### Type 2 diabetes mellitus in children [^20d7cc4e]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents has increased worldwide over the past three decades. This increase has coincided with the obesity epidemic, and minority groups are disproportionately affected. The American Diabetes Association recommends screening for type 2 diabetes beginning at 10 years of age or the onset of puberty in children who are overweight or obese and have two additional risk factors. Diagnostic criteria include a fasting blood glucose level of 126 mg per dL or greater, a two-hour plasma glucose level of 200 mg per dL or greater during an oral glucose tolerance test, an A1C level of 6.5% or more, or a random plasma glucose level of 200 mg per dL or greater plus symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, or unintentional weight loss. Management should be focused on a multidisciplinary, family-centered approach. Nutrition and exercise counseling should be started at the time of diagnosis and as a part of ongoing management. Metformin is the first-line therapy in conjunction with lifestyle changes. Insulin therapy should be initiated if there are signs of ketosis or ketoacidosis, or if the patient has significant hyperglycemia (A1C greater than 9% or a random plasma glucose level of 250 mg per dL or greater).

### International expert committee report on the role of the A1c assay in the diagnosis of diabetes [^09f9e67b]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

What are the practical issues related to A1C testing?

A1C tests to diagnose diabetes should be performed using clinical laboratory equipment. Point-of-care instruments have not yet been shown to be sufficiently accurate or precise for diagnosing diabetes. Although this International Expert Committee has concluded that the attributes of the A1C assay with regard to diagnosing diabetes and detecting individuals at high risk support its use over the FPG or 2HPG tests, the superiority of A1C testing does not invalidate the diagnostic criteria based on glucose testing. In circumstances when A1C testing cannot be performed, the diagnostic glucose tests are acceptable alternatives.

Whichever of the three different tests now available to diagnose diabetes (A1C, FPG, and 2HPG) is used, both initial and confirmatory testing should be performed with the same test. As the three tests are not completely concordant, using different tests could easily lead to confusion. The only exception to the need to confirm the diagnosis of diabetes with the same test would be the presence of clinical symptoms characteristic of diabetes and glucose levels > 200 mg/dl (> 11.1 mmol/l). Confirmatory testing is also not required to establish risk status in individuals identified as in the highest-risk group for diabetes (A1C of 6.0 to < 6.5%).

Most cases of type 1 diabetes, particularly in children and adolescents, are diagnosed by the classical symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, unexplained weight loss, and a casual glucose > 200 mg/dl. If diabetes is suspected in the absence of those conditions, A1C testing is warranted.

### Monogenic diabetes: a new pathogenic variant of HNF1A gene [^628eec15]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

HNF1A-MODY is the most common form of monogenic diabetes that leads to familial symptomatic diabetes and the most probable clinical diagnosis to be considered in families with autosomal dominant symptomatic diabetes. In earlier stages of the disease, often evident during adolescence or early adulthood, the fasting blood glucose may be normal, but patients tend to show a large increment in blood glucose (> 80 mg/dL) after meals or at 2 hours during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and glucose intolerance. Patients with HNF1A-MODY typically have low renal threshold for glucose reabsorption due to impaired renal tubular transport of glucose and may present postprandial glycosuria, before developing significant hyperglycemia. In later stages, the patient develops osmotic symptoms such as polydipsia or polyuria, and fasting hyperglycemia appears, but ketosis is not frequent, since some residual insulin secretion is maintained for several years. The occurrence of microvascular and macrovascular complications depends on metabolic control, similar to type 1 and 2 DM.

As described before, one of the biggest diagnostic challenges is to differentiate between MODY from type 1 and 2 diabetes, as clinical features might be similar and due to a frequent overlap between phenotypes. Genetic testing is crucial to define the aetiology, allowing appropriate and individualised care, accurate prognosis, predict complications and adequate family counselling.

### Is it time to take a different approach to screening people at high risk for type 1 diabetes? [^50148fe5]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

It is generally believed that the onset of type 2 diabetes can be insidious and evade detection for prolonged time periods. Type 1 diabetes, however, often displays a sudden clinical onset due to the development of insufficient insulin secretory capacity following a pre-diabetic period characterized by the presence of pancreatic islet autoantibodies. Type 1 diabetes usually presents with symptoms, the most frequent being polyuria and polydipsia (97%) and weight loss (46%) in one recent study of newly diagnosed patients.

The article by Triolo et al. in this issue of Diabetes Care, addresses the period in the development of type 1 diabetes between the onset of hyperglycemia that meets diagnostic criteria for diabetes and its clinical presentation. Triolo et al. present evidence that the onset of type 1 diabetes can occur without clinical symptoms and be difficult to detect with the current approach to diagnosis, which is based on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) measurement. These conclusions are based on the results of semiannual oral glucose tolerance tests for diabetes diagnosis among the Diabetes Prevention Trial–Type 1 (DPT-1) participants. The occurrence of asymptomatic type 1 diabetes in the DPT-1 population has been previously reported. The important additional findings are the value of A1C in the detection of diabetes and the comparatively low occurrence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at diagnosis of diabetes. The authors conclude by advising that "high-risk relatives may benefit from close attention or screening in order to prevent DKA at diagnosis".

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^e6065b16]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus — the rate of beta-cell destruction varies, and presentations include individuals who develop ketoacidosis as the first manifestation or others with modest fasting hyperglycemia that can change rapidly to severe hyperglycemia and/or ketoacidosis because of infection or other stress. Some people retain sufficient residual beta-cell function to prevent ketoacidosis for many years but eventually become dependent on insulin for survival; in the later stage of the disease, there is little or no insulin secretion, and persons tend to be acutely symptomatic at onset, often complaining of polydipsia, polyphagia, polyuria, unexplained weight loss, dry mouth, or blurred vision.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^8a052792]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

American Optometric Association — ADA diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus include A1C ≥ 6.5 percent performed using a method that "should be performed using a method that is certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program and standardized to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial assay (point-of-care A1C assays are not sufficiently accurate to use for diagnostic purposes)"; fasting plasma glucose level ≥ 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L), with "Fasting… defined as no caloric intake for at least eight hours"; two-hour plasma glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) where "The test should be performed as described by the World Health Organization using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75-g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water"; or random plasma glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) "in a person with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia (polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss) or hyperglycemic crisis", with "Random… defined as any time of the day without regard to time since the last meal". In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, "these results should be confirmed by repeat testing".

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^6290ce21]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Symptom-triggered testing for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) states that testing for T2DM should always be performed if there is suspicion of hyperglycemia in a patient with symptoms and signs of hyperglycemia, such as new onset thirst (polydipsia), frequent urination (polyuria) or new onset bedwetting, excessive hunger and eating (polyphagia), blurred vision, unexplained or unexpected weight loss, or fatigue.

### Performance of HbA1c as an early diagnostic indicator of type 1 diabetes in children and youth [^a5807043]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Elevated HbA 1c has been proposed by the joint American Diabetes Association (ADA), International Diabetes Federation, and European Association for the Study of Diabetes International Expert Committee (IEC) as an alternative criterion for the diagnosis of diabetes. HbA 1c reflects a 90-day moving average of blood glucose concentrations, weighted more heavily toward the last 30 days, and may be more stable in the presence of significant day-to-day glycemic variation. The recommended thresholds are ≥ 5.7% for impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and ≥ 6.5% for diagnosis of diabetes on two tests. These thresholds were established based on research conducted in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who demonstrated significant correlations with HbA 1c ≥ 6.5% and higher prevalence of retinopathy and nephropathy. While recent research has substantiated rising HbA 1c as a predictor of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in both young (age < 15 years) and adult (median age > 50 years) populations, data demonstrating appropriate HbA 1c thresholds for diagnosing T1D are lacking.

In > 50% of children, diagnosis is made when characteristic symptoms (polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss) are associated with elevated blood glucose. The most widely used screening test in children is random plasma glucose (RPG) with characteristic symptoms, diagnostic if ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) and confirmed in a laboratory. Asymptomatic cases are rare and usually picked up on screening of urine (glucosuria or ketonuria) or blood (hyperglycemia) or among subjects known to be positive for islet autoantibodies. In these cases, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) are recommended and diagnostic if abnormal on two separate days. It is in these individuals that HbA 1c has gained appeal as a potential diagnostic indicator that would preclude the need for fasting tests and provide diagnostic data.

Although there are many proponents for including HbA 1c as an alternative criterion for diagnosing diabetes, full consensus has not yet been achieved. Most studies evaluating HbA 1c against the gold standard of the OGTT were carried out in subjects at increased risk for T2D. In contrast, few studies have assessed the sensitivity and specificity of HbA 1c in children and adolescents: the age-group with the highest incidence of T1D.

The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of HbA 1c as an alternative criterion in diagnosing IGT and T1D in high-risk subjects < 21 years of age.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis: evaluation and treatment [^34c57fa9]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of type 1 and type 2 diabetes resulting from an absolute or relative insulin deficiency. It can occur in patients of all ages and can be the initial presentation of diabetes, especially in young children. Polyuria and polydipsia are the most common symptoms, followed by nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss, severe fatigue, dyspnea, and preceding febrile illness. Traditionally, DKA has been diagnosed by the triad of hyperglycemia (blood glucose greater than 250 mg/dL), metabolic acidosis (pH less than 7.3, serum bicarbonate less than 18 mEq/L, anion gap greater than 10 mEq/L), and elevated serum (preferred) or urine ketones. However, hyperglycemia has been de-emphasized in recent guidelines because of the increasing incidence of euglycemic DKA. The use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors modestly increases the risk of DKA and euglycemic DKA. Electrolytes, phosphate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, urinalysis, complete blood cell count with differential, A1C, and electrocardiography should be evaluated for all patients diagnosed with DKA to identify causes and complications of DKA. Amylase, lipase, hepatic transaminase levels, troponin, creatine kinase, blood and urine cultures, and chest radiography are additional tests to consider. Treatment involves fluid and electrolyte replacement, insulin, treatment of precipitating causes, and close monitoring to adjust therapy and identify complications. Prevention strategies include identifying diabetes before DKA develops, educating patients to manage high-risk situations, and ensuring uninterrupted access to therapies for diabetes.

### Children and adolescents: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^497960d9]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Children and adolescents — initial pharmacologic management of type 2 diabetes: In individuals with incidentally diagnosed or metabolically stable diabetes (A1C < 8.5% [< 69 mmol/mol] and asymptomatic), metformin is the initial pharmacologic treatment of choice if kidney function is normal (A). Youth with marked hyperglycemia (blood glucose ≥ 250 mg/dL [≥ 13.9 mmol/L] A1C ≥ 8.5% [≥ 69 mmol/mol]) without acidosis at diagnosis who are symptomatic with polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia, and/or weight loss should be treated initially with long-acting insulin while metformin is initiated and titrated (B). Initiate subcutaneous or intravenous insulin treatment in individuals with ketoacidosis to rapidly correct the hyperglycemia and the metabolic derangement, and once acidosis is resolved, metformin should be initiated while subcutaneous insulin therapy is continued (A). In individuals presenting with severe hyperglycemia (blood glucose ≥ 600 mg/dL [≥ 33.3 mmol/L]), consider assessment for hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (A).

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^1771b915]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

ASCO guideline update — Evaluation and initial management of suspected checkpoint inhibitor–associated diabetes mellitus (CIADM) emphasizes vigilance for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and timely workup. The acute risks of DKA from autoimmune beta-cell destruction require vigilance, and new-onset hyperglycemia in a patient with high risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus should raise the level of concern for CIADM. Acute onset of polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, and lethargy should be evaluated without delay; urine ketones, acid base status, and electrolytes can be evaluated as screening for DKA and the need for inpatient evaluation. Antibodies, insulin, and C-peptide levels should also be sent to support diagnosis, although the initiation of therapy should not be delayed pending results; insulin should be used to treat hyperglycemia in anyone where the diagnosis is in question. Endocrinology consultation is appropriate even without evidence of DKA, and when outpatient endocrinology consultation is not readily available, hospitalization is appropriate. At this time, no immunosuppressive strategies are approved to treat type 1 diabetes and by extension are not considered to be indicated in CIADM.

### Type 1 diabetes mellitus diagnosis in young adult preceded by years of elevated postprandial and fasting glucose but normal HbA1c: a clinical example of discordance [^c9ea0933]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Herein, a case study of an individual with fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and postprandial blood glucose (PBG) measures from the 3 years preceding their type 1 diabetes mellitus diagnosis is used to highlight discordance among these common diagnostic tests. Data from the patient's own records, participation in clinical research, and healthcare provider were collated. Measures of FBG (90–160 mg/dL) and PBG (195–247 mg/dL) were elevated for 3 years with a normal HbA1c (5.0–5.4%) and without any symptoms. Overt symptoms, including polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss, manifested 3 years later prompting the patient to contact their physician. Testing revealed an elevated HbA1c (9.8%) and presence of glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies (GAD) (9 IU/mL). Daily body composition measures and weighed food logs from the 3 months preceding and 4 months after diagnosis illustrate the effects of glucose spilling and inadequate insulin levels. Both FBG and PBG indicated diabetes 3 years prior to HbA1c. While FBG, PBG, and HbA1c are considered equally appropriate for screening and diagnosing diabetes, this case study highlights the need to revisit important distinctions between these tests that explain their frequent discordance.

### Management of type 2 diabetes in older people [^e900f2ab]. Diabetes Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical Presentation

Diabetes can be asymptomatic in up to 50% of older people. However, when symptoms are present they are nonspecific and can be attributed to aging. Nonspecific symptoms, such as being generally unwell, fatigued, or lethargic, are common manifestations of diabetes in old age. Geriatric syndromes may be the first manifestation of diabetes, such as falls and urinary incontinence. Symptoms could also be atypical, such as anorexia, rather than the typical polyphagia. The classic osmotic symptoms of diabetes are usually less prominent due to the increased renal threshold for glucose (reducing the intensity of polyuria) and impairment of thirst sensation (reducing the intensity of polydipsia). Diabetes complications, such as non ketotic hyperosmolar coma, may be the presenting symptom or diabetes may be first diagnosed during an acute illness or a routine blood test.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus [^b6c18ff8]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Symptoms of marked hyperglycemia include polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, sometimes with polyphagia, and blurred vision. Impairment of growth and susceptibility to certain infections may also accompany chronic hyperglycemia. Acute, life-threatening consequences of uncontrolled diabetes are hyperglycemia with ketoacidosis or the nonketotic hyperosmolar syndrome.

Long-term complications of diabetes include retinopathy with potential loss of vision; nephropathy leading to renal failure; peripheral neuropathy with risk of foot ulcers, amputations, and Charcot joints; and autonomic neuropathy causing gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and cardiovascular symptoms and sexual dysfunction. Patients with diabetes have an increased incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular, peripheral arterial, and cerebrovascular disease. Hypertension and abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism are often found in people with diabetes.

The vast majority of cases of diabetes fall into two broad etiopathogenetic categories (discussed in greater detail below). In one category, type 1 diabetes, the cause is an absolute deficiency of insulin secretion. Individuals at increased risk of developing this type of diabetes can often be identified by serological evidence of an autoimmune pathologic process occurring in the pancreatic islets and by genetic markers. In the other, much more prevalent category, type 2 diabetes, the cause is a combination of resistance to insulin action and an inadequate compensatory insulin secretory response. In the latter category, a degree of hyperglycemia sufficient to cause pathologic and functional changes in various target tissues, but without clinical symptoms, may be present for a long period of time before diabetes is detected. During this asymptomatic period, it is possible to demonstrate an abnormality in carbohydrate metabolism by measurement of plasma glucose in the fasting state or after a challenge with an oral glucose load or by A1C.

Classification and Diagnosis of Diabetes in Childhood

The criteria for diagnosing diabetes in childhood are based on glucose levels and the presence of symptoms. There are three possibilities for diagnosing diabetes, which, in the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia symptoms, must be confirmed by dosages in subsequent days, as follows:

1. Fasting glycemia > 126 mg/dl,

2. Post-overload glucose levels with 1.75 g/kg of anhydrous glucose up to 75 g dissolved in water, ≥ 200 mg/dl

3. Classic symptoms of diabetes and casual glycemia ≥ 200 mg/dl, where 'casual' is defined as any time of day, not related to the last meal, and 'classic symptoms' include polyuria, polydipsia and unexplainable weight loss.

However, similarly as in adults, glycemic values often do not reach those established for diagnosing diabetes, but they are too elevated to be considered normal and must be classified as impaired fasting glucose levels (≥ 100 mg/dl, but < 126 mg/dl) or impaired glucose tolerance, 2 hours after glucose overload, glycemic levels above 140 mg/dl, but lower than 200 mg/dl.

On the other hand, images shown as type 1 diabetes (T1D) stereotypes - skinny children, with abrupt clinical condition - are characteristics that are no longer typical of the condition. Approximately one quarter of T1D patients may be obese at the moment of diagnosis. T1D may be confirmed by the 90% presence of anti-pancreatic antibodies at the moment of diagnosis, while the other 10% may have T2D, MODY or other types of diabetes (Tables 3 and 4).

Criteria for the diagnosis of CFRD in stable outpatients

ADA has established diagnostic criteria for diabetes that include specific fasting glucose levels, 2-h OGTT glucose levels, and A1C levels. They are based on the population risk of microvascular disease, and patients with CF are also at risk for these complications (,–). The committee questioned whether the diagnostic thresholds should be lower for the CF population as CFRD is known to have a negative impact on CF pulmonary status, given that pulmonary disease is the chief morbidity in CFRD. Even less severe glucose tolerance abnormalities such as IGT are associated with lung function decline. However, sufficient outcome-based data are not available at present to determine whether more stringent diagnostic glucose thresholds more appropriately reflect risk for the CF population.

During a period of stable baseline health, the diagnosis of CFRD can be made in CF patients according to standard ADA criteria. Testing should be done on two separate days to rule out laboratory error unless there are unequivocal symptoms of hyperglycemia (polyuria and polydipsia); a positive FPG or A1C can be used as a confirmatory test, but if it is normal the OGTT should be performed or repeated. If the diagnosis of diabetes is not confirmed, the patient resumes routine annual testing. (ADA-E; Consensus)
2-h OGTT plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l)
FPG ≥ 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l)
A1C ≥ 6.5% (A1C < 6.5% does not rule out CFRD because this value is often spuriously low in CF.)
Classical symptoms of diabetes (polyuria and polydipsia) in the presence of a casual glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l)

### Clinical care guidelines for cystic fibrosis-related diabetes: a position statement of the American diabetes association and a clinical practice guideline of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, endorsed by the Pediatric Endocrine Society [^e4f1ebba]. Diabetes Care (2010). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) diagnostic criteria under different conditions are summarized as follows: Healthy outpatients — "OGTT of choice"; diagnosis based on "FPG ≥ 126 mg/dl", "2-h OGTT glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl", "A1C ≥ 6.5%", and "Random glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl plus polyuria, polydipsia"; "All but 4 should be repeated". Continuous drip feedings — diagnosis is based on "mid- or immediate postfeeding glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl"; "Should be confirmed on two separate nights"; if measured by self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), it "should be confirmed by laboratory measurement". Acute illness or systemic steroids — "Diagnosis based on hyperglycemia that persists for > 48 hours", with hyperglycemia defined as "FPG ≥ 126 mg/dl" and "2-h postprandial glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl"; if measured by SMBG, it "should be confirmed by laboratory measurement". Pregnancy — diagnosis is based on a "75-g fasting OGTT if any of the following plasma glucose levels are present: 1. fasting ≥ 92 mg/dl 2. 1-h ≥ 180 mg/dl 3. 2-h ≥ 153 mg/dl".

### Diabetic subjects diagnosed through the diabetes prevention trial-type 1 (DPT-1) are often asymptomatic with normal A1c at diabetes onset [^fb5847bc]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Demographic characteristics

The 246 subjects diagnosed through follow-up in the study were analyzed (98 in the oral insulin trial, 143 in the parenteral insulin trial, and 5 during the high-risk follow-up study). Of the 246 people diagnosed throughout the study, 167 (67.9%) were diagnosed by an OGTT, 42 (17.1%) were diagnosed by a random plasma glucose test, and 29 (11.8%) were diagnosed by FPG. The remaining eight (3.25%) diagnoses occurred outside of routine study evaluation by a nonstudy physician, and diagnostic glucose data were not available.

Baseline characteristics of those diagnosed through the study (n = 246) were compared with those of individuals enrolled in the study who did not develop diabetes (n = 453) (Table 1). There were no significant differences between the two groups for race, sex, or relationship to the index relative with type 1 diabetes. Children diagnosed with diabetes were younger at randomization compared with those not diagnosed by study end (P = 0.03).

Symptoms at presentation of type 1 diabetes

Of the 246 people analyzed, 28 (11.4%) did not have data regarding the presence of symptoms at diagnosis. These individuals were excluded from analysis of symptoms. For the remaining subjects, 80 (36.70%) reported a presence of at least one symptom (71 [32.57%] reported polyuria, 54 [24.77%] polydipsia, and 20 [9.17%] polyphagia), and 58 (26.6%) reported the presence of more than one symptom. Weight loss was reported in 21 subjects (9.63%). DKA was reported in eight subjects (3.67%).

### Management of kidney transplant recipients for primary care practitioners [^387bdbd1]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetes and post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM)

PTDM is a prevalent complication following solid organ transplantation with incidence rates varying from 10 to 40% between different studies, particularly in kidney transplant recipients. Beyond the conventional risk factors associated with diabetes, such as obesity, ethnicity, infections, hypomagnesemia, and other pertinent risk factors associated with PTDM include the impact of immunosuppressive medications and infections like hepatitis C and cytomegalovirus (CMV). PTDM has a significant risk to both graft function and patient survival, contributing to increased rates of mortality and morbidity. Complications of PTDM, including kidney transplant rejection, cardiovascular diseases, and infections, are major contributors to the mortality among kidney transplant recipients. Diagnosis of PTDM should be made with caution, as immediate-to-early post-transplant hyperglycemia is common but may resolve within a few weeks. Therefore, a formal diagnosis is typically deferred until at least six weeks post-transplant to ensure accurate assessment, unless severe hyperglycemia is sustained or progressively worsening. For the diagnosis of PTDM, a patient should have at least one of the following criteria: a random plasma glucose level exceeding 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) along with symptoms associated with diabetes mellitus (polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, fatigue), a fasting plasma glucose level surpassing 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L), a 2-hour plasma glucose level exceeding 200 mg/dL during a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test or an HbA1c level > 6.5%.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis: evaluation and treatment [^d9a7e836]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis is characterized by a serum glucose level greater than 250 mg per dL, a pH less than 7.3, a serum bicarbonate level less than 18 mEq per L, an elevated serum ketone level, and dehydration. Insulin deficiency is the main precipitating factor. Diabetic ketoacidosis can occur in persons of all ages, with 14 percent of cases occurring in persons older than 70 years, 23 percent in persons 51 to 70 years of age, 27 percent in persons 30 to 50 years of age, and 36 percent in persons younger than 30 years. The case fatality rate is 1 to 5 percent. About one-third of all cases are in persons without a history of diabetes mellitus. Common symptoms include polyuria with polydipsia (98 percent), weight loss (81 percent), fatigue (62 percent), dyspnea (57 percent), vomiting (46 percent), preceding febrile illness (40 percent), abdominal pain (32 percent), and polyphagia (23 percent). Measurement of A1C, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, serum glucose, electrolytes, pH, and serum ketones; complete blood count; urinalysis; electrocardiography; and calculation of anion gap and osmolar gap can differentiate diabetic ketoacidosis from hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, gastroenteritis, starvation ketosis, and other metabolic syndromes, and can assist in diagnosing comorbid conditions. Appropriate treatment includes administering intravenous fluids and insulin, and monitoring glucose and electrolyte levels. Cerebral edema is a rare but severe complication that occurs predominantly in children. Physicians should recognize the signs of diabetic ketoacidosis for prompt diagnosis, and identify early symptoms to prevent it. Patient education should include information on how to adjust insulin during times of illness and how to monitor glucose and ketone levels, as well as information on the importance of medication compliance.

### Approach to the patient with suspected hypotonic polyuria [^bebc64b7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

It is common for endocrinologists to receive referred patients who have polyuria and polydipsia that need investigation. When initial investigations reveal the urine to be hypotonic, differentiating between the 3 main causes is essential, as the management differs for each. Over the past 2 years, due to concerns about patient safety and in response to patient feedback, the causes of hypotonic polyuria have been renamed as arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D, formerly central diabetes insipidus), arginine vasopressin resistance (AVP-R, formerly nephrogenic diabetes insipidus), while the name of the third cause is retained as primary polydipsia (PP), in which excess fluid intake suppresses AVP secretion. In a survey of more than one thousand patients with AVP-D, the large majority had experienced confusion of their condition by health care workers with diabetes mellitus, resulting in delays in availability of desmopressin and unnecessary capillary glucose monitoring when hospitalized, and 85% favored changing the name. The new nomenclature more accurately reflects pathophysiology and clearly identifies the patients' condition as different from diabetes mellitus, and now has been adopted by the Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) taxonomy hierarchy codes for electronic patient records. In parallel, the last several years have seen improvements in the diagnostic tools used for the investigation of hypotonic polyuria, with a particular emphasis on the use of measurement of plasma copeptin. This Approach to the Patient review presents the use of this copeptin-based approach in 3 specific cases, and places each in the context of the revised nomenclature. We then describe the overall approach to the patient presenting with hypotonic polyuria, itemize the causes, and discuss when and how testing should be performed (Fig. 1), highlighting specific areas that frequently cause diagnostic and management difficulties.

### Paliperidone [^e6fde90b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.

Pooled data from the three placebo-controlled, 6-week, fixed-dose studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia are presented in Table 1a.

In the uncontrolled, longer-term open-label extension studies, paliperidone was associated with a mean change in glucose of +3.3 mg/dL at Week 24 (n = 570) and +4.6 mg/dL at Week 52 (n = 314).

Data from the placebo-controlled 6-week study in adolescent subjects (12 to 17 years of age) with schizophrenia are presented in Table 1b.

### Diabetes mellitus: screening and diagnosis [^1a2e9a0c]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common diagnoses made by family physicians. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to blindness, limb amputation, kidney failure, and vascular and heart disease. Screening patients before signs and symptoms develop leads to earlier diagnosis and treatment, but may not reduce rates of end-organ damage. Randomized trials show that screening for type 2 diabetes does not reduce mortality after 10 years, although some data suggest mortality benefits after 23 to 30 years. Lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions decrease progression to diabetes in patients with impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance. Screening for type 1 diabetes is not recommended. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for abnormal blood glucose and type 2 diabetes in adults 40 to 70 years of age who are overweight or obese, and repeating testing every three years if results are normal. Individuals at higher risk should be considered for earlier and more frequent screening. The American Diabetes Association recommends screening for type 2 diabetes annually in patients 45 years and older, or in patients younger than 45 years with major risk factors. The diagnosis can be made with a fasting plasma glucose level of 126 mg per dL or greater; an A1C level of 6.5% or greater; a random plasma glucose level of 200 mg per dL or greater; or a 75-g two-hour oral glucose tolerance test with a plasma glucose level of 200 mg per dL or greater. Results should be confirmed with repeat testing on a subsequent day; however, a single random plasma glucose level of 200 mg per dL or greater with typical signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia likely indicates diabetes. Additional testing to determine the etiology of diabetes is not routinely recommended.

### The value of urine specific gravity in detecting diabetes insipidus in a patient with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus: urine specific gravity in differential diagnosis [^ad6fea31]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

When a patient with diabetes mellitus presents with worsening polyuria and polydipsia, what is a sensible, cost-effective approach? We report the unique coincidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. A 46-year-old woman with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes complained of polyuria with a daily output of 5 L. Although urinalysis demonstrated significant glucosuria, diabetes insipidus was suspected owing to a low urine specific gravity (1.008). The low specific gravity persisted during a water deprivation test. Ultimately, diabetes insipidus was confirmed when urine specific gravity and urine osmolality normalized following desmopressin administration. This case emphasizes the importance of accurately interpreting the urine specific gravity in patients with polyuria and diabetes mellitus to detect diabetes insipidus.

Hyperglycemic crisis recognition and sick day/home management — clinical directives include: hyperglycemic crisis should be considered in all individuals presenting with polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, vomiting, dehydration, and change in cognitive state; individuals at risk for DKA should be counseled on early signs and symptoms, provided urine and/or blood ketone tests, and educated on timely self-management; individuals treated with intensive insulin therapy should not stop or hold their basal insulin even if not eating; those with mild ketosis and potential precipitating factors, particularly if glucose levels exceed 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L), may be managed at home, and when hemodynamically and cognitively intact may treat mild DKA with frequent glucose and ketone monitoring, noncaloric hydration, and subcutaneous insulin; individuals should seek immediate medical attention if unable to hydrate orally, if glucose does not improve with insulin, with altered mental status, or signs of worsening illness; because HHS is associated with greater volume depletion and typically triggered by acute illness, suspected HHS should be immediately evaluated and treated in the inpatient setting.

### Varying clinical presentations at onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children – epidemiological evidence for different subtypes of the disease? [^b557171a]. Pediatric Diabetes (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

On the basis of 2121 case observations between 1987 and 1997, we describe the clinical and laboratory characteristics of diabetes mellitus type 1 at its onset. Our objective is to analyze whether clinical presentation follows a uniform pattern or whether there is evidence for different subtypes.

Research Design and Methods

Thirty-one pediatric hospitals and one diabetes center in Baden-Wuerttemberg (BW), Germany, participated in this study. The hospital records of 2121 children below 15 yr of age were examined retrospectively. Statistical analysis was done after logarithmic transformation into a normal distribution.

Results

The average duration of symptoms was found to be 15.2 d (95% CI (Confidence Intervals) = 14.3–16.1) ranging between 2.0 and 180 d (95% central range). The most frequent symptoms were polyuria and polydipsia; 7.2% presented with altered level of consciousness. The mean blood glucose value was 407.9 mg/dL (95% CI = 400.0–416.0), corresponding to 23.3 mmol/L (95% CI = 22.8–23.8). The median pH value was 7.35 (95% CI = 7.34–7.36), and the median base excess was -5 mmol/L (95% CI = -5 to -4). The younger patients had a shorter duration of symptoms and suffered most frequently from ketoacidosis.

Conclusions

Although the symptoms of diabetes at its onset follow a uniform pattern, the clinical presentation and duration of symptoms indicate that there may be various forms of type 1 diabetes.

### TGF-β 1 and IGF-I gene variations in type 1 diabetes microangiopathic complications [^8c658fa5]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes

Diabetes was diagnosed according to the criteria, which was suggested by an expert committee in 1997 (report of the expert committee on the diagnosis and classification of diabetes Mellitus). The diabetic patients included in the present study fulfilled at least one of the triple criteria recommended by the expert committee, detailed as follows:

a) Symptoms of hyperglycaemia (polyuria, polydipisia, unexplained weight loss) plus random plasma glucose > 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L). Random is defined as any time of day without regard to time since last meal.

b) Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) > 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/L). Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 hours.

c) 2-hour plasma glucose (PG) > 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/L) during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The test should be performed as described by the World Health Organization (WHO), using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75-g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water.

Diabetes was regarded as T1DM if it was diagnosed before age of 30 years and accompanied with acute onset and treatment with insulin began within the first year of diagnosis and continued thereafter.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR)

The back of the eye was examined by fundoscopy (after pupillary dilatation) and when more than five dots or blots per eye, hard or soft exudates or new vessels were evident the diagnosis of retinopathy was applied. Patients who had a history of laser treatment were also diagnosed as retinopathy.

Diabetic nephropathy (DN)

The elevation of AER (> 300 mg-2 g/day) at least on two of three occasions and/or 3 positive Albustix over the past 12 months were evident to mark patients as nephropath, while a urinary tract infection (UTI) was ruled out already.

### Clinical presentation of type 1 diabetes [^5ba8255e]. Pediatric Diabetes (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify the presenting features of type 1 diabetes in a national incident cohort aged under 15 yr, the duration of symptoms, the occurrence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at presentation, and the frequency of a family history of diabetes.

Methods

A prospective study was undertaken of incident cases of type 1 diabetes using an active monthly reporting card system from January 1, 1997 to December 31, 1998 in the Republic of Ireland. Follow-up questionnaires were distributed to pediatricians nationally.

Results

Two hundred and eighty-three incident cases were identified. Polyuria, polydipsia and weight loss were the main presenting symptoms in all age categories. Nocturnal enuresis was reported in 19% under 5 yr and in 31% aged 5–9.99 yr. Constipation was noted in five patients and in 10.4% under 5 yr of age. The median duration of symptoms was highest in the youngest (under 2 yr) and oldest (10–14.99 yr) age categories. Presentation in moderate/severe DKA occurred in 25% overall and six of nine of those aged under 2 yr. A family history of type 1 diabetes in a first-degree relative was found in 10.2%.

Conclusions

This study confirms the abrupt onset of type 1 diabetes, the absence of a family history, and the importance of the classical symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss in the majority of cases. It reveals secondary enuresis as an important symptom, especially in those under 10 yr, and constipation in the under 5 yr age group. The very young (under 2 yr) are more difficult to diagnose, have more variability of symptom duration, and are more likely to present in moderate/severe DKA. A high index of suspicion aids early diagnosis.

### Hemoglobin A1c is a reliable criterion for diagnosing type 1 diabetes in childhood and adolescence [^704af421]. Pediatric Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Little is known about the use of the hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) test for the diagnosis of diabetes in childhood and adolescence. The aim is to investigate sensitivity and specificity of HbA1c at onset of childhood type 1 diabetes.

Methods

A total of 184 children and adolescents with blood glucose levels above 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) were included: 84.8% (n = 156, mean age 9.0 yr) with new onset of type 1 diabetes, 15.2% (n = 28, mean age 6.1 yr) with transient hyperglycemia. HbA1c was measured using the Bayer(®) DCA2000 analyzer.

Results

Patients with new onset of type 1 diabetes (n = 156) had HbA1c values between 6.6% and > 14% (mean (SD) 11.4 (2.0)%; IQR, interquartile range 9.8–13.3%). All patients suffered from typical symptoms of hyperglycemia, i.e., polyuria and polydipsia. In the patient group with transient hyperglycemia (n = 28), HbA1c values were between 4.5 and 6.1% (mean (SD) 5.3 (0.4)%; IQR 5.0–5.6%). None of these patients reported typical symptoms of diabetes. All patients with HbA1c values greater than 6.35% had new onset of type 1 diabetes. Sensitivity of HbA1c at the onset of childhood type 1 diabetes was calculated to be 100%. In patients with HbA1c values less than 6.35%, the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes could be excluded. Thus, specificity of HbA1c as diagnostic criterion was 100%.

Conclusions

Childhood type 1 diabetes can be diagnosed and excluded with high reliability by means of HbA1c testing.

### Plasma levels of fetuin – A and hepatic enzymes and risk of type 2 diabetes in women in the U.S [^e7b4f133]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Ascertainment of type 2 diabetes.

In the baseline questionnaire and all biennial follow-up questionnaires, we inquire about the incidence of physician-diagnosed diabetes. Participants who report such a diagnosis received a supplementary questionnaire querying about symptoms, diagnostic tests, and treatment for the purpose of confirmation. The self-report of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes has been demonstrated to be highly reliable in a validation study in which self-reported diagnosis of diabetes was confirmed by medical records, which were reviewed by an endocrinologist blinded to the supplementary questionnaire information for 61 of 62 randomly selected participants who responded. In another validation study among the NHS participants, the reliability of a "negative screen" also was examined. Medical record review documented that 129 of 130 participants who reported a negative screen had fasting plasma glucose levels < 126 mg/dL. Only patients with confirmed type 2 diabetes were included in this study. We used the American Diabetes Association 1998 criteria to confirm or refute self-reported type 2 diabetes diagnosis: 1) an elevated glucose concentration (fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L, random plasma glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L, or plasma glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L after an oral glucose load) and at least one symptom (excessive thirst, polyuria, weight loss, or hunger) related to diabetes; 2) no symptoms, but elevated glucose concentrations on two occasions; or 3) treatment with insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication.

### Type I diabetes manifested solely by 2-h oral glucose tolerance test criteria [^56a409b0]. Diabetes (2001). Low credibility.

The clinical presentation of type 1 diabetes usually involves symptoms such as polyuria and polydipsia. However, investigators in the Diabetes Prevention Trial of Type 1 Diabetes (DPT-1) have detected a group of subjects with type 1 diabetes who have a different phenotype. These subjects are asymptomatic, have normal (< 6.1 mmol/l) (group A) or impaired (6.1- < 7.0 mmol/l) (group B) fasting glucose, but have 2-h glucose values > 11.1 mmol/l on their oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT). Of the 585 OGTTs performed on islet cell antibody (ICA)-positive relatives with insulin autoantibodies (IAA) or low first-phase insulin response (FPIR), normal glucose tolerance (NGT) was found in 427 subjects; impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) was found in 87 subjects, and diabetes was found by 2-h OGTT criteria alone in 61 subjects. Despite marked differences in 2-h glucose values (NGT 5.8 ± 1.1 mmol/l, IGT 8.9 ± 0.9 mmol/l, and group A 13.5 ± 2.5 mmol/l), there were no significant differences in fasting glucose values among NGT (4.8 ± 0.5 mmol/l), IGT (5.03 ± 0.5 mmol/l), and group A (4.99 ± 0.7 mmol/l) categories. Mean FPIR was higher in subjects with NGT compared with subjects with IGT and subjects diagnosed by 2-h OGTT criteria alone. However, the correlation between FPIR and 2-h glucose value was low (r2 = 0.114). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that additional independent variables provide smaller contributions to the 2-h glucose value. In conclusion, there are asymptomatic type 1 diabetic subjects whose diabetes was diagnosed by the 2-h criteria on OGTT alone. Despite the importance of beta-cell dysfunction in the pathogenesis of type I diabetes, factors other than impaired FPIR must also contribute to postprandial glucose tolerance in these subjects.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to diagnose diabetes based on HbA1c or plasma glucose criteria, using either the fasting plasma glucose value, 2-hour plasma glucose value during a 75-g OGTT, or random glucose value accompanied by classic hyperglycemic symptoms/crises criteria:

- HbA1c ≥ 6.5% (≥ 48 mmol/mol), performed in a laboratory using a method that is National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program-certified and standardized to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial assay

### A retrospective database study of the demographic features and glycemic control of patients with type 2 diabetes in kinshasa, democratic republic of the Congo [^649cb321]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

In the big capital city of DRC, Kinshasa, adults seek medical help close to their homes when health complaints are present. During medical check-ups at primary health facilities, screening for T2D is typically done through medical history, clinical parameters (e.g. blood pressure and blood glucose) and anthropometric measurements such as body weight and height. When blood glucose is abnormal (random glucose test of > 200 mg/dL or FPG > 126 mg/dL) and/or diabetes-related symptoms are present, for instance, polyuria, polyphagia, or polydipsia, extreme fatigue or blurred vision, patients are referred, in most of the cases, to the endocrinology department of the hospital for further testing. After the diagnosis of T2D is confirmed and the physician has selected the most appropriate treatment, the national standard form for patients with T2D is completed. Developed by the Diabetes National Programme, this paper-based form collects the diabetes history of the patient, demographic details, diagnosis status, clinical evaluation, and anti-diabetic treatment records. Diagnosis of T2D is carried out by a doctor at the hospital or by a nurse at the primary health centres. If the diagnosis was performed at the hospital, from the moment the patient's glycemia is stable, the continuation of treatment and care is decentralised to the primary health centres.

In Kinshasa, T2D care is often offered by Kin Réseau, a network initiative, which was set up in 1974 by mostly religious organisations, aiming at providing decentralised care for diabetes. This longstanding network, comprises 80 care centres, including hospitals and primary health centres, and has a patient referral system in place. This programme also offers patient education, medication for a subsidised price, and daily insulin administration at the health centre, as well as annual screening for complications of diabetes. More details on this programme can be found elsewhere. Currently, Kin Réseau offers a basic diabetes package that includes one follow-up visit a week at the health centre and a bi-monthly medical examination by a trained doctor for a price of USD 3.5/month.

### Identifying targets to reduce the incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in the UK [^46950441]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is the leading cause of mortality in childhood diabetes, and at diagnosis might represent delayed presentation. The extent and reasons for delays are unclear, but identifying and targeting factors associated with DKA could reduce this incidence.

Objective

To compare the patient pathway before diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in children presenting with DKA and non-acidotic hyperglycaemia.

Design, Setting and Patients

Over a 3-month period, children newly diagnosed with T1DM were identified on admission to UK hospitals. Parents and medical teams completed a questionnaire about events before diagnosis.

Results

Data were available for 261 children (54% male), median age 10.3y (range 0.8–16.6 y). 25% presented with DKA, but more commonly in children < 2y (80% vs 23%, p < 0.001). Fewer children with DKA reported polyuria (76% vs 86%) or polydipsia (86% vs 94%) (both p < 0.05), but more reported fatigue (74% vs 52%) and weight loss (75% vs 54%) (both p < 0.01). 24% of children had multiple healthcare professional (HCP) contacts, and these children had lower pH on admission. 46% of children with a delayed presentation to secondary care had non-urgent investigations. 64% of parents had considered a diagnosis of diabetes, and these children were less likely to present with DKA (13% vs 47%, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Multiple HCP contacts increased risk of presentation in DKA, whereas, parental awareness of diabetes was protective. Improved public and health professional education targeting non-classical symptoms, awareness of diabetes in under 2 y, and point-of-care testing could reduce DKA at diagnosis of diabetes.

### Diagnosis, classification, and pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus [^111c6e46]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder that is characterized by inappropriate hyperglycemia and is associated with both acute and chronic complications. Currently, diabetes mellitus is diagnosed by blood or plasma glucose levels. A random plasma glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL in an individual with classic symptoms is sufficient to make the diagnosis. Otherwise, a fasting plasma glucose level ≥ 126 mg/dL or a 2-hour plasma glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL after an oral glucose challenge of 75 g on 2 occasions is sufficient evidence upon which to diagnose diabetes mellitus. The major types of diabetes mellitus are type 1 diabetes (insulin deficient) and type 2 diabetes (combination of insulin resistance and insulin deficiency). In both types, there is a genetic predisposition as well as environmental factors that contribute to the expression of the genetic predisposition. In type 1 diabetes, the primary abnormality is extensive deficiency of beta cell function. In type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance occurs, and the marked compensatory increases in insulin secretion necessary to maintain normal glucose tolerance cannot be achieved or maintained. As beta cell function continues to decrease, the individual progresses from normal glucose tolerance to impaired glucose tolerance to diabetes with primarily postprandial hyperglycemia to diabetes with fasting hyperglycemia. Drugs can cause diabetes by interfering with beta cell insulin secretion, by increasing insulin resistance, or by a combination of both. Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been reported to cause diabetic ketoacidosis, obesity and insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and hypertriglyceridemia. A monitoring system should be in place in patients started on treatment with these agents to detect metabolic abnormalities as they are evolving so that adequate and timely treatment can be initiated.

Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus

Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse events is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics.

Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.

Schizophrenia

Adults

Pooled data from short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies are presented in Table 3.

In the uncontrolled, longer-term schizophrenia studies (primarily open-label extension studies), LATUDA was associated with a mean change in glucose of +1.8 mg/dL at week 24 (n = 355), +0.8 mg/dL at week 36 (n = 299) and +2.3 mg/dL at week 52 (n = 307).

Adolescents

In studies of adolescents and adults with schizophrenia, changes in fasting glucose were similar. In the short-term, placebo-controlled study of adolescents, fasting serum glucose mean values were -1.3 mg/dL for placebo (n = 95), +0.1 mg/dL for 40 mg/day (n = 90), and +1.8 mg/dL for 80 mg/day (n = 92).

Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus

Hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, have been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. There have been few reports of hyperglycemia or diabetes in patients treated with ziprasidone. Although fewer patients have been treated with ziprasidone, it is not known if this more limited experience is the sole reason for the paucity of such reports. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available.

Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of antidiabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.

Pooled data from short-term, placebo-controlled studies in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are presented in Tables 1–4. Note that for the flexible dose studies in both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, each subject is categorized as having received either low (20–40 mg BID) or high (60–80 mg BID) dose based on the subject's modal daily dose. In the tables showing categorical changes, the percentages (% column) are calculated as 100×(n/N).

In long-term (at least 1 year), placebo-controlled, flexible-dose studies in schizophrenia, the mean change from baseline in random glucose for ziprasidone 20–40 mg BID was -3.4 mg/dL (N = 122); for ziprasidone 60–80 mg BID was +1.3 mg/dL (N = 10); and for placebo was +0.3 mg/dL (N = 71).

### Assessing diabetic control – reliability of methods available in resource poor settings [^92cc613e]. Diabetic Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Aims and Methods

To examine the reliability of random venous or capillary blood glucose testing, random urine glucose testing, and a current symptom history in predicting a high HbA1c in Type 2 diabetic patients taking oral hypoglycaemic agents in a poorly controlled rural African population.

Results

For a cut-off point for HbA1c of ≥ 8%, for random venous plasma glucose of ≥ 14 mmol/L (present in 47.2% of subjects), specificity was 97.1% (95% CI 85.1–99.9), sensitivity 56.8% (48.8–64.5) and positive predictive value (PPV) 98.9% (94.2–99.9). HbA1c ≥ 8% is predicted by a random capillary blood glucose of 17 mmol/L (present in 28.4% of subjects) with specificity 100% (90.0–100.0), PPV 100% (93.7–100.0) and sensitivity of 34.3% (27.2–42.1). HbA1c ≥ 8% is predicted by the presence of heavy glycosuria (≥ 55 mmol/L) (present in 35.6%) with specificity 94.1% (80.3–99.3), sensitivity of 41.9% (34.1–49.9) and PPV 97.1% (89.9–99.6). Polyuria/nocturia (present in 31.3%) was the only symptom found to be associated with poor control, with a specificity for predicting HbA1c of ≥ 8% of 81.5% (61.9–93.7), PPV 89.1% (76.4–96.4) and sensitivity 30.6% (22.9–39.1).

Conclusions

Where resources are short, random glucose testing can be used to detect a significant proportion of those with the worst control with a high degree of specificity enabling primary care staff to modify treatment safely. Where facilities are limited capillary blood or urine testing with reagent strips, may be substituted for venous plasma testing in the laboratory. A symptom history was insufficient to replace biochemical testing, but where this is unavailable, urinary symptoms may be helpful.

### Atypical diabetes: a diagnostic challenge [^26f70f84]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Patient 5

The patient in the 30s was diagnosed with T1D at age 10 and was treated with insulin for 10 years. Because of massive heredity for diabetes and very low insulin requirements, MODY was suspected. The patient, as well as one of the sisters, proved to be heterozygous for a mutation in the enzyme glucokinase (GCK: C.1305-1306INSG) and was accordingly diagnosed with MODY-2.

MODY-2 is due to inactivating mutations in GCK, which is expressed in, for example, the insulin-producing β-cells and in the liver.GCK is a critical component of β-cell glucose sensing and heterozygous defects in this enzyme result in mild fasting hyperglycemia that can be asymptomatic for many years and is often detected by coincidence.

As expected, the patient's glycemic control was excellent on only dietary treatment for 10 years, but the patient then sought the emergency room because of 3 months of polyuria, polydipsia, fatigue and 20 kg weight loss. P-glucose was 29 mmol/L and HbA1c 117 mmol/mol. Arterial blood gas and electrolytes were normal and B-ketones 0.2 mmol/L. The patient was admitted to the hospital with a basal bolus insulin regimen and fluid replacement. Analysis of autoantibodies against GAD-65 showed 314 E/mL (ref < 5) and against IA-2 was 513 E/mL (ref < 7.5), thus a strong autoimmune process. The patient's insulin production was weak, as evidenced by a level of C-peptide that only increased from 0.26 to 0.42 nmol/L on meal stimulation. The patient was found to be very sensitive to insulin, perhaps not so unexpectedly, as GCK is also expressed in glucagon-producing α-cells in the pancreas and in glucose-sensitive neurons in the central nervous system.

### Emergency department management of uncomplicated hyperglycemia in patients without history of diabetes [^507df339]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperglycemia is a common finding in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). Recommendations addressing uncomplicated hyperglycemia in the ED are limited, and the management of those without a prior diagnosis of diabetes presents a challenge.

Objective

This narrative review will discuss the ED evaluation and management of hyperglycemic adult patients without a history of diabetes who do not have evidence of a hyperglycemic crisis, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.

Discussion

Many adults who present to the ED have risk factors for diabetes and meet American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria for diabetes screening. A new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes can be established in the ED by the ADA criteria in patients with a random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) and symptoms of hyperglycemia. The diagnosis should be considered in patients with an elevation in random blood glucose > 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L). Treatment may begin in the ED and varies depending on the presenting severity of hyperglycemia. Treatment options include metformin, long-acting insulin, or deferring for close outpatient management.

Conclusions

Emergency clinician knowledge of the evaluation and management of new-onset hyperglycemia and diabetes is important to prevent long-term complications.

### Diagnosis and management of diabetes insipidus for the internist: an update [^cc2b2c9f]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Diabetes insipidus is a disorder characterized by excretion of large amounts of hypotonic urine. Four entities have to be differentiated: central diabetes insipidus resulting from a deficiency of the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus resulting from resistance to AVP in the kidneys, gestational diabetes insipidus resulting from an increase in placental vasopressinase and finally primary polydipsia, which involves excessive intake of large amounts of water despite normal AVP secretion and action. Distinguishing between the different types of diabetes insipidus can be challenging. A detailed medical history, physical examination and imaging studies are needed to detect the aetiology of diabetes insipidus. Differentiation between the various forms of hypotonic polyuria is then done by the classical water deprivation test or the more recently developed hypertonic saline or arginine stimulation together with copeptin (or AVP) measurement. In patients with idiopathic central DI, a close follow-up is needed since central DI can be the first sign of an underlying pathology. Treatment of diabetes insipidus or primary polydipsia depends on the underlying aetiology and differs in central diabetes insipidus, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia. This review will discuss issues and newest developments in diagnosis, differential diagnosis and treatment, with a focus on central diabetes insipidus.

Patients and controls

In this cross-sectional study, in total 248 unrelated British Caucasian with T1DM were randomly selected among patients attending Manchester Diabetes Centre during 1999–2002. The ethical approval was obtained from the Manchester Royal Infirmary.

All patients fulfilled the relevant criteria for related diagnosis as are detailed below. To be on the safe side, patients who had diabetes less than 3 years were excluded from analysis.

Type 1 diabetes

Diabetes was diagnosed according to the criteria, which was suggested by an expert committee in 1997 (report of the expert committee on the diagnosis and classification of diabetes Mellitus, 1997). The diabetic patients included in the present study fulfilled at least one of the triple criteria recommended by the expert committee, detailed as follows:

a) Symptoms of hyperglycaemia (polyuria, polydipisia, unexplained weight loss) plus random plasma glucose > 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L). Random is defined as any time of day without regard to time since last meal.

b) Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) > 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/L). Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 hours.

c) 2-hour plasma glucose (PG) > 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/L) during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The test should be performed as described by the World Health Organization (WHO), using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75-g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water.

Diabetes was regarded as T1DM if it was diagnosed before age of 30 years and accompanied with acute onset and treatment with insulin began within the first year of diagnosis and continued thereafter.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR)

The back of the eye was examined by fundoscopy (after pupillary dilatation) and when more than five dots or blots per eye, hard or soft exudates or new vessels were evident the diagnosis of retinopathy was applied. Patients who had a history of laser treatment were also diagnosed as retinopathy.

Diabetic nephropathy (DN)

The elevation of AER (> 300 mg-2 g/day) at least on two of three occasions and/or 3 positive Albustix over the past 12 months were evident to mark patients as nephropath, while a urinary tract infection (UTI) was ruled out already.

Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics, including RYKINDO, should be monitored regularly for worsening glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics, including RYKINDO, should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics, including RYKINDO, should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics, including RYKINDO, should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia resolved when the atypical antipsychotic, including risperidone, was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of risperidone.

Pooled data from 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with schizophrenia and 4 double-blind, placebo-controlled monotherapy studies in patients with bipolar mania with oral risperidone are presented in Table 1.

In longer-term, controlled and uncontrolled studies in adult patients, oral risperidone was associated with a mean change in glucose of +2.8 mg/dL at Week 24 (N = 151) and +4.1 mg/dL at Week 48 (N = 50).

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^115be2f3]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Type 2 diabetes is epidemic. Its long-term consequences translate into enormous human suffering and economic costs; however, much of the morbidity associated with long-term microvascular and neuropathic complications can be substantially reduced by interventions that achieve glucose levels close to the nondiabetic range. Although new classes of medications and numerous combinations have been demonstrated to lower glycemia, current-day management has failed to achieve and maintain the glycemic levels most likely to provide optimal healthcare status for people with diabetes.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^5eb155a8]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Table 2.1 — Criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes in nonpregnant individuals — Diagnosis can be established by any of the following: A1C ≥ 6.5% (≥ 48 mmol/mol). The test should be performed in a laboratory using a method that is NGSP certified and standardized to the DCCT assay; fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥ 126 mg/dL (≥ 7.0 mmol/L). Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 h; 2-hour plasma glucose (2-h PG) ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11.1 mmol/L) during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The test should be performed as described by the WHO, using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water; or, in an individual with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, a random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11.1 mmol/L). Random is any time of the day without regard to time since previous meal. In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, diagnoses require two abnormal results from different tests which may be obtained at the same time (e.g. A1C and FPG), or the same test at two different time points.

Clinical, anthropometric, and laboratory data

We determined anthropometric parameters such as height, weight, BMI, abdominal circumference, and blood pressure and examined biochemical parameters for glycemic balance, i.e. fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and lipid profile (total cholesterol: high-density lipoprotein [HDLc], low-density lipoprotein [LDLc], and triglyceride [TG]); for kidney function, i.e. eGFR, albuminuria, serum creatinine, and creatinine/albumin ratio; and for thyroid gland function, i.e. thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroxine (FT 4), and antithyroid antibodies.

The criteria for the diagnosis of T1DM were fasting plasma glucose levels > 126 mg/dL, symptoms of hyperglycemia (polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss with random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL or 2-h plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL during an oral glucose tolerance test), and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥ 6.5% (≥ 48 mmol/mol). In some cases, the diagnosis was confirmed with low C-peptide levels and presence of one or more autoimmune markers of diabetes autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase, islet antigens (IA2 and IA2-beta), and the zinc transporter ZnT8.

Objective

Our study aims to assess the presentation, prevalence, and associations of acute and chronic complications in subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) at their first visit to outpatient departments.

Study Design and Setting

Study was carried out at two centers, Diabetic Association of Pakistan and WHO Collaborating Centre and Baqai Institute of Diabetology and Endocrinology, Karachi. Records of 591 T1DM subjects divided into two groups were studied. Group 1 (62.1%, n = 367) includes patients with known T1DM and group 2 (n = 224, 37.9%), newly diagnosed T1DM. Clinical features [polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, history of weight loss, and history of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)] were recorded. Biochemical parameters including fasting plasma glucose, 2-h postprandial plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c, urinary ketones, and proteinuria were recorded. Arterial blood gases was done in suspected cases of DKA.

Results

In group 1, male predominance was seen (57.8 vs. 42.2%). Mean age at presentation was 19.1 ± 10 yr. Mean duration of diabetes was 16 ± 9 yr. Two percent subjects presented with DKA, while 21% had a history of DKA. Among the subjects with > 10 yr of diabetes, 20.1% had hypertension, 5.5% had nephropathy, 2.9% had neuropathy, and 7.7% had retinopathy. In group 2, 224 T1DM subjects were identified, with mean age of 17 ± 11 yr. Equal number of males (50.9%) and females (49.1%) were diagnosed at their first presentation. Most subjects (40.8%, n = 91) diagnosed between 11 and 20 yr of age presented with polyuria (81.3%), polydipsia (77.2%), polyphagia (56.7%), and weight loss (79.5%). Ketonuria was positive in 4.9%, while 5.8% presented with DKA.

Conclusions

This is the first study in Pakistan to assess the mode of presentation and prevalence of acute and chronic complications in T1DM. Larger scale prospective studies are needed to have more detailed informative data.

Child with suspected type 2 diabetes — diagnostic criteria and laboratory features include the following: diabetes is defined as fasting blood glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl, 2 hour post prandial glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl after glucose load of 1 gm/ kg (maximum dose: 75 gm), HbA1c ≥ 6.5% or random blood glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl in patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia, and in the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, result should be repeated. Simultaneous c-peptide level is elevated and undetectable pancreatic autoantibodies include islet cell antibodies (ICA), GAD-65, insulin antibodies, IA2A and ZnT8. Most commercial laboratories may have the assays to test for some/ most of the autoantibodies accurately. Should be done after discussion with the endocrinologist. Electrolyte abnormalities include pseudo-hyponatremia (secondary to blood glucose elevation), metabolic acidosis, elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine (secondary to dehydration), and liver function abnormality (secondary to Non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis [NASH]). Children with Type 2 diabetes can present in DKA and are also more likely to present with Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS), both of which are medical emergencies.

Normal: FPG < 100 mg/dL, 2-h PG < 140 mg/dL, and A1C < 5.5%. Prediabetes: impaired fasting glucose (IFG) with FPG ≥ 100 to 125 mg/dL, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) with 2-h PG ≥ 140 to 199 mg/dL, and A1C 5.7% to 6.4% for screening of prediabetes. Diabetes: FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL; 2-h PG ≥ 200 mg/dL or random PG ≥ 200 mg/dL + symptoms; and A1C ≥ 6.5% (secondary). A1C should be used only for screening prediabetes and diagnosis should be confirmed with glucose testing; for diabetes, glucose criteria are preferred, the same test should be repeated on a different day, two abnormal test results from the same sample confirm diagnosis, and a glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL in the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) symptoms does not need confirmation.

### Type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents [^b45fafae]. Pediatrics in Review (2013). Low credibility.

On the basis of strong research evidence and consensus, type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) remains the most common form of DM in children and adolescents. The incidence of type 2 DM in the pediatric population is rapidly increasing because of the obesity epidemic, and minority groups are disproportionately affected. (2) (10) (19) On the basis of some research evidence and consensus, it can be challenging to initially differentiate between type 2 DM and type 1 DM clinically because of the increased prevalence of obesity, the complex interplay of autoimmunity and obesity, and common symptoms at presentation. (1) (10) (19) Significant evidence and consensus support a genetic basis for the development of type 2 DM in children. Physicians should routinely screen at risk children older than age 10 years for DM. Screening criteria include obesity, a family history of type 2 DM, a minority racial or ethnic background, acanthosis nigricans, or other diseases associated with insulin resistance, including polycystic ovary syndrome, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. (1) (10) (18) (19) On the basis of consensus, diagnosis of type 2 DM can be confirmed by an elevated fasting blood glucose level greater than 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/L), an elevated 2-hour plasma glucose greater than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) on an oral glucose tolerance test, an elevated random blood glucose greater than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L), or a hemoglobin A1c level greater than 6.5% with suggestive symptoms. (10) According to strong research evidence and consensus, once the diagnosis has been made, treatment should be based on the acuity of presentation and should focus on lifestyle modification and on normalizing hyperglycemia to minimize complications. Metformin is currently first-line treatment for type 2 DM in children and adolescents older than age 10 years who present nonacutely. (18) (19) Strong research evidence and consensus demonstrate that because type 2 DM has an insidious onset, microvascular and macrovascular complications can be present at the time of diagnosis. Patients should be screened for the presence of complications when the diagnosis of type 2 DM is made and in follow-up. (6) (10).

### Tests of glycemia for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^00146d02]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

This paper discusses tests of glycemia for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, with particular reference to the 1997 diagnostic criteria of the American Diabetes Association. The potential benefits of the lower diagnostic threshold for fasting plasma glucose are not well defined. However, the change in the diagnostic cut-off for diabetes mellitus affects as many as 1.9 million persons in the United States; therefore, the medical and social costs of the lower threshold may be considerable. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is defined by a threshold imposed on the continuous distribution of glycemic levels, typically with respect to risk for microvascular complications. However, the burden of type 2 diabetes relates more to macrovascular than microvascular complications. Because no clear threshold exists for macrovascular complications, a formal balancing of direct and indirect costs with both microvascular and macrovascular complications may be appropriate to establish glycemic thresholds. Because fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and the oral glucose tolerance test all predict diabetic complications yet test reliability is better for fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c than for the oral glucose tolerance test, we suggest an alternative diagnostic approach: If random plasma glucose is elevated (≥ 11.1 mmol/L [200 mg/dL]) and the hemoglobin A1c level is more than 2 SDs above the laboratory mean, then diabetes mellitus should be diagnosed, and management should be based on the hemoglobin A1c level. If the result of only one of these tests is positive, then fasting plasma glucose should be tested to evaluate the patient for impaired fasting glucose and diabetes mellitus. The glycemic threshold for type 2 diabetes should be established by cost-effectiveness analysis. The clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus could be streamlined by incorporation of hemoglobin A1c into established criteria.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^747ef59d]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Fasting or 2-hour plasma glucose testing — In individuals without symptoms, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or 2-hour plasma glucose (2-h PG) can be used for screening and diagnosis of diabetes, while measurement of random plasma glucose is sufficient to diagnose diabetes when symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis are present plus random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL [≥ 11.1 mmol/L]. In nonpregnant individuals, FPG (or A1C) is typically preferred for routine screening due to the ease of administration; however, the 2-h PG (OGTT) testing protocol diagnoses more diabetes than the other two tests and is preferentially recommended for screening for some conditions (e.g., cystic fibrosis-related diabetes or posttransplantation diabetes mellitus). Individuals may have difficulty fasting for the full 8-h period or may misreport their fasting status, and glycolysis and sample handling can affect results; people should follow a mixed eating pattern with at least 150 g of carbohydrates on the 3 days prior to OGTT, and antecedent carbohydrate restriction in the days prior to OGTT can falsely elevate postchallenge glucose levels, potentially resulting in a false-positive OGTT.

Patients and Methods

Patients

All consecutive subjects with symptoms suggestive of PAD or with known CV risk factors who were referred to our angiology unit between 1 July 2014 and 30 June 2015 for ultrasonographic evaluation of the lower limb arteries were recruited for the study. The exclusion criterion was age < 18 years.

CV risk factors included in the statistical model were age, gender, diabetes mellitus status, arterial hypertension status, dyslipidemia status, body mass index (BMI), cigarette smoking modeled as both number (packs per year) and smoking status ('never', 'former' and 'active'), sedentary lifestyle, previous CV events and family history of CV disease. The presence of diabetes mellitus status was determined based on the following indicators: fasting plasma glucose concentration (after 8 or more hours of no caloric intake) ⩾126 mg dL −1; plasma glucose concentration ⩾200 mg dL −1 2 h after ingesting a 75 g oral glucose load in the morning after an overnight fast of at least 8 h; symptoms of hyperglycemia (e.g. polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia) and a random (casual, non-fasting) plasma glucose concentration ⩾200 mg dL −1; or hemoglobin A1c level ⩾6.5%. The presence of arterial hypertension status was defined by systolic blood pressure > 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure > 90 mm Hg or in case of consumption of any antihypertensive drug. The presence of dyslipidemia status was defined by low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level > 130 mg dL −1, total cholesterol level > 200 mg dL −1, triglyceride level > 150 mg dL −1, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level < 50 mg dL −1 or in case of consumption of any lipid-lowering drug.

Choosing specific diabetes interventions and their roles in treating type 2 diabetes

Numerous reviews have focused on the characteristics of the specific diabetes interventions listed below. In addition, meta-analyses and reviews have summarized and compared the glucose-lowering effectiveness and other characteristics of the medications. The aim here is to provide enough information to justify the choices of medications, the order in which they are recommended, and the use of combinations of therapies. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of high-quality studies that provide head-to-head comparisons of the ability of the medications to achieve the currently recommended glycemic levels. The authors highly recommend that such studies be conducted. However, even in the absence of rigorous, comprehensive studies that directly compare the efficacy of all available glucose-lowering treatments and their combinations, we feel that there are enough data regarding the characteristics of the individual interventions to provide the guidelines below.

An important intervention that is likely to improve the probability that a patient will have better long-term control of diabetes is to make the diagnosis early, when the metabolic abnormalities of diabetes are usually less severe. Lower levels of glycemia at the time of initial therapy are associated with lower A1C levels over time and decreased long-term complications.

### Consensus report: definition and interpretation of remission in type 2 diabetes [^22746634]. Diabetes Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Improvement of glucose levels into the normal range can occur in some people living with diabetes, either spontaneously or after medical interventions, and in some cases can persist after withdrawal of glucose-lowering pharmacotherapy. Such sustained improvement may now be occurring more often due to newer forms of treatment. However, terminology for describing this process and objective measures for defining it are not well established, and the long-term risks versus benefits of its attainment are not well understood. To update prior discussions of this issue, an international expert group was convened by the American Diabetes Association to propose nomenclature and principles for data collection and analysis, with the goal of establishing a base of information to support future clinical guidance. This group proposed "remission" as the most appropriate descriptive term, and HbA1c < 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) measured at least 3 months after cessation of glucose-lowering pharmacotherapy as the usual diagnostic criterion. The group also made suggestions for active observation of individuals experiencing a remission and discussed further questions and unmet needs regarding predictors and outcomes of remission.

### Approach to the pediatric patient: central diabetes insipidus [^e21ccd91]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a complex disorder in which large volumes of dilute urine are excreted due to arginine-vasopressin deficiency, and it is caused by a variety of disorders affecting the hypothalamic-posterior pituitary network. The differential diagnosis is challenging and requires a detailed medical history, physical examination, biochemical approach, imaging studies, and, in some cases, histological confirmation. Magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard method for evaluating congenital or acquired cerebral and pituitary stalk lesions. Pituitary stalk size at presentation could be normal, but it may change over time, depending on the underlying condition, while other brain areas or organs may become involved during follow-up. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to avoid central nervous system damage and germ cell tumor dissemination and to minimize complications of multiple pituitary hormone defects. We provide a practical update on the diagnosis and management of patients with CDI and highlight several pitfalls that may complicate the differential diagnosis of conditions presenting with polyuria and polydipsia. The need for a careful and close follow-up of patients with apparently idiopathic CDI is particularly emphasized because the underlying condition may be recognized over time. The clinical scenario that we outline at the beginning of this article represents the basis for the discussion about how the etiological diagnosis of CDI can be overlooked and demonstrates how a water intake and urine output improvement can be a sign of progressive damage of both hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland with associated pituitary hormonal deficiencies.

Materials and methods

Study population

This retrospective study included patients who had a successful kidney transplant from a living or deceased donor between May 2010 and December 2013. The study population consisted of 128 consecutive adult patients treated with CNI with at least two years of follow-up. Patients were divided into groups based on the type of CNI treatment, including CsA (n = 60) and Tac (n = 68) groups. The study was conducted in accordance with local Good Clinical Practice guidelines and current legislations, while permission was obtained from the institutional ethics committee to use patient data for publication purposes (Date of Approval: 12/08/2014; Reference number/Protocol No: 2014–15/20).

Assessments

Data on patient demographics (age, gender) and clinical characteristics (primary diagnosis, transplant type, diabetes mellitus treatment, post-transplant diabetes mellitus and hypertension) were retrieved from hospital records. Data on blood glucose (mg/dL) and creatinine (mg/dL) levels, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; mL/min/1.73 m2), total-cholesterol (mg/dL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (mg/dL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (mg/dL) and triglyceride (mg/dL) levels, systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure (mmHg) levels and anthropometric measurements (height [m], body weight [kg], BMI [kg/m2], body fat percentage [BF%, %], WaC [cm], HC [cm], WHR, wrist circumference [WrC, cm] and neck circumference [NC, cm]) were recorded in each patient both in the pre-transplant and post-transplant 4-year follow-up periods (1st, 3rd, 6th, 12th, 24th, 36th and 48th months). Post-transplant diabetes diagnosis was made using the American Diabetes Association diagnostic criteria; symptoms of diabetes (polyuria, polydipsia and unexplained weight loss) plus random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL or fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL or 2-h plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL during an oral glucose tolerance test or HbA1c ≥ 6.5%. Study parameters were compared in CsA and Tac treatment groups.

### Delay in diagnosis of diabetes is not the patient's fault [^269f4a23]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Previous reports have suggested that onset of diabetes occurs 4–7 years before clinical diagnosis. However, it is not known whether delay in diagnosis reflects patient factors, such as lack of medical visits or glucose measurements, or provider factors, such as clinical inertia.

We reviewed the charts of 50 patients selected for delayed diagnosis at the Atlanta Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center. Date of first diabetes range hyperglycemia (D1) was defined by outpatient fasting plasma glucose (0630–1000 h) ≥ 126 mg/dl, random glucose (1001–1800 h) ≥ 200 mg/dl, 2-h post–oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl, or A1C ≥ 6.5%. Date of second diabetes range hyperglycemia (D2) was defined by having any two of these values or any value twice. The date of diagnosis was defined by initial use of ICD-9 code 250.xx at a primary care visit, any use of the code twice, and/or initial prescription of a diabetes drug — criteria establishing the disease. Inpatient values were excluded to avoid confounding by stress hyperglycemia.

The patients were all men, with average age 66 ± 10 years (mean ± SD). The delay between initial hyperglycemia (D1) and the diagnosis date averaged 3.7 ± 1.1 years, and the delay after D2 averaged 1.8 ± 1.7 years. During the delay from D2 to diagnosis (four patients had no D2), patients averaged 9 ± 11 outpatient plasma glucose and 2 ± 2 A1C measurements; for each patient 46% of the fasting plasma glucose values were > 125 mg/dl, 20% of the random glucose values were ≥ 200 mg/dl, and 62% of the A1C values were ≥ 6.5%. During the delay after D2, patients averaged 8 ± 8 outpatient visits, of which 5 ± 4 were to primary care. Patients were seen by a wide range of various primary care physicians, nurse specialists, and physician assistants. In 60% of cases, the primary care provider's note mentioned hyperglycemia without a diagnosis or follow-up plan, and often subsequent notes would not mention glucose again despite continued elevations; 46% of patients had glucose levels > 125 mg/dl entered into the note without mention of hyperglycemia. Only two patients had OGTTs (both with normal fasting but elevated 2-h glucose levels). Only five patients (10%) were recorded as missing scheduled appointments, and there was no documentation of patients missing blood tests.

### Approach to the patient: "Utility of the copeptin assay" [^00a97e15]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Back to Patient Presentation

Although the water deprivation test initially indicated partial diabetes insipidus, the further course of the disease under desmopressin treatment was suspicious for primary polydipsia. Therefore, our patient underwent the hypertonic saline infusion test for further evaluation. During osmotic stimulation to a plasma sodium level of 150 mmol/L, his copeptin level rose to 16 pmol/L. Accordingly, the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus was revised to primary polydipsia and the patient referred to our colleagues from the psychosomatic department. With their help, the patient was able to slowly decrease his daily fluid intake to 3 L per day. During the last follow-up, the sodium levels remained stable and the patient reported wellbeing. Occasionally, he felt an increased sense of thirst, but he learned to deal with it.

This case illustrates that clinical signs and symptoms, such as severe polyuria–polydipsia with a high daily fluid intake or nocturia that are sometimes described as characteristic of diabetes insipidus, are unspecific. Similarly, the magnetic resonance imaging finding "absence of posterior pituitary bright spot" is not specific for central diabetes insipidus as the bright spot is also invisible in up to 40% of primary polydipsia patients (compared to 70% of patients with central diabetes insipidus).

Several observations during the water deprivation test wrongly led to the diagnosis of partial diabetes insipidus: high amount of polyuria and loss of body weight, moderate increase of urine osmolality during test period and good urine osmolality response to desmopressin. At this point it must be mentioned that the diagnostic criteria of the water deprivation test were based on data from only 36 patients and, unsurprisingly, the overall diagnostic accuracy of this test is very poor (diagnostic accuracy 70%). Moreover, to reliably interpret AVP action or urine concentration capacity, a hypernatremic state has to be reached. This is often not the case during the water deprivation test, as exemplified by our case. With the hypertonic saline test, a hypernatremic state is ensured and the measurement of stimulated copeptin values increases the diagnostic accuracy of the test to 97%.
