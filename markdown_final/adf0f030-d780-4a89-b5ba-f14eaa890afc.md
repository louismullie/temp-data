## Question

What are the indications for intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy in pediatric ITP patients requiring hospitalization?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the indications for intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy in pediatric ITP patients who require hospitalization. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about why the child is hospitalized and how that constrains treatment choices. Then, I should verify bleeding severity and the role of platelet count versus clinical phenotype. Next, I will examine first-line therapy hierarchies, including observation, corticosteroids, and when to escalate to IVIG. After that, I should review IVIG dosing, expected response, and alternatives like anti-D immunoglobulin. I will then consider special situations such as steroid contraindications, pre-procedural platelet augmentation, and combination therapy in emergencies. Finally, I should integrate cost, safety, and guideline alignment, and summarize practical indications with dosing and monitoring recommendations, while double-checking any areas of uncertainty along the way.

> Let me first confirm the hospitalization context because that shapes everything else. Children are often admitted for social reasons, diagnostic uncertainty, proximity to care, or significant bleeding rather than the platelet count alone, and ASH allows outpatient management even with platelets less than 20 × 10⁹/L if bleeding is mild and reliable follow-up is assured, so I should not jump to IVIG just because of a low platelet number without correlating bleeding risk and logistics [^114Lnky9] [^112ryBN8] [^116zbHVN].

> Next, I should review bleeding severity carefully, since this drives treatment intensity. ASH uses a practical approach that treats no/minor bleeding differently from non–life-threatening mucosal bleeding and from life-threatening bleeding, and although tools like the Khellaf score can quantify severity, they are not universally adopted, so I need to translate clinical bleeding (wet purpura, epistaxis requiring intervention, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria) into a decision framework without over-relying on a single score [^113F98aM] [^1178eyVq] [^116s8z4q].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. If there is no or only minor bleeding (petechiae, bruising, scant oral petechiae), I should prioritize observation over IVIG because ASH makes a strong recommendation for observation and highlights harms of IVIG such as hemolysis and thrombosis, with observational data showing similar or lower bleeding and mortality with observation compared with IVIG in this low-risk population, so IVIG is not indicated here solely on the basis of low platelets [^1151ipGW] [^111Jyb56] [^115GWXNF].

> Now, for non–life-threatening mucosal bleeding or impaired quality of life, I need to check first-line pharmacotherapy choices. ASH suggests corticosteroids rather than IVIG when a short steroid course is acceptable, given lower cost, outpatient feasibility, and fewer serious adverse effects, though IVIG or anti-D are reasonable alternatives if steroids are contraindicated or if a faster platelet rise is needed, so I should individualize based on comorbidity, prior response, and urgency of platelet recovery [^112JwNFP] [^113XhQNn] [^113F98aM].

> Wait, let me verify the emergency indications. In life-threatening bleeding or when a very rapid platelet increase is required, IVIG is appropriate and often combined with corticosteroids and platelet transfusion, with evidence that adding IV methylprednisolone to IVIG accelerates platelet recovery compared with IVIG alone, and transfusion guidelines support platelets plus IVIG for serious bleeding in ITP, so I should not hesitate to use combination therapy in this setting [^112Ukbkw] [^117AV48T] [^114fbTnT].

> I will now examine IVIG dosing and expected kinetics. Standard pediatric dosing is 0.8–1 g/kg as a single dose or 2 g/kg divided over 2–5 days, with platelet responses typically beginning within 24–72 hours, and recent meta-analyses suggest that lower total doses around 1 g/kg may achieve similar early response rates to 2 g/kg, which can mitigate cost and adverse effects, so if rapid effect is needed but bleeding is not catastrophic, a single 1 g/kg dose is reasonable to try first with reassessment at 24–48 hours [^114dzC46] [^1151sWeX] [^115tsSYc].

> But wait, what if anti-D immunoglobulin is considered instead of IVIG? I should double-check comparative efficacy and safety. Randomized and observational pediatric data show anti-D can achieve platelet increases comparable to IVIG in many children with shorter infusion times and fewer infusion-related symptoms, yet hemolysis is more frequent with anti-D and both carry boxed warnings, so anti-D is a valid alternative when Rh-positive, hemoglobin is adequate, and close monitoring for hemolysis is feasible, whereas IVIG may be preferred when a faster or more robust early rise is desired or anti-D is contraindicated [^1116hNph] [^117RVuVF] [^114SZ95G].

> Let me consider special scenarios that commonly trigger inpatient IVIG. If corticosteroids are contraindicated or have failed, IVIG is appropriate for nonmajor mucosal bleeding or pre-procedural platelet augmentation, and French practice-based data support IVIG use in steroid-resistant cases and in preparation for invasive procedures, reinforcing that the indication is contextual rather than platelet-count driven alone [^1178eyVq] [^116KhxZo] [^1137oes2].

> I should confirm that combination therapy has a role when time to hemostasis is critical. The randomized data show faster platelet rises with IV methylprednisolone plus IVIG versus IVIG alone, and although the sample is small, the directionality is consistent with clinical experience in severe bleeding, so in critical scenarios I would pair IVIG with high-dose steroids and add platelet transfusion per transfusion guidance while arranging close monitoring for hemolysis, thrombosis, and renal function [^112Ukbkw] [^117AV48T] [^112KNx5P].

> Next, I should review cost and safety because these influence inpatient decisions. IVIG is expensive, often requires inpatient administration for high-dose regimens, and carries risks including hemolysis, aseptic meningitis, thrombosis, and renal dysfunction, whereas low-dose strategies appear to have fewer adverse reactions without sacrificing early efficacy, so using the lowest effective dose and shortest duration is prudent, especially outside of emergencies [^115tsSYc] [^114dzC46] [^112KNx5P].

> Hold on, I should verify alignment with guidelines and evolving evidence. ASH 2019 remains the anchor, and subsequent reviews reaffirm observation for no/minor bleeding, corticosteroids preferred for nonmajor mucosal bleeding, and IVIG reserved for specific indications or emergencies, with newer pediatric data suggesting observation strategies are safe and that early IVIG does not clearly change long-term chronicity, which supports a conservative approach when bleeding risk is low [^1151ipGW] [^111a5SyC] [^115oJUss].

> Let me synthesize practical indications for IVIG in hospitalized pediatric ITP. IVIG is indicated for life-threatening bleeding as part of a combination regimen with corticosteroids and platelet transfusion, for non–life-threatening mucosal bleeding when corticosteroids are contraindicated or have failed, and for urgent pre-procedural platelet augmentation when a rapid rise is required, whereas IVIG is not indicated for no or minor bleeding where observation or corticosteroids are preferred, and I should document the clinical rationale clearly to align with guideline intent [^112Ukbkw] [^117AV48T] [^113F98aM] [^1178eyVq].

> I should double-check dosing and monitoring details. A single dose of 1 g/kg IVIG is reasonable initially with reassessment at 24–48 hours, repeating once if the response is inadequate, while monitoring for headache, hemolysis, renal function, and thrombosis risk, and if anti-D is used instead, ensure hemoglobin is above 10 g/dL, observe for 8 hours post-infusion for hemolysis, and provide hydration, adjusting the plan based on clinical response and bleeding control [^114dzC46] [^115tsSYc] [^1161ywdJ].

> Finally, I need to ensure discharge planning reflects that IVIG provides a transient effect lasting 2–4 weeks, so ongoing management should pivot back to observation or corticosteroids as appropriate, with clear return precautions and follow-up, and I should remember that most children recover spontaneously, so the threshold for repeated IVIG outside emergencies should remain high to avoid overtreatment and unnecessary risks [^116nRSsj] [^1127iFMA] [^1151ipGW].

IVIG is indicated in pediatric ITP when there is **life-threatening bleeding** (e.g. intracranial hemorrhage, major GI bleeding) [^114EYXaS] or when a **rapid platelet rise** is needed (e.g. before urgent surgery or procedures) [^117AV48T]. It is also appropriate for **severe mucosal bleeding** or when first-line corticosteroids are contraindicated or have failed [^113F98aM] [^112zaWuA]. IVIG is not recommended for children with no or minor bleeding, where observation is preferred [^1151ipGW]. Typical dosing is 0.8–1 g/kg as a single dose, repeated once if needed; monitor for infusion reactions, hemolysis, and thrombosis [^114SZ95G] [^112KNx5P].

## Indications for IVIG in pediatric ITP requiring hospitalization

### Life-threatening bleeding

For life-threatening bleeding, such as **intracranial hemorrhage**, **major gastrointestinal bleeding**, or **severe pulmonary hemorrhage**, IVIG is indicated to rapidly increase platelet count and control bleeding [^114EYXaS] [^117AV48T]. The **need for a rapid platelet rise** arises when an urgent procedure or surgery is required and a quick increase is essential for hemostasis [^112zaWuA].

---

### Severe mucosal bleeding

Wet purpura with **oral mucosal bleeding**, epistaxis, or menorrhagia warrants IVIG when bleeding is significant or persistent [^113F98aM] [^117AV48T]. The **failure or contraindication of corticosteroids** — when first-line steroids are not tolerated or ineffective — also supports IVIG use [^112zaWuA] [^1178eyVq].

---

## Situations where IVIG is not recommended

In children with newly diagnosed ITP who have no or minor bleeding, **observation is preferred** over IVIG or corticosteroids [^1151ipGW] [^112AyCb8]. When **bleeding is minor or cutaneous only**, observation is appropriate unless additional risk factors are present [^111Jyb56].

---

## Dosing and administration of IVIG

- **Standard dosing**: 0.8–1 g/kg IV as a single dose; repeat once if needed based on response [^115GWXNF] [^112KNx5P].
- **Infusion**: Dilute to 5% and infuse over 2–4 hours; slower rates reduce reaction risk [^112KNx5P].
- **Monitoring**: Watch for infusion reactions, hemolysis, and thrombosis; check renal function and hemoglobin/hematocrit post-infusion [^114SZ95G] [^112KNx5P].

---

## Clinical outcomes and response rates

The **early platelet response** is typically a rise to ≥ 20 × 10⁹/L within 24–72 hours, with many reaching > 50 × 10⁹/L within 1–3 days. The **duration of response** is transient, often lasting 2–4 weeks, necessitating close follow-up and additional therapy as needed [^116nRSsj].

---

## Safety considerations and adverse effects

- **Infusion reactions**: Headache, fever, chills, and nausea are common; premedication with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine may help [^116nRSsj].
- **Hemolysis**: Risk is higher with anti-D; monitor hemoglobin and DAT in Rh-negative patients [^114SZ95G].
- **Thrombosis**: Rare but serious; assess and mitigate risk factors before infusion [^112KNx5P].

## Comparison with other first-line therapies

| **Attribute** | **IVIG** | **Corticosteroids** | **Anti-D immunoglobulin** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mechanism | Fc blockade | Immune suppression | Fc blockade |
| Onset | Rapid (24–72 h) | Moderate (2–7 d) | Rapid (24–72 h) |
| Duration | Short (2–4 wk) | Variable | Short (2–4 wk) |
| Adverse effects | Hemolysis, thrombosis, reactions | Hyperglycemia, mood changes, infections | Hemolysis, anemia |
| Cost | High | Low | Moderate |

---

IVIG is preferred when a **rapid rise** is needed or steroids are contraindicated; corticosteroids are preferred for nonurgent cases with non-life-threatening bleeding [^113F98aM] [^113XhQNn].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

- **ASH 2019**: Strongly recommends observation for children with no or minor bleeding; IVIG for severe bleeding or when rapid rise is needed [^1151ipGW].
- **French guidelines**: Use Khellaf bleeding score; IVIG when score > 8 or steroid-resistant cases [^1178eyVq].
- **Consensus**: IVIG is a key option for severe bleeding, steroid failure, or urgent procedures in children [^116s8z4q].

---

IVIG is indicated in pediatric ITP for **life-threatening bleeding**, **severe mucosal bleeding**, or when a **rapid platelet rise** is needed; it is not recommended for no or minor bleeding, where observation is preferred. Dosing is 0.8–1 g/kg IV, repeated once if needed, with monitoring for infusion reactions, hemolysis, and thrombosis [^113F98aM] [^115oJUss] [^112zaWuA] [^116MmeKR].

### Evidence for the use of intravenous immunoglobulins – a review of the literature [^11485dpB]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) were first introduced in the middle of the twentieth century for the treatment of primary immunodeficiencies. In 1981, Paul Imbach noticed an improvement of immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, in patients receiving IVIg for immunodeficiencies. This opened a new era for the treatment of autoimmune conditions with IVIg. Since then, IVIg has become an important treatment option in a wide spectrum of diseases, including autoimmune and acute inflammatory conditions, most of them off-label (not included in the US Food and Drug Administration recommendation). A panel of immunologists and internists with experience in IVIg therapy reviewed the medical literature for published data concerning treatment with IVIg. The quality of evidence was assessed, and a summary of the available relevant literature in each disease was given. To our knowledge, this is the first all-inclusive comprehensive review, developed to assist the clinician when considering the use of IVIg in autoimmune diseases, immune deficiencies, and other conditions.

### Anti-D immunoglobulin therapy for pediatric ITP: before and after the FDA's black box warning [^114HQxBd]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

In March 2010, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a black box warning for anti-D immunoglobulin (anti-D), an approved treatment for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). It is unknown if and how clinical practice at U.S children's hospitals has since changed. We sought to describe inpatient anti-D usage, laboratory monitoring, and anti-D complications before and after the FDA warning. Using the Pediatric Health Information System, we collected data from 41 children's hospitals. There was a modest but statistically significant decrease in anti-D usage from pre-warning to post-warning. Severe complication rates were very low and did not change appreciably.

### Management of children with persistent ITP, A novel approach… [^111tE1M1]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Overview The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if mini-pool intravenous immunoglobulin is a safe and effective treatment for children with persistent immune thrombocytopenia. ITP is a condition that causes low platelet levels and increases the risk of bleeding. The main questions this study aims to answer are: Can mini-pool IVIG raise platelet levels in children with persistent ITP. Can it reduce bleeding episodes and hospital visits. What side effects, if any, are seen with this treatment. There is no comparison group in this study. All participants will receive mini-pool IVIG, which is made from small pools of donated plasma using a cost-effective process. Participants will: Receive one dose of mini-pool IVIG through a vein over 6 to 8 hours Receive follow-up doses every 2 to 4 weeks for up to 5 doses, based on their platelet count Have regular blood tests and checkups during the study and for 6 months after treatment.

Report on bleeding episodes, physical activity, school attendance, and side effects Immune thrombocytopenia is an autoimmune condition where the immune system destroys platelets, leading to low platelet counts and increased risk of bleeding. Persistent ITP is defined as ongoing thrombocytopenia lasting 3 to 12 months after initial diagnosis. Children with persistent ITP who lose their response to first-line treatments, such as steroids or standard intravenous immunoglobulin, have limited therapeutic options, especially in low- and middle-income countries, due to the high cost of commercial IVIG preparations. Mini-pool IVIG is produced from small pools of plasma collected locally, using a validated process with virus inactivation and IgG purification steps. This method enables safe, cost-effective preparation of IVIG in resource-limited settings.

Prior research has shown that mini-pool IVIG is effective and well-tolerated in acute pediatric ITP, but its role as a second-line therapy for persistent ITP has not been evaluated. This multicenter, prospective clinical trial will enroll 20 children aged 1 to 10 years with persistent ITP at three tertiary care pediatric hematology centers in Egypt. Participants will receive a loading dose of mini-pool IVIG at 1 g/kg, followed by maintenance doses of 0. 5 g/kg every 2 to 4 weeks for up to five additional doses, with dose intervals adjusted based on platelet counts. Throughout the study, participants will undergo regular blood counts, bleeding assessments using the Bleeding Assessment Tool, and monitoring for infusion-related or delayed adverse events. Data on school attendance, physical activity, and patient or family satisfaction will also be collected.

Responses to therapy will be classified as complete response, response, or no response based on platelet count thresholds and bleeding status, with response duration measured from achievement of CR or R to loss of response. Participants achieving sustained response off therapy or response off therapy during the 6-month post-treatment follow-up will be identified to evaluate durability of treatment effects. This study aims to provide evidence on the safety and efficacy of mini-pool IVIG as a second-line therapy for persistent pediatric ITP, potentially offering an affordable and effective treatment alternative in settings where standard IVIG is inaccessible due to cost.

### Critical bleeding in adults and children with immune thrombocytopenia: a multicenter cohort study [^114fbTnT]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

In this multicenter study, we described the characteristics, management, and outcomes of a cohort of patients with ITP who experienced a critical bleed. Our data collection spans a long time horizon (10 years) and multiple centers in the United States and Canada. Strengths of this study include the strict eligibility criteria, careful methods for accurate data collection, and the use of a specific definition to identify the most severe bleeding events. The inclusion of both adults and children was justified by similar strategies that can be applied to both age groups. Characterizing critical bleeds and mortality according to different factors in adults and children will help identify the risk groups prone to developing critical bleeds and experiencing the worst outcomes. Limitations of this study include the lack of statistical inferences that can be made from this small data set and insufficient data to determine treatment effects. Although our sample frame was broad, it included only urban academic centers, which limits the generalizability of our findings to smaller ERs, where access to certain treatments, such as platelet transfusions and IV immunoglobulin, may be more limited, and to health care settings where patients bypass the ER and are directly admitted to hospital.

Our results highlight the variation in treatment approaches across patients, emphasizing the need for a standardized management protocol to reduce delays and optimize care. In addition, our data strengthen the existing evidence regarding treatment approaches used and provide valuable insights into treatment timeliness, patient characteristics, and associated outcomes, which are critical in clinical decision-making. The results from this cohort study will contribute to a clinical practice guideline for emergency management of critical bleeding in ITP patients, alongside systematic reviews of both randomized and observational studies.

In conclusion, critical bleeds in patients with ITP were rare, but the rate was higher in adults than children, representing 5.1% vs 1.4% of patients with ITP presenting to the ER with severe thrombocytopenia. The rate of critical bleeds was higher in adults with comorbidities and in both adults and children with chronic ITP. Treatments of critical bleeds included corticosteroids, IV immunoglobulin, and platelet transfusion often administered in combination and often with adjunctive use of TPO-RAs and tranexamic acid. Median time from presentation to ER to first ITP treatment was longer for adults than for children. Mortality was higher in adults than in children, in older patients, and in those whose treatment was delayed. A standardized approach to the management of critical bleeds in patients with ITP is needed to optimize treatment and avoid adverse health outcomes associated with this hematologic emergency.

### Intravenous immunoglobulin in acute immune thrombocytopenia… [^116nL74A]. publications.aap.org (2018). Low credibility.

Source: Investigators from multiple institutions in the Netherlands conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine the effect of intravenous immunoglobulin treatment for immune thrombocytopenia on the development of chronic ITP. Children were eligible if they were 3 months to 16 years old, had newly diagnosed ITP, had a platelet count of ≤ 20 × 10. 9/L, and had mild or moderate bleeding according to standardized bleeding score assessments. Participants were randomized to a treatment arm, in which they received a single dose of IVIG, or an observation arm, in which they were carefully observed and only received immunomodulatory treatment if they developed severe bleeding. Demographic and clinical data were collected at enrollment; data regarding symptoms, laboratory results, and clinical course were collected at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after diagnosis.

The primary outcome was development of chronic ITP, defined as either a platelet count of < 150 × 10 9/L 6 months after diagnosis or a platelet count of < 100 × 10 9/L 12 months after diagnosis. Complete response was defined as a platelet count > 100 × 10 9/L and was assessed at each study visit. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, particularly severe bleeding events by 12 months, as determined by standardized bleeding score assessments. Investigators calculated the relative risks of outcomes among participants in the treatment versus observation arm, using the intention to treat principle. There were 200 participants included in analysis. There were no significant differences in demographic and clinical characteristics of participants by arm at baseline. There was no significant difference in the development of chronic ITP among participants by arm using either chronic ITP definition.

Complete response rates were significantly higher in the treatment versus observation group at 1 week and 3 months but were not significantly different at 6 or 12 months. There were severe bleeding events in 9% of participants in the observation arm and 1% in the treatment arm. The investigators conclude that treatment of ITP with IVIG does not reduce the development of chronic ITP in children. Dr Hogan has disclosed no financial relationship relevant to this commentary. This commentary does not contain a discussion of an unapproved/investigative use of a commercial product/device. Since 2011, chronic ITP in childhood has been defined as a platelet count < 100, 000/uL 12 months from initial ITP diagnosis. 1 Of children with acute ITP, approximately 20% will progress to chronic.

2 Within the next 5 years, about one-third of children with chronic ITP will self-resolve, one-third will intermittently require treatment for bleeding, and one-third will need regular intervention to prevent bleeding. 3 Affected children are impacted by fatigue, bleeding risks of varying severity, additional.

### When is the use of intravenous immunoglobulin appropriate in immune thrombocytopenia? [^1161EER1]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our study shows excellent overall compliance of IVIg use in ITP with French guidelines, with further studies to be performed to extend the study to non‐expert centres. Nevertheless, we highlighted room for improvement, with a probable need to include concomitant anti‐coagulant treatment in IVIg prescription algorithms and, on the other hand, greatly reduce the weight attributed to age in this indication. The conclusions from this retrospective study warrant further, prospective, studies in order to best adjust the Khellaf bleeding score to treat ITP patients efficiently, while preserving precious IVIg products.

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia [^112JwNFP]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

Recommendation 18 — children with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and non–life-threatening mucosal bleeding and/or diminished health-related quality of life (HRQoL): In children with newly diagnosed ITP who have non–life-threatening mucosal bleeding and/or diminished HRQoL, the ASH guideline panel suggests corticosteroids rather than IVIG (conditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence of effects ⊕⊕◯◯). This recommendation assumes that a short course of corticosteroids is being used for treatment and is reserved only for children with non-major mucosal bleeding. The panel did not prioritize any harms a priori and therefore the undesirable effects were determined to be unknown; IVIG is associated with a black box warning for associated thrombosis and renal failure, and IVIG has high costs compared with a short course of corticosteroids with administration often requiring inpatient admission.

### Second-line therapies in immune thrombocytopenia [^111eGF6X]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare, acquired autoimmune condition characterized by a low platelet count and an increased risk of bleeding. Although many children and adults with ITP will not need therapy beyond historic first-line treatments of observation, steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and anti-D globulin, others will have an indication for second-line treatment. Selecting a second-line therapy depends on the reason for treatment, which can vary from bleeding to implications for health-related quality of life (HRQoL) to likelihood of remission and patient preference with regard to adverse effects, route of administration, and cost. Published studies of these treatments are limited by lack of comparative trials, in addition to inconsistent outcome measures, definitions, and efficacy endpoints. This article provides an up-to-date comparison of the second-line treatments, highlighting important outcome measures including bleeding, HRQoL, fatigue, and platelet counts, which influence treatment selection in a shared decision-making model.

### When is the use of intravenous immunoglobulin appropriate in immune thrombocytopenia? [^1178eyVq]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is the gold standard treatment for severe cases of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). However, its cost, limited duration of efficacy and market supply tension have led French guidelines to reserve IVIg for ITP patients with formal contra‐indications to corticosteroids, with French bleeding score ('Khellaf score') > 8, and corticosteroid‐resistant patients either with Khellaf score ≤ 8 or in preparation for an invasive procedure or during pregnancy. We studied the prescribing practices of IVIg for ITP in real‐life conditions and assessed their compliance with French guidelines. A monocentric retrospective study was conducted between 2016 and 2020 among 114 patients hospitalized in our unit, for a total of 208 IVIg treatments. In 37% of cases, the Khellaf score was > 8, validating IVIg prescription according to French guidelines. In the remaining cases, reasons noted for use of IVIg included corticosteroid resistance (33.7%), preparation for an invasive procedure (8.5%), context of pregnancy (6.6%) and contra‐indication to corticosteroids (3.3%). After analysis, IVIg prescription was considered valid according to current French guidelines in 84.4% of cases. Non‐compliant IVIg prescription was more frequent in younger patients (p = 0.027). Concomitant anti‐coagulation was also noted as an argument for IVIg prescription outside of the current French guidelines.

INTRODUCTION

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an auto‐immune disorder characterized by an isolated thrombocytopenia (platelets < 100 × 10 9 /L) in the absence of other aetiologies. The main issue at the heart of ITP patient management is an increased bleeding risk, which guides treatment indications. Corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) are the cornerstone of first‐line treatment in ITP. There is a consensus in international guidelines that IVIg should be reserved for the most severe forms and in preparation for surgery in patients resistant to corticosteroids. It has been shown that in emergency situations with a platelet count < 20 × 10 9 /L, response to IVIg is faster, more important and more frequent than that obtained with corticosteroids. However, even if all guidelines clearly place IVIg as the reference treatment in severe ITP, there are no clear recommendations as to its indications and the assessment of bleeding severity is most often left to the discretion of the physician, with no consensual bleeding score. A widely accepted and validated bleeding measurement tool specific to adult ITP is lacking, with the literature identifying at least 12 different definitions of 'severe bleeding'. Hence, the classification of bleeding severity in patients with ITP remains unstandardized and is a challenge.

Key Points

- Although rare, critical ITP bleeding was fatal (47% of adults; 15% of children), with higher mortality in older cases and delayed treatment.
- The combination of corticosteroids, IV immunoglobulin, and platelet transfusion was the most common treatment for critical ITP bleeding.

### Treatment landscape in pediatric immune thrombocytopenia: addressing unmet needs [^112kENm6]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is associated with a multifaceted burden on children and their parents/caregivers due to bleeding, fatigue, activity restrictions, and psychological distress. Most children recover within 12 months, but up to 30% develop chronic ITP. While emergent therapies, such as steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin, are effective in many children and transiently raise platelet counts, 38–47% of children require subsequent therapies. The choice of subsequent therapy for individual children with ITP is often complex and the absence of head-to-head comparisons of available therapies and the use of nonstandardized outcomes in randomized clinical trials complicates treatment decisions. Furthermore, medication access varies globally and by age. Additional unmet needs in pediatric ITP include a lack of support and educational resources allowing children and parents/caregivers to effectively participate in treatment decisions, inadequate prediction of treatment response and disease chronicity, heterogeneous approaches to diagnostic evaluation of ITP, scarcity of novel treatments for children unresponsive to current therapies, and the need for a multispecialty approach to support the mental health of children and their families. This review summarizes the known impact of ITP on children and their families, current treatment strategies, and unmet needs in pediatric ITP.

### Immunoglobulins act as predictors of chronicity in pediatric immune thrombocytopenia [^113NpLVg]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

TO THE EDITOR:

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare autoimmune bleeding disorder in children with an incidence of 5 per 100 000 children per year. Children typically present with thrombocytopenia and variable bleeding symptoms, rarely including severe bleeding, such as intracranial hemorrhage. Chronic ITP (cITP), with persistence > 12 months, occurs in 20% to 30% of patients and is associated with decreased quality of life and an increased need for second-line treatments. Identifying patients at risk for cITP can help providers recognize those who require early investigation for secondary causes of ITP and those in whom earlier interventions may help alter the disease course and overall outcomes. Older age is a well-documented risk factor for cITP. The lack of an identifiable trigger or mucosal bleeding, higher platelet count, and positive direct antiglobulin test at diagnosis have also been associated with the development of cITP. However, the definitive predictors of chronicity at the time of ITP diagnosis remain largely unknown.

### Can low-dose intravenous immunoglobulin be an alternative to high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin in the treatment of children with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113qtcTr]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune hemorrhagic disease characterized by decreased platelet counts (< 100 × 10 9 /L) and coagulation function due to immune-mediated platelet destruction and impaired platelet production. It is the most common cause of thrombocytopenia in childhood, with an estimated incidence of approximately 1.9–6.4 per 100,000 children per year.

New onset of epistaxis, gingival bleeding, petechiae, and ecchymoses is typical in pediatric patients at diagnosis, many of whom will experience spontaneous resolution and will not require medical treatment. However, about 20.2% of children may develop severe bleeding, adversely affecting the health-related quality of life and need medical treatment.

Currently, the treatment of ITP is not strictly regimented. First-line therapy for children with newly diagnosed ITP typically consists of glucocorticoids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), or a combination of both. IVIg is a blood product prepared from the serum of many healthy donors, containing microbial antigens, autoantigens, and anti-idiotype antibodies. Studies about the pharmacological mechanism have indicated that IVIg inhibits the Fc-mediated phagocytosis of antibody-coated platelets by the reticuloendothelial system, meanwhile encouraging the development or activation of T cells and regulating the function of B cells, thereby protecting platelets and suppressing autoimmune responses. Recently, Schmugge et al. identified that IVIg may have the ability to improve thrombin-induced platelet activation and enhance thrombin generation in a prospective observational study of 23 children with newly diagnosed ITP, indicating that besides increasing platelet counts, IVIg treatment helps to counteract diminished platelet function and coagulation.

Our objectives were to describe the prescribing practices of IVIg in ITP, to assess their compliance with national guidelines and to identify the potential factors associated with prescriptions outside recommendations. To do so, we performed a real‐life, retrospective monocentric pilot study of patients hospitalized for ITP who had received IVIg in this indication between 2016 and 2020 in the internal medicine unit of the Henri Mondor Hospital in Créteil, France.

### Patterns of inpatient care for newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia in US children's hospitals [^116UfEmF]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Although recent evidence-based guidelines for the management of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) recommend a conservative, observation-based approach for the majority of patients with newly diagnosed pediatric ITP, current practice patterns are unknown. This study used the Pediatric Health Information System database to examine patterns of inpatient care in newly diagnosed ITP in freestanding US children's hospitals and to examine geographic differences in care.

Methods

Data were extracted from Pediatric Health Information System for all newly diagnosed ITP admissions aged 1 to 18 years discharged between January 2008 and December 2010. Clinical data obtained included age, gender, length of stay, diagnoses, medications, and discharge status.

Results

We identified 2314 unique patients meeting the study diagnosis of newly diagnosed ITP. Noncutaneous bleeding occurred in 12% of patients (intracranial hemorrhage 0.6%), with epistaxis the most commonly reported symptom. Ninety percent of hospitalized patients received ITP-directed therapy, with intravenous immunoglobulin G the most commonly used therapy (78% of patients). We identified significant variation by geographic region in treatment strategies, length of stay, hospital charges, and likelihood of readmission.

Conclusions

A substantial number of children with newly diagnosed ITP continue to be hospitalized and receive intravenous medications, although the majority of these patients do not have clinical bleeding events during the admission. By using these results as a backdrop, future studies will be able to identify if the number of ITP admissions, costs of care, and geographic variability in care decrease with the dissemination and implementation of recently published guidelines.

### Sustained remission at long term follow-up in adolescents and young adults with chronic primary immune thrombocytopenia [^114uHs44]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, AYAs with chronic ITP demonstrate a gradual clinical improvement until 48 months of FU, characterized by fewer patients experiencing bleeding, increasing mean platelet counts, and reduced treatment use. A significant proportion of patients with ongoing chronic disease were managed solely with first-line drugs at various FU periods (> 35% of treated patients), suggesting a potentially oligosymptomatic disease and an on-demand treatment approach. This is consistent with the findings of Ducassou et al, who reported that 45% of children with chronic ITP received first-line drugs only during FU. Bleeding sites among patients experiencing hemorrhage remained consistent across all FUs, with 60% wet bleeding, although the severity is unknown, except for gynecological bleeding, which increased over time, likely because of more girls entering puberty. ICH was rare in our cohort, with 6 of 8 events occurring within the first 6 months of the disease. This aligns with previous findings indicating that ICH risk is primarily observed in older populations (aged ≥ 60 years) and during the early stages of the disease.,

Despite the increasing use of second-line therapies in treated patients, IV immunoglobulin was still administered to 40% of them at all FUs. IV immunoglobulin serves as a standard rescue therapy, often used for significant bleeding or in the preoperative setting. This persistent use potentially suggests that second-line therapies fail to prevent platelet fluctuations, breakthrough bleeding events, or adequately address specific risk situations. It could also indicate unsuccessful attempts to discontinue ongoing treatment. Yet, the precise count of IV immunoglobulin administrations between FUs remains undisclosed, thus a potential decline in the effective use of IV immunoglobulin over the course of time cannot be excluded. Unfortunately, administration of corticosteroid remained relatively high at all FUs (31%-47% of all treated patients). Duration of treatment and cumulative dose was not evaluated, and guidelines regarding corticosteroid use differ greatly between children and adults, making it difficult to estimate the real toxic burden in AYAs. Although corticosteroids are effective, safe, convenient, and inexpensive first-line and/or rescue drugs, there is no evidence suggesting they improve health-related quality of life. However, because a significant number of patients were included 10 to 20 years ago, changes in practice may not yet be reflected in our registries. Notably, TPO-RAs were licensed for pediatric ITP between 2016 and 2018, potentially underrepresented in this analysis, thus, treatment strategies may have substantially evolved.

### When is the use of intravenous immunoglobulin appropriate in immune thrombocytopenia? [^1159hPmS]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Given the results of this pilot study, we propose a modified Khellaf score, which would maintain the same point system for intensity of the different bleeds but would keep 2 points only for patients over 75 years of age, and would add a category for concomitant anti‐coagulant treatment (0 points if 'no', 5 points if 'yes'). The threshold for IVIg treatment would remain at 8. Of course, to be of value, this modified Khellaf score would have to be tested prospectively against the current Khellaf score in order to confirm whether it would reduce IVIg use without reducing overall prognosis.

Other bleeding scores do already exist for adult ITP, such as the ITP Bleeding Scaleor the ITP‐BAT (Bleeding Assessment Tool). However, they do not take concomitant anti‐coagulant treatment into account either and most importantly, no score other than the Khellaf bleeding score has prospectively established a threshold for IVIg prescription. There is an urgent need for more in‐depth work on the development and validation of bleeding scores in ITP, which can be used worldwide, and should facilitate the application of international guidelines on the use of IVIg in ITP.

The limitation of our study lies in its retrospective nature, which does not allow us to make a detailed assessment of the reasons that led the prescriber not to follow the French recommendations on the use of IVIg, other than what is clearly written within the hospitalization report. Furthermore, the fact that the study was carried out in the French reference centre, which initially published the Khellaf score and which published the French guidelines for the use of IVIg in ITP, represents a selection bias that could potentially overestimate adherence to guidelines and we have consequently planned a further study to analyse whether these recommendations are correctly followed in less expert groups in this field. The third limitation of our study is the Khellaf score itself, which consists of items that were arbitrarily defined. This study as well as others conducted by our group suggest that the score probably needs to be modified, and, in particular, that anti‐coagulants should be included in the score and that the weight given to age should, on the contrary, be reduced. Ideally, this score should be defined internationally and validated prospectively. Finally, our main objective in this study was to analyse the overprescription of IVIg. Our data therefore do not allow us to determine the percentage of patients with a Khellaf score > 8 who did not receive IVIg but this question seems less crucial to us.

Adults with newly diagnosed ITP

Corticosteroids remain the backbone of therapy for ITP. The 2019 guidelines suggest either prednisone (0.5–2.0/mg/kg per day) or dexamethasone (40 mg per day for 4 days) as the type of corticosteroid for initial therapy in adults with newly diagnosed ITP (recommendation 4). Two new systematic reviews and 1 randomized trial were identified. The systematic reviews included 1 study not considered in the original 2019 guidelines and 2 non-English studies that were excluded. The inclusion of this manuscript did not change the strength or direction of the current recommendation. A randomized trial favored 3 courses of dexamethasone over prednisone for newly diagnosed and treatment of naïve patients based on higher sustained remission. Due to the heterogeneity of the population, the need for 3 courses of dexamethasone, no difference in additional outcomes and < 50 patients per study arm, this study was not felt to change the current recommendation.

The 2019 guidelines suggest corticosteroids alone rather than rituximab and corticosteroids for initial therapy (recommendation 5). There were no new trials that addressed this recommendation. However, trials of combination therapy with corticosteroids and recombinant human thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs), all-trans retinoic acid, and mycophenolate mofetil were identified. We acknowledged that the landscape of upfront management is evolving, however, given the heterogeneity of the studies, did not feel that there was sufficient data to require a new recommendation. Trials in upfront combination therapy should be assessed with an emphasis on cost, patient-related outcomes, and shared decision-making.

Children with newly diagnosed ITP

The 2019 guidelines recommend observation rather than intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) in children with newly diagnosed ITP and those who have no or minor bleeding (recommendation 12). The guidelines commented on the randomized trial of IVIg vs observation that was published after the original search. The trial included 200 children with newly diagnosed ITP randomized to either IVIg or observation alone. The authors found no difference in the guideline-prioritized outcome of the chronic disease. Higher rates of bleeding were seen in the observation arm. However, the population included children with moderate bleeding. Therefore, the results do not directly apply to the patient population in this recommendation. Bleeding was not increased in children with no or mild bleeding at diagnosis treated with observation, the population included in the guideline and therefore, this trial supports the certainty of the current recommendation.

### Clinical course of children with immune thrombocytopenic purpura treated with intravenous immunoglobulin G or megadose methylprednisolone or observed without therapy [^115ykccx]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

The authors compared the prognosis in 50 children with acute immune thrombocytopenicpurpura (ITP) who received intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG), megadose methylprednisolone (MDMP), or no therapy. Twenty-six children were observed with no therapy, 12 children received IVIG, and 12 children received MDMP. The percentage of the patients whose platelet counts increased at a level of > 20 × 10⁹/L and > 50 × 10⁹/L at 3 days after starting therapy was significantly higher in both IVIG and MDMP groups than in the no therapy group (p < .01), but there was no significant difference at 10 and 30 days after initiation between the 3 groups (p > .05 in each comparison). This result suggested that therapy does not increase the rate of recovery but shortens the duration of thrombocytopenia in the first days. Management derision in ITP is made on clinical condition rather than on platelet count and no treatment options is to be preferred even in the face of mucosal bleeding. If the patient has extensive bleeding and the decision is to treat, both IVIG and MDMP are equally effective in providing a safe platelet level early on.

### Immune thrombocytopenia… [^1161ywdJ]. publications.aap.org (2024). Medium credibility.

Key Points Three types: Newly diagnosed, persistent, and chronic. Diagnosis: Established by excluding known causes of thrombocytopenia. Treatment: Most patients are treated as outpatient and decision to treat depends on severity of symptoms and not on the platelet count. When therapy is indicated, the primary treatment options for the newly diagnosed patient are: Corticosteroids Intravenous immunoglobulin Intravenous anti-D Ig. Patients not achieving spontaneous remission or Patients not maintaining their response after stopping treatment between 3–12 months from diagnosis Chronic ITP is reserved for patients with ITP lasting > 12 months. Primary ITP is thrombocytopenia without a known cause and secondary ITP is thrombocytopenia secondary to a known cause such as lupus. Management Treatment Approach Early treatment does not alter the natural course and does not affect the development of chronic ITP.

The same principles of treatment of acute ITP apply to a certain extent to management of chronic ITP. Most ITP cases in children can be managed on an outpatient basis. Indications for inpatient therapy include: Important factors in treatment decision include Child's age Child's degree of activity Social variables, such as reliability of caregivers and ease of access to emergency medical care When therapy is indicated, the primary treatment options for the newly diagnosed patient are: Corticosteroids Intravenous immunoglobulin. Intravenous anti-D Ig Platelet transfusions Ineffective because the transfused platelets are rapidly destroyed Chronic ITP: the chance of spontaneous remission is still significant during this period, making deferral of more aggressive therapeutic approaches reasonable. Other options include splenectomy, immunosuppressive therapy, rituximab, and thrombopoietin receptor agonists.

Specific Treatments Corticosteroids Used for many years in all age groups Reduce the risk of symptoms, most likely by reducing reticuloendothelial system phagocytosis of antibody-coated platelets Most patients respond to steroids. Prednisone or dexamethasone. IVIG Recommended dose:

0. 8 to

1. 0 g/kg. Compared with patients receiving steroids Rapid improvement in platelet count is seen, usually within 24 hours. Probably interferes with Fc receptor activity, resulting in prolonged survival of antibody-coated platelets Other mechanisms of action include Regulatory properties of anti-idiotypic antibodies in IVIG. Achieves a more rapid increase in platelet count that is similar to that seen with IVIG therapy An average decrease in the hemoglobin level of ~1. 3 g is seen as a result of the mild hemolysis of the patient's Rho -positive red cells.

Should be used with caution in children with preexisting anemia. Should probably be given only to children with a hemoglobin level > 10 g/dL With increased use, there have been a few cases of patients developing increased hemolysis leading to severe anemia, acute renal insufficiency, DIC, and multisystem organ failure. It should always be used with caution. It is recommended that patients treated with anti-Rho receive intravenous fluids and be observed for the development of hematuria and hemoglobinuria for at least 8 hours. Median time from the diagnosis of ITP to ICH was 32 days. 72% of cases occurred ≤ 6 months of diagnosis. Platelet count was < 10, 000/mcL in 71. 4% of the cases. Treatments before the ICH were primarily steroids but also included IVIG, splenectomy, and others. A significant number of patients developed ICH despite having already initiated steroid treatment.

### Predictors of response to emergent therapies in paediatric immune thrombocytopenia [^114DtzgM]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Emergent therapies (ET), which include intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), corticosteroids and intravenous anti-Rho(D) immunoglobulin, are used to treat acute episodes of bleeding in children with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). There are currently no known biomarkers or clinical features predictive of treatment response to any specific ET. Thus, the treatment of ITP remains largely trial and error, exposing patients to potentially ineffective medications, which are often expensive and associated with adverse effects. We therefore sought to identify the predictors of treatment response through comparison of clinical characteristics in paediatric patients with ITP responsive to ET versus those non-responsive to ET. We identified high rates of non-response to ET in our cohort of 511 children diagnosed with ITP over a recent 5-year period. Through a multivariable logistic regression model, we identified the presence of secondary ITP, the presence of systemic lupus erythematosus, a positive baseline direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and a high baseline IgA level as predictors of non-response to IVIG. In the future, management guidelines that incorporate predictors of response could help individualize treatment for each patient, achieving better response rates that ensure less bleeding-related morbidity and avoid unnecessary side effects.

Abstract

The 2019 American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) included recommendations on the management of adults (recommendations 1–9) and children (recommendations 10–21) with primary ITP. We describe here the results of a review of the 2019 guidelines by a working group of experts requested by ASH to inform decision-making about the need for and timing of a guideline revision. An updated Medline and Embase search applied the same search terms as in the 2019 ASH guidelines, limited to systematic reviews and clinical trials, from May 2017 to July 2022. There were 193 studies identified, 102 underwent abstract reviews, and 54 full reviews. Each study was assessed based on relevance to the previous recommendation with regard to the population, prioritized outcomes, new outcomes, and study design. Reviewers assessed if the data would change the strength or the directionality of the existing recommendation or merit development of a new recommendation. Based on this review, the ASH Committee on Quality endorsed a focused update on second-line management for adults with ITP. In addition, there will be continued annual monitoring and reviewing of the 2019 ASH guidelines on ITP in full to evaluate when there is sufficient new evidence to warrant additional revisions.

### IVMP + IVIG raises platelet counts faster than IVIG alone: results of a randomized, blinded trial in childhood ITP [^112Ukbkw]. Blood Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Children with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) rarely suffer from life-threatening bleeds (eg, intracranial hemorrhage). In such settings, the combination of IV methylprednisolone (IVMP) with IV immune globulin (IVIG) is used to rapidly increase platelet counts (PCs). However, there are no controlled data to support using combination therapy over IVIG alone. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the rapidity of the PC increment and associated adverse events (AEs) between 2 regimens: A (IV placebo) and B (IVMP 30 mg/kg), both given over 1 hour, followed in both cases by IVIG (Gamunex 10%) 1 g/kg over 2–3 hours in children 1–17 years old with primary ITP and PCs < 20 × 10⁹/L in whom physicians had decided to treat with IVIG. Thirty-two children (ages: median, 8 years; range, 1.2–17.5 years) with a mean baseline PC of 9.2 × 109/L participated. Eighteen were randomized to regimen A and 14 to regimen B. By 8 hours after initiating therapy, 55% of all children had a PC ≥ 20 × 109/L (no group difference). By 24 hours, mean PCs were 76.9 × 109/L (B) vs 55 × 109/L (A) (P = 0.06; p = 0.035 when adjusted for intergroup differences in patient ages). No patient experienced severe bleeding/unexpected severe AEs. There were statistically fewer IVIG-related headaches in the group receiving combination therapy (P = 0.046). Our findings show a rapid response to IVIG with/without steroids and provide evidence to support the use of IVMP+IVIG in life-threatening situations. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00376077.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study design, data sources, and ethical considerations

The study is reported according to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariate prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) checklist for prediction model development and validation. 19 Two cohorts were included in this study to develop and validate the clinical prediction model. The NOPHO ITP study included children with newly diagnosed ITP in a prospective registry cohort in five Nordic countries between 1998 to 2000. 5, 15 Patients with a diagnosis of ITP consistent with clinical criteria and absent clinical or laboratory evidence of alternative causes for thrombocytopenia were recruited at pediatric departments. Data was recorded at diagnosis. Children with an age below 15 years and a platelet count ≤ 20 × 10⁹/L and available 6‐month follow‐up were included (Figure 1 A; N = 377). The study was approved by ethical review committees and authorities in each participating country. A second cohort of children with newly diagnosed ITP was obtained from the TIKI trial, 7 a multicenter randomized controlled trial in the Netherlands that enrolled children between 2009 and 2015 (Figure 1B; N = 194). Inclusion criteria were an age between 3 months and 16 years and a platelet count ≤ 20 × 10 9 /L. Patients were excluded when severe or life‐threatening bleeding was present (Buchanan score ≥ 4), immunomodulatory drugs were given within 1 month of diagnosis, or contraindications to IVIg therapy were present. Clinical characteristics were obtained at diagnosis and registered in standardized clinical report forms. Enrolled patients were randomized to receive careful observation or a single dose of 0.8g/kg IVIg. During follow‐up, patients were routinely assessed according to a pre‐defined schedule at 1 and 4 weeks, as well as 3, 6, and 12 months after the diagnosis. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of University Medical Center Utrecht. Patients (≥ 12 years) and parents gave written informed for study participation. All analyses were performed on deidentified, coded data. Of note, in both studies, patients were not eligible for participation when there were indications for other underlying conditions (secondary ITP) from the patient history, physical exam, or laboratory tests.

### Early response and long-term prognosis of paediatric ITP: exploration of future management strategies [^116FsrXH]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is the most common immunological haemorrhagic disease in childhood. Our retrospective study analysed hospitalized paediatric ITP patients to identify determinants of early treatment response and long-term clinical outcomes. The study found that younger children had a higher 7-day complete response (CR) rate and were more likely to achieve CR in the early stages (p = 0.003, hazard ratio = 0.960 [0.934–0.986]). There was no difference in early partial response or CR rates between subgroups of intravenous immunoglobulin at different doses (p > 0.05). Age was identified as an independent factor affecting long-term prognosis, with older children experiencing a longer duration of illness (p < 0.001, odds ratio = 1.225 [1.143–1.309]). The long-term prognosis was not influenced by early treatment response. Despite this, current first-line treatments for children cannot prevent disease recurrence or improve long-term outcomes. Whether treatment strategies based on risk stratification and early combination of second-line treatments can decrease glucocorticoid use, reduce the likelihood of chronic ITP, improve quality of life and optimize long-term prognosis remains to be determined. The optimization of treatment regimens based on risk stratification warrants further investigation.

Observation versus intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in children with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and no or minor bleeding — observational data showed similar bleeding and mortality between groups (0.6% with IVIG vs 0% with observation for bleeding; 1.8% with IVIG vs 0% with observation for mortality). The panel recognized IVIG harms including hemolysis at 6.3% and a black box warning for thrombosis and acute renal failure, and stated that the balance of effects favored observation rather than IVIG; when observation is chosen, close observation and follow-up must be possible with ready access to medical care. After the search, a randomized trial in children aged 3 months to 16 years with platelet count < 20 × 10⁹/L and mild to moderate bleeding used a single dose of 0.8 mg/kg IVIG versus observation and found no difference in chronic disease (platelet count < 150 × 10⁹/L at 6 months) or ongoing disease at 12 months, no deaths in either group, and grade 4 to 5 bleeding occurred in 9% of the observation group and 1% of the IVIG group; however, this trial enrolled children with moderate bleeding whereas the target population involves no or minor bleeding only.

### The 2022 review of the 2019 American Society of Hematology guidelines on immune thrombocytopenia [^1119essR]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The 2019 American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) included recommendations on the management of adults (recommendations 1–9) and children (recommendations 10–21) with primary ITP. We describe here the results of a review of the 2019 guidelines by a working group of experts requested by ASH to inform decision-making about the need for and timing of a guideline revision. An updated Medline and Embase search applied the same search terms as in the 2019 ASH guidelines, limited to systematic reviews and clinical trials, from May 2017 to July 2022. There were 193 studies identified, 102 underwent abstract reviews, and 54 full reviews. Each study was assessed based on relevance to the previous recommendation with regard to the population, prioritized outcomes, new outcomes, and study design. Reviewers assessed if the data would change the strength or the directionality of the existing recommendation or merit development of a new recommendation. Based on this review, the ASH Committee on Quality endorsed a focused update on second-line management for adults with ITP. In addition, there will be continued annual monitoring and reviewing of the 2019 ASH guidelines on ITP in full to evaluate when there is sufficient new evidence to warrant additional revisions.

ASH 2019 guidelines for ITP — Children with newly diagnosed ITP and no or minor bleeding: In this population, the ASH guideline panel suggests observation rather than corticosteroids (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects ⊕◯◯◯). The clinical question addressed is whether children with newly diagnosed ITP who have no or minor bleeding should receive observation or corticosteroids for initial therapy. The evidence review included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies with internal comparators comparing corticosteroids and observation, and, due to scarce RCTs, also included prospective studies of ≥ 25 children with ITP and retrospective studies of ≥ 25 children with ITP.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved eltrombopag for pediatric patients with chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenia (ITP) ages ≥ 6 on June 11, 2015, and ages ≥ 1 on August 24, 2015. Approval was based on the FDA review of two randomized trials that included 159 pediatric patients with chronic ITP who had an insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, or splenectomy. This manuscript describes the basis for approval of these applications. The FDA concluded that eltrombopag has shown efficacy and a favorable benefit to risk profile for pediatric patients with chronic ITP.

### Clinical and laboratory predictors of chronic immune thrombocytopenia in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1123pLjC]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

Childhood immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare autoimmune bleeding disorder. Most children recover within 6 to 12 months, but individual course is difficult to predict. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify predictors of chronic ITP. We found 1399 articles; after critical appraisal, 54 studies were included. The following predictors of chronic ITP in children, assessed in at least 3 studies, have been identified: female gender (odds ratio [OR] 1.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04–1.31), older age at presentation (age ≥ 11 years; OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.94–3.15), no preceding infection or vaccination (OR 3.08, 95 CI 2.19–4.32), insidious onset (OR 11.27, 95% CI 6.27–20.27), higher platelet counts at presentation (≥ 20 × 10(9)/L: OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.63–2.83), presence of antinuclear antibodies (OR 2.87, 95% 1.57–5.24), and treatment with a combination of methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.44–4.96). Children with mucosal bleeding at diagnosis or treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin alone developed chronic ITP less often (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.28–0.54 and OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52–0.97, respectively). The protective effect of intravenous immunoglobulin is remarkable and needs confirmation in prospective randomized trials as well as future laboratory studies to elucidate the mechanism of this effect.

### Impact of immunoglobulin therapy in pediatric disease: a review of immune mechanisms [^111zufXH]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) provides replacement therapy in immunodeficiency and immunomodulatory therapy in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. This paper describes the immune mechanisms underlying six major non-primary immunodeficiency pediatric diseases and the diverse immunomodulatory functions of IVIG therapy. In Kawasaki disease, IVIG plays a major, proven, and effective role in decreasing aneurysm formation, which represents an aberrant inflammatory response to an infectious trigger in a genetically predisposed individual. In immune thrombocytopenia, IVIG targets the underlying increased platelet destruction and decreased platelet production. Although theoretically promising, IVIG shows no clear clinical benefit in the prophylaxis and treatment of neonatal sepsis. Limitations in research design combined with the unique neonatal immunologic environment offer explanations for this finding. Inflammation from aberrant immune activation underlies the myelinotoxic effects of Guillain-Barré syndrome. HIV-1 exerts a broad range of immunologic effects and was found to decrease serious bacterial infections in the pre-highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) era, although its practical relevance in the post-HAART era has waned. Clinical and experimental data support the role of immune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of childhood epilepsy. IVIG exerts anti-epileptic effects through targeting upregulated cytokine pathways and antibodies thought to contribute to epilepsy. Applications in six additional pediatric diseases including pediatric asthma, atopic dermatitis, cystic fibrosis, pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS), autism, and transplantation will also be briefly reviewed. From autoimmunity to immunodeficiency, a dynamic immunologic basis underlies major pediatric diseases and highlights the broad potential of IVIG therapy.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study participants

We report data from the phase 3 randomized controlled, open‐label trial Therapy with or without Intravenous Immunoglobulins for Newly Diagnosed Immune Thrombocytopenia in Kids in the Netherlands (TIKI). 31 The study protocol was approved by the ethical review board of University Medical Center Utrecht and all participating sites, and conducted in accordance with the second Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Parents or patients aged ≥ 12 years gave written informed consent for study participation. Children with newly diagnosed ITP (N = 200) were allocated in a 1:1 ratio to be administered 0.8 g/kg intravenous immunoglobulin or followed by careful observation. The randomization into the trial arms was stratified by a platelet count below or above 10 × 10 9 /L. To be eligible for inclusion, patients had to be 3 months to 16 years of age, with newly diagnosed ITP in the past 72 hours, according to guidelines, 2, 30 a platelet count ≤ 20 × 10 9 /L and bleeding symptoms (Buchanan score 1‐3). Exclusion criteria were severe bleeding with an indication for IVIg therapy (Buchanan score 4‐5), immune modulatory treatment within the past month, or insufficient command of language. The primary outcome of the trial was development of chronic ITP. Secondary outcomes included bleeding symptoms, resolution of thrombocytopenia, and biological factors related to the pathophysiology of ITP and response to IVIg. Blood samples were collected at study sites and transferred to a central laboratory facility (Laboratory for Platelet and Leukocyte Serology; Sanquin Diagnostics).

### Applicability of 2009 international consensus terminology and criteria for immune thrombocytopenia to a clinical pediatric population [^11398t1T]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Since pediatric immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is relatively infrequent, comparisons among clinical studies are critical but have previously been limited by differences in terminology. In 2009, an international working group (IWG) developed consensus criteria to enhance comparability in future studies in adults and children.

Methods

We performed a retrospective medical record review of all pediatric ITP patients seen at a single children's hospital with a first visit between 2003 and 2010 and applied both historical (criteria(Hist)) and IWG (criteria(IWG)) ITP criteria to available clinical data.

Results

Among the 505 patients seen for ITP over 7 years, 98% could be classified as "acute" or "chronic" ITP using the criteria(Hist), while only 90.7% could be classified as "newly diagnosed", "persistent", or "chronic" ITP using the criteria(IWG) (P < 0.01). Only 33.7% met criteria(IWG) for severe ITP, whereas 77.4% met criteria(Hist) for severe ITP. A striking difference was that overall response to therapies was lower if the criteria(IWG) were used rather than the criteria(Hist), particularly for IVIG (55.4% vs. 70%, P = 0.02) and rituximab (35.3% vs. 83.3% P = 0.05). Only 2 subjects (0.4%) met the criteria(IWG) for refractory ITP.

Conclusions

Most ITP patients could easily be classified using the 2009 criteria(IWG). Limitations to applying the criteria(IWG) included absence of treatment response durations, incomplete definition of pediatric "refractory ITP", and exclusion of secondary ITP. Nevertheless, the criteria(IWG) were more clinically relevant given the reliance on definitions based on bleeding and their ability to be applied prospectively. The utility of using the criteria(IWG) within prospective trials remains to be determined.

Recommendation 17 — children with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and non–life-threatening mucosal bleeding and/or diminished health-related quality of life (HRQoL): the panel suggests either IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) or anti-D immunoglobulin for initial treatment (conditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence of effects ⊕⊕◯◯), with the remark that this is reserved only for children with nonmajor mucosal bleeding. The evidence base included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective/observational studies, with 7 RCTs comparing IVIG to anti-D immunoglobulin, 1 RCT using anti-D 75 vs 50 μg/kg, and 1 prospective study of anti-D; additional data included 6 RCTs of IVIG vs other comparators and 1 RCT comparing IVIG doses at 0.3 g/kg per day for 2 days, plus 4 studies reporting responses within 7 days and 6 studies reporting hemolysis. Across 2 randomized trials, there was no difference between IVIG and anti-D immunoglobulin for 7-day platelet count response (RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.91–1.15), durable response (RR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.63–1.51), or remission (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.69–1.06). Major bleeding was not reported with anti-D immunoglobulin but was 0.6% with IVIG, mortality was 0% with anti-D immunoglobulin and 1.8% with IVIG, and HRQoL data were not reported; notably, there were no RCTs that reported mortality, major bleeding, or overall HRQoL.

### When is the use of intravenous immunoglobulin appropriate in immune thrombocytopenia? [^116KhxZo]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is the gold standard treatment for severe cases of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). However, its cost, limited duration of efficacy and market supply tension have led French guidelines to reserve IVIg for ITP patients with formal contra-indications to corticosteroids, with French bleeding score ('Khellaf score') > 8, and corticosteroid-resistant patients either with Khellaf score ≤ 8 or in preparation for an invasive procedure or during pregnancy. We studied the prescribing practices of IVIg for ITP in real-life conditions and assessed their compliance with French guidelines. A monocentric retrospective study was conducted between 2016 and 2020 among 114 patients hospitalized in our unit, for a total of 208 IVIg treatments. In 37% of cases, the Khellaf score was > 8, validating IVIg prescription according to French guidelines. In the remaining cases, reasons noted for use of IVIg included corticosteroid resistance (33.7%), preparation for an invasive procedure (8.5%), context of pregnancy (6.6%) and contra-indication to corticosteroids (3.3%). After analysis, IVIg prescription was considered valid according to current French guidelines in 84.4% of cases. Non-compliant IVIg prescription was more frequent in younger patients (p = 0.027). Concomitant anti-coagulation was also noted as an argument for IVIg prescription outside of the current French guidelines.

### Prioritization of evidence-based indications for intravenous immunoglobulin [^111nQd3b]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

e The application of the algorithm should be reserved for those in which IVIG is recommended based upon the existing evidence, which of course is subject to change with time. For the purposes of the present algorithm this is divided into three categories: yes – where the supporting evidence is perceived as definitely or probably beneficial; no – where the supporting evidence is perceived as unlikely to be beneficial; and maybe – where the supporting evidence is perceived as "might provide benefit"

f It is important to note that in some cases stronger evidence is available now as compared to 2006 and the reader is referred to subsequent revisions of the 2006 document, alternative documents of similar nature, or the direct evidence

In order to illustrate the role and interplay of the "first" axis of strong evidence supporting use, the supporting evidence rating and evidence-based recommendation from the 2006 AAAAI IVIG evidence review is provided in Table I (fourth column). While those recommendations are now several years old and in need of update, they are provided as a frame of reference for the "first" axis. This demonstrates that even within indications supported by similar levels of evidence, there is typically a range of generally aligned scores on the "second" and "third" axes of the algorithm. For example both SCID and CVID have the same level of evidence and evidence-based recommendation for IVIG usage, but the disease severity and effectiveness of therapeutic alternatives rankings are discordant (the difference in the latter for SCID amongst the authors was likely that one author perceived hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as an effective "alternative", while the other two authors did not perceive this as an alternative to the need for therapeutic immunoglobulin). Another example of the utility of the algorithm and use of these additional axes would be in the comparison of the PID diagnoses such as XLA to ITP. The use of IVIG in ITP is supported by the highest level of evidence and the AAAAI recommendation for use is that of "definitely beneficial". The evidence for use of IVIG in XLA is also perceived as "definitely beneficial" in the AAAAI document but is supported by a lower level of evidence. The comparison of these two indications by the authors using algorithm, however, demonstrates distinct differences in prioritization in the opposite direction of the grade of evidence. Thus the quality of evidence alone does not necessarily provide the full dynamic range of utility of therapeutic immunoglobulin in specific clinical indications. It is hoped that the application of the algorithm as "second" and "third" axes can provide this additional granularity and resolution that could prove helpful in meeting increased demands for a limited supply of IVIG.

### Intravenous immunoglobulin and anti-RhD therapy in the management of immune thrombocytopenia [^116nRSsj]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Intravenous immunoglobulin and intravenous anti-D are common therapies in the management of patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Both are pooled plasma products and both result in an increase in the platelet count in approximately 60% to 70% of patients with ITP. Despite immediate increases in the platelet count, the duration of response is limited, with platelet increments lasting between 2 and 4 weeks. Infusion reactions are common but adverse events rare. Although responses are similar, human and murine data suggest that the mechanisms of action of these treatments are complex and likely different.

### Can low-dose intravenous immunoglobulin be an alternative to high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin in the treatment of children with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1151sWeX]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is a first-line treatment for children with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Higher doses of IVIg are associated with a more insupportable financial burden to pediatric patients' families and may produce more adverse reactions. Whether low-dose IVIg (LD-IVIg) can replace high-dose IVIg (HD-IVIg) has yet to be established. We conducted a comprehensive literature search from the establishment of the database to May 1, 2023, and eventually included 22 RCTs and 3 cohort studies compared different dosages of IVIg. A total of 1989 patients were included, with 991 patients in the LD-IVIg group and 998 patients in the HD-IVIg group. Our results showed no significant differences between the two groups in the effective rate (LD-IVIg: 91% vs. HD-IVIg: 93%; RR: 0.99; 95%CI: 0.96–1.02) and the durable remission rate (LD-IVIg: 65% vs. HD-IVIg: 67%; RR: 0.97; 95%CI: 0.89–1.07). Similar results were also found in the time of platelet counts (PC) starting to rise (MD: 0.01, 95%CI: -0.06–0.09), rising to normal (MD: 0.16, 95%CI: -0.03–0.35), and achieving hemostasis (MD: 0.11, 95%CI: -0.02–0.23) between the two groups. Subgroup analysis showed the effective rate of 0.6 g/kg was equal to 1 g/kg subgroup (91%) but higher than 0.8 g/kg subgroup (82%), and a combination with glucocorticoid may contribute to effect enhancement (combined with glucocorticoid: 91% vs. IVIg alone: 86%) whether combined with dexamethasone (92%) or methylprednisolone (91%). Besides, the incidence rate of adverse reactions in the LD-IVIg group (3%) was significantly lower than the HD-IVIg group (6%) (RR: 0.61; 95%CI: 0.38–0.98). So low-dose IVIg (≤ 1 g/kg) is effective, safe, and economical, which can replace high-dose IVIg (2 g/kg) as an initial treatment. This systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022384604).

Pediatric immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) — observation versus intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in newly diagnosed children with no or minor bleeding — is addressed as follows: In children with newly diagnosed ITP who have no or minor bleeding, the ASH guideline panel recommends observation rather than IVIG (strong recommendation based on moderate certainty in the evidence). The evidence review included RCTs and observational comparisons of IVIG with observation in this population, and the panel acknowledges that important information on the impact of observation on patient-reported outcomes is lacking; however, a lack of evidence does not imply that there is no effect on these outcomes.

### Can low-dose intravenous immunoglobulin be an alternative to high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin in the treatment of children with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Q1bv4]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we included 25 clinical studies compared different dosages of IVIg, involving 1989 newly diagnosed ITP children from China. Our systematic review and meta-analysis investigated 3 main questions: (1) Whether low-dose IVIg (≤ 1 g/kg) is as effective as conventional high-dose IVIg (2 g/kg)? (2) How effective are those different low-dose schemes? (3) Does the combination therapy further improve the therapeutic effect than IVIg alone?

Regarding the first question, our results showed the pooled ER including the complete and partial response rate were similar between the low-dose IVIg (≤ 1 g/kg) and high-dose IVIg (2 g/kg) groups, and there were also no significant differences in the pooled DR and the time of PC increase and hemorrhage improvement, suggesting reduced-dose IVIg was equally effective and can be used as an initial treatment.

In order to identify the efficacy of different low-dose regimens, we performed a proportion meta-analysis. We found that the pooled ER of 0.6 g/kg subgroup was equal to 1 g/kg subgroup (91%) but higher than 0.8 g/kg subgroup (82%). This may be due to the fact that all studies using 0.6 g/kg also combined with glucocorticoid, while all studies using 0.8 g only gave IVIg. Since all the studies reported DR used 1 g/kg IVIg (65%), we were unable to perform a subgroup analysis of other schemes.

Regarding the third question, we further conducted a subgroup analysis of whether glucocorticoid was combined and found combining with intravenous glucocorticoid was associated with a higher ER when compared with using IVIg only (91% vs. 86%). So, this confirmed that a higher ER in 0.6 g/kg subgroup was related to combination therapy. Several studies have shown that glucocorticoids can reduce the formation of autoantibody and binding to antigens, inhibit the phagocytic effect of monocyte-macrophage system on platelets, and stimulate medullary hematopoiesis function and platelet maturation. The combination of glucocorticoid and IVIg can raise PC faster than IVIg alone. Based on our subgroup analysis, we also found the pooled ER of combining with DXMS was close to that of MP, indicating the type of glucocorticoid had little influence on the effect.

### When is the use of intravenous immunoglobulin appropriate in immune thrombocytopenia? [^112ofMcA]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Patient selection

We retrospectively included patients older than 18 years of age, hospitalized between 2016 and 2020 for ITP in the Internal Medicine Department of the Henri Mondor Hospital in Créteil, France. Data were gathered from the Health Data Warehouse of the Assistance Publique–Hôpitaux de Paris (AP‐HP), which collects data from inpatients and outpatients of all AP‐HP hospitals (including Henri Mondor hospital) on socio‐demographics, clinical summaries, biological data, medication prescriptions and medical charts with diagnoses and interventions related to the hospital stays, and vital status at hospital discharge.

In this monocentric study, patients hospitalized for ITP were identified by the presence of a D693 ICD‐10 code (ITP) as a principal or significantly related diagnosis. Text contents of medical reports and structured medical prescriptions were then analysed in order to identify IVIg prescriptions among these patients. The search terms 'IVIg', 'immunoglobulin' and brand names of IVIg were flagged by text search in hospitalization reports. IVIg brands and corresponding international non‐proprietary name were further detected within structured medical prescriptions. Information from AP‐HP data warehouse was finally cross‐referenced with data from the hospital pharmacy, allowing identification of patients who actually were prescribed IVIg for ITP over the period studied.

To be included in this study, IVIg prescription had to be in regard to an acute event: maintenance IVIg infusions for multirefractory ITP patients were excluded.

Collected data

Hospital reports were manually checked to confirm IVIg prescription during the study period. Khellaf bleeding score noted in the report or the clinical elements necessary for its calculation were collected.

IVIg indications were collected and IVIG treatments were classified by indication:
In the case of Khellaf bleeding score > 8, IVIg use was considered compliant with current French guidelines.
In the case of Khellaf bleeding score ≤ 8, IVIg use was considered in accordance with French guidelines for patients with a formal contra‐indication to corticosteroids and for corticosteroid‐resistant patients in preparation for an invasive procedure or delivery in corticosteroid‐resistant pregnant women. The absence of a clearly explicit reason to use IVIg was also noted and in this case, IVIg use was considered as 'non‐compliant' with the guidelines.

### Eltrombopag for newly diagnosed pediatric immune thrombocytopenia requiring treatment: the PINES randomized clinical trial [^115RfZJv]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Eltrombopag, a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for children with chronic immune thrombocytopenia. Efficacy of eltrombopag during the newly diagnosed phase of pediatric immune thrombocytopenia is unknown.

Objective

To determine if the proportion of patients with a platelet response is significantly greater in patients with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia treated with eltrombopag than in those treated with standard therapy (first-line treatments).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This phase 3, randomized clinical trial enrolled patients (aged 1- < 18 years) with newly diagnosed primary immune thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 30×109/L who required pharmacological treatment but did not have severe bleeding or need a rapid increase in platelet count) from May 7, 2019, to January 25, 2024, at 23 centers participating in the Pediatric ITP Consortium of North America. Final follow-up occurred on February 26, 2025.

Interventions

Eltrombopag was administered orally based on a standard dosing schedule (n = 78) vs standard therapy (investigator choice of glucocorticoids, intravenous immunoglobulin, or anti-D immunoglobulin) (n = 40).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was a sustained platelet response defined as 3 or more of 4 platelet counts greater than 50×109/L during weeks 6 to 12 without rescue treatment. The secondary outcomes included bleeding scores, change in health-related quality of life, and serious adverse events.

Results

Of 118 pediatric patients (median age, 8 years [IQR, 4–12 years]; 49% were male), 63% experienced an initial treatment failure after observation or medical therapy. Enrollment ended after a planned interim analysis met a prespecified threshold for efficacy. Of 71 patients in the eltrombopag group, 46 (65% [95% CI, 54%-76%]) had a sustained platelet response compared with 13 of 37 patients (35% [95% CI, 20%-51%]) in the standard therapy group (between-group difference, 30% [95% CI, 11%-49%]; p = 0.002), which crossed the monitoring boundary for efficacy. Overall, there was no between-group difference in the number and type of adverse events.

Conclusions and Relevance

In pediatric patients with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia requiring pharmacological treatment, eltrombopag resulted in a higher rate of sustained platelet response compared with standard therapy. Eltrombopag may be an effective option for pediatric patients with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia with nonsevere bleeding who warrant medical intervention.

Bleeding characteristics at the time ofinfusions

All hospital reports either clearly transcribed the patient's Khellaf bleeding score at time of IVIg use or noted the clinical data required for its calculation. The Khellaf bleeding score was > 8 for 78 cases (37.5%) and ≤ 8 for 130 cases (62.5%) (Figure 2).

Figure 3 details IVIg indications. As noted above, Khellaf bleeding score was > 8 in 37.5% of cases, validating IVIg prescription according to current French guidelines. When Khellaf score was ≤ 8, known steroid resistance was the reason for IVIg use for 33.7% of these cases. Preparation for an invasive procedure, preparation for childbirth and a contra‐indication to corticosteroids were noted as the reasons for IVIg use in, respectively, 8.5%, 6.6% and 3.3% of these cases. We were not able to identify a clearly stated reason for IVIg use in 6.6% of cases and IVIg use was then considered as non‐compliant. Of note, in 2.4% of these cases, the presence of concomitant anti‐coagulant therapy was explicitly highlighted as the reason for IVIg use, which was still considered non‐compliant. Finally, IVIg was prescribed as a therapeutic test in 1.4% of cases (non‐compliant).

4.4 Implications

Given the limited sample size, our data should not be seen as evidence‐based diagnostic or therapeutic recommendations. When a beneficial response was predicted, patients almost exclusively (91%) exhibited CSR and a substantially higher spontaneous recovery rate in the observation cohort. In such cases, our data suggest that IVIg treatment could be omitted. However, these patients would likely respond if IVIg was administered in emergency situations. Moreover, the patients could be managed with fewer repeated clinical assessments and laboratory investigations, which may be considered to be positive for some patients. At the same time, it is valuable to reconsider the benefit of IVIg in cases in which a full response can be expected. Clearly, the time to recovery can be shortened with the administration of IVIg and bleeding episodes can be prevented. In the TIKI trial, 10 patients in the observation cohort were hospitalized at approximately the same rate as the patients in the IVIg cohort for bleeding events and treatment side effects, respectively. If IVIg can be targeted toward the patients who are expected to achieve the greatest benefit (i.e. the patients predicted to exhibit a response to treatment), the benefit‐to‐side effect ratio may shift to become more favorable.

Some clinicians regard a failure to respond to IVIg as a reason to reconsider the diagnosis of ITP. 56 Patients who are predicted to display ASR could be targeted for additional diagnostic testing or the early screening of both autoimmune diseases and immune deficiencies. Overall, the aim of reducing ITP‐specific treatments in patients with alternative causes of thrombocytopenia is critical to reduce unnecessary side effects.

Introduction

The 2019 American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) included recommendations on the management of adults (recommendations 1–9) and children (recommendations 10–21) with primary ITP. The guidelines addressed the treatment of newly diagnosed ITP as well as persistent and chronic ITP with regard to hospitalization, observation, and treatment selection of both first- and second-line agents. The guidelines also carried forward recommendations from the 2011 ASH guidelines for ITP related to diagnostic testing in patients with ITP, management of Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus, and measles mumps rubella vaccine–associated ITP. This review of the 2019 guidelines by a working group of experts was requested by ASH to inform decision-making about the need for and timing of a guideline revision.

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia [^116EAqos]. Blood Advances (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite an increase in the number of therapies available to treat patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), there are minimal data from randomized trials to assist physicians with the management of patients.

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians, and other health care professionals in their decisions about the management of ITP.

Methods

In 2015, ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel that included 8 adult clinical experts, 5 pediatric clinical experts, 2 methodologists with expertise in ITP, and 2 patient representatives. The panel was balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The panel reviewed the ASH 2011 guideline recommendations and prioritized questions. The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, including evidence-to-decision frameworks, to appraise evidence (up to May 2017) and formulate recommendations.

Results

The panel agreed on 21 recommendations covering management of ITP in adults and children with newly diagnosed, persistent, and chronic disease refractory to first-line therapy who have non-life-threatening bleeding. Management approaches included: observation, corticosteroids, IV immunoglobulin, anti-D immunoglobulin, rituximab, splenectomy, and thrombopoietin receptor agonists.

Conclusions

There was a lack of evidence to support strong recommendations for various management approaches. In general, strategies that avoided medication side effects were favored. A large focus was placed on shared decision-making, especially with regard to second-line therapy. Future research should apply standard corticosteroid-dosing regimens, report patient-reported outcomes, and include cost-analysis evaluations.

1 INTRODUCTION

Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia that can lead to an increased tendency to bleed. 1, 2 Although it typically presents as a subtle‐onset, chronic syndrome in adults, with no forewarning symptoms or illness, clinical manifestations can range from minor bruising to severe hemorrhaging. 3, 4, 5 The primary goal of treatment is to achieve a safe platelet count (above which, a patient does not experience bleeding episodes), and this is determined on a case‐by‐case basis. 3 Common first‐line therapies include corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), and anti‐D (Rho[D] immune globulin intravenous). 6, 7, 8 Relapse or failure to respond to these may necessitate second‐line treatment, which can include splenectomy or a variety of medical therapies, most of which have not been approved by regulatory authorities for the treatment of ITP but have been used because of efficacy demonstrated in other autoimmune diseases or as immune suppressants. 9

Splenectomy has historically been considered the second‐line therapy of choice in adult ITP. 10, 11 A systematic review was previously conducted to examine studies (published from 1966 to 2003) that assessed the efficacy/effectiveness of medical treatments for adult patients with ITP who have not responded to splenectomy. The review covered a total of 90 studies representing 656 patients who were splenectomized, aged > 16 years, had ITP for > 3 months, and a platelet count < 50 × 10 9 /L. 12 Only one study 13 was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) but the randomization was by dose of the same therapy; the remaining were cohort studies or uncontrolled case series. A complete response (as defined in each respective original report) was achieved in 14% of patients across the 22 treatment types, with the largest numbers of responders reported with cyclophosphamide (27% of 83 patients), rituximab (24% of 41 patients), and azathioprine (17% of 109 patients). Although partial response was achieved in 40% of patients across these three therapies, 36% to 42% had no response. This review focused on the third‐line setting and beyond, but it demonstrated that at least at that time, there was minimal evidence for the effectiveness of any medical treatment for ITP patients with persistent, severe thrombocytopenia, highlighting the need for RCTs to properly evaluate potentially effective treatments in this setting.

### Pediatric refractory ITP, a definition to be defined [^115dU4P7]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

TO THE EDITOR:

We read with great interest the recent paper by Nakano et al", What is in a name: defining pediatric refractory ITP", published online on 27 September 2024, in which pediatric hematologists from the United States, Canada, Mexico, and France discuss the necessary framework for accurately defining children with symptomatic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who are challenging to treat.

In 2023, the Coagulation Disorder Working Group of the Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Italian Association published a consensus document, aimed at updating previous Italian guidelines and providing recommendations to support pediatricians in the diagnostic workup and treatment of newly diagnosed children with ITP.

Regarding the definition of refractory ITP, we fully agree with the authors that the term is frequently applied to complex cases, which may still be naive to certain treatments and may require a more comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to rule out secondary immune-mediated thrombocytopenias or other causes of thrombocytopenia.

The Italian consensus panel emphasized that the International Working Group criteriafor defining refractory ITP (lack of response to splenectomy) are unsuitable for newly diagnosed and persistent ITP in children, given the decline in splenectomy rates in pediatric ITP. Splenectomy is rarely indicated in pediatric ITP and should only be considered in children aged > 5 years who have failed all available medical therapies, are experiencing thrombocytopenia-related bleeding, and are at risk of life-threatening complications or a significantly impaired health-related quality of life.

As a unified definition of "refractory" in ITP has yet to be established, the Italian panel reserved the term "refractory ITP" for pediatric patients with more severe and difficult-to-treat disease, specifically:

- Children with persistent, clinically significant active bleeding and consistently low platelet counts (no response according to International Working Group criteria) despite first-line treatments (ie, intravenous immunoglobulin and steroids) or rescue therapies (other immunosuppressive agents, thrombopoietin receptor agonists, or splenectomy);
- Children who are not entirely unresponsive to first-line treatments but require frequent therapeutic interventions to maintain a sustained clinical response, experiencing disease worsening and medication-induced toxicities.

We believe that both our definition and the definition suggested by Nakano et alclearly delineate a subset of pediatric patients with ITP with acutely symptomatic cases that may require prompt identification for expanded evaluation. This approach can also help define a group of children who should be considered for clinical trials to identify optimal or novel therapies and to deepen understanding of their disease biology.

### Management of children with persistent ITP, A novel approach (LMICs) [^111gs7jw]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Overview The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if mini-pool intravenous immunoglobulin is a safe and effective treatment for children with persistent immune thrombocytopenia. ITP is a condition that causes low platelet levels and increases the risk of bleeding. The main questions this study aims to answer are: Can mini-pool IVIG raise platelet levels in children with persistent ITP. Can it reduce bleeding episodes and hospital visits. What side effects, if any, are seen with this treatment. There is no comparison group in this study. All participants will receive mini-pool IVIG, which is made from small pools of donated plasma using a cost-effective process. Participants will: Receive one dose of mini-pool IVIG through a vein over 6 to 8 hours Receive follow-up doses every 2 to 4 weeks for up to 5 doses, based on their platelet count Have regular blood tests and checkups during the study and for 6 months after treatment.

Report on bleeding episodes, physical activity, school attendance, and side effects Immune thrombocytopenia is an autoimmune condition where the immune system destroys platelets, leading to low platelet counts and increased risk of bleeding. Persistent ITP is defined as ongoing thrombocytopenia lasting 3 to 12 months after initial diagnosis. Children with persistent ITP who lose their response to first-line treatments, such as steroids or standard intravenous immunoglobulin, have limited therapeutic options, especially in low- and middle-income countries, due to the high cost of commercial IVIG preparations. Mini-pool IVIG is produced from small pools of plasma collected locally, using a validated process with virus inactivation and IgG purification steps. This method enables safe, cost-effective preparation of IVIG in resource-limited settings.

Prior research has shown that mini-pool IVIG is effective and well-tolerated in acute pediatric ITP, but its role as a second-line therapy for persistent ITP has not been evaluated. This multicenter, prospective clinical trial will enroll 20 children aged 1 to 10 years with persistent ITP at three tertiary care pediatric hematology centers in Egypt. Participants will receive a loading dose of mini-pool IVIG at 1 g/kg, followed by maintenance doses of 0. 5 g/kg every 2 to 4 weeks for up to five additional doses, with dose intervals adjusted based on platelet counts. Responses to therapy will be classified as complete response, response, or no response based on platelet count thresholds and bleeding status, with response duration measured from achievement of CR or R to loss of response.

Participants achieving sustained response off therapy or response off therapy during the 6-month post-treatment follow-up will be identified to evaluate durability of treatment effects. This study aims to provide evidence on the safety and efficacy of mini-pool IVIG as a second-line therapy for persistent pediatric ITP, potentially offering an affordable and effective treatment alternative in settings where standard IVIG is inaccessible due to cost.

### Intravenous immunoglobulin vs observation in childhood immune thrombocytopenia: a randomized controlled trial [^115oJUss]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Management of children with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) consists of careful observation or immunomodulatory treatment. Observational studies suggest a lower risk for chronic ITP in children after intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment. In this multicenter randomized trial, children aged 3 months to 16 years with newly diagnosed ITP, platelet counts 20 × 10⁹/L or less, and mild to moderate bleeding were randomly assigned to receive either a single infusion of 0.8 g/kg IVIg or careful observation. Primary outcome was development of chronic ITP, which at the time of study initiation was defined as a platelet count lower than 150 × 10 9 /L after 6 months. Two hundred six children were allocated to receive IVIg (n = 102) or careful observation (n = 104). Chronic ITP occurred in 18.6% of the patients in the IVIg group and 28.9% in the observation group (relative risk [RR], 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.38–1.08). Platelet counts lower than 100 × 10 9 /L at 12 months (current definition of chronic ITP) were observed in 10% of children in the IVIg group and 12% in the observation group (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.38–1.84). Complete response rates in the first 3 months were significantly higher in the IVIg group. Immunoglobulin G Fc receptor IIb genetic variations were associated with early complete response in both groups. Grade 4 to 5 bleeding occurred in 9% of the patients in the observation group vs 1% in the IVIg group. This trial was registered at www.trialregister.nl as NTR 1563.

### Initial management of childhood acute immune thrombocytopenia: single-center experience of 32 years [^114YWm35]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acute self-limited disease of childhood, mostly resolving within 6 months irrespective of whether therapy is given or not. Treatment options when indicated include corticosteroids, intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), and anti-RhD immunoglobulin. We reviewed our 32 years' experience for first-line therapy of acute ITP. Five hundred forty-one children (mean age: 5.3 years) diagnosed and treated for ITP were evaluated retrospectively. Among 491 acute ITP patients, IVIG was used in 27%, high-dose steroids in 27%, low-dose steroids in 20%, anti-D immunoglobulin G (IgG) in 2%, and no therapy in 22%. When the initial response (platelets > 50 × 10(9)/L) to first-line treatment modalities were compared, 89%, 84%, and 78% patients treated by low-dose steroids, high-dose steroids, and IVIG responded to treatment, respectively (P > .05). Mean time to recovery of platelets was 16.8, 3.8, and 3.0 days in patients treated with low-dose steroids, high-dose steroids, and IVIG, respectively (P < .0001). Thrombocytopenia recurred in 23% of low-dose steroid, 39% of high-dose steroid, and in 36% of IVIG (P < .0001) treatment groups. Of 108 patients who were observed alone, 4 (3%) had a recurrence on follow-up and only 2 of these required treatment subsequently. Recurrence was significantly less in no therapy group compared with children treated with 1 of the 3 options of pharmacotherapy (P < .0001). Response rates were similar between patients treated by IVIG and low- and high-dose steroids; however, time to response was slower in patients treated with low-dose steroids compared with IVIG and high-dose steroids.

### The American Society of Hematology 2011 evidence-based practice guideline for immune thrombocytopenia [^114ffMQp]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is commonly encountered in clinical practice. In 1996 the American Society of Hematology published a landmark guidance paper designed to assist clinicians in the management of this disorder. Since 1996 there have been numerous advances in the management of both adult and pediatric ITP. These changes mandated an update in the guidelines. This guideline uses a rigorous, evidence-based approach to the location, interpretation, and presentation of the available evidence. We have endeavored to identify, abstract, and present all available methodologically rigorous data informing the treatment of ITP. We provide evidence-based treatment recommendations using the GRADE system in those areas in which such evidence exists. We do not provide evidence in those areas in which evidence is lacking, or is of lower quality — interested readers are referred to a number of recent, consensus-based recommendations for expert opinion in these clinical areas. Our review identified the need for additional studies in many key areas of the therapy of ITP such as comparative studies of "front-line" therapy for ITP, the management of serious bleeding in patients with ITP, and studies that will provide guidance about which therapy should be used as salvage therapy for patients after failure of a first-line intervention.

### Immune thrombocytopenia guidelines get an annual checkup [^111VnzLi]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Overall, the authors give the pediatric guidelines a clean bill of health. The authors acknowledge newly published work investigating intravenous immunoglobulin vs observation in children with newly diagnosed ITP and note small trials of sirolimus, cyclosporine, and hydroxychloroquine in children with non–life-threatening mucosal bleeding and/or diminished health–related quality of life. The updated guidelines are not likely to be very different but will have further support for observation of patients without bleeding symptoms based on the results of the randomized clinical trial for intravenous immunoglobulin.

Underlying this report is an important question: how often should guidelines be reviewed or revised? Benchmarks developed by the Institute of Medicine Committee on Standards for Developing Trustworthy Clinical Practice Guidelines include regular "updating" as a criterion by which clinical practice guidelines may be judged. But the interval at which guidelines should be reviewed is intentionally left vague, because the benefits of review must be weighed against the time, effort, and resources needed to enact them. Timing of review is also dependent on the speed of research in a given field. By committing to yearly reviews, the authors underscore the pace at which new evidence is being generated in the field of ITP.

In conclusion, Neunert et al demonstrate that although progress has been made in ITP, the 2019 guidelines remain pertinent. We look forward to a focused update or clarification on second-line therapy for adults, particulary because of discordant recommendations in the last guideline. However, this literature review demonstrated that despite a large body of work in ITP since the publication of the last guidelines, all the prior recommendations remain relevant, and a complete guideline revision is not necessary. As research moves apace and medical literature ever expands, it becomes critical for guidelines to remain dynamic. An annual and focused approach to updating the ITP guidelines will create a flexible resource that all practitioners can trust.

### Immunoglobulins act as predictors of chronicity in pediatric immune thrombocytopenia [^114mYrJa]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Prior analysis of baseline immunoglobulin levels in a smaller institutional cohort of children with ITP indicated their potential for predicting chronicity but without definitive clinically applicable conclusions. Thus, we analyzed retrospective data obtained from children with ITP treated at 2 tertiary care referral centers to investigate the utility of immunoglobulin levels obtained at the time of diagnosis in predicting the development of cITP.

A retrospective review of pediatric patients (aged 6 months to 21 years) diagnosed with ITP by a hematologist at 2 tertiary care children's hospitals in the United States between 2015 and 2022 was conducted under an institutional review board–approved protocol. Included patients had immunoglobulin levels obtained within 3 months of ITP diagnosis and before any treatment and those lost to follow-up or without at least 1 year of follow-up were excluded. Of the total patients in this selected cohort (N = 624), 45 were excluded from the final regression analysis because of missing values for at least 1 type of immunoglobulin (n = 579). Patients were determined to have spontaneously resolved ITP if they achieved a platelet count > 150 × 10 9 /L on 2 consecutive occasions, or 1 occasion in the presence of normalized mean platelet volume, absent of therapy, before 12 months from ITP diagnosis. Patients were considered to have no therapy before achieving spontaneous resolution based on treatment-specific definitions of minimum time since receiving therapy, as follows: 6 weeks since IV immunoglobulin or Rh immune globulin, 3 weeks since corticosteroids, 1 week since immunomodulators, 2 weeks since thrombopoietin receptor agonists, or achieving B-cell repopulation after rituximab therapy. Immunoglobulins were recorded as continuous variables and classified for the purposes of description by age-related reference values.

### Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in a pediatric patient positive for SARS-CoV-2… [^1123zCsp]. publications.aap.org (2020). Medium credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia is a potential presentation of COVID-19. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 viral testing should be considered in these patients to allow for appropriate hospital triaging and isolation to limit community spread and health care worker infection during epidemics or pandemics. ITP is characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia. Approximately two-thirds of children with primary ITP have a history of a viral infection during the previous month. The patient's vital signs were temporal temperature 37. 3°C, heart rate 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, blood pressure 120/77 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation 100% on room air. On physical examination, the patient was a well-appearing, conversant girl, with oral examination notable for wet purpura.

Close modal Close modal Close modal Given the patient's severe thrombocytopenia and wet purpura in the setting of suspected immune thrombocytopenia, her risk for severe bleeding was significant, and she was admitted to the hematology service. She received 400 mg acetaminophen and 30 mg diphenhydramine as pretreatment, followed by 30 g intravenous immunoglobulin. She was discharged from the hospital the next morning. She had telehealth visits with the hematology and infectious disease providers 2 days after being discharged. During these 2 days, she took acetaminophen every 6 hours and diphenhydramine every 12 hours. Her rash and oral lesions improved within 48 hours after IVIG administration. However, she developed a temperature to 37. 9°C, decreased appetite, headache, nausea, 2 episodes of emesis, and abdominal pain likely secondary to IVIG.

Discussion In this case, we illustrate the presentation, clinical course, follow-up, and public health implications of the first documented case of ITP in a pediatric patient who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We also describe the presentation, workup, and treatment options of ITP in children. ITP is a disease characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia of < 100 × 10. 10 Acute ITP typically occurs after a viral illness, and platelet counts often spontaneously recover within weeks to months. 11 Chronic ITP occurs when thrombocytopenia persists for > 12 months. 9, 12 The peak incidence of ITP in children is at 5 or 6 years old. 9 Most children, with or without treatment, recover from ITP within 3 to 6 months of initial presentation.

According to a consensus report by Provan et al, 16 the initial investigation for ITP should include a thorough history, physical examination, complete blood count and peripheral blood smear review, direct antiglobulin test, and baseline immunoglobulin levels. Bone marrow aspiration, biopsy, and cytogenetics are not required unless there are abnormal or potentially malignant cells on the blood smear, abnormalities in the hemoglobin and/or white cell count, hepatosplenomegaly, adenopathy, or failure to respond to standard ITP therapy. Patients with mild bleeding may be managed with supportive care and close follow-up.

American Society of Hematology (ASH) immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) guideline — panel, scope, and key emphases: In 2016, ASH formed a multidisciplinary panel including 9 clinical experts, 5 pediatric clinical experts, 2 methodologists with expertise in ITP, and 2 patient representatives, used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach with evidence-to-decision frameworks to appraise evidence up to May 2017, and agreed on 21 recommendations covering management of ITP in adults and children with newly diagnosed, persistent, and chronic disease refractory to first-line therapy who have non–life-threatening bleeding; management approaches included observation, corticosteroids, IV immunoglobulin, anti-D immunoglobulin, rituximab, splenectomy, and thrombopoietin receptor agonists. The background notes minimal randomized-trial data to assist management, and the conclusions state there was a lack of evidence to support strong recommendations, that strategies avoiding medication side effects were favored, that a large focus was placed on shared decision-making (especially second-line therapy), and that future research should apply standard corticosteroid-dosing regimens, report patient-reported outcomes, and include cost-analysis evaluations.

### Can low-dose intravenous immunoglobulin be an alternative to high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin in the treatment of children with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112EUn2C]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Protocol and registration

This systematic review was reported following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) and registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022384604).

Literature search and selection

We conducted an extensive search strategy to retrieve all eligible literature published from the establishment of the database to May 1, 2023, by searching Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and three Chinese databases including CNKI, Wan Fang and VIP. In case of omittance, we also searched ClinicalTrials.gov. The search strategy was shown in supplemental Table 1.

Two reviewers independently conducted study screening based on the titles and abstracts, and further assessed the full texts of potential literature to identify eligible studies. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and consensus of the third reviewer.

Studies were selected based on the following inclusion criteria: (1) Peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or comparable observational studies; (2) Studies compared low-dose IVIg (≤ 1 g/kg) and high-dose IVIg (˃ 1 g/kg); (3) Studies enrolled patients at age < 18 years; (4) Studies enrolled patients diagnosed with primary ITP, and the duration were less than 3 months. Exclusion criteria were: (1) Duplicated studies. If multiple publications from the same study group occur, the one with the largest sample size or the most complete one was included; (2) Studies enrolled secondary ITP or previously treated patients; (3) The full texts were not available; (4) Studies published in languages other than Chinese and English.

Data extraction

Two reviewers independently extracted data from each eligible study and then cross-checked the results. The following information was extracted: name of the first author, year of publication, type of studies, sample size, baseline characteristics (gender, age, PC before treatment), details of interventions (the dosage and course of IVIg, the type, dosage and course of glucocorticoid if combined with glucocorticoid), follow-up period. Disagreements between reviewers were resolved through discussion.

Quality appraisal

The Risk of bias (ROB) tool recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions was used to assess included RCTs. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to evaluate the methodological quality of included cohort studies. Two reviewers independently performed the quality evaluation and obtained consensus through discussion.

The extensive clinical and molecular heterogeneity of autoimmune disorders leads to complex disease classifications and challenges for the accurate clinical diagnosis, prognostication, and selection of efficacious therapies. 1 With the detailed, high‐resolution molecular data that are obtained with current methods, the biological stratification of patients may become possible. 1 Using such data, the identification of clinically relevant subgroups could be achieved by the combination of several biomarkers and genetic variants, which would have limited discriminative value when considered individually. 1, 2

Childhood immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare autoimmune bleeding disorder with an annual incidence of approximately 5 per 100 000 children. 3 ITP is characterized by thrombocytopenia with a platelet count below 100 × 10 9 /L. 4 Although two‐thirds of children spontaneously recover from the disease within 3 months of the diagnosis, the remaining patients exhibit prolonged thrombocytopenia, and some eventually develop chronic disease. 5, 6 The quality of life is markedly reduced in patients with prolonged and chronic ITP. 7, 8 A key clinical challenge is the early identification of a patient's likely disease course (i.e. platelet count and bleeding over time), as well as the expected response to treatment. Specifically, an indication of a patient's likely disease course may help clinicians in the counselling of patients and families, as well as guide patient monitoring and treatment decisions. The early identification of patients likely to have persistent or chronic ITP would enable the clinicians to target monitoring and perform additional diagnostic testing (e.g. screening for immune deficiencies, other autoimmune diseases, genetic causes), as well as consider adjunctive or alternative forms of treatments. In childhood ITP, treatment is only initiated in emergency situations or on a case‐by‐case basis with a significant perceived disease burden. 9 In these situations, knowledge of the expected response to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is critical for managing bleeding and preventing unnecessary hospitalizations, side effects, and substantial costs. 7 However, there are currently no sufficient tools that can be used to predict the disease course of ITP.

### Treatment of immune-mediated thrombocytopenia purpura with concurrent intravenous immunoglobulin and platelet transfusion: a retrospective review of 40 patients [^113MzDkT]. American Journal of Hematology (2008). Low credibility.

We performed a retrospective review of patients with immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (ITP) treated with prolonged infusions of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) (1 g/kg by continuous infusion over 24 hr) and concurrent platelets (1 pheresis unit every 8 hr), to determine the response rate of this therapy. Patient inclusion criteria included clinically significant thrombocytopenia, with either active bleeding, need for anticoagulation, or a needed surgical procedure. The average pretreatment platelet count was 10,000/microl, which increased to 55,000/microl after 24 hr and 69,000/microl after 48 hr. After 24 hr, 62.7% of patients had a platelet count > 50,000/microl. Bleeding was controlled initially in all patients, and those requiring a procedure experienced no bleeding complications. Over half of the patients (52.5%) required additional treatments for recurrent or refractory ITP. Six of the 21 patients requiring retreatment (29%) received IVIg and platelets again in a similar fashion, with similar results. No side effects of the combined treatment were noted. There is limited literature on the optimal dose and schedule for administration of IVIg and platelets. Our approach for administration of IVIg and platelets concurrently was associated with minimal side effects, resolution of bleeding, ability to safely undergo procedures, and rapid restoration of adequate platelet counts.

Regarding medical management for immune thrombocytopenia, more specifically with respect to first-line therapy (pediatric patients), ASH 2019 guidelines recommend to consider using corticosteroids in preference to IVIG in children with newly diagnosed ITP who have non-life-threatening mucosal bleeding and/or diminished health-related QoL.

### Intravenous immunoglobulin as a therapy for autoimmune conditions [^111NZm7Q]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is a medical preparation used as replacement therapy for patients with immunodeficiencies. Over time, IVIg's anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects have been recognized, which have led to the approval of this therapy in the treatment of various pathologies, such as Kawasaki disease, immune thrombocytopenia, and Guillain-Barré syndrome. There are numerous studies in the literature regarding the off-label use of IVIg in the treatment of autoimmune diseases (e.g. myositis and vasculitis), and hematological disorders. Since the role of immunoglobulins in fields other than replacement therapy is now consolidated, in this study we carried out a review of the literature to evaluate the main uses of IVIg therapy. We have focused our attention on the treatment of autoimmune, neurological, hematological, dermatological and pediatric diseases. Furthermore, our analysis of the literature also extended to the potential use of IVIg as an adjuvant treatment of long COVID-19. From our analysis, we found consistent data about IVIg's effectiveness in treating numerous clinical conditions. Treatment with IVIg represents a second-line approach or a valid adjuvant to standard therapies capable of positively influencing the clinical course of many pathologies and reducing or avoiding side effects of standard therapies, with a good safety profile.

### Can low-dose intravenous immunoglobulin be an alternative to high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin in the treatment of children with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115tsSYc]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

However, the costs of IVIg are high, which is hardly bearable for many families. A study showed the mean hospitalization cost for ITP children treated with IVIg was $6275. Since the administration of IVIg requires an inpatient admission, the cost increase is most pronounced for those who need high-dose IVIg. Furthermore, high-dose use was considered as one of the main risk factors for undesirable IVIg-associated adverse events such as flu-like symptoms, dermatological adverse effects, thrombotic events, aseptic meningitis, hemolysis, and renal failure.

To alleviate patients' financial pressure and ensure efficacy and safety, how to rationally reduce the dosage of IVIg is always a matter of clinical concern, especially in some developing countries. In China, IVIg is administered chiefly at a total dose of 2 g/kg distributed over 2–5 days. Although several studies have shown that reducing the dosage of IVIg may also be effective and can be used for ITP in newly treated children, there is still some controversy on the optimal low-dose regimen.

Thus, we performed a comprehensive analysis to evaluate both long and short-term efficacy of low-dose IVIg and to compare the effect of different low-dose regimens and combination with glucocorticoids, which may provide enough information for healthcare providers to choose the most appropriate medication regimen when treating children with newly diagnosed ITP.

### Corticosteroids versus intravenous immune globulin for the treatment of acute immune thrombocytopenic purpura in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111fTSPs]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of corticosteroids with intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) for the initial treatment of children with acute immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).

Study Design

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing corticosteroids with IVIG. Studies were identified from eight electronic databases, meeting abstracts, expert consultation, and hand-searched reference lists. Two authors independently reviewed potentially eligible studies and extracted data. The number of patients with a platelet count > 20,000/mm3, 48 hours after treatment initiation, was the primary outcome. Relative risks (RR) and risk differences were pooled using a random effects model, and numbers needed to treat (NNT) were calculated.

Results

A total of 1248 abstracts were reviewed, 55 articles were retrieved, and 10 studies were included. The RR (steroids vs IVIG) of achieving a platelet count > 20,000/mm3 at 48 hours was 0.74 (95% CI: 0.65, 0.85), and the NNT was 4.55 (95% CI: 3.23, 7.69).

Conclusion

Children treated with corticosteroids for acute ITP are 26% less likely to have a platelet count > 20,000/mm3 after 48 hours of therapy, when compared with children treated with IVIG. Given the importance of low platelets in the pathogenesis of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), this difference may hold important clinical implications.

### Intravenous immunoglobulins ameliorate thrombin-related platelet functions in childhood immune thrombocytopenia [^116swEah]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). Medium credibility.

Childhood immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired haematological disorder characterized by low platelet counts, with a disease course which is usually benign and self-limiting within 3–12months. An estimated 28%, however, continue to develop chronic ITP and may experience bleeding symptoms and an impaired quality of life. Treatment options in case of severe bleedings include corticosteroids, anti-D or intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg). The general working mechanism of IVIg remains unresolved and a matter of debate. Schmugge et al now identify that IVIg may have the ability to improve thrombin-induced platelet activation and enhance thrombin generation in a prospective study of 23 children with primary ITP, demonstrating that besides increasing platelet counts IVIg can be efficacious on the level of thrombin-induced platelet activation and coagulation support.

Management of children with newly diagnosed ITP — Recommendation 10b states: In children with newly diagnosed ITP and a platelet count of ≥ 20 × 10⁹/L who have no or mild bleeding (skin manifestations) only, the ASH guideline panel suggests against admission to the hospital rather than management as an outpatient (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects ⊕◯◯◯). Remark: For patients with uncertainty about the diagnosis, those with social concerns, those who live far from the hospital, or those for whom follow-up cannot be guaranteed, admission to the hospital may be preferable.

RESULTS

Patient characteristics

Pharmacy data identified 135 patients having effectively received IVIg for ITP between 2016 and 2020 in our department. Our multicriteria automated search successfully identified 118 (87%) patients, with no false positives. Among them, one patient was removed as he had received IVIg for severe combined immunodeficiency although he was also known to have ITP. Three additional patients were removed as they had received IVIg as maintenance treatment for multirefractory ITP, without an acute event leading to IVIg prescription. A total of 114 patients, accounting for 208 IVIg courses, were therefore included. Flowchart of patient selection is shown in Figure 1. Main patient characteristics are presented in Table 1. Briefly, a slight majority (54%) of patients were female, with a median age of 55 years old. An anti‐platelet or anti‐coagulant therapy was noted in 32.5% of patients. The cohort was fairly evenly split among newly diagnosed ITP (less than 3 months of duration) and chronic ITP (more than 1 year of duration), with a minority of persistent ITP. The cohort included heavily pretreated patients, with a median number of two ITP therapies prior to the IVIg prescription studied (min 0 − max 17). At time of IVIg prescription, 47% of patients had an ongoing ITP treatment. Median platelet levels at admission, prior to IVIg prescription, were 6 × 10 9 /L (min 1 × 10 9 /L − max 70 × 10 9 /L), and 105 of 114 patients had platelet levels < 20 × 10 9 /L.

### Can low-dose intravenous immunoglobulin be an alternative to high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin in the treatment of children with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114dzC46]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is a first-line treatment for children with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Higher doses of IVIg are associated with a more insupportable financial burden to pediatric patients' families and may produce more adverse reactions. Whether low-dose IVIg (LD-IVIg) can replace high-dose IVIg (HD-IVIg) has yet to be established. We conducted a comprehensive literature search from the establishment of the database to May 1, 2023, and eventually included 22 RCTs and 3 cohort studies compared different dosages of IVIg. A total of 1989 patients were included, with 991 patients in the LD-IVIg group and 998 patients in the HD-IVIg group. Our results showed no significant differences between the two groups in the effective rate (LD-IVIg: 91% vs. HD-IVIg: 93%; RR: 0.99; 95%CI: 0.96–1.02) and the durable remission rate (LD-IVIg: 65% vs. HD-IVIg: 67%; RR: 0.97; 95%CI: 0.89–1.07). Similar results were also found in the time of platelet counts (PC) starting to rise (MD: 0.01, 95%CI: -0.06–0.09), rising to normal (MD: 0.16, 95%CI: -0.03–0.35), and achieving hemostasis (MD: 0.11, 95%CI: -0.02–0.23) between the two groups. Subgroup analysis showed the effective rate of 0.6 g/kg was equal to 1 g/kg subgroup (91%) but higher than 0.8 g/kg subgroup (82%), and a combination with glucocorticoid may contribute to effect enhancement (combined with glucocorticoid: 91% vs. IVIg alone: 86%) whether combined with dexamethasone (92%) or methylprednisolone (91%). Besides, the incidence rate of adverse reactions in the LD-IVIg group (3%) was significantly lower than the HD-IVIg group (6%) (RR: 0.61; 95%CI: 0.38–0.98). So low-dose IVIg (≤ 1 g/kg) is effective, safe, and economical, which can replace high-dose IVIg (2 g/kg) as an initial treatment. This systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022384604).

### Management of newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia: can we change outcomes? [^116cAR6d]. Blood Advances (2017). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia resulting from antibody-mediated platelet destruction combined with impaired platelet production is a common cause of thrombocytopenia. The decision to treat newly diagnosed patients is based on several factors including ceasing hemorrhagic manifestations, increasing the platelet count, prevention of bleeding, and inducing remission. Current standard first-line therapy is a course of corticosteroids. Although this treatment paradigm increases the platelet count in the majority of patients, a high percentage relapse after discontinuation of corticosteroid therapy. For this reason, intensification of first-line therapy that results in superior long-term remission rates would be desirable. This manuscript focuses primarily on adults with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), highlighting pediatric data and practice when applicable. The primary aim is to outline upfront strategies for treatment-naive patients with ITP to enhance remission rates, taking into account assessment of the risks and benefits of these approaches.

### Influence of the American Society of Hematology guidelines on the management of newly diagnosed childhood immune thrombocytopenia [^112F5Hrz]. JAMA Pediatrics (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

In 2011, the American Society of Hematology (ASH) published updated guidelines for the management of childhood immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) recommending management with observation alone when there are mild or no bleeding symptoms, regardless of platelet count. Little is known about practice patterns of newly diagnosed ITP in the United States.

Objective

To understand the impact of management recommendations on practice patterns.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective medical record review in the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, a large, urban, pediatric tertiary care hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The study involved 311 pediatric patients with newly diagnosed ITP managed between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2012.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Management type (observation alone vs pharmacotherapy) was determined via medical record review and electronic pharmacy data at diagnosis and within 6 months after diagnosis.

Results

Overall, 44.7% of patients were managed with observation alone at diagnosis, with a significant increase from 34.9% in 2007–2010 to 49.2% in 2011 (P < .02) and 71.1% in 2012 (P < .001). Of those treated, 99% were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin. In multivariable logistic regression, younger age (odds ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87–0.99), lower platelet count (odds ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.83–0.89), and earlier period (2007–2010) of diagnosis (odds ratio, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.09–0.34) were significantly associated with increased odds of pharmacologic management. During 2010–2012, 20.8% of patients were also treated within 6 months after diagnosis. There was no significant difference by year or initial management type in those who received this later pharmacotherapy. Additionally, 19.6% of patients had documented bleeding symptoms beyond cutaneous bruising or petechiae at diagnosis. Intracranial hemorrhage at diagnosis was rare (0.6%).

Conclusions and Relevance

We demonstrated a significant practice change in the management of newly diagnosed ITP at a pediatric care tertiary care hospital in the United States surrounding revision of the ASH management guidelines for childhood ITP. Our experience supports adoption of observation alone for a proportion of patients with newly diagnosed childhood ITP. This form of management did not lead to an increase in later treatment or an increase in delayed bleeding symptoms.

### Can low-dose intravenous immunoglobulin be an alternative to high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin in the treatment of children with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115VLSiB]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we identified the efficacy of 1 g/kg IVIg was equal to 2 g/kg, and even 0.6 or 0.8 g/kg was also effective. A combination with glucocorticoids can improve therapeutic effects, so we suggested combining with glucocorticoids when giving low-dose IVIg. In the future, more high-quality studies with appropriate sample sizes are needed to identify the efficacy of IVIg less than 1 g/kg and explore the effect of improving prognosis.

### Anti-D immunoglobulin versus immunoglobulin G for the treatment of acute immune thrombocytopenia in children: a 10-year retrospective study [^1116hNph]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Anti-D immunoglobulin (anti-D) therapy is cheaper and has a shorter infusion time than intravenous immunoglobulin G (IgG), but their comparative effects in the treatment of acute immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) have not been studied thoroughly. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of anti-D and intravenous IgG in the treatment of acute ITP in children.

Methods

The medical records of children diagnosed with acute ITP between January, 2008, and January, 2018, at Al-Rantisy Specialized Pediatric Hospital (a tertiary care centre) in Gaza were reviewed. Patients who received either intravenous anti-D (75 μg/kg, single dose) or intravenous IgG (2 g/kg, divided doses) as initial treatment for ITP were included in this retrospective study. Data on patient demographics, hospital stay period, and adverse drug reactions were collected for analysis. Laboratory results, including platelet counts and haemoglobin levels, were evaluated before treatment, and after 1, 3, 5, and 7 days of treatment. The therapy response was defined as the time taken to increase the platelet count to at least 20,000 platelets per μL.

Findings

Data from 134 patients (mean age, 5·8 years; range, 1·1–10·4 years) were included for analysis. 32% of patients (43 of 134) received anti-D and 68% of patients (91) received intravenous IgG. Mean pre-treatment platelet counts were 6420 platelets per μL and 8750 platelets per μL for anti-D and intravenous IgG groups, respectively. The platelet count increased significantly after 1, 3, 5, and 7 days of treatment in both groups (p < 0·001). After 24 h of treatment, 58% of patients (25 of 43) in the anti-D group and 55% of patients (50 of 91) in the intravenous IgG group had platelet counts of over 20000 platelets per μL. Moreover, all of the patients in both groups had more than 20000 platelets per μL after 7 days of therapy. There were no significant differences in platelet count after treatment between the two groups. Haemoglobin levels decreased during the 72 h after treatment (anti-D group, mean 0·8 g/dL, range, 0·1–1·4 g/dL; intravenous IgG group, mean 0·5 g/dL, range, 0·2–1·2 g/dL; p = 0·237), but increased on days 5 and 7 in both groups. The changes in haemoglobin after treatment were similar in both study groups. No patient developed severe anaemia requiring medical intervention. The average length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the anti-D group than in the intravenous IgG group (1·8 days and 3·2 days, respectively; p < 0·0001). Fewer adverse effects (headache, vomiting, chills) were reported in children who received anti-D therapy.

Interpretation

In this analysis, anti-D was as effective as intravenous IgG in the treatment of children with acute ITP. Given that patients in the anti-D group experienced fewer adverse effects and shorter hospitalisation times than patients in the intravenous IgG group, this suggests that anti-D is a good substitute for intravenous IgG in the treatment of children with acute ITP.

Funding

None.

### Intravenous and subcutaneous immunoglobulin replacement: a two-way road. optimizing healthcare quality in patients with primary immunodeficiencies [^114F2o1m]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the alternate use of subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in patients with primary immunodeficiencies (PID) in a third-level Pediatric University Hospital.

Methods

Retrospective study of all patients receiving SCIG from 2006 to 2012. Data collected included demographics, date SCIG was started, date of switch to IVIG and reasons, administration tolerance, and related adverse events. Effectiveness was defined as the lack of severe infections.

Results

Twenty-three patients (15 male, 8 female) with PID were studied. SCIG was initiated at a median age of 14.2 years (8.4 months-25.7 years) and median duration on SCIG treatment was 41 months (4–68). Nine patients (39.1%) temporarily switched from SCIG to IVIG for the following reasons: vacation (8), administration issues (1), and transient need for immunomodulatory therapy (1). A mean of 5.2 IVIG infusions/patient (SD = 2.86) was administered while on SCIG. IVIG-related adverse events were documented in 3 patients with 6 infusions. Eight (34.8%) patients definitively discontinued SCIG use for the following reasons: convenience (5), adverse effects (1), coagulopathy (1), and autoimmune thrombocytopenia (1). There were no severe infections requiring hospital admission in any patient during the study period.

Conclusions

Alternating SCIG and IVIG use in patients with PID was associated with considerable advantages in terms of convenience for the patients and their caregivers, while maintaining the effectiveness and safety of this therapy. Healthcare units treating these patients should show flexibility with this dual therapy in order to optimize patients' quality of life.

### Efficacy and safety of anti-D immunoglobulins versus intravenous immunoglobulins for immune thrombocytopenia in children: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^117RVuVF]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) and anti-D immunoglobulin (anti-D) in pediatric immune thrombocytopenia (ITP).

Study Design

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines, including all randomized controlled trials that have assessed the efficacy and safety of anti-D and IVIG in children with ITP. We searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Primary outcomes were the proportion of children achieving platelet count responses as defined in each study and bleeding response. Other safety outcomes included infusion reactions and hemolysis.

Results

Eleven studies with 558 children were included. Anti-D was significantly inferior to IVIG at increasing platelet counts, both for thresholds of > 20×10 9 /L at 24–72 hours (response rate ratio for anti-D vs IVIG: 0.85, 95% CI 0.78–0.94) and > 50×10 9 /L at 24–72 hours (response rate ratio for anti-D vs IVIG: 0.75, 95% CI 0.61–0.92). Bleeding response was assessed in 4 studies, but some heterogeneity in reporting leads to unclear conclusion. General symptoms after anti-D infusion were less frequent than after IVIG (Peto OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.25–0.62). Hemolysis was more frequent after anti-D. The overall quality of the studies was low.

Conclusions

Compared with anti-D, IVIG led to a better response in terms of platelet count and may be preferred as a first-line treatment of ITP in children with acute hemorrhagic symptoms. However, the clinical significance of IVIG superiority on platelet count remains unclear.
