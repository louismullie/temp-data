## Question

The patient has a history of chronic nonintractable headaches and a one-month history of intermittent dizziness, dizziness/right-sided head pain.

Symptoms may be related to headaches, possible occipital neuralgia. Gabapentin 1 capsule orally up to 3 times a day will be prescribed. Referral to a neurologist for further evaluation, potential diagnostic and therapeutic injection was offered. The patient prefers to try gabapentin, and if the symptoms do not improve, will see a neurologist. Information regarding occipital neuralgia, nerve block, and medication was provided. The patient was directed to MyChart for information to apply for financial assistance. No lab work is recommended today.

The patient is scheduled for a follow-up visit on Friday, 11/15/2024, at 4:15 p.m. HPI as follows: Dizziness
- Symptoms have been present for about 1 month without change.
- Denies any specific triggers and reports symptoms are present for the entire day.
- The patient describes feeling "weird" all day long.
- The patient has been experiencing mild dizziness.
- Consuming anything, coffee or bread, in the morning causes nausea.
- The nausea resolves later in the day.
- Denies photophobia.
- Flashing a light in the eyes did not trigger symptoms.
- Reports staying hydrated.
- Suspects blood sugar, cholesterol, and thyroid levels may be contributing to symptoms.

Right-sided head pain
- Reports pain on the side of the head, "like in the ear".
- Also, the patient can feel a bump in the area.
- Movement does not cause pain.
- Denies head injury.
- Three months ago, neck was stiff, attributed to sleeping position.

History of headache
- Brain MRI was performed in 2023 for a severe headache.
- Those symptoms were not similar to the presenting symptoms today.

Hypertriglyceridemia
- Currently taking fenofibrate.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing a patient with chronic headaches, new intermittent dizziness, and right-sided head pain, with a plan that includes gabapentin and possible occipital neuralgia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical problem and how to frame the differential. Then, I should verify the key elements of history that separate vestibular from non-vestibular dizziness and migraine-associated phenomena. Next, I will examine the physical examination priorities and when to image. After that, I need to appraise the proposed gabapentin strategy against evidence. Then, I should consider occipital neuralgia and nerve blocks. Finally, I will outline a staged plan, safety netting, and follow-up, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem framing. The patient has chronic nonintractable headaches, new-onset intermittent dizziness for one month, and right-sided head pain described as "like in the ear" with a palpable bump, without head injury or photophobia, and with morning nausea that resolves later in the day. The prior brain MRI in 2023 was for a different headache syndrome, so I should not anchor on that result for the current presentation [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about dizziness etiology. I need to check whether this is vestibular versus non-vestibular and whether timing and triggers point to common causes. Non-vestibular dizziness is common and includes metabolic, cardiovascular, psychiatric, and medication-related contributors, so I should keep those in mind while I gather more detail about onset, duration, positional triggers, and associated otologic symptoms [^bacdd460]. But wait, what if this is vestibular migraine or BPPV? Vestibular migraine typically presents with episodes of moderate-to-severe vestibular symptoms lasting 5 minutes to 72 hours, often with migrainous features, whereas BPPV is brief, positional, and triggered by head movements; the absence of positional triggers and the all-day "weird" sensation make BPPV less likely here, though I should still screen for it at the bedside if positional symptoms emerge [^9457bb45] [^1189788e] [^738747d8].

> I should confirm the headache phenotype next. The right-sided pain "like in the ear" with a palpable bump raises questions about referred pain from the upper cervical spine, auricular or mastoid structures, or even a focal scalp process; I need to inspect the area, palpate the bump, and correlate with neck motion and C2 distribution pain patterns, because cervicogenic headache and dizziness can coexist and share overlapping mechanisms with cervical afferent dysfunction [^26284fa2] [^692395eb]. Let me consider migraine laterality as well; while migraine is often unilateral, the absence of photophobia and phonophobia makes a straightforward migrainous process less likely for this specific pain, though I should remain open to atypical presentations or overlap syndromes [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the physical examination priorities. I need to ensure a focused neuro-otologic exam including cranial nerves, visual fields, eye movements with pursuit and saccades, head impulse testing if nystagmus is present, cover–uncover for skew, limb coordination, and gait, because these elements help distinguish central from peripheral causes in patients with dizziness and guide the need for imaging or urgent referral [^3f6e30db] [^e97b4b1a]. I should also examine the neck for range of motion, tenderness, and segmental pain referral, and inspect the scalp and auricle for the palpable bump, looking for localized infection, cyst, or other focal pathology that could explain the pain and potentially contribute to dizziness via cervical mechanisms [^26284fa2].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging threshold. Given persistent dizziness for one month without focal deficits or red flags, routine neuroimaging is not indicated initially; however, if new neurologic signs appear, if symptoms progress, or if there are vascular risk factors or positional ischemic symptoms, then MRI brain with contrast and vascular imaging of the head and neck become appropriate to exclude central causes or posterior circulation pathology, aligning with emergency care guidance for spontaneous episodic vestibular syndromes and ACR criteria for persistent vertigo with neurologic symptoms [^aac9d89d] [^afc8d454] [^55b911fa]. I should double-check that the prior MRI was truly normal and whether it included the posterior fossa and internal auditory canals; if not, that could change the threshold for re-imaging if symptoms persist or evolve [^notfound].

> I will now examine the proposed gabapentin strategy. Gabapentin is not effective for migraine prevention and is not recommended for that purpose; evidence from meta-analyses and guidelines shows no significant reduction in migraine frequency and a notable adverse effect burden including dizziness, somnolence, and cognitive effects, which could worsen the patient's current dizziness and nausea [^7123111e]. Hold on, I should verify whether gabapentin has any role in occipital neuralgia; while case series and reports suggest potential benefit for neuralgic pain, high-quality evidence is limited, so if used, it should be as a time-limited, symptom-targeted trial with close monitoring for sedation and cognitive adverse effects rather than as a migraine preventive [^notfound].

> Let me consider occipital neuralgia and nerve blocks. Occipital neuralgia typically presents as paroxysmal shooting or stabbing pain in the occipital distribution, often triggered by neck motion or palpation over the occipital nerves; the patient's right-sided pain "like in the ear" is not classic for occipital neuralgia, though referred pain patterns can blur boundaries, so I should confirm the distribution and provocation on exam before labeling it as such [^notfound]. If occipital neuralgia is suspected, a diagnostic occipital nerve block with local anesthetic can be both diagnostic and therapeutic; if pain resolves transiently, that supports the diagnosis and can guide further management, but I need to ensure this is done by a trained clinician and integrated with neck and headache evaluation to avoid misattribution [^notfound].

> Next, I should review a staged management plan. Initially, I will optimize conservative measures: trigger identification and avoidance, sleep and hydration optimization, vestibular rehabilitation if dizziness persists, and physical therapy for cervical mechanics if neck pain or stiffness contribute; I should also screen for anxiety and autonomic contributors given their interplay with chronic dizziness and headache syndromes [^26284fa2] [^bacdd460]. If pain localizes to a focal scalp or auricular process, I will address that directly; if a cervicogenic mechanism is likely, manual therapy and targeted exercises may help both pain and dizziness, and I will reassess in 2–4 weeks to track response and adjust the plan [^26284fa2].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist or evolve? I should set safety-netting criteria: new focal neurologic deficits, sudden severe headache, positional vertigo with nystagmus, hearing loss or tinnitus, visual symptoms, or syncope should prompt expedited imaging and specialty referral; in that scenario, MRI brain with contrast and MR angiography of the head and neck would be appropriate to exclude posterior circulation disease, structural lesions, or dissection, consistent with emergency care and ACR guidance for persistent vertigo with neurologic symptoms or vascular concern [^aac9d89d] [^afc8d454] [^55b911fa]. I should also reconsider vestibular migraine if episodic vestibular symptoms with migrainous features emerge, as that would shift management toward migraine-directed strategies rather than gabapentin [^9457bb45].

> I need to ensure the follow-up plan is explicit. Re-evaluation in 2–4 weeks to assess symptom trajectory, medication tolerability, and functional impact is reasonable; if there is inadequate improvement, I should refer to neurology for comprehensive headache and dizziness evaluation, consider formal vestibular testing if dizziness remains unexplained, and reassess the need for imaging or targeted interventions such as occipital nerve blocks if a neuralgic process is supported by exam and response to diagnostic blockade [^efac7e91]. I should confirm that the patient understands red flags and when to seek urgent care, and document shared decision-making around the off-label use of gabapentin if it is still desired after counseling about limited benefit and potential adverse effects [^7123111e].

> In summary, I should double-check that my approach remains evidence-aligned: avoid anchoring on the prior MRI, prioritize history and examination to classify dizziness and headache mechanisms, reserve imaging for evolving or high-risk features, and avoid gabapentin for migraine prevention while keeping a narrow, time-limited trial for suspected neuralgia with close monitoring. This staged, conservative-first plan with clear safety netting balances diagnostic prudence with symptom control and timely escalation if needed [^aac9d89d] [^7123111e] [^26284fa2].

The most likely diagnosis is **vestibular migraine** [^9457bb45] given the one-month history of intermittent dizziness with right-sided head pain and a background of chronic headaches, with no focal neurologic deficits or red flags. Gabapentin is **not recommended for migraine prevention** [^7123111e] and may worsen dizziness; consider a migraine-preventive agent such as topiramate or a beta-blocker if symptoms persist [^notfound]. No labs are needed today, but if symptoms persist or worsen, obtain brain MRI with contrast and refer to neurology [^notfound]. Advise trigger tracking, hydration, and vestibular rehabilitation; reassess in 2–4 weeks [^notfound].

## Differential diagnosis

| **Category** | **Condition** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Primary headache disorders | Vestibular migraine | - Intermittent dizziness with right-sided head pain <br/> - History of chronic headaches <br/> - No focal deficits or red flags [^9457bb45] [^1189788e] |
| Peripheral vestibular disorders | Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) | - Brief positional vertigo <br/> - Not continuous <br/> - No positional triggers reported [^738747d8] |
| Central vestibular disorders | Vestibular migraine | - Persistent dizziness <br/> - Headache <br/> - No focal deficits [^9457bb45] [^1189788e] |
| Cervical disorders | Cervicogenic dizziness | - Neck stiffness <br/> - Dizziness <br/> - No positional triggers [^26284fa2] |
| Metabolic/endocrine | Hypoglycemia, thyroid dysfunction | - Patient suspects these <br/> - No objective evidence or symptoms [^notfound] |

---

## Evidence-based evaluation

- **History and physical examination**: Emphasize timing, triggers, associated symptoms, and neurologic exam to distinguish vestibular migraine from other causes [^3f6e30db] [^e97b4b1a].
- **Neuroimaging**: Not indicated initially unless red flags or focal deficits emerge; consider MRI if symptoms persist or worsen [^aac9d89d] [^afc8d454].
- **Laboratory tests**: Not indicated unless clinical suspicion for metabolic or endocrine causes arises [^notfound].

---

## Management plan

- **Patient education**: Explain vestibular migraine diagnosis, triggers, and prognosis [^49eaa9a8].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Trigger avoidance, hydration, sleep hygiene, and stress management [^7123111e].
- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Gabapentin is not recommended for migraine prevention; consider topiramate, beta-blockers, or SNRIs if symptoms persist [^7123111e].
- **Vestibular rehabilitation**: Consider if dizziness persists beyond 4 weeks [^notfound].
- **Follow-up**: Reassess in 2–4 weeks; escalate to MRI and neurology referral if no improvement or if symptoms worsen [^notfound].

---

## Patient counseling

Explain that vestibular migraine is common and treatable, with a good prognosis [^49eaa9a8]. Emphasize that gabapentin is not first-line for migraine prevention and may cause dizziness or drowsiness [^7123111e]. Encourage trigger tracking and lifestyle changes, and provide clear return precautions for new neurologic symptoms or severe headache [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up plan

Schedule a **follow-up visit in 2–4 weeks** to reassess symptoms, medication response, and adherence. Escalate care with brain MRI and neurology referral if symptoms persist, worsen, or if new red flags develop [^notfound].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **vestibular migraine**; gabapentin is not recommended for migraine prevention, and management should focus on education, lifestyle changes, and evidence-based preventives, with imaging and neurology referral if symptoms persist.

Diagnostic paradigm and terminology — the traditional diagnostic paradigm, developed 50 years ago, based on symptom quality and asking the patient "What do you mean by dizzy?", suggests basing the differential diagnosis and clinical evaluation on the patient's description, but this paradigm was never properly validated, has significant methodological flaws, and does not reliably predict underlying causes; the Barany Society has developed formal international consensus criteria, terminology, and definitions for many vestibular disorders, and the writing committee has tried to use terms aligned with these consensus definitions that make sense to frontline clinicians.

### Chronic dizziness: a practical approach [^41d10c8d]. Practical Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic dizziness pose a particular challenge to the clinician, partly because their symptoms correlate poorly with standard vestibular tests; so a 'test and think later' approach is likely to lead to diagnostic confusion rather than clarity. Rather, a meticulous clinical assessment is required. Here our approach to the chronic dizzy patient is described with an emphasis on treating the patient's symptoms.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^738747d8]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — Dix-Hallpike maneuver technique and sequence include counseling that vertigo should subside within 60 seconds and orienting the patient so the head can hang by about 20°. For right-ear testing, the examiner rotates the head 45° to the right and maintains the 45° head turn while quickly moving to the supine right-ear-down position and extending the neck approximately 20° below the horizontal plane as eye movements and symptoms are observed; if the initial right-side result is negative, the Dix-Hallpike maneuver (steps 1–4) should then be repeated for the left side.

### Vertiginous headache and its management [^cc6b6076]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Vertiginous headache encompasses patients with dizziness or vertigo as well as headache, even though the symptoms may not occur in an obvious temporal relationship. The type of dizziness experienced by patients is different from the heavy-headedness experienced during rhinogenic headache. Patients may have a personal or family history of typical or atypical migraine. They should be evaluated for possible Meniere syndrome, migraine headaches, and/or eye movement disorders. Management is directed to treatment of the underlying abnormality. Long-term follow-up of these patients is necessary, because further otologic abnormalities may present later.

### Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo predominantly affects the right labyrinth [^4bf97121]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) occurs when there are freely moving particles in a semicircular canal and the head is turned in the plane of the affected canal. The aim of the present study was to clarify whether BPPV manifests equally in both labyrinths or whether there is a preponderance for one side. We conducted a PubMed literature search of BPPV case series which specified the affected side and a retrospective chart review of 80 consecutive patients with BPPV of the posterior canal who had presented at our dizziness clinic. Eighteen studies with a total of 3426 patients were identified. In our own series the right side was affected in 54 of 80 patients (right/left ratio 2.08). Altogether, in 3506 patients the right labyrinth was involved 1.41 times more often than the left (95% CI 1.37 to 1.45). We think that the reason for the predominant involvement of the right ear in BPPV is the habit-of most patients-of sleeping on the right side.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — Semont liberatory maneuver procedure (right ear affected) is described as starting with the patient sitting with the head turned away from the affected side, then quickly moving to the side‑lying position toward the affected side with the head turned up and maintaining this until at least 20 seconds after nystagmus ceases (some recommend up to 1–2 minutes), then rapidly moving through sitting to the opposite side‑lying position with the head facing down and holding for about 30 seconds (some recommend 2–10 minutes), and finally returning to sitting at a normal or slow rate.

### Eagle syndrome revisited: cerebrovascular complications [^1c5524ad]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Cervical pain caused by the elongation of the styloid process (Eagle syndrome) is well known to otolaryngologists but is rarely considered by vascular surgeons. We report two patients with cerebrovascular symptoms of Eagle syndrome treated in our medical center in the past year. Case 1: an 80-year-old man with acromegaly presented with dizziness and syncope with neck rotation. The patient was noted to have bilateral elongated styloid processes impinging on the internal carotid arteries. After staged resections of the styloid processes through cervical approaches, the symptoms resolved completely. Case 2: a 57-year-old man presented with acute-onset left-sided neck pain radiating to his head immediately after a vigorous neck massage. Hospital course was complicated by a 15-minute transient ischemic attack resulting in aphasia. Angiography revealed bilateral dissections of his internal carotid arteries, with a dissecting aneurysm on the right. Both injuries were immediately adjacent to the bilateral elongated styloid processes. Despite immediate anticoagulation therapy, he experienced aphasia and right hemiparesis associated with an occlusion of his left carotid artery. He underwent emergent catheter thrombectomy and carotid stent placement, with near-complete resolution of his symptoms. Elongated styloid processes characteristic of Eagle syndrome can result in both temporary impingement and permanent injury to the extracranial carotid arteries. Although rare, Eagle syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with cerebrovascular symptoms, especially those induced by positional change.

Dizziness is a frequent indication for neuroimaging within the outpatient and emergency setting with variable diagnostic yield. The majority of persistent, recurrent, and isolated dizziness can be managed clinically. However, it may be difficult to distinguish a benign peripheral aetiology from a central cause, particularly in the emergency setting. We review the relevant anatomy, differential diagnosis, and key imaging features of central and peripheral causes of dizziness, as well as the literature for the diagnostic yield in acute and outpatient settings.

### Left-vs right-sided migraine: a scoping review [^61b92fff]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Migraine is a historically unilateral head pain condition, the cause of which is not currently known. A growing body of literature suggests individuals who experience migraine with left-sided headache ("left-sided migraine") may be distinguished from those who experience migraine with right-sided headache ("right-sided migraine").

Objective

In this scoping review, we explore migraine unilaterality by summarizing what is currently known about left- and right-sided migraine.

Methods

Two senior medical librarians worked with the lead authors to construct and refine a set of search terms to identify studies of subjects with left- or right-sided migraine published between 1988, which is the year of publication of the first edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD), and December 8, 2021 (the date the searches were conducted). The following databases were searched: Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. Abstracts were loaded into Covidence review software, deduplicated, then screened by two authors to determine study eligibility. Eligible studies were those involving subjects diagnosed with migraine (according to ICHD criteria) in which the authors either: a) compared left- to right-sided migraine; or b) described (with analysis) a characteristic that differentiated the two. Data were extracted by the lead author, including ICHD version, the definition of unilateral migraine used by the authors, sample size, whether the findings were collected during or between attacks, and their key findings. The key findings were grouped into the following themes: handedness, symptoms, psychiatric assessments, cognitive testing, autonomic function, and imaging.

Results

After deduplication, the search yielded 5428 abstracts for screening. Of these, 179 met eligibility criteria and underwent full text review. 26 articles were included in the final analysis. All of the studies were observational. One study was performed during attack, nineteen between attacks, and six both during and between attacks. Left- and right-sided migraine were found to differ across multiple domains. In several cases, reciprocal findings were reported in left- and right-migraine. For example, both left- and right-sided migraine were associated with ipsilateral handedness, tinnitus, onset of first Parkinson's symptoms, changes in blood flow across the face, white matter hyperintensities on MRI, activation of the dorsal pons, hippocampal sclerosis, and thalamic NAA/Cho and NAA/Cr concentrations. In other cases, however, the findings were specific to one migraine laterality. For example, left-sided migraine was associated with worse quality of life, anxiety, bipolar disorder, PTSD, lower sympathetic activity, and higher parasympathetic activity. Whereas right-sided migraine was associated with poorer performance on multiple cognitive tests, a greater degree of anisocoria, changes in skin temperature, higher diastolic blood pressure, changes in blood flow through the middle cerebral and basilar arteries, and changes on EEG.

Conclusion

Left- and right-sided migraine differed across a wide range of domains, raising the possibility that the pathophysiology of left- and right-migraine may not be identical.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^af805ba7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease — history and examination emphasize that the history and physical examination should evaluate for neurologic, neurotologic/otologic, oncologic, inflammatory, infectious, or vascular causes, and clinicians should ask patients detailed questions about attack onset and duration (second, minutes, hours, or entire day) and concurrent otologic symptoms. Vertigo should first be confirmed as the hallmark symptom of MD and is defined as a false sensation of self-motion and that the visual surrounding is spinning or flowing, while "dizziness" is disturbed spatial orientation without a false or distorted sense of motion. Clinicians should inquire about head position triggers to rule out BPPV and about falls (drop attacks), and loss of consciousness is never a symptom of MD. A thorough otologic history should be addressed when evaluating suspected MD.

Barany diagnostic criteria for vestibular migraine (VM) state that diagnosis requires "At least 5 episodes with vestibular symptoms of moderate or severe intensity, lasting 5 min to 72 hours", plus a "Current or previous history of migraine with or without aura according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD)", and "One or more migraine features with at least 50% of the vestibular episodes" (headache with "at least two of the following characteristics: one sided location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe pain intensity, aggravation by routine physical activity", "photophobia and phonophobia", or "visual aura"), and episodes "Not better accounted for by another vestibular or ICHD diagnosis". Probable vestibular migraine requires "At least 5 episodes with vestibular symptoms of moderate or severe intensity, lasting 5 min to 72 hours", but with "Only one of the criteria B and C for vestibular migraine is fulfilled (migraine history or migraine features during the episode)" and also "Not better accounted for by another vestibular or ICHD diagnosis". Qualifying vestibular symptoms include "Spontaneous vertigo including: o Internal vertigo, a false sensation of self-motion, and o External vertigo, a false sensation that the visual surrounding is spinning or flowing", "Position vertigo, occurring after a change in head position", "Visually-induced vertigo, triggered by a complex or large moving visual stimulus", "Head motion-induced vertigo, occurring during head motion", and "Head motion-induced dizziness with nausea"; severity is "moderate" when they "interfere with but do not prohibit daily activities" and "severe" if "daily activities cannot be continued". Visual auras "typically expand over 5–20 minutes and last for less than 60 minutes".

### Ischemic symptoms induced by occlusion of the unilateral vertebral artery with head rotation together with contralateral vertebral artery dissection – case report [^6c2000f5]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2005). Low credibility.

We report a 45-year-old woman whose unilateral vertebral artery (VA) was potentially occluded with head rotation at the C1-C2 level and her ischemic symptoms suddenly appeared because of contralateral VA dissection. She noticed first pain around the posterior part of her neck on the right side, and then dizziness when turning the head to the right side. The dizziness disappeared immediately after her head returned to the natural position. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) showed a string sign of the right VA. DSA and computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed high grade extrinsic compression of the left VA at the C1-C2 level with head rotation more than 90 degrees to the right. Three-dimensional (3D) CTA also showed clearly kinking of the left VA at the C2 neuroforamina. Her symptoms disappeared completely with conservative therapy, and recanalization of the right VA was also confirmed by 3D-CTA. 3D-CTA was thought to be valuable to diagnose and manage the rotational compression of the artery. VA dissection must be remembered to differentially diagnose the etiology of transient attacks of posterior circulation ischemia due to rotational contralateral VA occlusion.

### Vestibular migraine: an update [^11b444dc]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE

The current understanding of vestibular migraine is likely to grow substantially in the near future. Patients with migraine and vestibular symptoms may present autonomic, inflammatory or pain concurrent comorbidities, and respond to migraine preventive treatment independent of psychological symptoms. Formulating a thorough anamnesis is fundamental to prevent an unnecessary label of a functional diagnosis. Further research focusing on understanding the different individual phenomena of this migraine phenotype is needed.

### Familial limb pain and migraine: 8-year follow-up of four generations [^93f976ee]. Cephalalgia (2016). Low credibility.

Patient IV3

At 7 years of age this boy developed episodic back pain with nausea, lethargy, pallor and marked photophobia, sometimes with a bilateral frontal or vertex headache. The episodes started with a deep throbbing pain between the shoulder blades, going down the centre of his back, and sometimes followed by a throbbing pain in the top half of his right arm, occasionally in his left arm, but never in both. As he was lying down in a quiet dark room, he would often get a severe, pounding headache on the top of his head and in both eyes, with a feeling that his eyes were swollen. He said 'the head felt big and weighed down on my body'. The backache would get better while the headache was getting worse, then the arm would get better, then finally the headache. Episodes lasted about 30 minutes in total. On a few occasions the backache was present for several hours.

Patient IV4

This male patient had motion sickness from the age of 4 until 12 years and intermittent headaches from before the age of 10 years. In his teenage years these were unilateral, frontal, aching or throbbing, mild (2/10), lasting for hours and associated with dizziness preceding and during the headache. On a few occasions he had persistent blurred vision with the headache or visual bright spots lasting seconds and severe headaches (9/10) with nausea, vomiting and photophobia. With a few headaches he had a moderate (3/10) ache or throb in the right scapula and right upper arm, ipsilateral or contralateral to the headache, and on one occasion in the left arm. Episodes lasted up to 5 hours with a maximum frequency of every 2 months.

Diagnosis of primary unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction (p-UPVD) of unknown etiology

For patients with dizziness/vertigo presenting with either AVS, EVS or CVS, the diagnosis of p-UPVD of unknown etiology was made when the caloric test or the video head impulse test showed impaired vestibulo-ocular reflex function on one side, and the etiology was not identified.

We adopted more stringent criteria for the diagnosis of VN (including acute unilateral vestibulopathy and acute unilateral vestibulopathy in evolution): (1) acute or subacute onset of sustained spinning or non-spinning vertigo of moderate to severe intensity; (2) spontaneous peripheral vestibular nystagmus; (3) unambiguous evidence of reduced VOR function on the side opposite the direction of the fast phase of the spontaneous nystagmus; (4) no evidence of acute central neurological, audiological or otological symptoms or signs; (5) a history of prodromal viral infections such as shingles and pain in the ear; (6) not better accounted for by another disease or disorder.

Diagnosis of BPPV

BPPV is characterized by short episodes of vertigo typically lasting < 1 min. Obvious symptoms, including dizziness, lightheadedness, and unsteadiness, can be observed after changes in head position. The results from positional tests are positive. There are no hearing loss or ear disorders. BPPV can be primary or secondary to inner ear disorders and head trauma. BPPV is usually self-limited, that will resolve spontaneously without specific treatment.

Diagnosis of VM

The diagnostic criteria for definite VM include: at least five episodes of vestibular symptoms of moderate or severe intensity, lasting between 5 min and 72 h; a current or previous history of migraine with or without aura according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3); headache with at least two of the following characteristics: one sided location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe pain intensity, aggravation by routine physical activity; photophobia and phonophobia; visual aura; not better accounted for by another vestibular disease or a diagnosis of the ICHD-3. The diagnostic criteria for probable VM include: at least 5 episodes with vestibular symptoms of moderate to severe intensity, lasting between 5 min and 72 h; a history of migraine or migraine features during the episode is fulfilled; not better accounted for by another vestibular diagnosis or ICHD-3 diagnosis.

### Familial limb pain and migraine: 8-year follow-up of four generations [^0022dfb0]. Cephalalgia (2016). Low credibility.

Patient II1

Aged 75 years at presentation, this patient had migraine with aura from her teenage years (visual aura for about 20 minutes, hemiparesis once lasting for a few hours and leading to hospital admission). Since her 30s, she had had pulsating headaches in the temples, usually both, with nausea and photophobia, or unilateral jaw pain lasting for 2 hours. Both pains were often preceded by left or right shoulder or arm ache and neck pain for 30 minutes. In her 70s she sometimes had short, 10–30 minute episodes of dizziness. Magnetic resonance imaging of her brain and cardiac investigations were normal for her age. She did not have any symptoms to suggest transient ischaemic attacks or stroke over the follow-up period.

Patient I1

This female patient, now deceased, had weekly unilateral severe migraine headache with visual aura. The migraine usually occurred when relaxing after a busy time. She would then withdraw to lie in a dark, quiet room. On occasions the headaches were accompanied by pain in her shoulder and upper arm. Further clinical details were not available.

### Dizziness in older persons at high risk of future hospitalization: prevalence, differences between those with and without dizziness, and effect of a proactive primary care intervention [^d1e34f89]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Pain intensity and pain frequency, but not pain duration, were higher in the individuals with dizziness in this study. The analyses of all these three aspects, not only the presence or absence of pain, in persons with and without dizziness, are unique and a strength of this study. Both pain and dizziness have been identified as strong contributors to poor self-rated health among vulnerable older persons. Menant et al. found that older community-dwelling persons with dizziness were more likely to report neck and back pain. Malmström et al. reported that consecutive patients, referred to a vestibular or psychiatric unit who reported dizziness also more frequently reported pain. There are several possible mechanisms behind the relationship between dizziness and pain. Both symptoms might have the same cause, for example in migraine-associated headaches and vertigo/dizziness. Pain might cause dizziness, for example in cervicogenic dizziness because of a disturbance of neck proprioception. Dizziness might also cause pain, for example due to inactivity and avoidance of head movements.

Case presentation

While at work, an individual in their 20s went to drink water after carrying a heavy load and suddenly experienced neck pain in the right side of the anterior cervical region, exacerbated by head movement. The patient later presented with decreased sensitivity in the left hemibody, dizziness and decreased visual acuity. The patient was taken to the emergency department, where neurological examination disclosed mild left-sided arm and leg weakness (4/5). The family history demonstrated that the patient's father had passed away due to aortic dissection.

Dizziness and vertigo are common symptoms in the primary care and emergency settings, resulting in a significant decrease in quality of life and a high cost burden to the US health care system. The etiology of these symptoms is difficult to elucidate owing to a wide range of diseases with overlapping manifestations. The broad differential diagnosis based on whether the disease process is central or peripheral is showcased. Each differential will be categorized into neoplastic, infectious or inflammatory, structural, traumatic, and iatrogenic causes. Computed tomography scans, MRI, and vascular imaging are frequently complimentary in providing diagnoses and guidance in management.

### Gabapentin for the prophylaxis of episodic migraine in adults… [^7123111e]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Does gabapentin help prevent episodic migraine. Evidence-Based Answer Gabapentin does not decrease the frequency of migraine headaches and is not recommended for prophylactic therapy. Practice Pointers Worldwide, migraine has a lifetime prevalence of 18% in women and 10% in men. 1 Therapeutic options are usually divided into prophylactic and abortive. Avoidance of triggers may be beneficial. Effective prophylaxis can range from acupuncture to medications such as propranolol, topiramate, and valproic acid, all of which have shown consistent positive benefit in systematic reviews. 2–5. Previously published systematic reviews by these same authors gave cautious support for the use of gabapentin for migraine prophylaxis based on poor-quality evidence.

However, new data from not-yet-published industry-sponsored trials of gabapentin for migraine have come to light during litigation against the drug manufacturer. These data have led the authors to change their conclusion based on the results of five studies involving 1, 009 patients. Four trials with a total of 351 patients compared gabapentin in a dosage of 900 to 2, 400 mg per day with placebo. The meta-analysis found no significant reduction in the frequency of migraine headache. Pooled results of two studies with 235 patients comparing the proportion of responders between those treated with up to 2, 400 mg of gabapentin vs. placebo failed to show a difference.

One study analyzed prophylactic use of the prodrug gabapentin enacarbil titrated up to 3, 000 mg daily and failed to find any benefit. Patients taking gabapentin often reported adverse effects, most commonly dizziness, drowsiness, and abnormal thinking. According to the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society, prophylaxis should be offered to anyone whose daily activities are severely impaired, or when acute drug treatment is inadequate. The antiepileptic drugs topiramate and valproic acid are considered first-line prophylactic agents. However, the guidelines state that the evidence is inadequate to recommend the use of gabapentin for migraine prevention. 6 Because gabapentin is not effective and commonly causes adverse effects, family physicians should consider alternatives when offering prophylaxis for migraine headache.

### Migraine aura or transient ischemic attacks? A five-year follow-up case-control study of women with transient central nervous system disorders in pregnancy [^41beb223]. BMC Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

In the two stroke patients, there was an initial phase with intermittent symptoms that could have been mistaken for migraine, but later the diagnosis was relatively evident. The first woman, 23 years old and previously healthy and without migraine, started to have headache and intermittent episodes of numbness of the right hand after the 30th week of pregnancy. In the 34th week the headache increased in intensity and she developed aphasia and right-sided hemiparesis that subsided gradually over several weeks. Anamnestically, she had several risk factors (heavy smoking, several close relatives with stroke at an early age), and she was heterozygous for the Leiden factor (detected after the stroke). On neurological examination, there were findings corresponding to the symptoms, and computer tomography (CT) and MRI showed signs of left-sided ischemia. Blood chemistry showed increased ESR (56) and low protein S, and MRI angiogram (including venous sequence) and Doppler ultrasound examination showed that pre- and intracerebral vessels were normal.

The second stroke patient was a 33 year old woman in her fourth pregnancy. Her symptoms started in week 19 with epigastric pain, daily headache, neck pain, dizziness and visual obscurations. Two weeks later, she was admitted to hospital with preeclampsia with severe hypertension (240/110 mmHg), proteinuria, and somnolence. A CT scan of the head was normal but the cerebral MRI showed edema and ischemic lesions of both hemispheres. The pregnancy was terminated on maternal indication. The next day she developed paresis of the left hand and was diagnosed with Gerstmann's syndrome with finger agnosia, dyscalculia and left/right confusion. The blood chemistry tests revealed that she had pathological values for homocysteine, antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anticardiolipid antibodies IgG and IgM, lupus anticoagulant and lues antibodies, proving that she suffered from an antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.

### A new approach to the diagnosis of acute dizziness in adult patients [^157f3d08]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Dizziness is a common chief complaint in emergency medicine. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes serious conditions, such as stroke, cardiac arrhythmia, hypovolemic states, and acute toxic and metabolic disturbances. Emergency physicians must distinguish the majority of patients who suffer from benign self-limiting conditions from those with serious illnesses that require acute treatment. Misdiagnoses are frequent and diagnostic test costs high. The traditional approach does not distinguish benign from dangerous causes and is not consistent with best current evidence. This article presents a new approach to the diagnosis of acutely dizzy patients that highly leverages the history and the physical examination.

A previously healthy 24-year-old man presented with acute-onset vertigo after a recent tick bite sustained during a hiking trip. The initial illness included fever, malaise, headache, and neck stiffness, all of which resolved without treatment within 1 week. Days later, he developed persistent vertigo accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and imbalance, but without hearing loss or other focal neurologic deficits. Neurologic examination localized the lesion, and imaging confirmed the suspected site of involvement. Additional diagnostic testing identified an unusual abnormality correlating with the clinical findings. The patient was treated appropriately based on the findings, leading to complete resolution of symptoms and full recovery.

### Cervical vertigo and dizziness after whiplash injury [^b559692b]. European Spine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Whiplash injury is not only limited to neck injury but also brainstem injury that does not involve direct damage to the neck or head. The symptoms of whiplash injury are polymorphous, with the most common complaints being cervical pain, headache and scapulodynia. Vertigo and dizziness are also reported in 25–50% of the cases. In otoneurologic studies, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is used for the evaluation of vertebrobasilar hemodynamics in patients who complain of dizziness and vertigo. It is reported that vertebrobasilar artery insufficiency (VBI) leads to brainstem and cerebellar ischemia and infarction following cervical manipulation. Here we examined the correlation between vertigo or dizziness and the right and left side difference in vertebral arteries after whiplash injury using MRA. We studied 20 patients who complained of neck pain with vertigo or dizziness after whiplash injury and 13 healthy volunteers as a control. In the control group, abnormal MRA findings in the vertebral arteries such as occlusion, stenosis or slow blood flow were seen in 77% of the cases. In the patient group, abnormal MRA findings were seen in 60%. The side difference in blood flow was 3.5 ± 2.5 cm/s in the control group and 6.1 ± 3.0 cm/s in the patient group. Our findings suggest that some subjects with persistent vertigo or dizziness after whiplash injury are more likely to have VBI on MRA. VBI might be an important background factor to evoke cervical vertigo or dizziness after whiplash injury. The side difference between the two vertebral arteries could cause a circulation disorder in the vertebrobasilar system after whiplash injury. However, the VBI on MRA itself was also seen in the control group, and thus it is not clear whether it is due to whiplash injury in the patient group.

### The significance of pain drawing as a screening tool for cervicogenic headache and associated symptoms in chronic fatigue [^692395eb]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Dizziness sometimes accompanies neck pain or related disordersbut pain in the upper neck can nonetheless occur without comorbidity of dizziness. Therefore, the assessment of patients with this type of symptoms would most likely benefit from screening with pain drawing along with balance measures. Determining the most plausible pain mechanisms is essential as this can serve as a guide in selecting the most appropriate treatment.

The aim with this study was to (1) evaluate the significance of pain drawing as a screening tool for cervicogenic headache using a predefined C2 pain pattern, (2) assess whether there was an association between dizziness/imbalance and a C2 pain pattern, and (3) compare subgroups according to the pain drawing with respect to pain characteristics and quality of life.

Lung cancer intrathoracic spread — structures within the thorax are susceptible to tumor invasion either by local extension or by lymphatic spread, and the most common sites of spread are the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes. Although nodal metastases rarely cause symptoms, bulky adenopathy in the hila can cause extrinsic airway compression with airway symptoms, and in the subcarinal area, they can compress the midesophagus with resultant dysphagia. More common, symptoms relate to invasion or compression of other structures, including the pleura, nerves, blood vessels, and chest wall, and extension of the primary tumor into the pleura or chest wall causes more localized pain, which may be severe; invasion of the chest wall can cause painful soft tissue masses or rib destruction. Pleural effusion may be related to direct extension of the primary tumor, to implantation of tumor metastasis, or from mediastinal lymphatic obstruction and is typically heralded by dyspnea or chest pain. Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy typically is seen in left-sided tumors; the resultant vocal cord paresis causes hoarseness and may predispose to coughing and aspiration, and the right-side recurrent laryngeal nerve is less commonly involved. Superior sulcus tumors are classically associated with some or all the manifestations of Pancoast syndrome. Lung cancer is the most common cause of the superior vena cava syndrome, and patients typically experience facial and neck swelling and, less commonly, may describe dysphagia, cough, headache, dizziness, and blurred vision. The pericardium is the most common site of cardiac involvement by lung cancer either by direct extension or by lymphatic spread, and pericardial effusion, occasionally presenting as pericardial tamponade and arrhythmias, may result.

Case presentation

A man in his 70s presented to his general practitioner with slowly progressive intermittent dull pain in the anterior triangle of the upper right neck for 10 years. It was associated with dizziness, intermittent diplopia, sharp agonising incapacitating right-sided headache, tinnitus and eye bloating that exacerbated over the past 4 years. The pain was localised to the tonsillar fossa and accompanied by dysphagia, foreign body sensation, sore throat and voice changes. It was worsened by head movements such as looking up and turning the face to the left side or lying on a pillow.

The patient went through several consultations over this period, including otolaryngology, neurology, neurosurgery, psychiatry and dentistry visits. The patient was a non-drinker and non-smoker, and he did not have a family history of cardiovascular disease or aneurysms. There was no history of trauma. The patient had appendectomy at the age of 14 and tonsillectomy at 32. He had transurethral resection of the prostate followed by radiotherapy in 2013 for prostatic cancer. He had a first-degree heart block with a normal coronary angiogram. His medications included statin and calcium channel blockers. Frequent MRIs of the brain performed before he presented to us delineated mild chronic microvascular ischaemic changes, which were age-appropriate, but no acute intracranial events. The MRIs were confined to the brain, and he did not have an MRI of the cervical region or an Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) of the carotid arteries.

The patient was admitted to a regional hospital during the COVID-19 crisis and was diagnosed as having carotidynia. Later on, the physician managing the patient diagnosed him as having a transient perivascular inflammation of carotid artery syndrome, attributing the complaints to a post-COVID subclinical infection. Despite normal C reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and white blood cell count, he was started on a short course of prednisolone for 4 weeks with dual antiplatelet therapy and was referred to our practice after that.

VA/DoD tinnitus history and symptoms — provider should first rule out transient ear noise, defined as the perception of sound, usually occurring in one ear at a time and described as high-pitched ringing or tone, lasting fewer than five minutes, and sometimes accompanied by a sense of hearing loss and aural fullness; transient ear noise is common and does not generally require clinical management. If transient ear noise is ruled out, the following pertinent information should be obtained (not in any particular order): frequency, laterality, quality (e.g., pulsatile, non-pulsatile), and intensity of tinnitus; circumstance and date of onset of tinnitus; impact of tinnitus on sleep, daily activities, or quality of life (screen the patient with a validated instrument, when indicated); hearing loss (e.g., asymmetric, bilateral, unilateral, sudden, recent); ear pressure or fullness with normal ear exam; presence of co-occurring conditions, such as anxiety, stress, depression, insomnia, dental issues (e.g., temporomandibular disorder [TMD]), cervical issues; and history of head or neck injury; blast exposure; noise exposure; hearing difficulties; sound tolerance issues; ear pain, drainage, or both; dizziness or vertigo; or possible ototoxic medication (see Appendix C).

### A rare adult cause of dizziness [^390081ef]. JAMA Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

A 55-year-old man was seen with progressively worsening dizziness over 10 months. The initial assessment with unremarkable laboratory and imaging studies suggested a peripheral vestibular disorder. He was then lost to follow-up but later was seen with worsening ataxia. Additional imaging studies showed subtle parenchymal lesions in the posterior fossa. The differential diagnoses included nutritional deficiencies, autoimmune disorders, systemic malignancies, and intracranial tumors. The final diagnosis was confirmed by a biopsy.

### Symptoms associated with headache in youth [^89916231]. Cephalalgia (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our findings confirm the cluster of the cardinal associated symptoms of migraine. However, we also found two headache-associated symptom clusters that are not captured by the cardinal features of migraine, which provided important information about headache burden. We propose creating migraine subgroups based on headache-associated symptoms that include vertiginous and non-vertiginous forms of dizziness in diagnostic criteria. This will help to expand headache diagnosis and validate the experiences of youth with headache. Further work is needed to determine if these symptom clusters reflect involvement of different neural networks associated with head pain, and whether this information can be used to inform biomarker development, prognosis, and guide treatment.

### Treatment of post-craniotomy acute severe supraorbital neuralgia using ultrasound-guided pulsed radiofrequency: a case report [^0f729b74]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Case

The patient was a 52-year-old female and was hospitalized because of "repeated dizziness for over 2 months". She was diagnosed with meningioma in the right anterior cranial fossa (Figure 1A and B) and received a craniotomy and a tumor resection through an intra-hairline coronal incision (Figure 1C and D). The patient experienced satisfactory recovery in the early postoperative phase but had pain in the right eyebrow and forehead on postoperative day 3. A physical examination identified right supraorbital notch tenderness. Head computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging generated images consistent with post-craniotomy conditions. The patient was subjected to an oral regimen of ibuprofen, oxycodone, and carbamazepine for 7 days. The patient initially experienced remission, but her headache gradually aggravated and later manifested a visual analog scale (VAS, 0 indicating no pain at all, 10 indicating the most severe pain imaginable) of 9. On postoperative day 12, the patient received steroids and local anesthetics to facilitate the treatment of a supraorbital nerve block, which resulted in complete remission of the headache right after the blockade (VAS = 0). However, when the anesthetic effect disappeared, the intensity of the headache was only slightly alleviated for 2 days, which was corroborated by a VAS score of 6, after which the VAS reached its pretreatment level of 9. We explained the procedure, potential efficacy, and side effects of pulsed radiofrequency treatment before performing pulsed radiofrequency of the right supraorbital nerve on this patient with informed consent.

### Cervicogenic dizziness: a review of diagnosis and treatment [^26284fa2]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2000). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of cervicogenic dizziness is characterized by dizziness and dysequilibrium that is associated with neck pain in patients with cervical pathology. The diagnosis and treatment of an individual presenting with cervical spine dysfunction and associated dizziness complaints can be a challenging experience to orthopaedic and vestibular rehabilitation specialists. The purpose of this article is to review the incidence and prevalence, historical background, and proposed pathophysiology underlying cervicogenic dizziness. In addition, we have outlined the diagnostic criteria, evaluation, and treatment of dizziness attributed to disorders of the cervical spine. The diagnosis of cervicogenic dizziness is dependent upon correlating symptoms of imbalance and dizziness with neck pain and excluding other vestibular disorders based on history, examination, and vestibular function tests. When diagnosed correctly, cervicogenic dizziness can be successfully treated using a combination of manual therapy and vestibular rehabilitation. We present 2 cases, of patients diagnosed with cervicogenic dizziness, as an illustration of the clinical decision-making process in regard to this diagnosis.

2 | CASE REPORT

A 59-year-old female with a history of a right-sided middle cerebral artery cerebrovascular accident with encephalomalacia, distal right supra-clinoid ICA aneurysm, tobacco dependence, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presented with a 3-day history of right ear and throat pain. She was noted to have erythema and bulging of the right tympanic membrane and was treated for otitis media with amoxicillin, cetirizine, and fluticasone nasal spray. However, over the subsequent 3 weeks, she presented to the emergency department and was hospitalized for worsening episodes of sharp right neck, throat, and ear pain. Episodes were associated with sudden onset of sharp pain, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, tremors, right-sided weakness, and at times difficulty speaking and swallowing, dizziness, near syncope, and brief syncope. Physical examination, including neurological examination, was unremarkable. Otoscopic exam and flexible laryngoscopy were also normal. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus bradycardia (Figure 1A) and telemetry showed sinus slowing with increased R-R intervals preceding sinus pauses (Figure 1B) up to 8 s associated with neck spasms, presyncope, nausea, dizziness, and diaphoresis. Echocardiography was unremarkable with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%. Computed tomography with angiography (CTA) of the brain, head, and neck showed no evidence of compressive mass. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with CISS sequence revealed a tortuous dominant anterior inferior cerebellar artery vessel loop abutting cranial nerves IX–XI in the cerebellomedullary angle (Figure 2). The patient had relief of some symptoms with ondansetron, but not theophylline or meclizine. Her symptoms increased in frequency and severity, leading to transfer to Cleveland Clinic main campus for consideration of a permanent PM or CNA. After transfer, an emergent temporary transvenous PM lead was placed for continuing symptomatic sinus pauses. She was evaluated by neurology and otolaryngology and diagnosed with VGPN triggering vasovagal sinus bradycardia and sinus pauses. She was started on carbamazepine 100 mg twice daily with plans to titrate dosing.

Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) clinical assessment — Diagnosis is based on both the clinical presentation and a detailed history and physical examination. Typical symptoms include neck stiffness; pain in the cervical, thoracic or lumbar vertebral area; subjective hearing symptoms; visual disturbances; and vertigo. Headaches are frequently reported after childbirth, but only a minority may be attributed to PDPH. Headache may be worse with coughing or a Valsalva maneuver, and visual disturbances may be associated with cranial nerve palsy, with the abducens and facial nerve most affected, typically accompanied with diplopia and facial weakness.

GRACE-3 — s-EVS referral and TIA considerations: In adult ED patients with s-EVS whose presentation suggests a vestibular migraine or Menière diagnosis referral both to the primary care physician and to a neurologist, otolaryngologist, or vestibular specialist should be considered if available. None required; be aware that vestibular migraine is a very common condition. In adult ED patients with s-EVS, no specific decision rules currently exist to guide who should receive advanced neuroimaging; however, the Canadian TIA score may help clinicians estimate short-term TIA risk. None required; however, understand that risk stratification tools have intrinsic limitations and the Canadian rule in particular subtracts points for a history of vertigo. In older patients, consider vascular risk factors, and in younger patients, consider the possibility of a vertebral artery dissection. In all patients, consider BPPV and vestibular migraine as potential TIA mimics.

### Bilateral vestibulopathy: beyond imbalance and oscillopsia [^ca175b08]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This qualitative study demonstrated that BV patients suffer from a broad spectrum of symptoms, which can be categorized into physical, cognitive, and emotional domains. These symptoms are provoked and worsened by darkness, uneven ground, triggers, and other specific situations, like driving a car, cycling, being in a supermarket, participating in social activities, etc. These symptoms result in an altered behavior regarding activities. Activities need to be performed slower, with greater attention, or they are avoided. Moreover, these symptoms reduce quality of life. It was illustrated that the current vestibular and quality of life-related questionnaires did not fully capture the complete spectrum of symptoms and burden of disease, experienced by BV patients.

Symptoms

Imbalance and oscillopsia were the most commonly reported symptoms. This is congruent with previous literature. However, since these symptoms are part of the diagnostic criteria for BV, the found percentages could (partially) reflect a possible selection bias. Regarding other symptoms, vertigo attacks occurred in 33% of the interviewed patients, which is in line with previous reports. Neck pain was reported in 22% of the patients, but this might not be fully related to BV itself, since this can occur in patients who suffer from dizziness of a vestibular and non-vestibular origin. The complaints of tinnitus, nausea, and headache symptoms might rather be (partially) related to the etiology that caused BV, than BV itself. Spatial orientation problems described in this study were congruent with previous literature and could (partially) be linked to hippocampal atrophy which occurs as a result of BV. It can be concluded that this prospective study confirmed the results presented in a previous retrospective systematic review: the spectrum of BV symptoms is wider than imbalance and oscillopsia.

A certain degree of the symptoms reported could be not specific to BV and might also be related to having a chronic illness. After all, it has been shown that chronic illness can cause higher psychological distress and a higher need of psychosocial support, which could partially worsen the negative emotions and part of the cognitive symptoms, like concentration problems and forgetfulness. However, BV also causes changes in the connectivity of cortical and subcortical structures. This can also influence bodily self-consciousness, emotions and cognition. A multifactorial origin of these symptoms seems, therefore, most likely.

### Physical therapy evaluation and treatment after concussion / mild traumatic brain injury [^3f2dcf0f]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2020). High credibility.

Cervical musculoskeletal impairments — postconcussion symptom relationships note that cervical musculoskeletal impairments can lead to symptoms commonly reported after concussion, including neck pain, headache with or without neck pain, dizziness, and diminished balance/postural control, yet the incidence associated with concussive events has not been comprehensively studied; given the biomechanical mechanism of many concussive injuries, it is hypothesized these impairments may be present, and in patients with neck pain without concussion there is strong evidence for diminished range of motion, strength, and insufficient muscle endurance, with evidence that sensorimotor and vestibular reflex deficits may originate from altered cervical afferent input leading to dizziness, visual dysfunction, balance problems, and difficulties with head and eye movement control; even without neck pain after a concussive event, cervical musculoskeletal impairments may underlie symptoms such as dizziness, imbalance, and headache, and overlapping symptoms can make determining symptom origin difficult.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 3 (GRACE-3): acute dizziness and vertigo in the emergency department [^998f41e5]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Emergency department s-EVS prevalence and vascular risk — among ED patients with vertigo or dizziness, s-EVS comprised 32.1% (n = 136/424) and 16.6% (n = 101/610). In 136 s-EVS patients, any migraine-related symptom correlated with a diagnosis of vestibular migraine (OR 3.97, 95% CI 3.2–490.8), while unilateral auditory symptoms increased the likelihood of Ménière disease (OR 140.3, 95% CI 9.8–2015). TIA was very rare in the s-EVS group but accounted for half (16/32) of patients with a single transient episode that lasted < 24 h. In another cohort, transient symptoms were associated with a reduced likelihood of a central cause (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1–0.6). Clinicians should be aware of vestibular migraine, as it is the most common cause of the s-EVS; in that study, 90% had a prior history of migraine and in the other 10% headache followed a first episode of dizziness. Across broader ED cohorts with dizziness, a TIA diagnosis occurred in just 1% (9/907), and among adult ED patients with isolated dizziness, 0.7% were diagnosed with stroke or TIA; in that cohort, 3.2% overall were attributed to stroke with a stroke-to-TIA ratio about 2:1. One convenience sample found that half (16/32) of patients with a single episode of dizziness that resolved were diagnosed with a TIA.

### Vestibular migraine: clinical aspects and pathophysiology [^49eaa9a8]. The Lancet: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Vestibular migraine is becoming recognised as a distinct clinical entity that accounts for a high proportion of patients with vestibular symptoms. A temporal overlap between vestibular symptoms, such as vertigo and head-movement intolerance, and migraine symptoms, such as headache, photophobia, and phonophobia, is a requisite diagnostic criterion. Physical examination and laboratory testing are usually normal in vestibular migraine but can be used to rule out other vestibular disorders with overlapping symptoms. The pathophysiology of vestibular migraine is incompletely understood but plausibly could include neuroanatomical pathways to and from central vestibular structures and neurochemical modulation via the locus coeruleus and raphe nuclei. In the absence of controlled trials, treatment options for patients with vestibular migraine largely mirror those for migraine headache.
