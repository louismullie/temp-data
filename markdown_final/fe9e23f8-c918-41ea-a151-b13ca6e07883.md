## Question

Does trazodone help patients sleep?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether trazodone helps patients sleep and how to interpret the evidence and guidelines to make a recommendation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory status and labeled indications. Then, I should review high-quality guidelines for chronic insomnia. Next, I will examine randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses for efficacy and safety. After that, I need to consider special populations where trazodone might differ. Finally, I will synthesize a balanced, actionable conclusion with dosing, monitoring, and alternatives, making sure I verify each claim against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory context, because I need to ensure I'm not overextending beyond what's supported. Trazodone is FDA-approved for major depressive disorder; its use for insomnia is off-label, although some FDA materials list insomnia in Alzheimer's disease and PTSD as recognized off-label uses, which still do not constitute formal approval for insomnia per se [^111hFipc].

> Next, I should review guideline positions for chronic insomnia in adults, since these carry substantial weight for practice. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends against trazodone for chronic insomnia due to limited efficacy and concerns about adverse effects, issuing a weak recommendation against its use for sleep onset or maintenance insomnia in adults [^111DA9Eb] [^112YbrR2] [^114owGtg]. Hold on, I should verify the VA/DoD stance as well; the VA/DoD guideline likewise suggests against trazodone for chronic insomnia disorder, citing very low-quality evidence and potential harms, aligning with AASM [^112sQS7w] [^1115Mv1c] [^114aydsZ]. I should also confirm the American College of Physicians perspective; ACP emphasizes CBT-I as first-line and notes insufficient evidence to recommend trazodone for insomnia, which reinforces the cautious stance [^116A69g1].

> Now, I will examine the core efficacy data in primary chronic insomnia, and I need to be careful not to overinterpret small studies. The pivotal evidence base is sparse; a single 50 mg RCT in primary insomnia showed only modest, sub–clinically significant improvements in some patient-reported outcomes and more adverse effects than placebo, which led the AASM to judge harms may outweigh benefits in this context [^112QNBhe]. Wait, let me verify pooled estimates; AASM meta-analytic summaries suggest trazodone reduces sleep latency by about 10 minutes and WASO by about 5 minutes without improving sleep quality, reinforcing that effects are small and not consistently clinically meaningful [^1154isNg]. Earlier critical reviews similarly conclude there are very few data supporting trazodone for nondepressed insomnia, with design limitations and lack of dose–response data tempering confidence [^111PwWuE] [^111qtxoJ].

> But wait, what if the population is different; I should review special contexts where signals might diverge. In Alzheimer's disease, a small RCT found that 50 mg trazodone increased total nocturnal sleep time by roughly 42 minutes and improved sleep efficiency over two weeks without serious adverse events, though the certainty is low and larger trials are needed [^111Tzjuo] [^115wbMR2]. In hemodialysis patients with chronic insomnia, the Sleep-HD RCT found no superiority of trazodone over placebo on the Insomnia Severity Index at 6 weeks, indicating no clinically meaningful benefit in that population either [^116VLkhq]. In contrast, a small, preliminary randomized study in the insomnia with objective short sleep duration phenotype suggested trazodone increased total sleep time by about 50 minutes and reduced salivary cortisol versus CBT-I, but the design was open-label and underpowered, so I should be cautious about overgeneralizing [^116mp9jS].

> I need to check safety and tolerability next, because even modest benefits could be undermined by risks. Trazodone commonly causes somnolence, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, and dry mouth, and in RCTs of primary insomnia, adverse events occurred more frequently than with placebo, including headache and somnolence, which can impact next-day functioning [^112QNBhe]. Hold on, I should verify fall risk in older adults; observational Medicare data associate trazodone with higher risks of falls, healthcare utilization, and costs comparable to benzodiazepines and zolpidem, challenging the perception that trazodone is categorically safer in geriatric populations [^114zMxGv] [^111nwviQ]. I should also confirm boxed warnings; antidepressants carry suicidality warnings in younger patients, and abrupt discontinuation can precipitate withdrawal, so counseling and monitoring are essential [^111CbgYo] [^113wHxM5].

> Let me consider mechanism and dosing pragmatics, because these often drive off-label use. Trazodone's sedative effects are thought to reflect 5‑HT2A antagonism, alpha‑1 blockade, and weak H1 antagonism, with low hypnotic doses typically in the 25–100 mg range, taken 1–2 hours before bedtime to align with pharmacokinetics and minimize next-day sedation, though this is based on limited data and clinical experience rather than robust dose–response trials [^111WnadS] [^1124aBXW]. I should double-check that no major guideline endorses a specific hypnotic dose range for trazodone; indeed, AASM and VA/DoD do not provide dose recommendations for insomnia, underscoring the evidence gap [^111DA9Eb] [^115MPejm].

> Next, I should review alternatives and first-line strategies to ensure the recommendation is complete. CBT-I remains the first-line treatment for chronic insomnia with durable benefits on sleep and daytime functioning, and when pharmacotherapy is used, agents with stronger evidence such as low-dose doxepin or dual orexin receptor antagonists are preferred by contemporary guidelines, with careful counseling on risks and a deprescribing plan [^116A69g1] [^115MPejm]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought suvorexant had a strong recommendation; let me verify — VA/DoD cites insufficient evidence for suvorexant, so I should correct that and frame DORAs as options with emerging but not uniformly strong guidance across bodies, reinforcing the primacy of CBT-I and the need for individualized risk–benefit discussions [^115wWqAX] [^115MPejm].

> Synthesizing this, I should confirm the bottom line. For adults with primary chronic insomnia, trazodone has, at best, modest and inconsistent effects on sleep parameters that generally do not reach clinically significant thresholds, and it is associated with more adverse effects than placebo in the best available RCT. Major guidelines recommend against its routine use for chronic insomnia, particularly given safety concerns in older adults and the availability of better-supported therapies [^112QNBhe] [^111DA9Eb] [^112sQS7w]. In selected special populations such as Alzheimer's disease, small studies suggest possible improvements in total sleep time and efficiency, but evidence quality is low and replication is needed; in hemodialysis, RCT data do not show benefit, so routine use is not supported there either [^111Tzjuo] [^116VLkhq]. If, after shared decision-making and a trial of CBT-I, trazodone is used off-label, I need to ensure low starting doses, slow titration, fall-risk mitigation, and explicit monitoring for sedation, orthostasis, and mood or suicidality symptoms, with a plan to reassess efficacy and discontinue if benefits are not realized [^115MPejm] [^111CbgYo].

---

Trazodone is **modestly effective** for insomnia, with evidence of small improvements in total sleep time and sleep efficiency, but **not recommended as first-line therapy** due to limited efficacy and notable side effects [^112QNBhe] [^111DA9Eb]. It is most appropriate for patients with comorbid depression or anxiety, or when other hypnotics are unsuitable [^1124aBXW]. Common adverse effects include daytime sedation, dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension; rare risks include priapism and cardiac arrhythmias. CBT-I remains the preferred initial treatment, and trazodone should be used at low doses (25–100 mg) with close monitoring.

---

## Clinical evidence for efficacy

- **Primary insomnia**: AASM guidelines conclude trazodone 50 mg has modest effects on sleep latency and total sleep time, but benefits are limited and not clinically significant; it is not recommended as first-line therapy [^112QNBhe] [^111DA9Eb].

- **Comorbid depression/anxiety**: Trazodone is beneficial when insomnia coexists with depression or anxiety, addressing both mood and sleep [^112e4fag] [^1124aBXW].

- **Alzheimer's disease**: Low-certainty evidence suggests trazodone 50 mg may increase total sleep time and sleep efficiency in dementia, but larger trials are needed [^111Tzjuo] [^115wbMR2].

- **PTSD**: Trazodone is sometimes used for PTSD-related insomnia and nightmares, though evidence is limited [^111hFipc].

---

## Recommended dosage and administration

- **Typical dosing**: 25–100 mg at bedtime; start low and titrate based on response and tolerability.

- **Administration**: Take shortly after a meal or light snack to reduce gastrointestinal upset and enhance absorption [^111DzHyK].

- **Duration**: Use the lowest effective dose with periodic reassessment to minimize adverse effects and dependence risk.

---

## Safety profile and side effects

- **Common side effects**: Sedation, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, dry mouth, headache, nausea, and blurred vision [^111va9Qp].

- **Serious risks**: Priapism, cardiac arrhythmias, and serotonin syndrome (especially with other serotonergic drugs) [^111qtxoJ].

- **Fall risk**: Increased risk in older adults, comparable to benzodiazepines and zolpidem [^114zMxGv] [^111nwviQ].

- **Suicidality**: Black box warning for increased suicidal thoughts in young adults; monitor closely [^113bZseR] [^111CbgYo].

## Comparison with other insomnia medications

| **Medication** | **Efficacy** | **Safety profile** | **Clinical recommendations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Trazodone | Modest efficacy; limited evidence | Sedation, orthostatic hypotension, priapism, falls | Not first-line; consider for comorbid depression/anxiety |
| Benzodiazepines | Effective short-term | Dependence, cognitive impairment, falls | Short-term use only |
| Non-benzodiazepine hypnotics (zolpidem, eszopiclone) | Effective short-term | Dependence, complex sleep behaviors, falls | Short-term use; caution in elderly |
| Melatonin | Limited efficacy | Minimal side effects | Consider for mild insomnia or adjunctive use |
| CBT-I | Highly effective | No medication side effects | First-line therapy |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

AASM **guidelines** recommend against trazodone as first-line for chronic insomnia due to limited efficacy and potential harms [^111DA9Eb] [^114owGtg]. VA/DoD **guidelines** similarly advise against trazodone for chronic insomnia, citing low-quality evidence and potential harm [^113bZseR] [^1115Mv1c]. CBT-I remains the **preferred initial treatment** for chronic insomnia [^116A69g1].

---

## Patient populations benefiting from trazodone

- **Comorbid depression/anxiety**: Trazodone addresses both mood and sleep disturbances [^112e4fag].

- **Substance use disorders**: Lower abuse potential than benzodiazepines; consider when addiction risk is a concern [^notfound].

- **Elderly patients**: Use cautiously due to sedation and fall risk; monitor closely [^114zMxGv].

---

## Limitations and gaps in current research

- **Limited high-quality evidence**: Few large, well-controlled RCTs in primary insomnia [^112QNBhe].

- **Short-term studies**: Most trials are ≤ 6 weeks; long-term efficacy and safety are uncertain [^112sQS7w].

- **Dose-response unclear**: Optimal dosing for insomnia is not well established [^111qtxoJ].

---

## Practical clinical considerations

- **Start low, go slow**: Begin at 25–50 mg and titrate to 100 mg if needed.

- **Monitor adverse effects**: Watch for sedation, orthostatic hypotension, and falls, especially in older adults [^114zMxGv].

- **Reassess regularly**: Periodically review efficacy and side effects to guide continued use.

- **Combine with CBT-I**: Use trazodone adjunctively with behavioral therapy when possible [^116A69g1].

---

Trazodone can modestly improve sleep, particularly in patients with comorbid depression or anxiety, but it is **not first-line** because of limited efficacy and notable side effects. Use low doses with close monitoring, and prioritize CBT-I as initial therapy.

Purpose of Review

The aim of this review article was to summarize recent publications on effects of antidepressants on sleep and to show that these effects not only depend on the kind of antidepressant drugs but are also related to the dose, the time of drug administration, and the duration of the treatment.

Recent Findings

Complaints of disrupted sleep are very common in patients suffering from depression, and they are listed among diagnostic criteria for this disorder. Moreover, midnocturnal insomnia is the most frequent residual symptom of depression. Thus, all antidepressants should normalize sleep. However, at least in short-term treatment, many antidepressants with so-called activating effects (e.g. fluoxetine, venlafaxine) may disrupt sleep, while others with sedative properties (e.g. doxepin, mirtazapine, trazodone) rapidly improve sleep, but may cause problems in long-term treatment due to oversedation. For sleep-promoting action, the best effects can frequently be achieved with a very low dose, administered early enough before bedtime and importantly, always as a part of more complex interventions based on the cognitive-behavioral protocol to treat insomnia (CBT-I).

Summary

For successful treatment of depression, it is necessary to understand the effects of antidepressants on sleep. Each physician should also be aware that some antidepressants may worsen or induce primary sleep disorders like restless legs syndrome, sleep bruxism, REM sleep behavior disorder, nightmares, and sleep apnea, which may result from an antidepressant-induced weight gain.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic insomnia disorder and obstructive sleep apnea [^115wWqAX]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Chronic insomnia disorder pharmacologic therapy — VA/DoD guideline recommendations address ramelteon, suvorexant, antipsychotic drugs, benzodiazepines, and trazodone. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of ramelteon for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder and there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of suvorexant for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder. We suggest against the use of antipsychotic drugs for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder, we suggest against the use of benzodiazepines for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder, and we suggest against the use of trazodone for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder.

### Effect of interventions for the management of sleep disturbances in patients with long COVID: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1127ngmr]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Given that the pathophysiology of long COVID and its impact on sleep is not fully understood, the development of targeted treatments remains uncertain. Currently, there is no standardized protocol specifically addressing long COVID–associated sleep disturbances, though interventions involving nonpharmacological approaches are increasingly explored due to their generally lower risks and side effects. Guezguez et alsuggest that recommendations endorsed by the European Academy for managing sleep problems during the pandemic can be extended to patients with long COVID. This includes cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, sleep hygiene improvement, and relaxation therapies. On the pharmacological side, National Center for Infectious Diseases physicians manage symptoms through the use of melatoninand antidepressants. However, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends against the use of melatonin and trazodone for the treatment of chronic insomnia, citing insufficient evidence of efficacy. The application of these agents in long COVID may reflect off-label use driven by clinical need, although further research is warranted. This divergence reflects a broader lack of consensus on managing of long COVID–associated sleep disturbances, underscoring the need for high-quality studies to inform standardized care and determine the long-term effectiveness and safety of various interventions for sleep disturbances in long COVID.

This research aims to compile and evaluate current evidence on the interventions for sleep disturbances in patients with long COVID, through a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. By assessing effectiveness, it seeks to identify promising interventions and pinpoint areas requiring further research, aiming to enhance clinical decision-making and care quality for affected individuals.

### Effects of treatment of sleep disorders on sleep, psychological and cognitive functioning and biomarkers in individuals with HIV / AIDS and under methadone maintenance therapy [^113Mc139]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Poor sleep is a major complaint of people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and undergoing methadone maintenance therapy (MMT). We tested the impact of three different sleep-improving interventions (trazodone; sleep hygiene training; sleep hygiene training + trazodone) on sleep, psychological functioning and biomarkers in males with HIV and undergoing MMT.

Methods

A total of 75 male outpatients (mean age: 39.6 years) participated in a 12 week intervention. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the following conditions: trazodone 50 mg/d (TRAZ); sleep hygiene training (SHT); sleep hygiene training and trazodone (SHT + TRAZ). At baseline, and six and 12 weeks later, participants completed questionnaires covering subjective sleep and daytime sleepiness, and symptoms of depression and anxiety. In parallel, their cognitive performance (working memory; sustained attention) was assessed. Biomarkers (cortisol, BNDF, CD4 +) were assessed at baseline and at the end of the study.

Results

Over time, sleep disturbances decreased and daytime functioning and overall sleep quality improved. More specifically, both sleep disturbances and daytime functioning improved in the two SHT conditions from baseline to week 6. Daytime functioning remained stable from week 6 to week 12. Over time, in all conditions symptoms of depression and anxiety declined from baseline to week 6 and remained lower from week 6 to week 12. Daytime sleepiness, symptoms of insomnia and sleep-disordered breathing remained unchanged. Sustained attention performance improved over time from baseline to week 6 and remained high through to week 12. Biomarkers remained unchanged.

Conclusions

In males with HIV and undergoing MMT, treating sleep disturbances over a period of six to 12 weeks had a positive impact on aspects of sleep disturbance, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and cognitive performance. The results indicate that sleep hygiene training, either as stand-alone or in combination with trazodone, can produce positive results.

### Burden of insomnia and sleep disturbances and the impact of sleep treatments in patients with probable or possible Alzheimer's disease: a structured literature review [^117NPUD3]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Antidepressants

A small study by Camargos et al. found that trazodone 50 mg increased sleep duration and efficiency in AD patients versus placebo, was well-tolerated, and did not increase daytime sleepiness. Petrescu et al. also reported that patients taking trazodone (50–200 mg) had more total sleep time in both patient- and nurse-reported measures, although it was associated with more side effects than quetiapine. Interestingly, trazodone may have a possible neuroprotective effect in AD patients with insomnia; a retrospective study by La et al. reported that among a group of older adults, including some with AD, those not using trazodone declined 2.4-fold faster than trazodone users (median dose 50 mg) across an average of 3.75 years based on MMSE results. Notably, while trazodone is an antidepressant, a dose of 50 mg is consistent with use for insomnia, rather than depressive disorders. A small study assessing the antidepressant mirtazapine reported no effects on sleep outcomes in AD patients (Table 5).

Antipsychotics

A five-year study by Yin et al. reported improved daytime (ESS) and nighttime (PSQI) sleep symptoms with low-dose risperidone versus zolpidem tartrate, melatonin, or no drug treatment in AD patients with sleep disturbances. Risperidone also alleviated neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI) versus no treatment and did not significantly affect cognition or functional autonomy versus zolpidem, melatonin, or no treatment, suggesting no acceleration in mental deterioration. Risperidone was also associated with a significant improvement in caregiver mood and sleep and a lower expectation that a patient would be institutionalized versus the melatonin and no treatment groups, implying improved outlook; institutionalization of risperidone-treated patients was significantly lower than in patients not receiving sleep medication. However, this was not a randomized trial, and treatment group assignment was based on the preference of the spousal caregiver. In a nursing home-based study, Meguro et al. reported that low-dose risperidone was effective at increasing patient sleep and decreasing daytime wandering. Importantly, patients did not exhibit daytime oversleeping or side effects which would have prevented them participating in daily activities.

### Zopiclone versus placebo for short-term treatment of insomnia in patients with advanced cancer-a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled clinical multicenter phase IV trial [^114mo5wt]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, clinical trial was designed to study the short-term effectiveness of zopiclone on patient-reported sleep quality in patients with advanced cancer who report insomnia. After six nights of intervention, patients receiving zopiclone reported significantly better sleep quality as compared with patients receiving placebo, adjusted for baseline sleep quality.

Two systematic reviews, one from 2013 and another from 2020, on the management of sleep disturbance in cancer identified no RCTs investigating pharmacological interventions for sleep disturbance in palliative cancer care. Nevertheless, a variety of pharmacological agents are in use to treat insomnia in patients with cancer. Benzodiazepines, with zolpidem and trazodone as the most frequently used drugs in palliative care, are reported by patients to be helpful at the time of prescription. However, due to the absence of clinical trials with randomization and a placebo comparison group, the effectiveness of these drugs was previously unproven for use against insomnia in cancer patients. The present study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first RCT that presents the effectiveness of zopiclone in patients with advanced cancer.

### Trazodone improves obstructive sleep apnea after ischemic stroke: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover pilot study [^111vfiNf]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Low arousal threshold plays a part in the pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and may be improved by sedatives. Sedative antidepressants are frequently prescribed for stroke patients due to their high prevalence of insomnia and depression. However, the effect of sedative antidepressants on the severity of OSA in stroke patients has not been studied well.

Methods

In a double-blinded randomized crossover pilot study, 22 post-acute ischemic stroke patients (mean age, 61.7 ± 10.6 y) with OSA received 100 mg of trazodone or a placebo just before polysomnography, with approximately 1 week between measures. The study also measured baseline heart rate variability and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure.

Results

Administration of trazodone significantly increased the percentage time of slow-wave sleep (31.5 ± 13.2 vs. 18.4 ± 8.7%; P < 0.001) and improved almost all the parameters of OSA severity, including the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI, 25.4 ± 15.4 vs. 39.1 ± 18.4 events/h; P < 0.001), the respiratory arousal index (9.8 (5.8–11.95) vs. 14.1 (11.3–18.7) events/h; P < 0.001), and the minimum oxygen saturation (80.2 ± 9.1 vs. 77.1 ± 9.6%; P = 0.016). Responders to therapy (AHI reduced by > 50%; n = 7/22) had predominant OSA during rapid-eye-movement sleep and decreased sympathetic tone, as reflected in significantly lower mean blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and normalized low-frequency power.

Conclusions

Obstructive sleep apnea with comorbid ischemic stroke may be a distinctive phenotype which responds quite well to trazodone, decreasing OSA severity without increasing nocturnal hypoxia.

### Sleep-HD trial: short and long-term effectiveness of existing insomnia therapies for patients undergoing hemodialysis [^1124oaR5]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale for study interventions

CBT for insomnia (CBT-I)

CBT-I is the first line therapy for insomnia. In adults with insomnia, CBT-I improves sleep latency, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, sleep quality, and can induce insomnia remission. Based on this evidence, the American College of Physicians strongly recommends CBT-I as the first-line treatment for insomnia. These studies have limited relevance for HD patients as they have unique challenges to maintaining regular sleep/wake routines. It is unknown if CBT-I will be effective in favorably modifying these behaviors to improve sleep for this patient population. Telehealth, a two-way video interaction between the patient and the therapist, overcomes accessibility challenges and has been identified by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine as having the potential to narrow the gap between the availability of sleep providers and the number of patients needing insomnia treatment. To date, only one center has reported a case series of its experience with telehealth CBT-I showing improvement; however, there was no control group to determine efficacy.

Trazodone

Pharmacotherapy is widely used as a first-line therapy for insomnia including HD patients; it is also an alternative for patients unwilling to engage with CBT-I or for whom CBT-I is unavailable or inaccessible. However, the drugs used widely have either concerns about safety or efficacy, or have been insufficiently studied for patients undergoing HD. Trazodone is an attractive option as population surveys show it to be the most common or second most common drug prescribed for insomnia in the United States for HD patients, yet is remarkably understudied.

Setting and participants

A total of 126 ESKD patients undergoing HD with chronic insomnia will be recruited from two clinical sites at the University of Washington, Seattle, WA and the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, which collectively have a wide range of dialysis clinics that vary in geographic area, size, and population served. These clinics were selected to ensure a diverse HD population with adequate representation of females and minority groups, including Blacks, Native Americans, and Hispanic/Latinos.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: a potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^1142AE12]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent studies reveal an association between slow-wave sleep (SWS), amyloid-β aggregation, and cognition.

Objective

This retrospective study examines whether long-term use of trazodone, an SWS enhancer, is associated with delayed cognitive decline.

Methods

We identified 25 regular trazodone users (mean age 75.4 ± 7.5; 9 women, 16 men) who carried a diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia, mild cognitive impairment, or normal cognition, and 25 propensity-matched trazodone non-users (mean age 74.5 ± 8.0; 13 women, 12 men), accounting for age, sex, education, type of sleep deficit (hypersomnia, insomnia, parasomnia), diagnosis, and baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Longitudinal group differences in cognitive testing were evaluated through repeated measures tests over an average inter-evaluation interval of four years.

Results

Trazodone non-users had 2.6-fold faster decline MMSE (primary outcome) compared to trazodone users, 0.27 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.07–0.48) versus 0.70 (95% CI: 0.50–0.90) points per year (p = 0.023). The observed effects were especially associated with subjective improvement of sleep complaints in post-hoc analyses (p = 0.0006). Secondary outcomes of other cognitive and functional scores had variable worsening in non-users and varied in significance when accounting for co-administered medications and multiple comparisons. Trazodone effects on MMSE remained significant within participants with AD-predicted pathology, with 2.4-fold faster decline in non-users (p = 0.038).

Conclusions

These results suggest an association between trazodone use and delayed cognitive decline, adding support for a potentially attractive and cost-effective intervention in dementia. Whether the observed relationship of trazodone to cognitive function is causal or an indirect marker of other effects, such as treated sleep disruption, and if such effects are mediated through SWS enhancement requires confirmation through prospective studies.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: a potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^115uCm4W]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

There are also inherent limitations to our study, primarily due to its retrospective nature. Ideally, we would prospectively standardize medication dosage and timing, after randomized allocation between groups, and monitor medication compliance across a predefined time period. For example, benefits observed in the trazodone group may reflect better overall medical management of participants by their physicians and delayed cognitive decline due to unaccounted factors. Possible adverse effects of trazodone were not explicitly reported during the assessment of participants' medication regimen. It is thus possible there is a biased selection against people who tried but did not tolerate trazodone for inclusion in the trazodone group, but who could have been included in the trazodone non-user group. Such participants may be more resistant in achieving better sleep consolidation through SWS enhancers. Alternatively, there may be different metabolism of trazodone in these participants, given that prior work indicates its active metabolite may have different effects on alertness compared to trazodone itself, a possibility that personalized medicine may be able to address. Eventually, optimal accounting for confounders necessitates prospective double-blind randomized trials to confirm that differential rates of cognitive decline are directly caused by trazodone. Such prospective studies, ideally incorporating interval cognitive evaluations, could also answer whether potential long-term trazodone benefits are due to continuous modulation of brain networks, or whether they primarily reflect early treatment period effects. Even though there are no prospective long-term studies of trazodone for insomnia in elders, long-term persistent benefits have been observed in depression.

Methods/design

Study design and overview

SLEEP-HD is a parallel-group RCT wherein 126 HD patients treated in community-based dialysis facilities in Seattle and Albuquerque will be randomized 1:1:1 over 31 months to 6-week treatment with telehealth Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I), trazodone, or medication placebo (Fig. 1). The investigators were considering increasing the sample size to 141 HD patients, but are in the process of re-evaluating this modification in co-operation with the NIH due to the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all clinical research operations. SLEEP-HD has two specific aims designed to test two hypotheses:
Specific Aim One – To compare the efficacy of 6-week treatment with telehealth CBT-I vs. trazodone vs. placebo for the treatment of chronic insomnia in patients undergoing HD. Hypothesis One - We hypothesize that the efficacy of six-week treatment with both telehealth CBT-I and trazodone will be superior to medication placebo in improving self-reported sleep.
Specific Aim Two – To compare the sustained efficacy of the 6-week treatment with telehealth CBT-I vs. trazodone vs. placebo for the treatment of chronic insomnia in patients undergoing HD by examining outcomes at 25 weeks from randomization.
Hypothesis Two - We hypothesize that telehealth CBT-I will be superior to both trazodone and placebo in improving self-reported sleep at 25 weeks from randomization.

Study overview

The primary and secondary outcomes (Table 2) for the two aims will be ascertained at weeks 7 and 25 from randomization, respectively.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: a potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^116Eeu2B]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Background:

Recent studies reveal an association between slow-wave sleep (SWS), amyloid- β aggregation, and cognition.

Objective:

This retrospective study examines whether long-term use of trazodone, an SWS enhancer, is associated with delayed cognitive decline.

Methods:

We identified 25 regular trazodone users (mean age 75.4 ± 7.5; 9 women, 16 men) who carried a diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia, mild cognitive impairment, or normal cognition, and 25 propensity-matched trazodone non-users (mean age 74.5 ± 8.0; 13 women, 12 men), accounting for age, sex, education, type of sleep deficit (hypersomnia, insomnia, parasomnia), diagnosis, and baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Longitudinal group differences in cognitive testing were evaluated through repeated measures tests over an average inter-evaluation interval of four years.

Results:

Trazodone non-users had 2.6-fold faster decline MMSE (primary outcome) compared to trazodone users, 0.27 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.07–0.48) versus 0.70 (95% CI: 0.50–0.90) points per year (p = 0.023). The observed effects were especially associated with subjective improvement of sleep complaints in post-hoc analyses (p = 0.0006). Secondary outcomes of other cognitive and functional scores had variable worsening in non-users and varied in significance when accounting for co-administered medications and multiple comparisons. Trazodone effects on MMSE remained significant within participants with AD-predicted pathology, with 2.4-fold faster decline in non-users (p = 0.038).

Conclusions:

These results suggest an association between trazodone use and delayed cognitive decline, adding support for a potentially attractive and cost-effective intervention in dementia. Whether the observed relationship of trazodone to cognitive function is causal or an indirect marker of other effects, such as treated sleep disruption, and if such effects are mediated through SWS enhancement requires confirmation through prospective studies.

### Practical approach to a patient with chronic pain of uncertain etiology in primary care [^116stf4f]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Reduce and remove daily analgesic therapy

Regular analgesic use may be associated with increased pain sensitivity and should be withdrawn with careful weaning. For some patients, especially those who have been living with daily analgesia for sometimes months or even years, this approach can be quite distressing. Therefore, communication with both patient and their caregivers, including reasons for withdrawing medication and clear explanation of the entire pain management plan and outcome expectations, is essential, with confirmation that this information has been understood. If the patient is not fully committed to the structured pain management plan, improvement in outcomes is unlikely.

Pharmacological sleep management

Sleep is a critical component of treatment and sleep management aims to ensure sufficient quantity of good quality sleep.

Short-term use of benzodiazepines or z-drugs (zolpidem and zopiclone) may be helpful during the initial stage of pain management. However, this should be limited to the shortest time possible (ie, less than 2 weeks), with withdrawal as pain and function improve. Reasons for choosing these drugs should be discussed with the patient, including that the duration of use will be limited to a certain period of time, which must be specified.

Thereafter, if sleep remains a problem, short-term intermittent use of sedative antidepressants (eg, mirtazapine, trazodone) is preferred. In carefully selected patients, it may be appropriate to prescribe Z-drugs for intermittent use. Because of potential for adverse effects, long-term use of benzodiazepines should be avoided (Box 6). Patients who are already taking benzodiazepines should preferably be slowly weaned (over approximately a month) until the medication can be discontinued altogether.

### The use of trazodone as a hypnotic: a critical review [^111qtxoJ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The last few years have seen a remarkable rise in the off-label use of trazodone for inducing sleep in nondepressed patients, to a degree that it is prescribed for this purpose as commonly as the leading hypnotic. In view of this widespread popularity, it seems prudent to review what is known of the safety and efficacy of trazodone when used in this context.

Data Sources and Selection

A MEDLINE search of the literature published in English between 1975 and 2003 that included the keywords sleep, trazodone, Desyrel, depression, sleeping pill, and sedative-hypnotics was conducted.

Data Synthesis

From this review, it is concluded that there are very few data to suggest that trazodone improves sleep in patients without mood disorder, though it does increase total sleep in patients with major depressive disorder. There are virtually no dose-response data for trazodone vis-à-vis sleep and, similarly, no available data on tolerance to its possible hypnotic effects. Areas of concern with its use include reports of significant dropout rates and induction of arrhythmias, primarily in patients with histories of cardiac disease, as well as the development of priapism.

Conclusion

In summary, there are few data to support the use of trazodone in nondepressed subjects. When the risk-benefit ratio of trazodone is assessed, its side effect profile, which is much more significant than that of conventional hypnotics, should be considered.

### Sleep-HD trial: short and long-term effectiveness of existing insomnia therapies for patients undergoing hemodialysis [^113qtm39]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

SLEEP-HD is the first multi-center RCT for the treatment of insomnia in patients undergoing HD and seeks to compare the efficacy of telehealth CBT-I vs. trazodone vs. medication placebo for the treatment of chronic insomnia in patients undergoing HD.

Dialysis is a life-sustaining treatment for patients with kidney failure. Nevertheless, most patients experience many troubling symptoms, and disturbances in sleep are among the most reported problem. However, there has been limited research done to identify what treatments are effective for patients undergoing HD with sleep problems. Moreover, HD treatments are scheduled three times every week, making it extremely difficult for patients to have the time to receive cognitive behavioral therapy – a treatment effective in improving sleep in individuals without kidney failure. In this study, we plan to test the short- and long-term effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy with a therapist face-to-face delivered over the web, instead of in-person, with a drug. This study has the potential not only to benefit patients treated with HD but other patients that have difficulty in accessing treatment for sleep problems such as residents of rural and underserved areas.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: a potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^114YKKG2]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

In summary, the pervasiveness and consistency of the observed trazodone effects, especially after considering disease severity and concomitant medication use, encourages further investigation into its effectiveness on preserving cognition via sleep-wake rhythm consolidation. Implications on clinical practice involve improving quality of life for patients who experience sleep disturbances that, if untreated, may promote future amyloid- β deposition. Furthermore, potential cognitive benefits of trazodone may be applicable to both cognitively intact older adults and mildly impaired patients with dementia. The effectiveness of trazodone, possibly achieved by decreasing amyloid- β aggregation and pathologic tau burden, as well as by improving sleep-mediated memory consolidation, can be further explored through controlled clinical trials.

### Effect of psychological and medication therapies for insomnia on daytime functions: a randomized clinical trial [^115REZb9]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Only a few studies have directly compared the efficacy of CBT and medications for daytime symptoms in insomnia, with mixed findings. In a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of young and middle-aged patients with chronic sleep-onset insomnia, no significant differences were found among CBT, medications, and combination therapy on mood-related changes after intervention. Another RCT of older patients with chronic insomnia found that CBT was more effective than zopiclone in reducing anxiety symptoms in the long term, and equally effective in reducing depressive symptoms in the short term. Furthermore, in an exploratory study of sequential treatments involving both medication and CBT, only CBT provided alone led to significant improvements in depressive symptoms from baseline to postintervention. These inconsistent results preclude definite conclusions about optimal therapy for improving daytime symptoms among patients with insomnia disorder. Although previous insomnia treatment studies have focused primarily on improving nocturnal symptoms of sleep continuity, greater attention to residual daytime impairments is important to optimize long-term outcomes. In addition, it is common for patients with insomnia who had suboptimal treatment responses to switch from one therapy to another in clinical practice. However, to our knowledge, no study has explored which first-stage treatment is optimal for improving daytime functions among patients with insomnia and which second-stage treatment offers the best added value for patients whose insomnia has not remitted with psychological or medication first-stage therapy.

The main objectives of this study were to compare short-term and long-term changes in daytime functions of 4 treatment sequences using psychological (behavioral and cognitive) and pharmacologic therapies (zolpidem and trazodone) for insomnia. In particular, the study aimed to compare the efficacy of behavioral therapy (BT) and zolpidem as first-stage therapies for improvement of daytime functions. For those whose insomnia did not remit after first-stage therapy, the added value of a second treatment was evaluated. Daytime functions investigated in the current study were among the predefined secondary outcomes of a previously published trial. Previous publications regarding the primary outcome related to sleep have suggested the benefits of sequential treatment paradigms on improving nocturnal symptoms of insomnia. We hypothesized that (1) participants receiving BT would show greater improvements in daytime functions after first-stage treatment than those receiving zolpidem and (2) of all patients receiving second-stage treatment, those who switched modalities (from BT to zolpidem, or vice versa) would report greater improvements at the end of second-stage treatment and at follow-ups than those continuing with the same treatment modality.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: a potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^113yYnec]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Based on previous studies that indicate a relationship between decreased SWS, cognitive deficits, and amyloid- β pathology as revealed through molecular PET even in cognitively non-impaired individuals, we included a CN group in addition to the two patient groups. Longitudinal trazodone use was associated with delayed cognitive decline across diagnostic groups in our study, supporting its possible utility as a treatment from cognitively non-impaired to mildly-impaired patients. None of our patients had moderate or severe dementia to allow for inferences of trazodone use on more advanced disease.

Trazodone group comparative delay in cognitive decline persisted when accounting for concomitant use of medications that modulate brain rhythms, such as stimulants and sedatives, which may signify trazodone's contribution to sleep-wake and ultradian rhythm consolidation toward delayed cognitive decline. However, when specifically accounting for ChEi use, trazodone users did not significantly benefit in delayed cognitive decline compared to non-users. This particular finding does not fully detract from our hypothesis that trazodone use may delay cognitive decline, considering that there may be 1) decreased statistical power when accounting for ChEi, 2) common mechanistic effects on sleep-wake rhythm consolidation between trazodone and ChEi, or 3) ceiling effects on cognitive outcomes for ChEi users. Specifically, ChEi users benefit from improved attention and alertness through enhancement of cholinergic transmission and may thus perform at ceiling throughout the follow-up period. Indeed, the observed rate of decline in MMSE for all non-users when accounting for ChEi use was slower than anticipated, at 0.60 points per year (Table 2), compared to the one-point decline per year observed in longitudinal trials on ChEi use in mild AD. Furthermore, for 25–40% of patients with mild to moderate AD who suffer from excessive daytime somnolence, daytime administration of ChEi can help consolidate sleep-wake rhythms by directly promoting daytime wakefulness. In turn, direct wakefulness consolidation indirectly enhances subsequent SWS, and may thus facilitate the hypothesized mechanism for trazodone's benefits. Even if ChEi have shared effects with trazodone toward delaying cognitive decline, trazodone has certain additional useful clinical qualities. In addition to directly improving sleep consolidation, the current results indicate a potential cognitive benefit for patients with MCI that is not verified in ChEi trials, where benefits are more definitively shown for mild to moderate AD. Whether trazodone's beneficial effects are indeed mediated through neuroprotection, however, remains to be clarified. Additionally, trazodone does not have the prevalent side effects of ChEi, such as insomnia, diarrhea, or bradycardia, making it even more favorable for patients who also do not tolerate ChEi.

### The treatment of chronic insomnia: drug indications, chronic use and abuse liability. summary of a 2001 new clinical drug evaluation unit meeting symposium [^114VC2eW]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

This paper summarizes a group of presentations and panel discussions on chronic insomnia at the 2001 NCDEU meeting. The presentations and discussions focused on the twin issues of efficacy and concerns of abuse liability with long-term hypnotic therapy. The panel concluded that insomnia may be an epidemiological marker for a variety of difficulties including accidents, increased health care utilization and subsequent development of major depression. Whether or not treatment of insomnia will prevent these long-term problems has not yet been determined. Since the mid-1980s there has been a rapid rise in the off-label use of antidepressants, particularly trazodone, for treating insomnia. Some participants expressed concern at the lack of data for this practice, particularly the absence of dose-response and tolerance information, and noted that the small amount of efficacy data available is not encouraging. Similarly, there are minimal data to support the use of antihistamines as sleep aids; moreover, their side effect profile and interactions with other drugs may be under appreciated. The limited data available on nightly long-term usage of the newer non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, primarily of six-months' duration, suggest an absence of tolerance, but more data for both nightly and non-nightly administration are needed. Insomniacs tend to show therapy-seeking, rather than drug-seeking behavior, and patients without histories of drug abuse are unlikely to self-escalate dosage of currently available hypnotics. There is fairly good agreement on the characteristics of an ideal hypnotic. All currently available agents, while effective and safe, do not achieve this ideal. The next few years are likely to see the appearance of a variety of agents with new and promising mechanisms of action.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: a potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^114awEU1]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Participant selection

We identified participants from the UCSF Memory and Aging Center cohort who satisfied the following criteria: 1) presence of sleep disturbances (insomnia, hypersomnia, or parasomnia) as documented on the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center assessment form, 2) longitudinal clinical, medication, and neuropsychological data, 3) and diagnostically grouped as AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or cognitively non-impaired (CN) on their first visit (Fig. 1). All participants provided informed consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Presence of insomnia, hypersomnia, or parasomnia was documented by a physician in an ordinal manner as absent, mild (i.e. present and not interfering significantly with daily function), or severe (i.e. interfering significantly with daily function) (Table 1). Since only two participants had severe sleep symptoms, sleep variables were binarized as present or absent at each visit for further analysis. The diagnoses of AD, amnestic MCI, and non-amnestic MCI were made using NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable AD, and the MCI criteria developed by Petersen et al. Molecular AD biomarkers were available for 14 participants (amyloid PET performed in eleven and CSF amyloid- β /tau levels obtained in five; two participants underwent both tests). From the eligible pool of volunteers, we identified 25 participants who reported regular trazodone use for at least two consecutive annual visits. Detailed longitudinal dosage and indication for trazodone use was available for 16 out of 25 trazodone users, all of which listed insomnia as the reason for trazodone use. The median prescribed dosage was 50 mg per day before bedtime (25th percentile 50 mg; 75th percentile 100–125 mg), consistent with insomnia, rather than antidepressant, dosing. Trazodone users were propensity matched to 25 participants who did not use trazodone, according to age, sex, education, diagnostic group, type, and severity of sleep deficit, and baseline MMSE (Fig. 1). These measures were similar between trazodone users and non-users, indicating successful propensity matching (Table 1). Furthermore, the two groups did not differ on longitudinal subjective change in sleep quality (improvement: stability: worsening [trazodone users –10:9:6 versus non-users –11:4:10]; χ² = 2.97, p = 0.23), even though this factor was not included for propensity matching the two groups. We purposely did not include a third comparison group of another hypnotic to evaluate whether observed effects are specific to trazodone or are class dependent, since available studies have shown that agents commonly recommended as hypnotics are not effective in prolonging sleep duration in AD, or have significant carry-over cognitive side effects (e.g. zolpidem). Hypnotics that have no or minimal cognitive side effects the following day and prolong SWS, such as sodium oxybate or orexin receptor antagonists, have not been tested in AD yet and are not used by participants in our cohort. This is a limitation in our study that will be addressed as our cohort includes participants on hypnotics without known cognitive side effects the following day.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The dosage should be initiated at a low level and increased gradually, noting the clinical response and any evidence of intolerance. Occurrence of drowsiness may require the administration of a major portion of the daily dose at bedtime or a reduction of dosage. Trazodone HCl should be taken shortly after a meal or light snack. Symptomatic relief may be seen during the first week with optimal antidepressant effects typically evident within two weeks. Twenty-five percent of those who respond to trazodone HCl require more than two weeks (up to four weeks) of drug administration.

Usual Adult Dosage: An initial dose of 150 mg/day in divided doses is suggested. The dose may be increased by 50 mg/day every three to four days. The maximum dose for outpatients usually should not exceed 400 mg/day in divided doses. Inpatients (i.e., more severely depressed patients) may be given up to but not in excess of 600 mg/day in divided doses.

Maintenance: Dosage during prolonged maintenance therapy should be kept at the lowest effective level. Once an adequate response has been achieved, dosage may be gradually reduced, with subsequent adjustment depending on therapeutic response.

Although there has been no systematic evaluation of the efficacy of trazodone beyond 6 weeks, it is generally recommended that a course of antidepressant drug treatment should be continued for several months.

Chronic insomnia — trazodone evidence: One systematic review (SR) comprising seven trials published between 1994 and 2014 reported no statistically significant differences for sleep efficiency or the rate of discontinuation due to adverse events when comparing trazodone (dose range 50–150 mg/prior to bedtime) to placebo in patients with chronic insomnia (n = 429; mean age 46 years), with no differences in sleep onset latency, total sleep time (TST), or wake after sleep onset (WASO); the SR was limited by a mean treatment length of 1.7 weeks with a follow-up of one to four weeks and concurrent antidepressant or methadone use in several trials. Everitt et al. (2018) conducted an SR that included a randomized controlled trial (RCT) (n = 278) evaluating trazodone for chronic insomnia and found subjective sleep quality improved significantly with trazodone, but there were no differences between trazodone and placebo in morning ratings of sleepiness or disruption at work or in social or family life, sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, and WASO.

Pharmacotherapy considerations for chronic insomnia disorder — before starting short-term pharmacotherapy, review sleep history, reproductive status, and evaluate contraindications for pharmacotherapy; evaluate for other sleep disorders (e.g., apnea, NREM parasomnias), daytime sleepiness, respiratory impairment, cognitive impairment, substance abuse history, and medication interactions, and encourage non-pharmacologic approaches (e.g. CBT-I or BBT-I). When short-term pharmacotherapy is appropriate, consider the following agents and discuss deprescribing plan: low-dose doxepin; or dual orexin receptor antagonists; or non-benzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonists (all patients offered treatment with a non - benzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonist should be specifically counseled regarding the risk of complex sleep-related behaviors) (See Recommendation 9).

Statistical power for aim one

The standard deviation for ISI in large clinical trials in other populations has ranged from 3.8–5.6. Based on these studies, we assume that the standard deviation of the 6-week ISI will be between 4.0 and 6.0 and we conservatively use 6.0 as the basis of sample size estimation. The minimal clinically important difference for this scale is between 6 and 8 for indication of an individually successful response to treatment. We ultimately targeted a group difference of 4.0 as the alternative that we would power our study to detect. Using simulation methods and assuming a correlation of 0.50 for baseline and follow-up measures we determined that 110 participants evaluated at 6 weeks is sufficient to obtain > 90% power to detect a 4.0 difference in ISI scores between the treatment groups combined and the placebo group. In order to have 110 evaluated participants we would need to inflate the enrolled sample size to account for an anticipated 10% loss to follow-up and arrive at our final sample size of n = 126.

Statistical analysis for aim two

The primary outcome for Aim 2 is the ISI measured 25 weeks from randomization. The analysis will leverage the same longitudinal model fit for aim 1, with a parallel primary hypothesis test and confidence interval estimation at 25-weeks as at 7-weeks. Secondary analysis will estimate the full trajectory over time for each treatment group and allow comparison of the group longitudinal profiles. A similar analytic approach will be taken for analyses of data for each of the 9 pre-specified secondary outcomes. Exploratory analyses will be undertaken to determine if there is evidence for effect modification by gender, race/ethnicity, presence of restless legs syndrome, concomitant medications, and treatment adherence.

Statistical power for aim two

We have based our sample size on Aim 1, yet we retain strong power to detect long-term treatment effects. A power analysis using a simple pre-post analysis for 25-week outcomes controlling for baseline is a conservative estimate of the power for the longitudinal model since the simple analysis would only use 25-week complete cases. If we assume 20% loss to follow-up through 24 weeks, then we would have 100 evaluated participants. For Aim 2 we would have 90% power to detect a CBT-I treatment effect of 4.0 points relative to trazodone and placebo and within the range of moderate treatment effects defined by standardized group differences of 3.0–4.8 points.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: a potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^116fHLMe]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Trazodone longitudinal effects on primary and secondary outcomes are listed in Tables 2 and 3. Trazodone non-users declined 2.6-fold faster on the MMSE than trazodone users, at an estimated inter-evaluation interval for both groups averaging 4.12 years (Fig. 2). Trazodone effects on MMSE remained significant even when only participants with AD-predicted pathology were included, with non-users declining 2.4-fold faster than trazodone users across an average of 3.75 years. These effects varied in significance when accounting for co-administered medications, retaining significance when accounting for overall concomitant sedative and stimulant use, with non-users declining 1.94-fold faster than trazodone users. Trazodone effects were not significant when accounting only for ChEi use. This latter finding did not reflect confounding effects from correlated administration of trazodone and ChEi (φ = –0.131; p = 0.355). We further performed additional post-hoc analysis to address a possible non-linear decline in MMSE associated with the longer inter-evaluation interval available for trazodone non-users. Still, trazodone non-users declined 2.0-fold faster on the MMSE than trazodone users, at an estimated inter-evaluation interval averaging 3.59 years, with each group retaining the same annual rate of decline (0.3 versus 0.7 points per year on MMSE for trazodone users versus non-users). These effects of trazodone on MMSE were marginally non-significant (p = 0.054, compare to Table 1). When evaluating, however, for sleep mediating effects of trazodone to longitudinal MMSE performance, significant effects were observed for both presence of sleep problems at the baseline visit (p = 0.006) and changes in sleep from baseline (p = 0.006) (Fig. 3), the latter being driven by improvement in sleep on the follow up visit (p = 0.0006) but not for stable (p = 0.326) or worsening of sleep (p = 0.176) in the follow up visit.

### The effects of trazodone on sleep apnea severity… [^111hqRRZ]. ClinicalTrials (2012). Low credibility.

The Effects of Trazodone on Sleep Apnea SeverityClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Obstructive sleep apnea is characterized by repetitive collapse or 'obstruction' of the pharyngeal airway during sleep. These obstructions result in repetitive hypopneas/apneas and intermittent hypoxia/hypercapnia, as well as surges in sympathetic activity. Such processes disturb normal sleep and impair neurocognitive function, often resulting in excessive daytime sleepiness and decreased quality of life. Furthermore, OSA is associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, making OSA a major health concern. This collapsibility of the upper airway is measured as the critical closing pressure or PCRIT. 2) the ability of the upper airway dilator muscles to activate and reopen the airway during sleep measured as the increase in upper airway electromyography activity above.

In addition to these alternative therapies, the use of pharmacological agents for the treatment of OSA has been gaining widespread interest. Previous data have shown that the non-myorelaxant hypnotic trazodone increases the arousal threshold however its effects on sleep apnea severity remain unclear. Based on studies showing that increasing the arousal threshold with a different hypnotic improves sleep apnea severity, we hypothesize that trazodone will increase the arousal threshold and this will be associated with an improvement in sleep apnea severity. Therefore the overall aim of this study is to examine the effects that trazodone has on OSA severity. STUDY DESIGN: A double-blinded randomized control design will be used. Initially, participants will be randomized to the trazodone or placebo arm where they will have both a clinical polysomnography with the addition of an epiglottic pressure cathether. The purpose of the clinical PSG is to determine the severity of OSA and the epiglottic catheter allows the calculation of the arousal threshold to be completed. During the trazodone arm, participants will be given trazodone to take before bed. During the placebo arm, subjects will be given a placebo to take before bed. Participants will have at least a 1-week washout period before cross over to the next arm of the study whereby the clinical PSG will be repeated. In total each subject will be studied for 2 nights.

### Clinical progress note: interventions for improving outcomes among hospitalized older adults [^113BGUAC]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

DARE TO DREAM — IMPROVING SLEEP

Sleep disruption in the hospital increases delirium, pain intensity, and fall risk. It also impacts glucose control, blood pressure, and respiratory status. Though experts agree that adequate sleep is important for health, numerous studies show that hospitalized persons have highly fragmented, poor‐quality sleep, mainly caused by hospital noise, frequent awakening for cares, uncontrolled pain, and light levels.

Historically, pharmacologic sleep interventions have been standard of care, but a growing body of research shows that commonly used classes such as benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics (e.g. zolpidem), and off‐label use of medications like trazodone are associated with increased falls, fractures, and delirium. Additionally, these medications may not actually be more effective for sleep than a placebo, though melatonin has increasingly been found to be safe and no less effective than other medications. Nonpharmacologic methods are now considered as first‐line therapy. These include eye masks, ear plugs, relaxation techniques, music interventions, and massage, with the most evidence supporting multi‐modal interventions. However, these can be difficult to implement, and patient acceptance is highly variable.

Improving sleep in the hospital may require larger system‐level interventions. Studies support that relatively small changes such as adjusting overnight lighting, shifting medication administration times, reducing overnight vitals checks, and delaying lab draws and morning rounds by only an hour or two can have profound benefits on patients' sleep duration and quality. One nurse‐led, team‐based intervention creating a "no wake zone" for patients significantly reduced delirium and increased cost avoidance. Another large trial that delayed morning lab draws, reduced vitals checks, and encouraged darkness at night improved both LOS and readmission rates. These were cost‐effective and relatively easy interventions without complete overhauls of care infrastructure. Additional data are needed to clarify whether these benefits persist in more medically acute patients and how delays in obtaining data from lab studies and vital signs checks affect provider decision‐making. Still, one can dream that better sleep will improve hospital experiences for many older adults.

### A review of the evidence for the efficacy and safety of trazodone in insomnia [^111PwWuE]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Trazodone, a triazolopyridine antidepressant, is currently the second most commonly prescribed agent for the treatment of insomnia due to its sedating qualities. Given trazodone's widespread use, a careful review of the literature was conducted to assess its efficacy and side effects when given for treatment of insomnia.

In April 2003, a MEDLINE search was conducted using the search terms trazodone and insomnia and trazodone and sleep and restricted to 1980–2003, human subjects, and English language. As trazodone has been implicated in cardiac disorders, a further search was conducted using the term cardiac and trazodone.

Study Selection

All clinical trials that measured any endpoint for insomnia efficacy were included in the assessment. A total of 18 studies were identified from the literature search. In addition, commonly used texts were consulted for information regarding adverse effects related to trazodone.

Data Extraction

Because so few studies were identified by the literature search, all were evaluated and described.

Data Synthesis

Evidence for the efficacy of trazodone in treating insomnia is very limited; most studies are small, conducted in populations of depressed patients, raise issues of design, and often lack objective efficacy measures. Side effects associated with trazodone are not inconsequential, with a high incidence of discontinuation due to side effects, such as sedation, dizziness, and psychomotor impairment, which raise particular concern regarding its use in the elderly. There is also some evidence of tolerance related to use of trazodone.

Conclusion

Given the relative absence of efficacy data in patients with insomnia and the adverse events associated with trazodone's use in general, it is uncertain whether the risk/benefit ratio warrants trazodone's use in nondepressed patients with insomnia.

### Sleep-HD trial: short and long-term effectiveness of existing insomnia therapies for patients undergoing hemodialysis [^1163fRne]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) treated with hemodialysis (HD) experience many distressing symptoms. One frequently reported symptom is insomnia. There are unique issues about HD treatments and schedules that disrupt regular sleep/wake routines and possibly contribute to the high severity of insomnia. Despite evidence for broad-ranging health effects of insomnia, very few clinical trials have tested the efficacy of treatments for HD patients. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is a recommended first-line therapy but largely inaccessible to HD patients in the United States, partly because they commit considerable amounts of time to thrice-weekly dialysis treatments. Another important reason could be the logistical and reimbursement challenges associated with providing behavioral health care at the dialysis center. CBT-I delivered by telehealth can overcome barriers to access, but its efficacy has never been rigorously tested for these patients. Pharmacotherapy is the most widely used treatment for insomnia; however, some drugs presently used are unsafe as they are associated with a higher risk for death for HD patients (benzodiazepines and zolpidem-like drugs). The efficacy and safety of other medications (trazodone) for the treatment of insomnia has never been tested for patients treated with HD.

Methods

This trial tests the short- and long-term comparative effectiveness of 6-week treatment with telehealth CBT-I, trazodone, or medication placebo. This will be accomplished with a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which 126 participants treated with HD in community-based dialysis facilities with chronic insomnia will be assigned 1:1:1 to telehealth CBT-I, trazodone, or medication placebo, respectively; short-term effectiveness of each treatment arm will be determined at the end of 6-weeks of treatment and long-term effectiveness at 25-weeks. The primary and secondary patient-reported outcomes will be assessed with computer-based telephone interviewing by research scientists blinded to treatment assignment; additional secondary outcomes will be assessed by participant interview and actigraphy.

Discussion

This clinical RCT will provide the first evidence for the comparative effectiveness of two distinct approaches for treating chronic insomnia and other patient-reported outcomes for patients receiving maintenance HD.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: a potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^116omjgd]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Effects of trazodone in all secondary outcomes were non-significant after correction for multiple comparisons but reveal a trend of delayed cognitive decline for almost all measures. We specifically tested trazodone effects on short-term memory and executive tests, considering known involvement of hippocampal and prefrontal areas in sleep-mediated effects via SWS enhancement on these cognitive domains. Even though the results were not significant, the observed trend is promising in pursuing tailored studies that are powered to identify a potential beneficial effect in the specific cognitive domains. It is worth keeping in mind that cognitive benefits via SWS enhancement may vary depending on a patient's specific syndrome (e.g. late age-of-onset AD, early age-of-onset AD, logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia, posterior cortical atrophy). Additionally, they may be dependent on a person's age, with younger patients potentially benefitting most in executive function versus older ones in short-term memory. In our cohort of predominantly older amnestic patients, a trend was observed in both executive and short-term memory tasks.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^113CCsFk]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

AASM clinical practice guideline — pharmacologic treatments for chronic insomnia in adults frames the clinical question using a PICO approach in adult patients diagnosed with primary chronic insomnia, comparing pharmacologic interventions to placebo control with outcomes sleep latency (SL), total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO), quality of sleep (QOS), sleep efficiency (SE), and number of awakenings (NOA). Interventions considered include Diphenhydramine, Doxepin, Eszopiclone, Melatonin, Ramelteon, Suvorexant, Temazepam, Tiagabine, Trazodone, Triazolam, Tryptophan, Valerian + hops, Zaleplon, and Zolpidem, and the PICO question is stated as, "In adult patients diagnosed with primary chronic insomnia, how does [intervention] improve [outcomes], compared to placebo?". Footnotes clarify approval status: "✱ = FDA-approved, indicated for the treatment of insomnia. ✱✱ = FDA-approved, off-label usage for the treatment of insomnia. † = Over-the-counter medication".

### Effects of trazodone versus cognitive behavioral therapy in the insomnia with short sleep duration phenotype: a preliminary study [^116mp9jS]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

The insomnia with objective short sleep duration phenotype is associated with increased risk for adverse health outcomes, physiological hyperarousal, and a blunted response to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). Whether insomnia with objective short sleep duration responds better to pharmacological treatment compared to CBT-I has not been examined.

Methods

Participants included 15 patients with chronic insomnia (86.7% female), aged 45.3 ± 8.1 years. Eight patients were randomized to CBT-I and 7 to trazodone. Patients were examined with 2 weeks of actigraphy, salivary cortisol, and the insomnia severity index at 3 time points (pretreatment, 3-month posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up). Mixed between-within-subjects analysis of variance and univariate analysis of covariance were conducted to assess the impact of trazodone and CBT-I on patients' total sleep time, salivary cortisol, and insomnia severity index scores across the 3 time points.

Results

Trazodone, but not CBT-I, significantly lengthened total sleep time (when measured with actigraphy) both at posttreatment (51.01 minutes vs -11.73 minutes; p = 0.051; Cohen's d = 1.383) and at follow-up (50.35 minutes vs -7.56 minutes; p = 0.012; Cohen's d = 1.725), respectively. In addition, trazodone, but not CBT-I, showed a clinically meaningful decrease in salivary cortisol from pretreatment to posttreatment (-36.07% vs -11.70%; Cohen's d = 0.793) and from pretreatment to follow-up (-21.37% vs -5.79%; Cohen's d = 0.284), respectively. Finally, there were no differences on insomnia severity index scores between the trazodone and the CBT-I groups.

Conclusions

The current preliminary, open-label, randomized trial suggests that trazodone, but not CBT-I, significantly improves objective sleep duration and reduces hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation, suggesting a differential treatment response in the insomnia with objective short sleep duration phenotype.

### Treatment of Alzheimer's disease: trazodone, sleep, serotonin, norepinephrine, and future directions [^1158bvzW]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

In this issue, an article by La et al. provides evidence that trazodone delayed cognitive decline in 25 participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment, or normal cognition. For participants considered to have AD pathology, trazodone non-users declined at a rate 2.4 times greater than those taking trazodone for sleep over a 4-year period. In the analysis of sleep complaints, the relationship between trazodone, a widely used medication for sleep problems in the elderly, and cognition was associated with subjective improvement of sleep disruption. Due to the design of the study, it was not possible to prove that the benefit of slowing cognitive decline was due specifically to the improvement in sleep. However, trazodone uniquely improves the deeper phases of slow-wave sleep. Other sedative medications are generally associated with worse cognitive function over time, and they do not improve sleep characteristics as does trazodone. Trazodone has a variety of effects on several monoaminergic mechanisms: a potent serotonin 5-HT2A and α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, a weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor, and a weak antihistamine or histamine H1 receptor inverse agonist. Because of the potential importance of this finding, further discussion is provided on the roles that trazodone may play in the modulation of monoamines, cognition, and the development of AD. If trazodone really does provide such a dramatic slowing in the development of dementia associated with AD, a great deal more research on trazodone is needed, including environmental and behavioral factors related to improvement of sleep, energy management, and neuroplasticity.

### Treatment of REM sleep behavior disorder with trazodone: report of 3 cases [^113wWiqK]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is a sleep disturbance characterized by the absence of regular paralysis during rapid eye movement sleep, accompanied by dream enactment behavior. The available pharmacotherapy options for treating rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are limited, and the utilization of antidepressants has yielded mixed results. We report 3 cases of isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder improved with trazodone. Doses of 50–100mg of trazodone at bedtime over 4–6 months resulted in significant clinical improvement. These cases highlight that trazodone could serve as a treatment for isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder that does not respond to traditional treatments at submaximal dosages.

### Falls, healthcare resources and costs in older adults with insomnia treated with zolpidem, trazodone, or benzodiazepines [^114FfDpd]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Falls are the leading cause of injury-related deaths among older adults (ie, age ≥ 65 years) and incur a substantial economic burden due to costs associated with subsequent fractures, hospital visits, and long-term care. In particular, medication-related falls or fractures are recognized as an important consideration for clinicians when initiating new pharmacotherapy in older adult patients. Clinical experts have published guidelines, such as the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Beers Criteria, to help inform treatment decisions. However, details on guideline use when treating certain conditions are scant.

Insomnia, a common sleep–wake disorder characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep or both, is more prevalent among older adults and older adults are more likely to be prescribed medication for insomnia treatment. Medication classes commonly used to treat insomnia – including benzodiazepines and z-drugs (i.e. non-benzodiazepine sedative hypnotics such as zolpidem) – can have adverse effects that may pose elevated risk for older adults. Benzodiazepine adverse effects include cognitive and memory impairment, rebound insomnia upon cessation, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents (MVAs), falls, dependence, and addiction. Z-drugs are associated with next day cognitive, memory, psychomotor, and balance impairments and risk of dependence and addiction. Thus, these medications may be inappropriate for use in older adults, particularly those with a history of falls or fractures, due to unfavorable risk–benefit ratios. Clinicians often prescribe off-label the heterocyclic trazodone for insomnia management. Trazodone may be perceived as a safer alternative in older adults due to the lack of anti-cholinergic activity and cardiotoxicity, although limited published data are available to support efficacy or safety in this population. The most common adverse effects associated with trazodone use include daytime sleepiness and orthostatic hypotension, which may pose a risk of falls in an older population, particularly upon awakening from sleep. National data suggests that zolpidem and low-dose trazodone are the most frequently prescribed medications used for insomnia management in the US, followed by benzodiazepines; use of low-dose trazodone for insomnia has increased in recent years while zolpidem use has decreased.

Regarding medical management for concussion, more specifically with respect to management of sleep-wake disturbances, LCG 2017 guidelines recommend to consider offering medications such as low-dose trazodone and TCAs (amitryptyline, doxepine), and mirtazapine to establish a more routine sleep-wake pattern. Consider offering prazosin in patients with nightmares and PTSD, modafinil and armodafinil in patients with excessive daytime sleepiness, and nonbenzodiazepine medications (zopiclone, exzopiclone) for short-term use. Avoid using benzodiazepines.

### Falls, healthcare resources and costs in older adults with insomnia treated with zolpidem, trazodone, or benzodiazepines [^114zMxGv]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

In summary, this national analysis of 100% Medicare claims examined outcomes for older adult patients treated with commonly prescribed medications for insomnia (ie, benzodiazepines, trazodone, zolpidem IR, zolpidem ER). Compared with non-sleep disordered controls, treated adult patients demonstrated significantly increased risk of falls, all-cause mortality, and adverse economic outcomes. Although prescribers may perceive trazodone as a lower-risk alternative for treatment of insomnia, this study's findings suggest that trazodone, like benzodiazepines and zolpidem, was associated with higher risk of falls and higher healthcare resource utilization compared to controls. Further, risk varied by insomnia medication, with benzodiazepines and trazodone typically being associated with the worst outcomes. Note, however, that this was an observational study rather than a randomized controlled trial so the results of this study are associative rather than causal. Future research should seek to identify patients at greatest risk of adverse outcomes from commonly prescribed insomnia treatments and to match these individuals with safe, effective alternatives. Most important, these results highlight the need for insomnia treatments which are suitable for use in older adults with insomnia and are not associated with an increased risk of falls.

### Effectiveness of existing insomnia therapies for patients undergoing hemodialysis: a randomized clinical trial [^116VLkhq]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The study Sleep-HD (trazodone) was published by Rajnish Mehrotra and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Ann Intern Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Insomnia and Chronic kidney disease. In the Sleep-HD (trazodone) study, the trial question was: what is role of trazodone in patients undergoing hemodialysis with mild or moderate chronic insomnia? In the Sleep-HD (trazodone) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the Sleep-HD (trazodone) study, the population was: 83 patients (41 female, 42 male). The inclusion criteria were patients undergoing hemodialysis with Insomnia Severity Index score ≥ 10, with sleep disturbances on ≥ 3 nights/week for ≥ 3 months. The key exclusion criteria were severe cognitive impairment; severe depressive symptoms; suicidal ideation; alcohol or substance misuse; severe restless legs syndrome; pregnancy/lactation; anticipated life expectancy < 3 months. In the Sleep-HD (trazodone) study, the interventions were: n = 42 trazodone (at a starting dose of 50 mg nightly, titrated to 100 mg, for 6 weeks) n = 41 placebo (matching placebo for 6 weeks). In the Sleep-HD (trazodone) study, the primary outcome was: borderline significant increase in reduction in Insomnia Severity Index score at week 7 (4.2 points vs. 3.1 points; AD 1.08 points, 95% CI -1.34 to 3.49). In the Sleep-HD (trazodone) study, the secondary outcomes were: borderline significant decrease in reduction in Insomnia Severity Index score at week 25 (4 points vs. 4.3 points; AD -0.34 points, 95% CI -3.17 to 2.49) No significant difference in reduction in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at week 7 (0.9 vs. -0.4; AD 1.3, 95% CI -0.15 to 2.74) No significant difference in reduction in Epworth Sleepiness Scale at week 7 (0.3 points vs. 1.3 points; AD -0.96 points, 96% CI -2.68 to 0.75). In the Sleep-HD (trazodone) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in non-serious adverse events. In the Sleep-HD (trazodone) study, the conclusion was: in patients undergoing hemodialysis with Insomnia Severity Index score ≥ 10, with sleep disturbances on ≥ 3 nights/week for ≥ 3 months, trazodone was not superior to placebo with respect to reduction in Insomnia Severity Index score at week 7.

### Effect of psychological and medication therapies for insomnia on daytime functions: a randomized clinical trial [^1142cZZh]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Daytime functional impairments are the primary reasons for patients with insomnia to seek treatment, yet little is known about what the optimal treatment is for improving daytime functions and how best to proceed with treatment for patients whose insomnia has not remitted.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy of behavioral therapy (BT) and zolpidem as initial therapies for improving daytime functions among patients with insomnia and evaluate the added value of a second treatment for patients whose insomnia has not remitted.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this sequential multiple-assignment randomized clinical trial conducted at institutions in Canada and the US, 211 adults with chronic insomnia disorder were enrolled between May 1, 2012, and December 31, 2015, and followed up for 12 months. Statistical analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis in April and October 2023.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned to either BT or zolpidem as first-stage therapy, and those whose insomnia had not remitted received a second-stage psychological therapy (BT or cognitive therapy) or medication therapy (zolpidem or trazodone).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Study outcomes were daytime symptoms of insomnia, including mood disturbances, fatigue, functional impairments of insomnia, and scores on the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) physical and mental health components.

Results

Among 211 adults with insomnia (132 women [63%]; mean [SD] age, 45.6 [14.9] years), 104 were allocated to BT and 107 to zolpidem at the first stage. First-stage treatment with BT or zolpidem yielded significant and equivalent benefits for most of the daytime outcomes, including depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-II mean score change, -3.5 [95% CI, -4.7 to -2.3] vs -4.3 [95% CI, -5.7 to -2.9]), fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory mean score change, -4.7 [95% CI, -7.3 to -2.2] vs -5.2 [95% CI, -7.9 to -2.5]), functional impairments (Work and Social Adjustment Scale mean score change, -5.0 [95% CI, -6.7 to -3.3] vs -5.1 [95% CI, -7.2 to -2.9]), and mental health (SF-36 mental health subscale mean score change, 3.5 [95% CI, 1.9–5.1] vs 2.5 [95% CI, 0.4–4.5]), while BT produced larger improvements for anxiety symptoms relative to zolpidem (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory mean score change, -4.1 [95% CI, -5.8 to -2.4] vs -1.2 [95% CI, -3.0 to 0.5]; p = 0.02; Cohen d = 0.55). Second-stage therapy produced additional improvements for the 2 conditions starting with zolpidem at posttreatment in fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory mean score change: zolpidem plus BT, -3.8 [95% CI, -7.1 to -0.4]; zolpidem plus trazodone, -3.7 [95% CI, -6.3 to -1.1]), functional impairments (Work and Social Adjustment Scale mean score change: zolpidem plus BT, -3.7 [95% CI, -6.4 to -1.0]; zolpidem plus trazodone, -3.3 [95% CI, -5.9 to -0.7]) and mental health (SF-36 mental health subscale mean score change: zolpidem plus BT, 5.3 [95% CI, 2.7–7.9]; zolpidem plus trazodone, 2.0 [95% CI, 0.1–4.0]). Treatment benefits achieved at posttreatment were well maintained throughout the 12-month follow-up, and additional improvements were noted for patients receiving the BT treatment sequences.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial of adults with insomnia disorder, BT and zolpidem produced improvements for various daytime symptoms of insomnia that were no different between treatments. Adding a second treatment offered an added value with further improvements of daytime functions.

### Treatment of insomnia in hospitalized patients [^114p8N8K]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide recommendations for the short-term management of insomnia in hospitalized patients and review patient assessment, nonpharmacologic treatment modalities, and selection of hypnotic medications.

Data Sources

Review articles and primary literature representative of current knowledge regarding the treatment of insomnia were identified by MEDLINE search (1966-January 2001). Search terms included insomnia (sleep initiation and maintenance disorders), benzodiazepines, zaleplon, zolpidem, and trazodone.

Data Synthesis

Literature regarding the management of insomnia in hospitalized patients is limited; therefore, data pertinent to the treatment of ambulatory patients must be extrapolated to the inpatient setting. When evaluating insomnia in hospitalized patients, it seems reasonable to obtain a thorough history and physical examination to identify potential underlying etiologies. Treatment of these underlying etiologies should be considered. When the use of a sedative-hypnotic agent is necessary, medication and dose selection should be based on the pharmacokinetic and adverse effect profiles of each agent. Patent-specific characteristics should also be considered to provide effective treatment while minimizing adverse effects.

Conclusions

Nonpharmacologic approaches to the treatment of insomnia should be considered for hospitalized patients. When sedative-hypnotic medications must be administered, the pharmacokinetic profile of intermediate-acting benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam, temazepam) makes them good first-line agents. Zaleplon and zolpidem are also attractive hypnotic agents; however, they are typically reserved for second-line therapy due to cost. Trazodone may be an alternative for patients unable to take benzodiazepines.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Trazodone hydrochloride tablets are indicated for the treatment of depression. The efficacy of trazodone HCl has been demonstrated in both inpatient and outpatient settings and for depressed patients with and without prominent anxiety. The depressive illness of patients studied corresponds to the Major Depressive Episode criteria of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, lll.a

Major Depressive Episode implies a prominent and relatively persistent (nearly every day for at least two weeks) depressed or dysphoric mood that usually interferes with daily functioning, and includes at least four of the following eight symptoms: change in appetite, change in sleep, psychomotor agitation or retardation, loss of interest in usual activities or decrease in sexual drive, increased fatigability, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, and suicidal ideation or attempts.

Sedative-hypnotics and related agents — adverse effects in older adults and dementia: General adversities attributed to sedative-hypnotics include increased risks for falls, headaches, nausea, medication-medication interactions, and drug dependence, with elderly patients at specific high risk. Benzodiazepines are associated with increased confusion, impaired motor performance, anterograde amnesia, daytime sleepiness, and physiologic dependence. Over-the-counter antihistamines have very high rates of side effects, including cognitive impairment, daytime somnolence, and anticholinergic responses. Trazodone is widely used off-label as a hypnotic despite virtually no evidence-based data supporting efficacy with older adults and carries significant risks including priapism, orthostatic hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmias. Off-label neuroleptic use for dementia-related disturbances has a black box warning for increased mortality risks approximately twofold higher than with placebo-treated patients, mostly due to cardiovascular or infectious causes.

### Accuracy and efficacy of trazodone (desyrel) on sleep quality and… [^112EBKjz]. ClinicalTrials (2018). Low credibility.

Study Overview The objective is to evaluate the accuracy and efficacity of 1 dose of trazodone in TMD patient. Subject will have 3 polysomnography over 3 weeks. The first one being the baseline. Half of the patient will receive trazodone on their 2nd PSG and placebo on their 3rd PSG, and the other half will receive placebo bedofe their 2nd PSG and trazodone for the 3rd PSG. Pain quality and sleep quality will be assessed before and after PSG. polysomnograms from baseline, placebo night and trazodone night will also be compared. In TMD subjects, clonazepam, cyclobenzaprine, benzodiazepines, and tricyclic antidepressant have been studied with mixed-results in the improvement of sleep quality and pain.

Evidence suggests that the antidepressant trazodone, a medication that is frequently prescribed off-label to manage insomnia, can help to attenuate the impact of sleep arousal in rising its thresholds in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. In normal subjects, Trazodone increases total sleep time and non-REM sleep duration without major side effects. Despite being an antidepressant, this medication is commonly prescribed to treat chronic and acute insomnia, anxiety disorders, and it has also been used to treat pain chronic conditions such as fibromyalgia. One of the most common side effects of trazodone, which perhaps can explain the advantage-effect of trazodone on sleep quality, is sedation. Other reported side effects are gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and less commonly dry mouth, dizziness, blurred vision, headache, or change in weight.

Primary Hypothesis: Trazodone will contribute to reduce the sleep instability associated to poor sleep in TMD subjects. Secondary Hypotheses: Trazodone will contribute to improve subjective sleep quality and to decrease pain ratings in TMD subjects. Method: Subjects: 16 patients with chronic TMD, aged 18 to 45 years, and reporting poor sleep quality will be recruited at the Université de Montréal dental clinic, at the CHUM stomatology department, and based on referrals from physicians and dentists in the community.

### Treatment of Alzheimer's disease: trazodone, sleep, serotonin, norepinephrine, and future directions [^111sLA1o]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

TRAZODONE HISTORY

Trazodone, a triazolopyridine derivative and a phenylpiperazine, was developed in Italy in the 1960s by Angelini Research Laboratories. Trazodone was approved for medical use in December 1981 in the US by the FDA as an anti-depressant medication, Desyrel. However, trazodone is a less effective anti-depressant than many other agents. Further, the drug had already had extensive use outside of the US, so there was a relatively short patent-life, and the drug became generic in 1986. Thus, there was a lack of pharmaceutical industry support for extensive research on this drug.

In spite of the commercial difficulties for trazodone, clinical experiences soon showed that this drug has several beneficial effects. Trazodone is unique in its effects on sleep, increasing the deeper stages of SWS early in the sleep cycle and delaying REM onset. There are an extensive number of studies that have supported the use of trazodone for insomnia. Trazodone is one of the top two drugs used for off-label prescribing, usually for insomnia. Trazodone is also beneficial and widely-used for anxiety, and it is arguably the most effective drug for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), likely because of its effects on sleep. Trazodone was tested for a potential benefit for agitation in AD, but the complex, multi-center study design did not show a statistically significant benefit for trazodone relative to other interventions, in spite of its reported usefulness in the management of agitation in dementia and PTSD. In 2015, 27.6 million prescriptions for trazodone were filled in the US, twice the number of 2007 (– accessed 11/11/2018). So, a finding that trazodone has a benefit for slowing AD progression is of considerable interest.

Regarding specific circumstances for insomnia, more specifically with respect to patients with mild traumatic brain injury, management, LCG 2017 guidelines recommend to consider offering medications such as low-dose trazodone and TCAs (amitryptyline, doxepine), and mirtazapine to establish a more routine sleep-wake pattern. Consider offering prazosin in patients with nightmares and PTSD, modafinil and armodafinil in patients with excessive daytime sleepiness, and nonbenzodiazepine medications (zopiclone, exzopiclone) for short-term use. Avoid using benzodiazepines.

### Effect of viloxazine and trazodone in obstructive sleep apnoea: a randomised, placebo-controlled, cross-over study [^114PYvAJ]. Thorax (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Combination of the noradrenergic atomoxetine with either the antimuscarinic aroxybutynin or trazodone has been shown to improve obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) severity. However, atomoxetine may contribute to apnoea-cycling and reduced drug tolerability due to wake-promoting, especially in a subgroup (poor cytochrome 2D6 metabolisers leading to higher blood concentration of medication). We investigated the effect of a potentially more manageable noradrenergic, viloxazine, with and without trazodone, on OSA severity.

Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 24 patients with OSA (18–75 years) were analysed and randomised to 500 mg viloxazine, 500/75 mg viloxazine-trazodone (vilo-trazo) or placebo; taken before bed for 2 weeks with 1-week washout between treatments. In-laboratory polysomnography was performed at the end of each cross-over period. Mixed-model analyses compared the effect of vilo-trazo versus placebo on AHI 4 (apnoea-hypopnoea index with 4% desaturations; primary outcome) and hypoxic burden (secondary outcome). Additional outcomes examined the effects of vilo-trazo versus viloxazine on total sleep time (TST) and wake-after-sleep-onset (WASO). Safety endpoints (patient-reported outcomes, heart rate and adverse events) were also assessed.

Results

Vilo-trazo reduced AHI 4 (mean difference (95% CI): 10.5 (6.6, 13.6) events/hour, p < 0.001) and hypoxic burden (16.7 (9.6, 21.8) %min/hr, p < 0.001) versus placebo. Compared with viloxazine, TST tended to be longer on vilo-trazo (22.3 (-1.4, 46.0) min, p < 0.065), while WASO was unchanged. TST and WASO remained significantly reduced on vilo-trazo versus placebo. Both interventions worsened patient-reported outcomes, although to a lesser extent on vilo-trazo, and increased heart rate versus placebo. Commonly reported adverse events were insomnia, constipation, headache and xerostomia.

Conclusions

Viloxazine-trazodone reduced OSA severity. Potential deleterious effects of viloxazine on sleep quality appeared partly attenuated by trazodone.

Trazodone 50 mg — primary insomnia efficacy and harms: A single study of trazodone 50 mg met inclusion criteria with no meta-analysis available and the overall quality of evidence was moderate due to potential publication bias; patient-reported outcomes showed a modest reduction in sleep latency below the clinical significance threshold, while increases in total sleep time and reductions in wake after sleep onset did not reach clinical thresholds, quality of sleep was not significantly improved, and reductions in number of awakenings fell just below clinical significance, so none of the sleep outcome variables improved to a clinically significant degree. There was no meta-analysis of harms; in the Walsh study the trazodone group experienced significantly more side effects than placebo, with headache 30% versus 19% and somnolence 23% versus 8%, and overall adverse events in 75% of trazodone subjects compared to 65.4% with placebo. Given the absence of demonstrated efficacy on numerous critical outcomes and limited harms data, the task force judged the harms to potentially outweigh the benefits, yet determined that the majority of patients would be likely to use trazodone compared to no treatment.

### Treatment of Alzheimer's disease: trazodone, sleep, serotonin, norepinephrine, and future directions [^115Wn3mx]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

In this issue, an article by La et al. provides evidence that trazodone delayed cognitive decline in 25 participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment, or normal cognition. For participants considered to have AD pathology, trazodone non-users declined at a rate 2.4 times greater than those taking trazodone for sleep over a 4-year period. In the analysis of sleep complaints, the relationship between trazodone, a widely used medication for sleep problems in the elderly, and cognition was associated with subjective improvement of sleep disruption. Due to the design of the study, it was not possible to prove that the benefit of slowing cognitive decline was due specifically to the improvement in sleep. However, trazodone uniquely improves the deeper phases of slow-wave sleep. Other sedative medications are generally associated with worse cognitive function over time, and they do not improve sleep characteristics as does trazodone. Trazodone has a variety of effects on several monoaminergic mechanisms: a potent serotonin 5-HT2A and α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, a weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor, and a weak antihistamine or histamine H1 receptor inverse agonist. Because of the potential importance of this finding, further discussion is provided on the roles that trazodone may play in the modulation of monoamines, cognition, and the development of AD. If trazodone really does provide such a dramatic slowing in the development of dementia associated with AD, a great deal more research on trazodone is needed, including environmental and behavioral factors related to improvement of sleep, energy management, and neuroplasticity.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: a potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^1155Sgec]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Another limitation pertains to whether the observed trazodone effects are primarily mediated through SWS enhancement. In this study, quantified data of SWS were not available for correlating to rate of cognitive decline. Additionally, it is possible that trazodone effects could be mediated through its antidepressant benefits. We do not believe the latter is the case, since trazodone is rarely, if ever, given as an antidepressant in our cohort. Moreover, antidepressant doses of trazodone are usually much higher than doses for insomnia that were prescribed for our participants, and often relate to carry-over cognitive deficits the following day, albeit less severe than those observed with certain other antidepressants. Nonetheless, a prospective study would be the optimal approach in controlling potential antidepressant-mediated cognitive benefits of trazodone. An alternative possibility of the observed trazodone benefits could be explained by its possible neuroprotective effects via inhibition of the phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2 α signaling pathway of the unfolded protein response (eIF2 α -P/UPR). Specifically, in the MAPT P301L mouse model of tauopathy, trazodone use was associated with less memory deficits, preserved hippocampal neuronal counts, delayed gross brain atrophy, and prolonged survival. Interestingly, the eIF2 α -P/UPR pathway is also induced during sleep deprivation of wild type mice, providing an additional mechanistic explanation through which improving disturbances in sleep may be neuroprotective. This latter inference, that potentially beneficial trazodone effects on cognition may be mediated by reducing sleep disturbance, is supported by the results from our post-hoc exploratory analyses indicating delayed cognitive decline in trazodone users with baseline sleep problems and, even more, in trazodone users who improved their sleep on follow-up evaluation (Fig. 3). A fine distinction should be highlighted on the above observation in that, although trazodone effects on cognition were mediated by improvement in sleep, which in turn raises the possibility that cognitive benefits may relate to improved sleep alone irrespective to trazodone use, the post-hoc analysis also indicates that participants who longitudinally improved their sleep while on trazodone had proportionally less cognitive decline compared to participants who improved their sleep but were not on trazodone (Fig. 3 c). Given that the current retrospective study and group matching were not structured to answer mechanisms of trazodone benefits, nor answer whether longitudinally improving sleep in general delays cognitive decline, the above post-hoc observations should be interpreted with caution until prospective intervention studies are completed. Nonetheless, speculating on the current findings, it is possible that the improvement in sleep symptoms could serve as a proxy for trazodone effects in general. One such effect to consider is the well-established SWS enhancement achieved through trazodone, which in turn shows promise towards neuroprotection. If this finding replicates in future prospective studies, then the entire class of medications decreasing the degree of sleep disturbance, and especially those promoting SWS, can be considered in the prevention of cognitive decline. Such beneficial effects may be achieved mechanistically via modulation of both amyloid- β and tau pathologic burden, as well as optimization of sleep-mediated synaptic potentiation.

### Sleep-HD trial: short and long-term effectiveness of existing insomnia therapies for patients undergoing hemodialysis [^113YSmh5]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Drug therapy

The site investigators will prescribe trazodone (50–100 mg) or corresponding medication placebo to the study participants randomized to the respective arms. The dose range selected for the trial (50–100 mg) is guided by prior studies with trazodone. The starting dose for trazodone will be 50 mg, and if after the end of the first or second week of treatment the participants report inadequate improvement in sleep, they will have the option to increase the dose to 100 mg. The dose achieved by the end of week 3 will be maintained for the remaining 3 weeks.

Drug procurement and dispensation

Prior to launching the clinical trial, the Investigational Drug Services at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, where the PI is based, will procure 50-mg tablets of trazodone from the same manufacturing stock for both clinical sites and prepare a matching placebo. The medications will be dispensed as per the protocol by the Investigational Drug Services at each site, and the study coordinators will hand the study drug to the participants at the dialysis facility when they arrive for their routine HD treatments; this will occur once during week 1 where a 3-week supply of the drug will be provided (with capacity to increase the dose to 100 mg starting week 2), and at week 4 where a 3-week supply of the drug for the dose being taken during weeks 4, 5 and 6.

Monitoring drug adherence

The participants will be asked to return the medication bottles for study drug at week 4 and week 7, and the coordinators will perform a pill count to assess adherence with the medication. All unused drugs will be destroyed by the Investigational Drug Supply.

### A randomized-controlled trial targeting cognition in early Alzheimer's disease by improving sleep with trazodone (REST) [^111ocety]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity among aging populations worldwide. Despite arduous research efforts, treatment options for this devastating neurodegenerative disease are limited. Sleep disturbances, through their link to changes in neural excitability and impaired clearance of interstitial abnormal protein aggregates, are a key risk factor for the development of AD. Research also suggests that the neuroprotective effects of sleep are particularly active during slow wave sleep. Given the strong link between sleep disturbance and AD, targeting sleep in the prodromal stages of AD, such as in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), represents a promising avenue for slowing the onset of AD-related cognitive decline. In efforts to improve sleep in older individuals, several pharmacologic approaches have been employed, but many pose safety risks, concern for worsening cognitive function, and fail to effectively target slow wave sleep. Trazodone, a safe and widely used drug in the older adult population, has shown promise in inducing slow wave sleep in older adults, but requires more rigorous research to understand its effects on sleep and cognition in the prodromal stages of AD. In this review, we present the rationale and study design for our randomized, double-bind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial (NCT05282550) investigating the effects of trazodone on sleep and cognition in 100 older adults with amnestic MCI and sleep complaints.

### Effects of antidepressants on sleep [^1124aBXW]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment of Insomnia Disorder with Low-Dose Antidepressants

Insomnia belongs to the most frequent disorders of the brain. In industrialized countries, approximately 6% of the adults suffer from insomnia as a disorder and as many as 50% may suffer from transient insomnia symptoms. Although insomnia is not regarded as a severe mental disorder, it shares many features with depression. In order to offer a patient an effective treatment of insomnia, there is a need for a broader perspective, one that reaches far beyond the prescription of hypnotics. Current treatment guidelines strongly recommend the use of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT-I) as the initial treatment for chronic insomnia disorder and only short-term use of the sleep-promoting drugs in patients with insufficient response to CBI-I. However, in daily clinical practice, the use of pharmacotherapy for insomnia is very common. The most frequently used drugs to treat insomnia aside from benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine (eszopiclone/zopiclone, zaleplon, zolpidem) hypnotics are sedative antidepressants. However, due to the lack of methodologically sound randomized clinical trials in insomnia, only one of them, doxepin, is approved by FDA for the treatment of sleep maintenance insomnia. Furthermore, recent recommendations discourage the use of other drugs from this class than doxepin for the insomnia treatment. In our opinion, sedative antidepressants are a valuable treatment option of insomnia in a situation in which despite being in CBT-I therapy, the patient still requires sleep-promoting drugs more than 3–4 times per week. The use of sedative antidepressants should be also considered when there is a comorbid mood or anxiety disorder because such patients are at increased risk of developing hypnotic dependency. Moreover, in many insomnia patients, physiological parameters, e.g. hormone secretion, whole body, and brain metabolic rate, are altered in a similar fashion to the depressed ones what is called a hyperarousal, supporting the use of sedative antidepressants to treat such patients. The pros and cons of using sedative antidepressants in insomnia patients were discussed extensively in the earlier papers. This is especially true for trazodone that is very often used as a sleep-promoting drug. Frequently expressed concern with the usage of sedative antidepressants in insomnia is that their side effect profile and interactions with other drugs may be underrated. Indeed, although there is evidence for efficacy of sedative antidepressants to promote sleep, for example for TCA in a form of a recent meta-analytic study, it is important to remember that these drugs should be used in insomnia patients only in a very low dose, e.g. for doxepin as low as 3 to 6 mg or 25–50 mg for trazodone. Many psychiatrists are astonished that a sedative antidepressant can promote sleep in such a low dose. Firstly, it should be noted that such low doses are appropriate only for patients with primary insomnia. In the presence of a comorbid mood disorder, the antidepressants have to be used in a recommended therapeutic dose. Secondly, such treatment should be used only when combined with behavioral interventions from CBT-I protocol. When a patient restricts time in bed and uses stimulus control technique, even low-dosage pharmacological treatment starts to work. Thirdly, to be effective in treating sleep-onset insomnia, sedative antidepressants have to be taken much earlier than hypnotics in regard to their pharmacokinetics, especially the time they take to reach the maximum serum concentration (Cmax). It usually means at least 2 hours before sleep (in the case of more rapid drug action the patient should be encouraged to shorten this time). In our opinion, sedative antidepressants are a safe class of drugs when given in low doses. We use them in many patient groups where hypnotics are contraindicated, e.g. in the elderly patients, in patients with sleep apnea and in patients with a history of alcohol and substance abuse. Despite the fact that the use of atypical antipsychotics, mostly quetiapine, is increasing for treatment of insomnia accompanying bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, we hold the conviction that sedative antidepressants are a valuable treatment option for such patients as well. Based on our clinical experience and review of published case reports, we believe that the use of sedative antidepressants in a low dose is not related to the increased risk of phase shift in bipolar disorder. Moreover, we have observed that for the treatment of insomnia low doses (5–10 mg) of citalopram administered in the morning can be an alternative to sedative antidepressants with good treatment effects.

Statistical analyses

Comparisons on primary and secondary outcomes between the two groups followed repeated-measures analysis of variance while accounting for inter-evaluation intervals, i.e. the length of time between baseline and final visits. Cognitive and functional assessment scores were treated as dependent variables, and trazodone use as a fixed factor. Significance level was set at 0.05, and one-tailed significance testing was performed given the a priori hypothesis that trazodone is associated with delayed cognitive decline. Significance testing on secondary outcomes and post-hoc analyses accounted for multiple comparisons by applying Bonferroni correction.

Additional analyses tested trazodone effects on MMSE only in participants who had AD-predicted pathology based on clinical judgment, and while accounting for concomitant sedative and stimulant medication effects. A sedative medication binary variable represented use of the following: benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, narcotics, atypical antipsychotics, antihistamines, or anticholinergic medications. A stimulant medication binary variable represented use of the following: cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEi), dopaminergic, noradrenergic, or serotoninergic antidepressant medications. A final group comparison of trazodone effects on MMSE accounted specifically for the concomitant use of ChEi, because they represent the main medication class with an established cognitive benefit in AD. Six participants in each group used ChEi. Furthermore, to test whether trazodone use was correlated with ChEi use, a possible confounder for observed trazodone effects, we calculated the mean square contingency coefficient (φ). Finally, to assess whether the observed trazodone effects were mediated through improvement of sleep, we performed post-hoc exploratory repeated measures analysis of variance while accounting, first, for presence or absence of sleep problems (insomnia or hypersomnia) at the baseline visit and, second, for longitudinal changes in sleep complaints between baseline and follow-up evaluations accounting for multiple comparisons. Analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences.

### Pharmacotherapies for sleep disturbances in dementia [^111Tzjuo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sleep disturbances, including reduced nocturnal sleep time, sleep fragmentation, nocturnal wandering, and daytime sleepiness are common clinical problems in dementia, and are associated with significant carer distress, increased healthcare costs, and institutionalisation. Although non-drug interventions are recommended as the first-line approach to managing these problems, drug treatment is often sought and used. However, there is significant uncertainty about the efficacy and adverse effects of the various hypnotic drugs in this clinically vulnerable population.

Objectives

To assess the effects, including common adverse effects, of any drug treatment versus placebo for sleep disorders in people with dementia.

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register, on 19 February 2020, using the terms: sleep, insomnia, circadian, hypersomnia, parasomnia, somnolence, rest-activity, and sundowning.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a drug with placebo, and that had the primary aim of improving sleep in people with dementia who had an identified sleep disturbance at baseline.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data on study design, risk of bias, and results. We used the mean difference (MD) or risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as the measures of treatment effect, and where possible, synthesised results using a fixed-effect model. Key outcomes to be included in our summary tables were chosen with the help of a panel of carers. We used GRADE methods to rate the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We found nine eligible RCTs investigating: melatonin (5 studies, n = 222, five studies, but only two yielded data on our primary sleep outcomes suitable for meta-analysis), the sedative antidepressant trazodone (1 study, n = 30), the melatonin-receptor agonist ramelteon (1 study, n = 74, no peer-reviewed publication), and the orexin antagonists suvorexant and lemborexant (2 studies, n = 323). Participants in the trazodone study and most participants in the melatonin studies had moderate-to-severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD); those in the ramelteon study and the orexin antagonist studies had mild-to-moderate AD. Participants had a variety of common sleep problems at baseline. Primary sleep outcomes were measured using actigraphy or polysomnography. In one study, melatonin treatment was combined with light therapy. Only four studies systematically assessed adverse effects. Overall, we considered the studies to be at low or unclear risk of bias. We found low-certainty evidence that melatonin doses up to 10 mg may have little or no effect on any major sleep outcome over eight to 10 weeks in people with AD and sleep disturbances. We could synthesise data for two of our primary sleep outcomes: total nocturnal sleep time (TNST) (MD 10.68 minutes, 95% CI -16.22 to 37.59; 2 studies, n = 184), and the ratio of day-time to night-time sleep (MD -0.13, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.03; 2 studies; n = 184). From single studies, we found no evidence of an effect of melatonin on sleep efficiency, time awake after sleep onset, number of night-time awakenings, or mean duration of sleep bouts. There were no serious adverse effects of melatonin reported. We found low-certainty evidence that trazodone 50 mg for two weeks may improve TNST (MD 42.46 minutes, 95% CI 0.9 to 84.0; 1 study, n = 30), and sleep efficiency (MD 8.53%, 95% CI 1.9 to 15.1; 1 study, n = 30) in people with moderate-to-severe AD. The effect on time awake after sleep onset was uncertain due to very serious imprecision (MD -20.41 minutes, 95% CI -60.4 to 19.6; 1 study, n = 30). There may be little or no effect on number of night-time awakenings (MD -3.71, 95% CI -8.2 to 0.8; 1 study, n = 30) or time asleep in the day (MD 5.12 minutes, 95% CI -28.2 to 38.4). There were no serious adverse effects of trazodone reported. The small (n = 74), phase 2 trial investigating ramelteon 8 mg was reported only in summary form on the sponsor's website. We considered the certainty of the evidence to be low. There was no evidence of any important effect of ramelteon on any nocturnal sleep outcomes. There were no serious adverse effects. We found moderate-certainty evidence that an orexin antagonist taken for four weeks by people with mild-to-moderate AD probably increases TNST (MD 28.2 minutes, 95% CI 11.1 to 45.3; 1 study, n = 274) and decreases time awake after sleep onset (MD -15.7 minutes, 95% CI -28.1 to -3.3: 1 study, n = 274) but has little or no effect on number of awakenings (MD 0.0, 95% CI -0.5 to 0.5; 1 study, n = 274). It may be associated with a small increase in sleep efficiency (MD 4.26%, 95% CI 1.26 to 7.26; 2 studies, n = 312), has no clear effect on sleep latency (MD -12.1 minutes, 95% CI -25.9 to 1.7; 1 study, n = 274), and may have little or no effect on the mean duration of sleep bouts (MD -2.42 minutes, 95% CI -5.53 to 0.7; 1 study, n = 38). Adverse events were probably no more common among participants taking orexin antagonists than those taking placebo (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.99; 2 studies, n = 323).

Authors' Conclusions

We discovered a distinct lack of evidence to guide decisions about drug treatment of sleep problems in dementia. In particular, we found no RCTs of many widely prescribed drugs, including the benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, although there is considerable uncertainty about the balance of benefits and risks for these common treatments. We found no evidence for beneficial effects of melatonin (up to 10 mg) or a melatonin receptor agonist. There was evidence of some beneficial effects on sleep outcomes from trazodone and orexin antagonists and no evidence of harmful effects in these small trials, although larger trials in a broader range of participants are needed to allow more definitive conclusions to be reached. Systematic assessment of adverse effects in future trials is essential.

Secondary outcomes on processing speed, disability scores, and visual recall also worsened faster in trazodone non-users, though none of the results were significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. All but three secondary outcomes revealed a trend that trazodone was beneficial in delaying cognitive decline. Prior to correcting for multiple comparisons, most notable were the apparent beneficial effects of trazodone in short-term visual memory, processing speed, calculations, and phonemic fluency (Table 3).

DISCUSSION

This study was conducted on the premise that SWS enhancement delays amyloid- β aggregation in AD models and improves sleep-mediated episodic memory consolidation through synaptic potentiation, both of which may delay long-term cognitive decline. Indeed, our results, by suggesting an association between longitudinal trazodone use and delayed cognitive decline, are supportive of this hypothesis, since the rate of decline in trazodone users was less than half (39.01%) of that of non-users on global measures of cognition over an estimated four-year period. Notably, it was participants treated with trazodone with concomitant baseline sleep complaints, especially those who reported improvement in sleep quality over time, who had delayed cognitive decline compared to patients with sleep disruption that were not on trazodone. After post-hoc analyses focusing on shorter inter-evaluation intervals, rates of decline remained relatively unchanged for each group, verifying a quasi-linear effect of inter-evaluation intervals to our primary outcome. However, effects were marginally non-significant, likely indicating a slightly underpowered study in revealing possible trazodone benefits for shorter follow-up periods. Overall, the above findings support for the first time the consideration of trazodone for clinical use, not only toward improving quality of life in older adults by increasing sleep duration, but also as an intervention against cognitive decline. The findings are also in keeping with the therapeutic concept of consolidating brain rhythms of sleep and wakefulness toward delaying neurodegeneration and optimizing synaptic plasticity. On this basis, sleep consolidation, as defined by integrity of sleep continuity and architecture, can be directly achieved through medications that consolidate sleep rhythms, as well as indirectly by consolidating rhythms of wakefulness that in turn allow deeper rhythms in subsequent sleep. Through this paradigm, SWS enhancers are only part of a gestalt approach toward optimizing sleep-wake rhythm separation, in which light therapy and daytime activities may also be useful.

### Does trazodone have a role in palliating symptoms? [^1173G8t9]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Trazodone is a unique antidepressant, which blocks the postsynaptic serotonin (5-HT) receptors, 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C), and weakly inhibits presynaptic 5-HT transporters.

Discussion

Trazodone is well-absorbed by the mouth and is metabolized by three cytochromes: CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Clinical benefits include reduced insomnia in those depressed and/or on antidepressants. Pain may be relieved by mechanisms similar to venlafaxine. Delirium unresponsive to neuroleptics has been reported to respond to trazodone. Drug interactions are a risk due to cytochrome metabolism.

Conclusion

Trazodone has a unique pharmacology, which may be an advantage in palliating symptoms; however, little evidence is available through cohort or randomized trials to give guidance to its use.

### Real-world characteristics and treatment patterns of patients with insomnia prescribed trazodone in the United States [^112bDkdd]. Clinical Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study sought to describe patient characteristics and treatment patterns among patients with insomnia prescribed trazodone in the United States.

Methods

This real-world, retrospective, descriptive cohort study used US commercial insurance claims from July 1, 2009, through June 30, 2019. The index date was the first prescription for trazodone between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2018, with 6 months for the preindex period and ≥ 6 months for the postindex period.

Findings

Among 5.8 million patients with insomnia, 17.7% were prescribed trazodone, and 357,380 adults (6.2%) and 7564 children (0.1%) met the study eligibility criteria. The mean (SD) age was 48.8 (15.8) years for adults and 14.8 (2.7) years for pediatrics. Most patients were female (229,280 adults [64.2%] and 4481 children [59.2%]). Insomnia due to mental disorder was the most common specific diagnosis. The most common (> 25%) comorbid conditions were anxiety, depression, and hypertensive disease, and 1 of 10 had a history of substance abuse. Zolpidem was previously prescribed (73,342 adults [20.5%] and 233 children [3.1%]) and continued to be prescribed. Concomitant antidepressants were most common (216,893 adults [60.7%] and 5414 children [71.6%]), but benzodiazepines (132,740 adults [37.1%] and 1188 children [15.7%]), antiepileptics (115,064 adults [32.2%] and 2103 children [27.8%]), nonbenzodiazepines (90,946 adults [25.4%] and 542 children [7.2%]), and antipsychotics (40,490 adults [11.3%] and 2063 children [27.3%]) were also prescribed.

Implications

This study provides current evidence that trazodone use is widespread among patients with insomnia and is often associated with other specific comorbidities, such as psychiatric conditions. A deeper knowledge of the real-world management of patients with insomnia may facilitate steps toward improving sleep quality, daytime functioning, and clinical outcomes for patients.

### Effect of psychological and medication therapies for insomnia on daytime functions: a randomized clinical trial [^112e4fag]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Treatments

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

The first-stage psychological therapy consisted of BT, which included sleep restrictionand stimulus control procedures. The second-stage psychological treatment consisted of CT, which targeted some perpetuating mechanisms (eg, ruminations and worries) that are implicated in the association between insomnia and mood disturbances (eg, anxiety and depression).

Medication

The first-stage medication treatment involved sublingual zolpidem, 5 mg to 10 mg, taken nightly at bedtime. The second-stage pharmacotherapy consisted of trazodone, 50 to 150 mg, taken 30 minutes before bedtime. As a serotonin receptor antagonist and reuptake inhibitor antidepressant, trazodone can alleviate a wide range of depressive symptoms with an additional sedative effect of sleep, and it has shown efficacy for both patients with insomnia and those with comorbid major depression. Additional information about treatment implementation can be found in a previous publication.

Statistical Analysis

The intention-to-treat analyses were performed in April and October 2023. To evaluate each treatment sequence while taking into account the nature of the SMART design (ie, 2 randomizations, where the second is conditional on the response to the first), the analytic strategy was based on recommendations from Nahum-Shani et al. Daytime functional outcomes according to 4 treatment sequences and 5 times (assessment after first-stage treatment [post1] to follow-up at 12 months) were analyzed using weighted generalized estimating equations models with identity link function. Weights were computed as the product of a missing model weight (to attenuate the effect of missing at random data) and a randomization weight (to correct for the inclusion of data from the patients whose insomnia remitted in stage 1 in the 2 sequences at stage 2 and beyond). Strata variables (site, age, sex, and comorbidity status) and outcome value at baseline were included as covariates. A priori contrasts within the weighted generalized estimating equations models were used to estimate temporal changes (baseline to post1, post1 to post2, and post2 to 12-month follow-up) and their 95% CIs and to test significance for comparisons between and within sequences. Data analyses were performed using the SAS, version 9.4, statistical software (SAS Institute Inc) with standard 2-tailed P < .05 considered statistically significant (P values for comparisons between sequences were adjusted for multiplicity using the simultaneous test procedure).

We further wanted to account for moderation effects on outcome measures of inter-evaluation interval secondary to natural disease progression. For trazodone users, baseline and final evaluations reflected the first and last visits with reported trazodone use. For trazodone non-users, these time points were the first and last visits with available medication data. We anticipated that follow-up intervals would not be identical for paired participants in the two groups to allow for propensity matching of inter-evaluation intervals, and thus planned our analysis a-priori with inter-evaluation intervals as a covariate. The interval between baseline and final visits was indeed different between the two groups (mean ± SD; trazodone users: 3.1 ± 1.9 years, non-users: 5.1 ± 2.8 years; p = 0.013) and interval effects were accounted for in all analyses. Nonetheless, to address possible non-linear effects of inter-evaluation interval differences between groups, we selected shorter follow-up periods for the trazodone non-users post-hoc, making intervals comparable between groups, and repeated the analysis.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: a potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^114P1GFD]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Data selection on primary and secondary outcomes

Our a priori defined primary outcome was the change in MMSE between baseline and final visits. Given increasing evidence on the association between SWS enhancement and improved sleep-mediated and awake episodic memory consolidation, we further pursued secondary outcomes of longitudinal changes in cognitive testing of visual and verbal episodic memory through 10-minute delayed recognition of the Benson Complex Figure and the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) and the CVLT Second Edition (CVLT-II). 24–26 Furthermore, considering that improved sleep also allows for improved executive function and working memory further mediated through prefrontal cortex engagement, we also tested longitudinal performance on Modified Trail-Making B, Design Fluency, Calculations, Digit-Span Forward and Backward, phonemic and semantic Verbal Fluency, and Stroop Color-Naming and Interference. We finally wanted to evaluate whether such effects translated to better disability scores through the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). Values for each of the variables were included as long as medication data were also available during the respective research visits. We did not impute data for our analyses.

### Is trazodone effective and safe for treating insomnia?… [^111va9Qp]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Is trazodone effective and safe for treating insomnia. Evidence-Based Answer Trazodone should not be used to treat insomnia. Trazodone decreases the number of nightly awakenings and may slightly improve subjective sleep quality, but it does not significantly improve total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, or waking time after sleep onset. Trazodone causes more adverse effects than placebo. It also has a higher fall risk than zolpidem or benzodiazepines. Patients treated with trazodone, zolpidem, and benzodiazepines have higher fall rates than untreated patients. 1 Patients with insomnia were included regardless of whether it was primary or secondary insomnia. Primary outcomes included sleep efficiency and self-reported sleep quality.

When trazodone was compared with placebo, there was no significant improvement in sleep efficiency and small to no change in sleep quality. Secondary outcomes included sleep latency, total sleep time, number of awakenings, and waking time after sleep onset. There was a significant decrease in the number of awakenings in patients receiving trazodone compared with placebo, with no significant differences in other secondary outcomes. A 2018 Cochrane review pooled three RCTs examining trazodone. Two low-quality RCTs used polysomnography to assess sleep efficiency and found no difference. One low-quality RCT showed more adverse effects, including morning grogginess, dry mouth, and thirst, at two weeks with trazodone compared with placebo.

### Effects of antidepressants on sleep [^116ELWdb]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Effects on Antidepressants on Sleep

It is well known that some classes of antidepressant drugs may deteriorate sleep quality mainly due to activation of serotonergic 5-HT2 receptors and increased noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission (Table 2). Among them, most prominent are serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRI), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), and activating tricyclic antidepressants (TCA).

Table 2
Effects of antidepressants on sleep

On the contrary, antidepressants with antihistaminergic action, like sedating TCA, mirtazapine, mianserine, or strong antagonistic action at serotonergic 5-HT2 receptors, like trazodone and nefazodone quickly improve sleep. Some patients show improvement of sleep quality already after the first drug dose, which was specially discussed for mirtazapine as related to the faster onset of antidepressant action.

### Effects of antidepressants on sleep [^111WnadS]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this review article was to summarize recent publications on effects of antidepressants on sleep and to show that these effects not only depend on the kind of antidepressant drugs but are also related to the dose, the time of drug administration, and the duration of the treatment.

Recent Findings

Complaints of disrupted sleep are very common in patients suffering from depression, and they are listed among diagnostic criteria for this disorder. Moreover, midnocturnal insomnia is the most frequent residual symptom of depression. Thus, all antidepressants should normalize sleep. However, at least in short-term treatment, many antidepressants with so-called activating effects (e.g. fluoxetine, venlafaxine) may disrupt sleep, while others with sedative properties (e.g., doxepin, mirtazapine, trazodone) rapidly improve sleep, but may cause problems in long-term treatment due to oversedation. For sleep-promoting action, the best effects can frequently be achieved with a very low dose, administered early enough before bedtime and importantly, always as a part of more complex interventions based on the cognitive-behavioral protocol to treat insomnia (CBT-I). For successful treatment of depression, it is necessary to understand the effects of antidepressants on sleep. Each physician should also be aware that some antidepressants may worsen or induce primary sleep disorders like restless legs syndrome, sleep bruxism, REM sleep behavior disorder, nightmares, and sleep apnea, which may result from an antidepressant-induced weight gain.

### Pharmacotherapies for sleep disturbances in dementia [^11582SHN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Sleep disturbances, including reduced nocturnal sleep time, sleep fragmentation, nocturnal wandering, and daytime sleepiness are common clinical problems in dementia, and are associated with significant caregiver distress, increased healthcare costs, and institutionalisation. Drug treatment is often sought to alleviate these problems, but there is significant uncertainty about the efficacy and adverse effects of the various hypnotic drugs in this vulnerable population.

Objectives

To assess the effects, including common adverse effects, of any drug treatment versus placebo for sleep disorders in people with dementia, through identification and analysis of all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register, in March 2013 and again in March 2016, using the terms: sleep, insomnia, circadian, hypersomnia, parasomnia, somnolence, rest-activity, sundowning.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs that compared a drug with placebo, and that had the primary aim of improving sleep in people with dementia who had an identified sleep disturbance at baseline. Trials could also include non-pharmacological interventions, as long as both drug and placebo groups had the same exposure to them.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data on study design, risk of bias, and results from the included study reports. We obtained additional information from study authors where necessary. We used the mean difference as the measure of treatment effect, and where possible, synthesized results using a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We found six RCTs eligible for inclusion for three drugs: melatonin (222 participants, four studies, but only two yielded data on our primary sleep outcomes suitable for meta-analysis), trazodone (30 participants, one study), and ramelteon (74 participants, one study, no peer-reviewed publication, limited information available). The participants in the trazodone study and almost all participants in the melatonin studies had moderate-to-severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD); those in the ramelteon study had mild-to-moderate AD. Participants had a variety of common sleep problems at baseline. All primary sleep outcomes were measured using actigraphy. In one study of melatonin, drug treatment was combined with morning bright light therapy. Only two studies made a systematic assessment of adverse effects. Overall, the evidence was at low risk of bias, although there were areas of incomplete reporting, some problems with participant attrition, related largely to poor tolerance of actigraphy and technical difficulties, and a high risk of selective reporting in one trial that contributed very few participants. The risk of bias in the ramelteon study was unclear due to incomplete reporting. We found no evidence that melatonin, at doses up to 10 mg, improved any major sleep outcome over 8 to 10 weeks in patients with AD who were identified as having a sleep disturbance. We were able to synthesize data for two of our primary sleep outcomes: total nocturnal sleep time (mean difference (MD) 10.68 minutes, 95% CI -16.22 to 37.59; N = 184; two studies), and the ratio of daytime sleep to night-time sleep (MD -0.13, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.03; N = 184; two studies). From single studies, we found no difference between melatonin and placebo groups for sleep efficiency, time awake after sleep onset, or number of night-time awakenings. From two studies, we found no effect of melatonin on cognition or performance of activities of daily living (ADL). No serious adverse effects of melatonin were reported in the included studies. We considered this evidence to be of low quality. There was low-quality evidence that trazodone 50 mg given at night for two weeks improved total nocturnal sleep time (MD 42.46 minutes, 95% CI 0.9 to 84.0; N = 30; one study), and sleep efficiency (MD 8.53%, 95% CI 1.9 to 15.1; N = 30; one study) in patients with moderate-to-severe AD, but it did not affect the amount of time spent awake after sleep onset (MD -20.41, 95% CI -60.4 to 19.6; N = 30; one study), or the number of nocturnal awakenings (MD -3.71, 95% CI -8.2 to 0.8; N = 30; one study). No effect was seen on daytime sleep, cognition, or ADL. No serious adverse effects of trazodone were reported. Results from a phase 2 trial investigating ramelteon 8 mg administered at night were available in summary form in a sponsor's synopsis. Because the data were from a single, small study and reporting was incomplete, we considered this evidence to be of low quality in general terms. Ramelteon had no effect on total nocturnal sleep time at one week (primary outcome) or eight weeks (end of treatment) in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. The synopsis reported few significant differences from placebo for any sleep, behavioural, or cognitive outcomes; none were likely to be of clinical significance. There were no serious adverse effects from ramelteon.

Authors' Conclusions

We discovered a distinct lack of evidence to help guide drug treatment of sleep problems in dementia. In particular, we found no RCTs of many drugs that are widely prescribed for sleep problems in dementia, including the benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, although there is considerable uncertainty about the balance of benefits and risks associated with these common treatments. From the studies we identified for this review, we found no evidence that melatonin (up to 10mg) helped sleep problems in patients with moderate to severe dementia due to AD. There was some evidence to support the use of a low dose (50 mg) of trazodone, although a larger trial is needed to allow a more definitive conclusion to be reached on the balance of risks and benefits. There was no evidence of any effect of ramelteon on sleep in patients with mild to moderate dementia due to AD. This is an area with a high need for pragmatic trials, particularly of those drugs that are in common clinical use for sleep problems in dementia. Systematic assessment of adverse effects is essential.

### Pharmacotherapy for behavioural manifestations in frontotemporal dementia: an expert consensus from the European reference network for rare neurological diseases (ERN-RND) [^113RYMPj]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Trazodone, a mixed agonist and antagonist of various serotonin receptors and antagonist of adrenergic receptors, is a third option often prescribed for neuropsychiatric symptoms in FTD. Trazodone increases extracellular serotonin in the frontal lobes and has been proved to decrease agitation and aggression and to improve sleep in FTD. A randomized controlled trial with trazodone in FTD in a cohort of 26 cases showed a significant improvement in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) total score, mainly based on improvements in irritability, agitation, depressive symptoms and eating disorders.

Other medications occasionally considered in behavioural manifestations of FTD include anticonvulsants, stimulants, benzodiazepines and other antidepressants. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially donepezil, frequently used to improve cognitive functioning in Alzheimer's disease, were proved to worsen the neuropsychiatric symptoms without cognitive improvement in patients with FTD in multiple studies. Memantine is also not an effective treatment for FTD.

Altogether, trial‐based evidence for symptomatic pharmacological treatment of behavioural disturbances in FTD is scarce despite their significant burden on both patients and caregivers. This expert opinion review aims to provide guidance for pharmacological treatment of behavioural symptoms that severely impact the patient's and family's wellbeing.

The symptoms queried were selected based on clinical expertise of the FTD disease group. They were deliberately meant to be concrete and directly taken from clinical experience rather than querying more general classes of symptom clusters.

### Use of a computer-based reminder to improve sedative-hypnotic prescribing in older hospitalized patients [^114M3SLW]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To develop a feasible, inexpensive, point-of-care computerized reminder to improve sedative-hypnotic prescribing in hospitalized older people.

Design

Pre-postintervention with a computer-based reminder.

Setting

Academic medical center.

Participants

Hospitalized patients aged 65 and older.

Intervention

Computer-based reminder directing clinicians to prescribe a nonpharmacological sleep protocol, to minimize the potential for harm with diphenhydramine and diazepam use by choosing an alternative medication (trazodone or lorazepam), or both.

Measurements

Frequency of prescription of four sedative-hypnotic drugs (diphenhydramine, diazepam, lorazepam, and trazodone) during the 12 months before (n = 12,356 patients) and after (n = 12,153) the reminder was instituted.

Results

Prescribing of sedative-hypnotics decreased from 2,208 per 12,356 (18%) patients preintervention to 1,832 per 12,153 (15%) postintervention (odds ratio for the intervention = 0.82, 95% confidence interval = 0.76–0.87), an 18% risk reduction. Combined prescription rates for all four drugs fell consistently throughout the postintervention period. Diphenhydramine, diazepam, and lorazepam orders declined overall, with lorazepam prescriptions decreasing 39% during the intervention. Ninety-five percent of patients were successfully directed to a safer sedative-hypnotic drug or a nonpharmacological sleep protocol.

Conclusion

Using real-time computer-based reminders could lead to improved sedative-hypnotic prescribing for older persons in acute care. This study highlights the potential to address patient safety concerns, and the quality of medication prescribing in particular, in vulnerable hospitalized patients.

Alzheimer's disease and other dementias — pharmacological options for insomnia include trazodone and hypnotics with specified dosing, with cautions and agents not recommended; some clinicians prefer 25–100 mg of trazodone at bedtime for sleep disturbances, whereas others prefer the nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics such as zolpidem (5–10 mg at bedtime) or zaleplon (5–10 mg at bedtime); benzodiazepines (e.g., 0.5–1.0 mg of lorazepam, 7.5–15.0 mg of oxazepam) may be used, but these agents are generally recommended only for short-term sleep problems because of the possibility of tolerance, daytime sleepiness, rebound insomnia, worsening cognition, falls, disinhibition, and delirium; rebound insomnia and daytime sleepiness can occur with any of these agents; triazolam is not recommended for individuals with dementia because of its association with amnesia; diphenhydramine is used by some clinicians, but it is not recommended for the treatment of patients with dementia because of its anticholinergic properties.

### Sleep alterations as a function of 88 health indicators [^114zHHf2]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Our findings showed accelerated EEG rhythms, increased REM sleep latency, reduced REM sleep duration/percentage, and increased N2 sleep in participants reporting ongoing treatment with SSRIs. SSRI antidepressants are known for their inhibition of the reuptake of serotonin from the synaptic cleft, thus potentiating the effect of the transmitter on pre- and postsynaptic receptors. Our findings on the acceleration of sleep EEG frequencies in patients treated with SSRIs confirm the excitatory profile of these drugs and cohere with former studies performed on a low number of healthy volunteers. We found that these effects were specific to SSRI treatment, with different patterns emerging for other antidepressants. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are known for their sedative side effects due to antagonizing muscarinic and histamine receptors, resulting in a different sleep–wake-promoting effect. Trazodone exhibits antagonistic effects on 5-HT2A (serotonergic) receptors, resulting in a wake-inhibiting and slow-wave sleep-promoting effect and a sedative, sleep-inducing profile of this mediation. TCAs and trazodone were not significantly associated with sleep EEG changes, but the former were associated with increased N2 and decreased SWS sleep, while the latter was associated with increased sleep efficiency, SWS, and decreased N1 sleep, in line with clinical experience. A direct comparison of patients undergoing different antidepressive treatment regimens supported that the acceleration of EEG rhythms is specific to SSRIs. However, the fact that the severity of depressive symptoms correlated with sleep alterations in a similar manner as SSRIs even in antidepressant-naïve participants suggests that the separation of the effects of SSRI treatment from that of the underlying illness is a complex issue in an ecologically valid observational study such as ours.

### Effects of antidepressants on sleep [^116ygM1t]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2017). Low credibility.

In a recent review article on the prevalence of treatment emergent insomnia and somnolence in depressed patients, it was shown that subjective complaints of insomnia or daytime somnolence were frequent in patients suffering from depression or anxiety disorders treated with SSRI and SNRI.

Based on data from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) study register, the average prevalence of treatment-emergent insomnia in clinical trials with SSRI was 17% as compared to 9% out of patients randomized to the placebo arm. The average rate of treatment emergent somnolence in patients being treated with SSRI amounted to 16% as compared to 8% out of patients receiving placebo. The lowest rate of treatment emergent insomnia complaints (below 2%) was reported in the study with citalopram. The highest rate of treatment-emergent insomnia and somnolence was found in patients suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) being treated with high-dose fluvoxamine, 31 and 27%, respectively. In clinical trials with SNRI, treatment-emergent insomnia was reported on average in 13% out of SNRI-treated patients as compared to 7% out of the placebo arm and treatment-emergent somnolence in 10% of SNRI-treated patients in comparison to 5% out of patients receiving placebo. Both treatment-emergent insomnia and somnolence were the most frequent (both equal to 24%) in patients with generalized anxiety disorders treated with venlafaxine. The lowest rate of treatment emergent insomnia and somnolence (both below 2%) was reported for levomilnacipran. On the contrary to the treatment with SSRI and SNRI, in clinical studies with sedating antidepressants, e.g. mirtazapine and trazodone, the reported prevalence of treatment-emergent insomnia complaints in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) was very low (below 2%). However, the rate of treatment-emergent somnolence was very high, 54% in patients being treated with mirtazapine as compared to 18% out of patients in the placebo arm and 46% in patients being treated with trazodone as compared to 19% out of patients receiving placebo. It is important to note that acute effects of antidepressants on sleep are reflected not only in the patients' subjective complaints but they can also be demonstrated in studies with PSG (Table 2). While SSRI, SNRI, and activating TCA increase REM latency, suppress REM sleep, and may impair sleep continuity, sedating antidepressants decrease sleep latency, improve sleep efficiency, increase SWS, and usually have little or no effect on REM sleep. Although both the sleep-disrupting and sleep-promoting effects of the antidepressants are the strongest only in the first few weeks of treatment, in some patients they may persist, aggravating insomnia complaints or causing daytime somnolence. Therefore, for the depressed patients with clinically significant insomnia, a treatment with a sedative antidepressant is usually more recommended. It was recently shown that such treatment significantly reduces the need to use benzodiazepines in patients with MDD. Such an approach, combination treatment with benzodiazepines and SSRI/SNRI is often necessary to reduce anxiety and insomnia as early as in the first week of treatment. However, there is a related risk that the patient suffering from depression and insomnia will not be able to stop such treatment after 14–28 days of therapy and will develop a dependence. On the other hand, because the sleep complaints usually improve after a few weeks of effective treatment of depression with SSRI/SNRI, it is important to consider whether the use of hypnotics is not a better short-term treatment option for a patient than risking oversedation during treatment with a sedative antidepressant. The sedating effect of those antidepressants is usually an increasing problem in long-term maintenance treatment, frequently resulting in a need to reduce the drug dose. It may substantially diminish the efficacy of the maintenance treatment. The sedative antidepressants may also induce a weight gain, what is particularly shown for mirtazapine but not for trazodone.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^115p37NH]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Current hypnotic usage — prescription patterns and population use are summarized across U.S. datasets. Overall frequency of hypnotic prescriptions for insomnia declined during 1970–1990 from 5.3% to 2.5%. In office-based prescribing during 1987–1996, there was an over 50% decline in benzodiazepine (BZD) hypnotic prescriptions accompanied by a nearly 150% increase in trazodone prescriptions, and overall prescriptions for insomnia declined by about 25% during this period. Using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999–2010 data, just under 3% of the population had used these agents within the past month; BzRAs were most commonly prescribed (1.23% of the population), followed by trazodone (0.97%), BZDs (0.4%), quetiapine (0.32%) and doxepin. The use of antidepressants with poor or limited documentation was only 0.7% in the past month, increasing from 0.2% in the first year sampled to 3.5% in the final year (2009–2010). The 2005 National Sleep Foundation's survey found that 7% of respondents report using a prescription medication to improve sleep at least a few nights per month.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: a potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^113pUEGp]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Sleep disorders increase in frequency with aging, and their manifestation, even in cognitively non-impaired individuals, can be a harbinger of subsequent cognitive decline. Sleep changes with aging include decreased total sleep time and efficiency, increased waking after sleep onset, and decreased slow wave sleep (SWS). SWS in humans, as part of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, mediates episodic memory consolidation. Recent studies in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) reveal that SWS restriction accelerates activity-dependent amyloid- β aggregation, whereas SWS enhancement delays aggregation. Furthermore, patients with AD have less SWS, and cognitively non-impaired adults with decreased SWS exhibit increased amyloid- β burden and worse sleep-mediated episodic memory consolidation. Several double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials for sleep consolidation in AD have tested the effectiveness of commonly used hypnotic agents: melatonin, ramelteon, mirtazapine, and trazodone. While melatonin, ramelteon, or mirtazapine use did not produce significant improvement on sleep measures, trazodone, previously shown to enhance SWS by 50–56% on polysomnography in younger and older adults, increased total sleep time by 42.5 minutes on actigraphy in patients with AD. Furthermore, there were no cognitive side effects or daytime somnolence after a 2-week intervention period, thus diminishing concerns for possible cholinergic, α -adrenergic, or histaminergic antagonistic effects in sleep-promoting doses. Although these studies did not reveal a change in cognitive performance, improvement or worsening, they were too short in duration to observe possible SWS-mediated effects on course of neurodegeneration, and did not specifically test overnight sleep-mediated memory consolidation that may have been a more sensitive test for sleep-mediated synaptic potentiation. To date, no studies have assessed long-term effects of trazodone on cognitive performance.

We thus hypothesized that trazodone, a SWS enhancer, may correlate with delayed cognitive decline over prolonged use. To test whether such an association exists, we retrospectively analyzed longitudinal cognitive decline trajectories dependent on prolonged use of trazodone in volunteers from our research cohort.

### Falls, healthcare resources and costs in older adults with insomnia treated with zolpidem, trazodone, or benzodiazepines [^111nwviQ]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this national Medicare administrative claims data study, older adult beneficiaries taking common insomnia medications demonstrated significantly elevated risk of falls, all-cause mortality, HCRU, and costs compared with non-sleep disordered controls. In addition to highlighting adverse outcomes associated with common insomnia treatments, our most novel findings pertain to substantial risks associated with trazodone, which is often perceived as a safe, albeit off-label, approach to insomnia medication treatment. Note, however, as this study was observational and not a randomized controlled trial, the results show association and not causality. Specifically, residual confounding due to potential misclassification of medication exposure and lack of availability of clinical variables such as severity of insomnia and other underlying illnesses cannot be ruled out.

This study's findings are consistent with two previous studies among older adults which suggested increased risk of falls associated with trazodone use and comparable risk of fall-related injury associated with use of low-dose trazodone or benzodiazepines. Very few studies have examined the impact of trazodone in insomnia, particularly among older adults. Roth and colleagues conducted a small, placebo-controlled study and found trazodone to be associated with impairments in next day balance and arm muscle strength among older adults with insomnia. Low-dose trazodone is commonly prescribed off-label for insomnia, yet it remains understudied and controversial. Indeed, the most common side effects associated with trazodone include drowsiness and dizziness. Nonetheless, many prescribers perceive trazodone as a relatively safe treatment – and some payers may require off-label use of low-dose trazodone as first line therapy for insomnia – although AASM Clinical Guidelines do not recommend trazodone due to limited efficacy/safety study data. AASM asserts that this physician perception of trazodone as a "safer" sleep-promoting agent and consequent prescribing practices of those physicians have engendered the widespread use of trazodone for insomnia. In this vein, findings from the current national study add an important population health perspective to the literature.

Treatment effect estimation on daytime impairment

In the absence of randomized clinical trials, we investigated and compared the ability of ICD-clin, ICD-clin-DiSMOL, and DiSMOL to quantify the effect of treatment with trazodone, benzodiazepine, and non-benzodiazepine receptor agonists (non-BzRAs) on the number of daytime impairment symptoms in individuals with insomnia. These hypnotics were selected as the most widely used sleep medications which also cause adverse events that might interfere with the daytime functioning of the patients. Melatonin was not included in the analysis as it is not always easy to understand which specific melatonin product is used and OTC formulations may not always be reported. Quantifying daytime impairment symptoms during versus before treatment with benzodiazepines, trazodone, and non-BzRAs differed between DiSMOL and ICD-clin. Compared with before treatment, treatment with benzodiazepines was associated with a statistically significant increase of daytime impairment symptoms in all domains ('overall') using DiSMOL (18.9%, P = 0.021), but not ICD-clin (−3.3%, P = 0.867 [not significant (ns)]). Similar outcomes for DiSMOL versus ICD-clin were identified in the emotional (26.3%, P = 0.016 vs. −13.2%, P = 0.866 [ns]) and physical (20.9%, P = 0.032 vs. −11.1%, P = 0.866 [ns]) domains but not in the cognition domain (6.9%, P = 0.793 [ns] vs. −3.3%, P = 0.867 [ns]) (Table 3). Patients who received trazodone experienced a statistically significant increase in daytime impairment symptoms overall during treatment compared with before treatment by ICD-clin (53.5%, P = 0.014). In comparison, no significant effect was observed for DiSMOL (9.0%, P = 0.094 [ns]) (Table 4). Similar outcomes for ICD-clin versus DiSMOL were identified for the cognition (53.5%, P = 0.014 vs. 4.4%, P = 0.465 [ns]), emotional (49.9%, P = 0.018 vs. 12.9%, P = 0.071 [ns]), and physical (50.1%, P = 0.018 vs. 7.0%, P = 0.237 [ns]) domains. Treatment with non-BzRAs compared with before treatment was associated with statistically significant increases across all representations in daytime impairment symptoms overall (DiSMOL: 16.0%, P = 0.001; ICD-clin: 43.5%, P = 0.002) and in each domain (cognition: 16.1%, P = 0.003 vs. 43.5%, P = 0.002; emotional: 21.6%, P = 0.001 vs. 43.0%, P = 0.002; physical: 11.8%, P = 0.016 vs. 43.2%, P = 0.002) (Table 5).
