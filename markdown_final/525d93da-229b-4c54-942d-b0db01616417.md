## Question

Acute interstitial nephritis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining AIN and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and contemporary trends. Next, I will review etiologies, followed by clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation, including when to biopsy. After that, I need to examine management principles, including drug withdrawal, supportive care, and the role and timing of corticosteroids. Finally, I should assess prognosis, special populations, and controversies, and close with practical clinical recommendations and a concise summary algorithm.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology so I don't gloss over fundamentals: AIN is an immune-mediated inflammatory process targeting the renal interstitium and tubules, with a predominance of T-cell–mediated hypersensitivity, leading to interstitial edema, tubulitis, and variable fibrosis; the glomeruli are typically spared, which helps distinguish it from primary glomerular diseases, and fibrosis can begin within 10–14 days, underscoring the urgency of diagnosis and treatment decisions [^113MX1VA] [^111Lhs4v] [^112vvA21].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiology before drawing conclusions: AIN accounts for roughly 15–27% of biopsies performed for AKI, though this likely underestimates true incidence because many cases are not biopsied; incidence appears to be rising, particularly in older adults exposed to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and there are emerging signals of increased cases in younger women with NSAID exposure; historical U.S. estimates suggest about 2 per 100,000 person-years, but contemporary biopsy series show higher proportions, reflecting both changing drug exposures and biopsy practices [^111Lhs4v] [^11794SYe] [^1157Gx1c] [^114fc8Fo] [^116YVck2].

> I will now examine etiologies, and I need to ensure I capture the dominant drug causes: drug-induced AIN comprises the majority of cases (about 60–75%), with antibiotics (notably beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones), NSAIDs, and PPIs most frequently implicated; immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are an increasingly recognized cause, and numerous other agents have been reported, including allopurinol, anticonvulsants, and even varenicline; non-drug causes include infections (e.g., leptospirosis, hantavirus, HIV, BK virus), autoimmune diseases (e.g., sarcoidosis, Sjögren's, TINU), and idiopathic forms; I should double-check that PPI-associated AIN is now highlighted in regulatory labeling, which it is [^113MX1VA] [^111Lhs4v] [^1157Gx1c] [^111Jiiys] [^112Prcv9] [^116vgiGE] [^111ZTsyf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the clinical picture: the classic triad of fever, rash, and eosinophilia is present in a minority, and modern presentations are often oligosymptomatic with nonoliguric AKI, mild proteinuria, sterile pyuria, hematuria, and occasionally white cell casts; eosinophiluria is neither sensitive nor specific, and RBC casts, while classically glomerular, can rarely occur in tubulointerstitial disease, so I should be cautious about overinterpreting sediment findings; importantly, timing after drug exposure is variable but often within days to weeks, and ICI-associated AIN typically emerges after several treatment cycles [^113MX1VA] [^111Lhs4v] [^113cCBXR] [^111rBXjh] [^113d7LGU].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach and confirm the gold standard: kidney biopsy remains the definitive test, especially when the diagnosis is uncertain, when there is no rapid improvement after drug withdrawal, or when immunosuppression is being considered; noninvasive tests such as eosinophiluria, gallium scanning, and even FDG-PET have limited or investigational roles; ultrasound may show enlarged, echogenic kidneys but is nonspecific; I need to ensure I integrate clinical context with urinalysis, electrolytes, and medication history rather than relying on any single test [^113MX1VA] [^111TYJUR] [^112r1bGv] [^112EGUn6] [^114Et4qd].

> Let me think about management principles, and I should confirm the hierarchy: immediate withdrawal of the suspected offending agent is the cornerstone; provide supportive care including volume optimization, electrolyte management, avoidance of nephrotoxins, and dose adjustments for renal function; I initially thought "early steroids within 7 days" was a universal rule, but wait, I should verify the strength of evidence — this timing comes from observational data and expert opinion rather than randomized trials, so I should frame it as "consider early corticosteroids", particularly in moderate-to-severe AKI or biopsy-proven AIN, using prednisone around 1 mg/kg/day for 2–3 weeks with a gradual taper if there is clinical response; if steroids fail or are contraindicated, escalation to other immunosuppressants may be considered case-by-case, and ICI-associated AIN generally responds to steroids with potential for rechallenge after recovery in selected patients [^111SBmSN] [^116YiZrt] [^111Lhs4v] [^111n8daF] [^111Jiiys] [^112Prcv9].

> I should double-check prognostic factors so counseling is accurate: recovery is common but not universal, with complete or partial recovery in many patients; adverse predictors include older age, delayed drug withdrawal, prolonged AKI duration, greater proteinuria, and interstitial fibrosis on biopsy; pediatric outcomes are generally better, though CKD can still occur; intriguingly, among patients with AKI on ICIs, those with AIN may have lower mortality than those with AKI from other causes, suggesting AIN may be a marker of effective immune activation, though this requires cautious interpretation [^112PzxsM] [^1157Gx1c] [^116NztRh] [^117LhoPt].

> But wait, what about special populations and emerging contexts: ICI-associated AIN warrants a high index of suspicion, early biopsy for moderate-to-severe AKI, prompt steroid therapy, and coordinated decisions about rechallenge; transplant recipients can develop AIN from BK virus or drug reactions, requiring tailored immunosuppression adjustments; COVID-19–associated AIN has been described, including granulomatous patterns, reinforcing the need to biopsy atypical or severe AKI when the course deviates from expected ATN; TINU syndrome should be considered in adolescents and young adults with AKI and ocular symptoms, even if they are not concurrent [^111Jiiys] [^112Prcv9] [^116QbdPi] [^117WwSuo] [^1144Wfgi].

> I need to ensure I acknowledge controversies transparently: the benefit of corticosteroids remains debated due to the absence of randomized trials, with some retrospective series showing faster recovery when steroids are started early and others showing no clear difference; given potential harm from delayed therapy and the risk of fibrosis, many experts favor early steroids in biopsy-proven or high-probability cases after culprit drug withdrawal, while recognizing the evidence quality [^113DyzNa] [^1157Gx1c] [^117Mq5VN] [^113MX1VA].

> Let me synthesize practical clinical recommendations so nothing critical is missed: maintain a high index of suspicion for AIN in AKI with sterile pyuria, mild proteinuria, or recent exposure to high-risk drugs (PPIs, NSAIDs, antibiotics, ICIs); stop the suspected drug immediately; if there is no rapid improvement within 3–7 days or the diagnosis is uncertain, pursue kidney biopsy; consider early corticosteroids in moderate-to-severe or biopsy-proven cases; provide meticulous supportive care and avoid nephrotoxins; counsel on prognosis and the importance of avoiding re-exposure to culprit agents [^113MX1VA] [^111TYJUR] [^116YiZrt].

> In summary, AIN is a predominantly drug-induced, immune-mediated tubulointerstitial injury that often presents subtly; early recognition, prompt withdrawal of the offending agent, judicious use of biopsy, and timely consideration of corticosteroids in appropriate patients are the pillars of management, with outcomes tightly linked to the rapidity of intervention and the extent of fibrosis at presentation; I should confirm that my plan aligns with these principles before finalizing recommendations [^113MX1VA] [^111Lhs4v] [^112PzxsM].

Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) is an **immune-mediated tubulointerstitial inflammation** [^1177v4KB] that causes acute kidney injury (AKI) and is most often triggered by drugs, infections, or autoimmune diseases [^1177v4KB]. Diagnosis relies on a high index of suspicion, with **kidney biopsy as the gold standard** [^1177v4KB], especially when AKI persists after stopping suspected drugs or when systemic disease is suspected [^111TYJUR]. Management centers on **immediate withdrawal of the offending agent** [^111SBmSN] and supportive care; corticosteroids may hasten recovery if started early, but evidence is limited and not universal [^113MX1VA] [^113DyzNa]. Prognosis is generally favorable with timely intervention, but delays can lead to chronic kidney disease [^112PzxsM].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

AIN is classically categorized into **drug-induced, infection-related, autoimmune, and idiopathic** forms [^113MX1VA]:

- **Drug-induced AIN**: The most common cause, accounting for 60–70% of cases [^113MX1VA]. Frequent culprits include antibiotics (beta-lactams, sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones), NSAIDs, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) [^111Lhs4v] [^1157Gx1c] [^115i8mNg].

- **Infection-related AIN**: Associated with systemic infections such as streptococcal infections, leptospirosis, hantavirus, and HIV [^111Lhs4v] [^116jcD19] [^1132mZ81].

- **Autoimmune and systemic diseases**: Sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren's syndrome, and IgG4-related disease can cause AIN [^111Lhs4v] [^11794SYe].

- **Idiopathic AIN**: A minority of cases have no identifiable cause [^1177v4KB].

Risk factors include **advanced age, chronic kidney disease, and polypharmacy**, particularly with nephrotoxic medications [^111o6UnR].

---

## Clinical presentation

AIN presents with **nonspecific symptoms**, making clinical diagnosis challenging [^113Ji8YC]:

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, rash, arthralgia, and eosinophilia (the classic triad) are present in only a minority of patients [^113Ji8YC].

- **Renal symptoms**: Acute kidney injury (AKI) with oliguria or anuria, flank pain, and hematuria [^113DyzNa].

- **Laboratory findings**: Elevated serum creatinine, mild proteinuria, sterile pyuria, hematuria, and occasionally eosinophiluria [^113cCBXR].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis of AIN requires a **combination of clinical, laboratory, and histopathological findings**:

- **Clinical suspicion**: Recent exposure to potential offending drugs or infections, and unexplained AKI [^1177v4KB].

- **Laboratory tests**: Elevated serum creatinine, mild proteinuria, sterile pyuria, hematuria, and eosinophiluria (sensitivity and specificity vary) [^113cCBXR] [^112r1bGv].

- **Imaging**: Renal ultrasound may show enlarged kidneys with increased echogenicity, but findings are nonspecific [^112EGUn6].

- **Kidney biopsy**: The gold standard for definitive diagnosis, especially in persistent or severe cases, or when alternative diagnoses are suspected [^113MX1VA] [^113Ji8YC].

Histopathology typically reveals **interstitial infiltrates** composed of lymphocytes, macrophages, eosinophils, and plasma cells, with interstitial edema and tubular injury [^113MX1VA] [^111Lhs4v].

---

## Management strategies

Management of AIN centers on **immediate withdrawal of the offending agent** and supportive care:

- **Withdrawal of offending agent**: Immediate discontinuation of suspected drugs or treatment of underlying infections [^111SBmSN].

- **Supportive care**: Fluid and electrolyte management, blood pressure control, and avoidance of nephrotoxic medications [^116YiZrt].

- **Corticosteroid therapy**: Controversial but may hasten renal recovery if initiated early (within 7–14 days). Prednisone 1 mg/kg/day for 2–3 weeks, followed by a gradual taper, is commonly used [^113MX1VA] [^111n8daF] [^111Lhs4v].

- **Dialysis**: Temporary dialysis may be required in severe cases of renal failure [^112PzxsM].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Prognosis of AIN varies with the **timeliness of intervention** and the extent of renal injury. With prompt recognition and management, most patients experience complete or partial recovery of renal function; however, delayed diagnosis or prolonged exposure to the offending agent increases the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [^112PzxsM]. Recurrence can occur with **re-exposure** to the offending agent or with autoimmune etiologies [^112PzxsM].

---

## Preventive measures and patient education

Preventive strategies focus on **avoiding nephrotoxic medications**, monitoring renal function during high-risk therapies, and educating patients about early signs of renal dysfunction. Regular follow-up and monitoring are essential, particularly in patients with chronic conditions requiring long-term medication use [^113vxBjZ].

Acute interstitial nephritis is an immune-mediated renal disorder characterized by interstitial inflammation and tubular injury. Early recognition, withdrawal of the offending agent, and supportive care are essential for optimal outcomes. Corticosteroids may benefit selected patients, but **evidence remains limited**.

### Diagnosis and management of acute interstitial nephritis [^113Ji8YC]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Acute interstitial nephritis is an important cause of acute renal failure resulting from immune-mediated tubulointerstitial injury, initiated by medications, infection, and other causes. Acute interstitial nephritis may be implicated in up to 15 percent of patients hospitalized for acute renal failure. Clinical features are essentially those of acute renal failure from any cause, and apart from a history of new illness or medication exposure, there are no specific history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that distinguish acute interstitial nephritis from other causes of acute renal failure. Classic findings of fever, rash, and arthralgias may be absent in up to two thirds of patients. Diagnostic studies such as urine eosinophils and renal gallium 67 scanning provide suggestive evidence, but they are unable to reliably confirm or exclude the diagnosis of acute interstitial nephritis. Renal biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis, but it may not be required in mild cases or when clinical improvement is rapid after removal of an offending agent or medication. The time until removal of such agents, and renal biopsy findings, provide the best prognostic information for return to baseline renal function. Corticosteroids appear to provide some benefit in terms of clinical improvement and return of renal function, but no controlled clinical trials have been conducted to confirm this.

### Changes in the aetiology, clinical presentation and management of acute interstitial nephritis, an increasingly common cause of acute kidney injury [^11794SYe]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) is an important cause of acute kidney injury that has experienced significant epidemiological and clinical changes in the last years. The classical presentation, mostly induced by antibiotics and accompanied by evident hypersensitivity manifestations (skin rash, eosinophilia, fever) has been largely replaced by oligosymptomatic presentations that require a higher index of suspicion and are increasingly recognized in the elderly, having non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and proton pump inhibitors as frequent offending drugs. Drug-induced AIN continues to be the commonest type, but it requires a careful differential diagnosis with other entities (tubulointerstitial nephritis with uveitis syndrome, IgG4-related disease, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptom syndrome, sarcoidosis and other systemic diseases) that can also induce AIN. Cortico-dependant, relapsing AIN is a recently recognized entity that poses an important therapeutic challenge. Although corticosteroids are widely used in drug-induced AIN to speed kidney function recovery and avoid chronic kidney disease, their efficacy has not been tested by randomized controlled trials. New diagnostic tests and biomarkers, as well as prospective therapeutic studies are needed to improve AIN diagnosis and management.

### Acute interstitial nephritis [^111Lhs4v]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) represents a frequent cause of acute kidney injury, accounting for 15–27% of renal biopsies performed because of this condition. By and large, drug-induced AIN is currently the commonest etiology of AIN, with antimicrobials and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs being the most frequent offending agents. Pathogenesis is based on an immunologic reaction against endogenous nephritogenic antigens or exogenous antigens processed by tubular cells, with cell-mediated immunity having a major pathogenic role. The characteristic interstitial infiltrates, mostly composed of lymphocytes, macrophages, eosinophils, and plasma cells, experience a rapid transformation into areas of interstitial fibrosis. A significant proportion of AIN has nowadays an oligosymptomatic presentation, although the presence of specific extrarenal symptoms such as fever, skin rash, arthralgias, and peripheral eosinophilia has an important role to orientate clinical diagnosis. Identification and removal of the offending drug are the mainstay of the treatment, but recent studies strongly suggest that early steroid administration (within 7 days after diagnosis) improves the recovery of renal function, decreasing the risk of chronic renal impairment. Delayed steroid treatment, when interstitial fibrosis has taken place, would have a less pronounced or nule therapeutic benefit.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for acute interstitial nephritis, more specifically with respect to kidney biopsy, AAFP 2003 guidelines recommend to consider implementing a trial of supportive management in patients in whom the diagnosis seems likely, for whom a probable precipitating drug can be easily withdrawn, or who improve readily after withdrawal of a potentially offending drug.

### Drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis [^113MX1VA]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2010). Medium credibility.

Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) is a common cause of acute kidney injury. Many etiologies of AIN have been recognized — including allergic/drug-induced, infectious, autoimmune/systemic, and idiopathic forms of disease. The most common etiology of AIN is drug-induced disease, which is thought to underlie 60–70% of cases. Multiple agents from many different classes of drugs can cause AIN, and the clinical presentation and laboratory findings vary according to the class of drug involved. AIN is characterized by interstitial inflammation, tubulitis, edema, and in some cases, eventual interstitial fibrosis. A definitive diagnosis of AIN can be established only by kidney biopsy. Noninvasive tests such as (67)gallium scintigraphy and testing for eosinophiluria have limited diagnostic utility. The mainstay of therapy for drug-induced AIN is timely discontinuation of the causative agent. Although the benefits of corticosteroid therapy remain unproven, they do appear to have a positive effect in some patients with drug-induced AIN, especially when treatment is initiated early in the course of the disease. In general, the prognosis for drug-induced AIN is good, and at least partial recovery of kidney function is normally observed. Early recognition is crucial because patients can ultimately develop chronic kidney disease.

### Management of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis [^1177v4KB]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN) is an important cause of acute kidney injury and acute kidney disease globally and is characterized by immune cell infiltration into the renal tubulointerstitium, causing inflammation, tubular injury, and ultimately fibrosis. Drug-induced hypersensitivity is the most common cause (> 70%); however, infections and systemic autoimmune conditions are additional triggers, with a small percentage having idiopathic ATIN. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion as there can be significant clinical and laboratory overlaps between the various types of ATIN and other etiologies of acute kidney injury. Oligosymptomatic acute kidney injury with a lack of urinary findings is a common presentation, adding to the diagnostic challenge. Kidney biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis. Management of ATIN focuses on promptly identifying and addressing the underlying trigger. Given that injury is primarily immune-mediated, immunosuppressive therapy has been explored extensively in the treatment of noninfectious ATIN; however, robust randomized controlled trials are lacking to guide specific treatments. With cessation of the immune trigger and prompt treatment initiation, ATIN generally has a favorable renal prognosis. However, delay in diagnosis or increased exposure to the culprit agent can result in irreversible interstitial fibrosis and CKD.

### Diagnosis and management of acute interstitial nephritis [^112r1bGv]. American Family Physician (2003). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute interstitial nephritis, more specifically with respect to laboratory investigations, AAFP 2003 guidelines recommend to basic laboratory investigations (urinalysis and microscopy, serum chemistry profile, CBC, LFTs) may provide evidence suggestive of AIN and help guide conservative management or empiric treatment with steroids. Unfortunately, none of these tests have sufficient predictive value to be diagnostically reliable.

Background

Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) is a recognized cause of reversible acute renal failure characterized by the presence of an interstitial inflammatory cell infiltrate.

Methods

In order to evaluate the clinical characteristics and management of this disorder, we performed a retrospective study of all cases of AIN found by reviewing 2598 native renal biopsies received at our institution over a 12 year period. Presenting clinical, laboratory and histological features were identified, as was clinical outcome with specific regard to corticosteroid therapy response.

Results

AIN was found in 2.6% of native biopsies, and 10.3% of all biopsies performed in the setting of acute renal failure during the period analysed (n = 60). The incidence of AIN increased progressively over the period observed from 1 to 4% per annum. AIN was drug related in 92% of cases and appeared to be idiopathic in the remainder. The presenting symptoms included oliguria (51%), arthralgia (45%), fever (30%), rash (21%) and loin pain (21%). Median serum creatinine at presentation was 670 micromol/l [interquartile range (IQR) 431–1031] and 58% of cases required acute renal replacement therapy. Corticosteroid therapy was administered in 60% of cases. Serum creatinine at baseline was similar in the corticosteroid-treated and conservatively managed groups; 700 micromol/l (IQR 449–1031) vs 545 micromol/l (IQR 339–1110) P = 0.4. In this, the largest retrospective series to date, we did not detect a statistically significant difference in outcome, as determined by serum creatinine, between those patients who received corticosteroid therapy and those who did not, at 1, 6 and 12 months following presentation.

Conclusion

The results of this study do not support the routine administration of corticosteroid therapy in the management of AIN.

### Diagnosis and management of acute interstitial nephritis [^111TYJUR]. American Family Physician (2003). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for acute interstitial nephritis, more specifically with respect to kidney biopsy, AAFP 2003 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining a renal biopsy in patients who do not improve following withdrawal of the likely precipitating medications, who have no contraindications to renal biopsy, and who are being considered for steroid therapy.

### Clinical tools for the diagnosis of acute tubulointerstitial disease [^115WBeXc]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN) is a common cause of acute kidney injury (AKI), occurring in up to a quarter of kidney biopsies performed for AKI. ATIN can lead to chronic kidney disease if not promptly diagnosed and managed. The most common cause is drugs, with antibiotics being the most commonly reported cause. Widespread use of proton pump inhibitors and increasing use of immuno-oncotherapy, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, are contributing to increased incidence of ATIN. However, there are diagnostic challenges. The time of onset of AKI in ATIN is variable, and diagnosis is often delayed due to a lack of specific symptoms or clinical findings. No standard diagnostic criteria exist even for histological diagnosis despite kidney biopsy being the gold standard. Additionally, there are no available tools to distinguish between different causes of ATIN, particularly when multiple etiologies are suspected, and to identify those who will benefit from treatment at diagnosis. Particularly with oncotherapy-associated AKI, where discontinuing the drug portends detrimental effects on the patient, diagnostic tools with high accuracy for distinguishing ATIN from other types of AKI are paramount. Herein, we discuss the current evidence on the diagnosis of ATIN with a focus on available clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings.

### The treatment of acute interstitial nephritis: more data at last [^117Mq5VN]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) is an uncommon form of acute renal failure that is usually medication related. Although the clinical features and renal histopathology are well recognized, therapy beyond discontinuing the offending drug has been a challenge. The use of corticosteroids, although supported by numerous small retrospective studies and anecdotal case reports, has been controversial. The study by González et al., although it has limitations, provides solid support for the early use of corticosteroids in the treatment of drug-related AIN.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute interstitial nephritis, more specifically with respect to renal ultrasound, AAFP 2003 guidelines recommend to renal ultrasound may demonstrate kidneys that are normal to enlarged in size, with increased cortical echogenicity, but there are no ultrasonographic findings that will reliably confirm or exclude AIN versus other causes of acute renal failure.

### Prognosis and outcomes of acute and chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis [^112PzxsM]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) is a rare heterogenous kidney disease and outcomes depend upon many factors including patient characteristics, clinical presentation and histopathological features on kidney biopsy. When considering short-term kidney outcomes, about 20% of adult patients with acute TIN will require dialysis, although many will fully or partially recover without need for maintenance kidney replacement therapy. However, current evidence suggests that long-term kidney outcomes of patients with TIN are far less favorable than originally thought. Risk factors for adverse kidney outcomes include patient characteristics (e.g., older age, hypertension), a higher degree of proteinuria, recurrent acute TIN episodes and signs of disease chronicity or granulomatous interstitial nephritis on kidney biopsy. Pediatric patients have a better long-term prognosis, although a significant proportion of patients will develop CKD as well. In general, drug-induced acute TIN has a better prognosis when compared with autoimmune etiologies, particularly if the inciting drug is discontinued early in the disease course and re-exposure is avoided. Autoimmune etiologies frequently cause CKD, partially because they are associated with recurrent acute TIN episodes. In this review, we summarize the available data regarding prognosis and outcomes of acute and chronic TIN for various etiologies of TIN.

Tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) is the second most common cause of acute intrinsic kidney injury after acute tubular necrosis. Although drug-induced forms of TIN represent the vast majority, rheumatic disease is another common cause and often underdiagnosed. Early diagnosis of acute interstitial nephritis and prompt withdrawal of the culprit medication or a correct treatment can avoid chronic damage and progressive chronic kidney disease. This review highlights the recent updates, clinical features, and treatment in TIN in autoimmune rheumatic disease.

### Acute drug-induced tubulointerstitial nephritis: current perspectives on diagnosis and treatment [^113cCBXR]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN) is one of the leading causes of acute kidney injury (AKI), accounting for approximately 15–27% of biopsy-proven cases of AKI. While some patients recover kidney function with timely intervention, a subset of patients may progress to chronic kidney disease and around one-third of the patients will require chronic dialysis. Drug-induced ATIN is the most common form and is often associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, and proton pump inhibitors. Infections, autoimmune disorders, such as Sjögren's syndrome and sarcoidosis contribute to a smaller proportion of cases. Clinically, ATIN presents with a wide spectrum of symptoms ranging from asymptomatic AKI to systemic manifestations such as fever, rash, arthralgia, and eosinophilia. Urinalysis often reveals sterile pyuria, hematuria, and occasionally, white blood cell casts. Proteinuria is typically mild (< 1.5 g/24 hours. Definitive diagnosis requires kidney biopsy, which reveals the presence of an extensive interstitial infiltrate, mainly composed of lymphocytes and monocytes, along with interstitial edema, and varying degrees of tubular injury. Early identification and management are critical to prevent irreversible kidney damage. So far, the optimal treatment of this entity is not yet well characterized but treatment strategies for ATIN must focus on prompt discontinuing the offending agent, supportive care, and corticosteroid therapy.

Discussion and Conclusions

Drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis (DI-AIN) represents a significant cause of acute kidney injury. It is characterized by inflammation and scarring that is confined largely to the tubular and interstitial compartments with sparing of the glomeruli and the vasculature. The infiltrates are largely composed of T cells, together with some macrophages, plasma cells and eosinophils. Antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most frequently implicated agents, but the list of drugs that can induce a DI-AIN is continuously increasing. The mechanism of injury is postulated to involve cell mediated immunity and the syndrome is often associated with extrarenal manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as rash, fever and eosinophilia. But recent studies document that the full hypersensitivity triad is not often present and suspicion of AIN should still arise if any of these features is present in patients with renal failure on suspect medications. Renal manifestations develop within three weeks after starting the inciting drug in about 80% of patients, with an average delay of about ten days. The clinical presentation most suggestive of the diagnosis is that of a sudden impairment of renal function associated with mild proteinuria and abnormal urine analysis in a patient with flank pain, normal blood pressure and no edema. Nevertheless, such a clinical picture is observed in less than one -fourth of cases.

Analysis of published cases of AIN induced by drugs other than methicillin show that nowadays the course of AIN is far from always being benign, and that serum creatinine level remains elevated in about 40% of patients. Bad prognostic indicators are the duration of renal failure (> 3 weeks), age and the degree of interstitial fibrosis. According to some reports interstitial fibrosis can begin occurring in AIN as soon as 10 to 14 days after disease induction.

Despite the above data, the optimal therapy of AIN remains to be defined. A general agreement exists about the discontinuation of the offending drug as the first therapeutic step in patients with DI-AIN, but controversy persists about the role of steroids in the treatment of DI-AIN. Whereas some studies have reported a more rapid and complete recovery of baseline renal function in those patients treated with steroids, others have failed to confirm these results. A recently published multicenter retrospective study involving 61 patients, suggested a beneficial influence of corticosteroids on the outcome of drug-induced AIN. An earlier onset of use (13 versus 34 days) was associated with a better recovery of renal function.

### Diagnosis and management of acute interstitial nephritis [^111n8daF]. American Family Physician (2003). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute interstitial nephritis, more specifically with respect to immunosuppressive therapy, AAFP 2003 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to make a recommendation regarding the use of corticosteroids in treatment of AIN. If steroid therapy is started, a reasonable dosage is prednisone, 1 mg per kg per day PO (or equivalent intravenous dose) for two to three weeks, followed by a gradually tapering dose over three to four weeks. In patients who do not respond to corticosteroids within two to three weeks, treatment with cyclophosphamide can be considered.

### Tubulointerstitial nephritis [^116SM7rC]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) is a cause of acute kidney injury in children characterized histologically by an inflammatory cell infiltrate in the kidney interstitium. The most common causes of TIN in children include medications, infections, inflammatory disorders, and genetic conditions. TIN typically presents with nonoliguric acute kidney injury and may be associated with systemic symptoms, including fever, rash, and eosinophilia. The long-term prognosis is generally favorable, with full kidney recovery; however, some patients may develop progressive chronic kidney disease. Immunosuppressive therapy may be indicated for severe or prolonged disease.

### Diagnosis and management of acute interstitial nephritis [^116YiZrt]. American Family Physician (2003). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute interstitial nephritis, more specifically with respect to supportive care measures, AAFP 2003 guidelines recommend to provide standard supportive care interventions in patients with AIN, such as:

- fluid and electrolyte management

- avoiding volume depletion or overload

- symptomatic relief for fever and rash

- avoiding use of nephrotoxic drugs

- avoiding use of drugs that impair renal blood flow

- adjusting drug dosages for existing level of renal function.

### Tubulointerstitial nephritis: diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring [^115Zyfkp]. Pediatric Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute interstitial nephritis:

- Definition: AIN is an acute disease characterized by the presence of inflammatory infiltrates and edema within the interstitium that is associated with a decline in renal function.
- Pathophysiology: AIN is mostly caused by drugs (> 75%) such as NSAIDs, allopurinol, acyclovir, furosemide, famotidine, omeprazole, phenytoin; infections (5–10%) such as viruses (HIV, CMV, EBV), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycoplasma, Rickettsia, Toxoplasma, Leptospira, Schistosoma; idiopathic (5–10%) such as tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome; and associated with systemic diseases (10–15%) such as sarcoidosis, Sjogren's syndrome and SLE.
- Disease course: The delayed hypersensitivity immune reactions to foreign antigens result in AIN, which leads to the clinical features of AKI, acute renal failure requiring dialysis, arthralgias, fever, skin rash, and gross hematuria.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: AIN is not associated with an increase in mortality.

### Diagnosis and management of immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated nephrotoxicity: a position statement from the American society of onco-nephrology [^112Prcv9]. Kidney International (2025). Medium credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the treatment of cancer and are now the backbone of therapy for several malignancies. However, ICIs can cause a spectrum of kidney immune-related adverse events including acute kidney injury (AKI), most commonly manifesting as acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), although glomerular disease and electrolyte disturbances have also been reported. In this position statement by the American Society of Onco-nephrology (ASON), we summarize the incidence and risk factors for ICI-AKI, pathophysiological mechanisms, and clinicopathologic features of ICI-AKI. We also discuss novel diagnostic approaches and promising biomarkers for ICI-AKI. From expert panel consensus, we provide clinical practice points for the initial assessment and diagnosis of ICI-AKI, management and immunosuppressive therapy, and consideration for rechallenge with ICI following AKI episodes. In addition, we explore ICI use in special populations, such as kidney transplant recipients, and propose key areas of focus for future research and clinical investigation.

Kidney injury during HIV infection encompasses a wide variety of disorders, including acute interstitial nephritis. We report a case of acute granulomatous interstitial nephritis related to a mycobacterial-triggered immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in an HIV-infected patient. IRIS is an emerging health concern during HIV infection and should be considered in the diagnostic frame of acute renal failure during immune restoration.

### Diagnosis and management of immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated acute kidney injury [^111Jiiys]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2022). High credibility.

Since their introduction into clinical practice a decade ago, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have had an overwhelming impact on cancer treatment. Use of these agents in oncology continues to grow; however, the increased use of these agents has been associated with a parallel increase in ICI-associated immune-related adverse events, which can affect virtually any organ, including the kidneys. ICI-associated acute kidney injury (ICI-AKI) occurs in 2–5% of patients treated with ICIs. Its occurrence can have important consequences, including the temporary or permanent discontinuation of ICIs or other concomitant anticancer therapies and the need for prolonged treatment with corticosteroids. Various mechanisms have been proposed to underlie the development of ICI-AKI, including loss of tolerance to self-antigens, reactivation of drug-specific effector T cells, and the production of kidney-specific autoantibodies. ICI-AKI most commonly manifests as acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis on kidney biopsy and generally shows a favourable response to early initiation of corticosteroids, with complete or partial remission achieved in most patients. The evaluation of patients with suspected ICI-AKI requires careful diagnostic work-up and kidney biopsy for patients with moderate-to-severe ICI-AKI to ensure accurate diagnosis and inform appropriate treatment.

### A case report of acute interstitial nephritis caused by cotton phenol [^117PfrQS]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Cotton phenol can also cause toxic effects in animals, mainly through the Browning or Meladic reaction with amino acids, which reduces the absorption and utilisation of amino acids, or by interfering with the activity of enzymes in the electron transport chain of mitochondria (especially dehydrogenases and oxidoreductases) or by directly damaging the mitochondrial membrane. It also affects the mitochondrial membrane potential, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, thus affecting cellular energy metabolism and inducing toxicity. Cotton phenol can also lead to a decrease in the number of leukocytes and major lymphocytes, thus affecting immunity. Cotton phenol has been reported to cause toxicity in a variety of animals such as cattle, sheep, pigs, dogs and chickens, which may result in congestion and oedema of internal organs, liver and kidney damage, or cardiac damage.

AIN is an AKI characterised by acute inflammation and oedema of the renal interstitium, accompanied by acute tubular dysfunction. Clinical diagnosis of AIN can usually be made on the basis of the typical history, clinical manifestations and laboratory tests, but renal puncture biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis. The usual treatments for AIN are: (1) removal of causative factors, such as, stopping related drugs, and treating primary infection; (2) systemic supportive therapy; and (3) immunosuppressive therapy, including glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive drugs. Timely diagnosis and treatment can avoid disease progression, and some patients can fully recover renal function, whereas others may progress to chronic kidney disease. In conclusion, the causative factors, disease duration, degree of renal function impairment, degree of interstitial fibrosis, and the timeliness and appropriateness of the treatment all affect the prognosis of AIN.

### AKI in an HIV patient [^1113WtuY]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

The renal manifestations of patients infected with HIV are diverse. Patients may have podocytopathies ranging from a minimal-change-type lesions to FSGS or collapsing glomerulopathy. Furthermore, such patients produce a variety of autoantibodies without clinical signs of the disease. Antiretroviral drugs also cause renal injury, including crystals and tubular injury, acute interstitial nephritis, or mitochondrial toxicity. In these circumstances, it is essential to perform a renal biopsy for diagnosis and to guide treatment. Here we describe a patient with HIV who presented with AKI and hematuria without concomitant systemic manifestations. Renal biopsy elucidated the cause of acute deterioration of kidney function.

### Aetiology of acute / subacute nephritic syndrome: results from kidney biopsy registries in Japan and Europe [^112bSase]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The combination of hematuria, proteinuria and a reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in patients with no previous diagnosis of chronic kidney disease is widely considered a strong indication for kidney biopsy. This study aimed to compare the frequencies of diseases leading to this symptom constellation, and to explore differences related to age and sex using data from kidney biopsy registries in Europe and Japan.

Methods

Data were retrieved from national or regional kidney biopsy registries in Japan, Sweden, Norway, Scotland, Austria, Croatia and Turkey from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2019. Patients were included if the indication for kidney biopsy was acute/subacute nephritic syndrome, which was defined as a combination of hematuria, proteinuria and reduced GFR in a patient without a prior diagnosis of chronic kidney disease. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected at the time of kidney biopsy.

Results

A total of 1023 patients from Europe and 2477 from Japan were included in the study. The primary cause of acute/subacute nephritic syndrome in both regions was ANCA-associated vasculitis, followed by IgA nephropathy/vasculitis and acute interstitial nephritis. The estimated GFR was higher in Europe than in Japan, at 24 and 20 ml/min/1,73 m2, respectively. The median age was 10 years younger in European patients than in Japanese patients.

Conclusions

The most common underlying causes of acute/subacute nephritic syndrome are ANCA-associated vasculitis, IgA nephropathy/vasculitis and acute interstitial nephritis. This study highlights both similarities and differences in the spectrum of underlying diagnoses and clinical presentations across ages, sexes, and geographical regions in patients presenting with acute/subacute nephritic syndrome.

### The increasing rates of acute interstitial nephritis in Australia: a single centre case series [^113eWY5i]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

In addition to the sample size issues already discussed, other factors should be taken into consideration when interpreting the present results. Being a single center study it is possible that our findings are not representative of national trends. Further investigations across multiples centers nationally are necessary in order to obtain a representative Australian sample. Patients with mild AKI or a typical presentation of AIN may not have undergone renal biopsy and thus may be underrepresented in our findings. By only reviewing patients who have biopsy proven AIN we include only a small fraction of those who are clinically diagnosed with AIN, as those with less severe AKI do not generally proceed to renal biopsy. The complement of nephrologists changed over the course of the study and the decision to undertake a renal biopsy was not standardized. Referring patterns from other specialists and clinics may have changed over the course of the study and could have contributed to an increase in the incidence of AIN. And lastly, our study excluded patients with pyelonephritis. Because of this, we were unable to compare rates of AIN to those of acute pyelonephritis and thus our findings cannot rule out the possibility that the increase in acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis reported by the AIHW was due to increased rates of both acute pyelonephritis and AIN. Further investigations are required to adjudicate this possibility.

### From sting to STING: role of inflammation in wasp sting induced AKI-a narrative review [^112U8kpW]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple wasp stings are a serious problem in the remote mountains of East, South, and Southeast Asia, and pose a significant threat to human health. Wasp populations are rising due to global climate change, with reports of stings now emerging in America and Europe. The wasp venom contains a wide variety of biologically active constituents, including proteins (antigen 5), enzymes (hyaluronidase and phospholipase A), bioactive peptides (mastoparan and wasp kinin), and amines (histamine). As a highly vascularized and excretory organ, the kidney is susceptible to the detrimental effects of wasp venom and/or pathogenic factors secondary to the wasp sting. Mastoparan and phospholipase A in wasp venom not only directly act on renal tubule epithelial cell membranes and cause renal damage, but also contribute to the rhabdomyolysis by attacking the muscle cell membrane and disrupting its integrity. The roles of wasp venom in kidney injury have already been elaborated in our previous review and are not within the scope of this article. The earliest clinical study on wasp stings by Xie et al. demonstrated that acute kidney injury (AKI) was a prominent clinical manifestation of wasp stings. Subsequent studies reported that the incidence of AKI after wasp stings was 30–50%. Further studies have indicated that AKI is an independent risk factor for death in patients stung by wasps. A few clinical studies have indicated that acute tubular necrosis is a typical pathological manifestation in patients with wasp sting-induced AKI. A small number of patients have acute interstitial nephritis as pathological changes in kidney due to anaphylactic response. In recent years, more attention has been focused on AKI caused by wasp stings, and related studies are rapidly increasing, ranging from clinical retrospective studies and case reports on clinical manifestations to basic research (animal and cellular experiments) on pathogenesis. The pathogenesis of AKI induced by wasp stings is currently being explored further.

### Biopsy-proven acute interstitial nephritis, 1993–2011: a case series [^1157Gx1c]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) is an important cause of acute kidney injury, especially in hospitalized patients. The cause and outcome of AIN, particularly that due to drugs, is changing with prevalent medication use. The effectiveness of steroids for treatment of AIN is debated.

Study Design

Case series.

Setting & Participants

133 patients with biopsy-proven AIN from 1993 through 2011 at a single center.

Outcomes

Recovery of kidney function by 6 months, either complete, partial, or none. Complete recovery was defined as improvement in serum creatinine level to within 25% of baseline (or < 1.4 mg/dL), and partial recovery, as a ≥ 50% decrease in serum creatinine level from its peak value but not reaching within 25% of its baseline value.

Results

Causes of AIN included drugs (70%), autoimmune diseases (20%), and infections (4%). Drug-induced AIN was due to antibiotics in 49%, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in 14%, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in 11%. Overall, the top 3 drug causes were omeprazole (12%), amoxicillin (8%), and ciprofloxacin (8%). Patients with drug-induced compared to non-drug-induced AIN were older and had higher baseline kidney function, but more severe acute kidney injury. Patients with PPI-induced AIN were older, were less symptomatic, and had longer durations of drug exposure and longer delays in getting kidney biopsy and steroids than for antibiotic-induced or NSAID-induced AIN. At 6 months postbiopsy, 49% of patients with drug-induced AIN treated with steroids achieved complete recovery; 39%, partial recovery; and 12%, no recovery. Correlates of poor recovery included a longer duration of drug exposure (15 vs 30 vs 130 days for complete, partial, and no recovery, respectively; P = 0.04) and longer delay in starting steroid therapy (8 vs 11 vs 35 days, respectively; P = 0.05).

Limitations

Retrospective study, selection bias in patients who had kidney biopsy, single-center experience.

Conclusions

The cause of AIN may be shifting; PPIs are emerging as an important contributor to this disease. Delays in discontinuation of the culprit drug and in initiating steroid treatment adversely affect recovery of kidney function.

### Lupus nephritis: clinical presentations and outcomes in the 21st century [^113vxBjZ]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The kidney is often affected in SLE and the impairment of renal function results from glomerular, tubule-interstitial and vascular lesions. LN occurs in about 40% of SLE patients, mostly within 5 years from the diagnosis, and still presents a rate of progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD) of 4.3–10.1%. Renal failure, along with infections, cancer and cardiovascular events, is one of the most common causes of death in SLE patients. The incidence of LN varies with ethnicity and the spectrum of clinical presentation ranges from silent urinary abnormalities to highly symptomatic cases of nephritic syndrome or rapidly progressive renal insufficiency.

Overview on clinical manifestations

Clinical presentation may be silent with urinalysis, renal function and 24 h-proteinuria within the normal range. Otherwise, LN can be characterized by urinary abnormalities, e.g. haematuria, leukocyturia, cellular casts and mild proteinuria or more overt presentations including nephrotic syndrome or acute nephritic syndrome or rapidly progressive renal failure.

An Italian study evaluating a cohort of 499 LN patients from 1970 to 2016 recently reported significant changes in demographic distribution, clinical presentation and laboratory abnormalities in LN during the past 45 years. The number of male patients and the age at LN diagnosis progressively increased along the decades with concomitant evidence of later onset of LN during the course of SLE. Over the years, clinical presentation became milder with a significant decrease in nephritic syndrome and rapidly progressive forms, a decrease in serum creatinine values and an increase in isolated urinary abnormalities, likely due to an earlier SLE diagnosis and to the identification of LN as soon as it appears during the follow-up, thereby highlighting the importance of a regular assessment of renal function, 24 h-proteinuria and urinary sediment in all SLE patients.

### The increasing rates of acute interstitial nephritis in Australia: a single centre case series [^116zJaG6]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) is an immune mediated condition that is characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate in the kidney interstitium and is a well-recognized cause of acute kidney injury (AKI). The incidence of AIN is increasing worldwide and previous studies have ascribed this to a surge in drug induced AIN in elderly patients. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) recently released their first national report into acute kidney injury. That snapshot reviewed hospital ICD-10 coding to assess the causes and incidence of AKI over the last 15 years in Australia. Surprisingly, this showed that since 2008 there has been a significant increase in the incidence of acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis (the ICD-10 code for both AIN and acute pyelonephritis) in women less than 55 years of age with acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis now representing the most common cause of hospitalization from AKI in women in this age group. An increased risk of AIN in younger women has not been previously reported and the Australian experience is an emerging phenomenon at odds with previous findings of increasing rates of AIN in elderly patients.

Before these conclusions can be made, however, several limitations in the AIHW report must be addressed by further research. Specifically, ICD-10 coding is imprecise, with AIN and pyelonephritis included as one ICD-10 code. As such the AIHW report is unable to determine which of these two entities is increasing. A case series of patients with biopsy-confirmed AIN would provide preliminary evidence to investigate if the new trends reported by the AIHW are being driven by increasing rates of AIN in younger women. Furthermore, while the AIHW report recorded patient age and gender it was not able to record other key patient factors, such as the causes of acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis, which might underlie their reported trend.

The present study seeks to address the limitations of the AIWH report by examining a cohort of patients with biopsy confirmed AIN in a single center to explore (a) whether there has been an increase in the rates of AIN and when this change began, (b) whether there was a disproportionate rise in AIN in younger women and (c) the causes, characteristics and outcomes of patients with AIN.

### Mortality after acute kidney injury and acute interstitial nephritis in patients prescribed immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy [^115uFzTL]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we noted that the occurrence of AKI was independently associated with lower survival of patients treated with ICI, particularly in the first 120 days of its occurrence. However, among patients with AKI, those with AIN had higher survival than those without AIN indicating that this IrAE may be a marker of therapeutic response to ICI. Future studies could consider further phenotyping AKI cases using biomarkers and biopsy data to better understand the relationship of various etiologies of ICI-associated AKI with mortality.

### Granulomatous interstitial nephritis in a patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection [^117WwSuo]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) associated with severe coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is common and is a significant predictor of morbidity and mortality, especially when dialysis is required. Case reports and autopsy series have revealed that most patients with COVID-19 – associated acute kidney injury have evidence of acute tubular injury and necrosis - not unexpected in critically ill patients. Others have been found to have collapsing glomerulopathy, thrombotic microangiopathy and diverse underlying kidney diseases. A primary kidney pathology related to COVID-19 has not yet emerged. Thus far direct infection of the kidney, or its impact on clinical disease remains controversial. The management of AKI is currently supportive.

Case Presentation

The patient presented here was positive for SARS-CoV-2, had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure. Within days of admission to the intensive care unit he developed oliguric acute kidney failure requiring dialysis. Acute kidney injury developed in the setting of hemodynamic instability, sepsis and a maculopapular rash. Over the ensuing days the patient also developed transfusion-requiring severe hemolysis which was Coombs negative. Schistocytes were present on the peripheral smear. Given the broad differential diagnoses for acute kidney injury, a kidney biopsy was performed and revealed granulomatous tubulo-interstitial nephritis with some acute tubular injury. Based on the biopsy findings, a decision was taken to adjust medications and initiate corticosteroids for presumed medication-induced interstitial nephritis, hemolysis and maculo-papular rash. The kidney function and hemolysis improved over the subsequent days and the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility, no-longer required dialysis.

Conclusions

Acute kidney injury in patients with severe COVID-19 may have multiple causes. We present the first case of granulomatous interstitial nephritis in a patient with COVID-19. Drug-reactions may be more frequent than currently recognized in COVID-19 and are potentially reversible. The kidney biopsy findings in this case led to a change in therapy, which was associated with subsequent patient improvement. Kidney biopsy may therefore have significant value in pulling together a clinical diagnosis, and may impact outcome if a treatable cause is identified.

### Positron emission tomography as an adjuvant diagnostic test in the evaluation of checkpoint inhibitor-associated acute interstitial nephritis [^114Et4qd]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute interstitial nephritis is an immune-related adverse event that can occur in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Differentiating checkpoint inhibitor-associated acute interstitial nephritis from other causes of acute kidney injury in patients with cancer is challenging and can lead to diagnostic delays and/or unwarranted immunosuppression. In this case report, we assess the use of 18 F-flourodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography imaging as an alternative diagnostic modality in the evaluation of potential acute interstitial nephritis.

Case Presentation

A 55-year-old woman with metastatic vulvar melanoma underwent treatment with two cycles of ipilimumab plus nivolumab, followed by seven cycles of nivolumab combined with radiation therapy. During her treatment, she developed non-oliguric acute kidney injury to a creatinine of 4.5mg/dL from a baseline of 0.5mg/dL. A clinical diagnosis of acute interstitial nephritis was made, and steroids were initiated, with rapid improvement of her acute kidney injury. Retrospectively, four positron-emission tomography scans obtained for cancer staging purposes were reviewed. We found a markedly increased 18 F-flourodeoxyglucose uptake in the renal cortex at the time acute interstitial nephritis was diagnosed compared to baseline. In three cases of acute kidney injury due to alternative causes there was no increase in 18 F-flourodeoxyglucose uptake from baseline.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, this is the first report describing increased 18 F-flourodeoxyglucose uptake in the renal cortex in a patient with checkpoint inhibitor-associated acute interstitial nephritis. Our findings suggest that 18 F-flourodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography may be a valuable test for diagnosing immune-mediated nephritis, particularly in patients where timely kidney biopsy is not feasible.

### A case report of acute interstitial nephritis caused by cotton phenol [^115JmMk5]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) is a tubulointerstitial renal disease characterised by acute inflammation and oedema of the renal interstitium, accompanied by impairment of renal tubular function. It is also known as acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis. The term AIN was first proposed by Councilman in 1898 during the autopsy of a group of patients with diphtheria and scarlet fever. The incidence of AIN varies considerably between different countries and regions. A review of the literature on renal biopsy cases indicates that AIN accounts for 1–2% of cases in many countries. In patients who have had renal biopsies for acute kidney injury(AKI), AIN accounts for 15–27% of cases. The most common causes of AIN can be categorised into four groups: exogenous compounds such as drugs, infections, autoimmune disorders, and idiopathic causes (Table 1), with drugs being the most prevalent. All causes of AIN may present with nonspecific signs and symptoms of acute renal insufficiency, including acute or subacute nausea, vomiting, discomfort, oliguria and haematuria.

We present a case of severe AKI triggered by exposure to cotton phenol. Percutaneous nephron puncture biopsy confirmed that the patient's renal failure was caused by AIN. The objective of this case report is to emphasise the role of cotton phenol as a rare cause of AIN. Through in-depth analysis of this case, we aim to enhance the understanding of AIN and provide guidance for the diagnosis and management of similar cases in the future.

### Biopsy proven acute interstitial nephritis after treatment with moxifloxacin [^1148detL]. BMC Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Both cases illustrate that moxifloxacin induced AIN represents a reversible cause of acute kidney injury. Of note, the classical clinical features were absent in our patient and his renal function recovered fully despite dialysis dependency at presentation. Notably, in the other reported case, where diagnosis was made 10 days and treatment with corticosteroids was initiated only two weeks after the onset of symptoms, the restoration of renal function was delayed and residual proteinuria persisted. Therefore increased vigilance is required to identify the emergence of new toxic compounds and early renal biopsy is recommended in cases of acute kidney injury in patients taking moxifloxacin. The early use of corticosteroids should be considered in patients with moxifloxacin induced AIN.

### Mortality after acute kidney injury and acute interstitial nephritis in patients prescribed immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy [^1131q9ca]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

It is not clear if the occurrence of ICI-associated AKI has any impact on long-term outcomes. Occurrence of AKI could lead to premature discontinuation of life-saving ICI therapy and unnecessary immune suppression if incorrectly diagnosed. AKI from ATI or prerenal azotemia also occurs as a result of the overall disease burden and is associated with higher mortality in other settings. On the other hand, several studies have suggested that the occurrence of dermatologic, endocrinologic, and low-grade IrAEs indicates ICI effectiveness and is associated with improvements in patient outcomes. Thus, it is possible that a subset of patients with AKI who have AIN may in fact have better survival. Whether the association of AKI with mortality differs between those who experience AKI due to AIN or other causes is not known. While it is difficult to diagnose AIN without a kidney biopsy, we recently developed and externally validated a statistical model for diagnosis of AIN using data from participants with biopsy-proven AIN and controls. In this study, we test the association of model predicted AIN with mortality among participants on ICI therapy who develop AKI. We hypothesize that occurrence of AIN indicates a favorable response to ICI therapy; therefore, among patients who develop AKI while on ICI therapy, those predicted to have AIN will demonstrate greater survival compared with others with AKI.

### Lansoprazole, amoxicillin, clarithromycin [^116vgiGE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute Interstitial Nephritis

Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) has been observed in patients taking proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) including lansoprazole. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue lansoprazole if AIN develops (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including lansoprazole. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematosus cases were CLE.

The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported.

Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving Lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets, discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in 4 to 12 weeks. Serological testing (e.g. ANA) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations

### BK virus nephritis after renal transplantation [^116QbdPi]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

BK viremia and nephritis are increasing problems in renal transplant recipients. The exact cause of the increasing prevalence of this condition remains poorly understood. Increasing prevalence has been correlated with newer immunosuppressive agents and the decline in acute rejection rates in recent years. The clinical manifestation varies from the asymptomatic state of viremia and nephritis to clinical renal dysfunction. The diagnosis of this infection is based on the combination of the presence of urinary decoy cells, virus in the urine/blood, and typical renal histological findings of interstitial nephritis. Routine post-transplant screening for BK viremia and viruria prior to the occurrence of nephritis and the reduction in immunosuppressive therapy for subjects with viremia appear to be attractive approaches. The treatment of BKV nephritis (BKVN) consists of reduction in immunosuppressive therapy and antiviral therapy with cidofovir or leflunomide or a combination of both. Approximately 30–60% of subjects with BKVN experienced irreversible graft failure. However, in recent years, the combinations of early detection, prompt diagnosis, and appropriate reduction in immunosuppressive therapy have been associated with better outcome. The pathogenesis of BK virus infection in renal transplant recipients needs to be explored. The source of BKV infection (donor as opposed to recipient), the role of host humoral, and cellular immunity to BKV, and the role of alloimmune activation in renal graft to the occurrence of nephritis are discussed in this review.

### Acute interstitial nephritis related to immune checkpoint inhibitors [^113d7LGU]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

When comparing ICI themselves, there was no evidence for a ICI-specific clinical pattern. Case 3 (Ipilimumab) showed more extra renal signs and a chronic pattern of interstitial inflammation but the epidemiological data are still lacking to distinguish specific adverse events between nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and ipilimumab.

Renal disorders following ICI are rare. In Toulouse University Hospital, between September 2015 and April 2016, 3 cases of AKI were reported out of 233 patients receiving ICI (168 nivolumab, 45 pembrolizumab, and 20 ipilumumab), thus leading to a global incidence of 1–2%. In a recent study of 752 melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab, 120 adverse events were reported. Among them, only four involved the kidney. The time for renal disease to appear varied from 6 to 12 weeks after first exposure to ICI (i.e. after the second infusion). Case reports and a very recent series of 13 patients (totally 28 patients) mostly described acute tubulointerstitial injuries. In one patient, lupus nephritis-related nephrotic syndrome developed after two infusions of ipilimumab. One patient developed hypothyroidism or autoimmune-related rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI. One patient also developed nephrotic syndrome with minimal-change disease. Although our study includes only three cases, the number of ICI-induced renal disorders will probably increase along with the widespread use of these molecules. Moreover, because ICI are mostly given to patients along with drugs that have mild-to-moderate-related adverse events, clinicians should be aware of the risk of delayed acute tubulointerstitial nephritis.

The combined literature and our study reveal the following characteristics of ICI-related AKI. Most patients had AKI with tubulointerstitial presentation, including normal urinary output, granular casts aseptic leucocyturia, and low-grade (< 1 g per day) or no proteinuria. Microscopic hematuria is rare. Renal size was normal, but imaging (ultrasound or CT) sometimes revealed reversible bilateral swelling of the renal cortices, without dilated pyelocaliceal cavities. Renal biopsies showed interstitial infiltration of polymorphic inflammatory cells with predominant CD3+ T-cells. Tubular-cell swelling, vacuolization, focal simplification of tubules with bland casts, and regenerative changes have been previously reported. Granulomatous interstitial nephritis has also been described. The glomeruli were not modified and immunostaining for immunoglobulins and complement was negative.

### Varenicline induced acute interstitial nephritis in the setting of idiopathic membranous glomerulonephritis [^111bfccP]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, this is only the second case report to document varenicline-induced AIN and the third describing any renal injury.

In 2009, Selby et al. described a patient with CKD (baseline Cr of 124 umol/L) secondary to hypertension who presented with biopsy proven AIN (Cr 230 umol/L) seven months after initiating varenicline treatment. There were no other new medications. The patient was symptomatic with malaise and low grade fevers. A short course of prednisone therapy (60 mg for 10 days) was initiated with improvement in serum creatinine levels to slightly above baseline levels (Cr 160 umol/L) within three weeks of treatment initiation. Follow-up creatinine levels were not provided. Bird et al. also reported varenicline-induced acute renal failure in a patient with moderate renal impairment. A diagnosis of AIN was postulated and renal function improved upon cessation of the medication. Renal biopsy was not performed.

AIN represents approximately 15–27% of acute kidney failure presentations, but may be under-represented since not all patients suspected of AIN are sent for renal biopsies. AIN is characterized by inflammation of the kidney interstitium and a corresponding decline in renal function. On biopsy, interstitial infiltrates consisting of lymphocytes, macrophages and eosinophils and tubulitis are seen. AIN can be caused by medications, infections (viral, bacterial and fungal), systemic diseases (sarcoidosis, lupus erythematosus) or be idiopathic in nature. Of all these causes, drug-induced AIN is the most common, accounting for up to 75% of all documented cases. Drugs most known to induce AIN include certain classes of antibiotics and NSAIDs although a wide variety of other medications have also been implicated.

The clinical presentation is highly varied with the classic triad of fever, rash and eosinophilia occurring in a small minority of patients. Non-beta lactam drug induced AIN is associated with eosinophilia in fewer than 1/3 of cases and eosinophiliuria in 2/3 of cases. Thus renal biopsy is required for a definitive diagnosis. Management consists of discontinuation of the culprit medication. The role of steroids is not clear and there are no randomized controlled studies to guide therapy. In some, but not all uncontrolled reports, steroids appear to have some beneficial role. There is a suggestion that prognosis is much improved with early identification of the AIN and institution of steroid therapy.

### The pathology of tubulointerstitial kidney disease: a clinicopathologic approach to narrowing the differential diagnosis [^111XmjG4]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Tubulointerstitial kidney disease can be recognized histologically as tubulointerstitial injury that is out of proportion to glomerular or vascular pathology. While recognizable as a histologic entity, determining a more precise underlying etiology for tubulointerstitial disease can be a diagnostic challenge. This review presents a clinicopathologic approach intended to help nephrologists and pathologists narrow the clinical differential diagnosis of tubulointerstitial disease. Inflammatory tubulointerstitial disease can often be subcategorized based on the presence of specific types of inflammatory infiltrates, such as eosinophils, neutrophils or granulomas. Recognition of these inflammatory phenotypes raises and lowers some entities in the differential diagnosis. Broadly speaking, underlying causes of inflammatory tubulointerstitial disease include drug reaction, infection, and autoimmune diseases. The most common causes of acute noninflammatory tubulointerstitial disease are ischemic and toxic tubular injuries. Much of the time there is substantial overlap in the morphology of ischemic and toxic tubular injury, but there are distinctive findings in noninflammatory tubulointerstitial disease, including casts and crystals, that may allow for a more specific histologic diagnosis that maps to a narrower clinical differential diagnosis. Ultimately, understanding the root cause of tubulointerstitial disease requires careful integration of clinical history with histopathologic findings.

### Cefepime induced acute interstitial nephritis – a case report [^115qDBji]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) from acute tubular necrosis and acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) are commonly seen in clinical practice. Approximately 20% of AKI cases are caused by drug or toxins with potential increase in morbidity and permanent renal dysfunction. Nephrotoxicity due to drugs can occur by various mechanisms including changes in glomerular hemodynamics, tubular toxicity, crystal nephropathy, obstruction, thrombotic microangiopathy and acute interstitial nephritis. The majority of cases of AIN (75%) are caused by drugs with antibiotics accounting for approximately 25% of these.

Cefepime is a parenteral fourth-generation cephalosporin with an extended spectrum of antimicrobial activity that is routinely prescribed for variety of hospital acquired infections. It is considered well tolerated and is associated with few adverse reactions. Cefepime-related neurological toxicity is well described in patients with renal impairment. However with the exception of a rat model with nephrotoxicity, till date no human report of nephrotoxicity exists. PubMed search conducted with keywords- "cefepime", "nephrotoxicity", "acute interstitial nephritis", "acute kidney injury" did not reveal any case reports in literature. We believe this is the first report of such adverse event arising from its use.

### Celecoxib-induced acute interstitial nephritis [^112Ri6KG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Data about the nephrotoxicity of selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors are still evolving. Acute interstitial nephritis is a well-described complication of therapy with nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. We report a case of biopsy-proven acute interstitial nephritis in a 73-year-old diabetic woman, who had taken celecoxib for more than 1 year before presentation. She presented with clinical findings of subnephrotic proteinuria and acute renal failure that required dialysis. She recovered renal function with cessation of celecoxib therapy after 2 weeks. Other medications were reintroduced safely, without recurrence of renal failure. A kidney biopsy specimen showed acute interstitial nephritis with a prominent eosinophilic infiltrate in the interstitium. This case documents the occurrence of acute interstitial nephritis with celecoxib and emphasizes the need for continued vigilance and care in use of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors in high-risk patients.

### Acute interstitial nephritis with predominant plasmacytic infiltration in patients with HIV-1 infection [^1132mZ81]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

We describe a new form of acute interstitial nephritis with predominant plasmacytic infiltration in 2 patients with active human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection. Clinical features included acute kidney injury and proteinuria, but no sicca syndrome. Acute kidney injury was characterized by a high serum creatinine level and nephrotic syndrome with no hematuria or leukocyturia. Kidney biopsy specimens from both patients showed interstitial infiltration by mononuclear cells composed mainly of CD138(+) plasmacytes and diffuse effacement of podocyte foot processes with no deposits. In one patient with Guillain-Barré syndrome, a sural nerve biopsy showed plasmacyte infiltration and immunohistochemistry was strongly positive for HIV-1 p24 protein. In both patients, minor salivary glands and bone marrow were infiltrated by lymphocytes, consistent with B-cell activation induced by HIV-1 infection. Other common causes of acute interstitial nephritis, including B-cell lymphoma and diffuse infiltrative lymphocytosis syndrome, were actively looked for and excluded. Treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy was effective; symptoms rapidly improved, serum creatinine level decreased, and proteinuria resolved. Exclusion of other common known causes of acute interstitial nephritis and the dramatic response with highly active antiretroviral therapy suggests HIV-1 as a likely cause. The acute interstitial nephritis probably was induced by HIV-1-driven nonspecific B-cell activation. Further investigations are needed to confirm the direct pathogenic role of HIV-1.

### A nationwide nested case-control study indicates an increased risk of acute interstitial nephritis with proton pump inhibitor use [^115i8mNg]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Identification of cases and controls

We asked the Ministry to identify all patients who were potentially diagnosed with acute interstitial nephritis after cohort entry by searching the hospital discharge and mortality data using the ICD-10-AM rubrics (determined in consultation with a professional clinical coder) under which interstitial nephritis may be coded (N10, N118, N119, N12, N141, N142, and N144). As mortality information for patients who died in 2009 had not yet been coded, we searched the free text causes of death for these patients for 'interstitial nephritis'. Next, we devised an algorithm to exclude patients whose additional diagnoses indicated an infection of the kidney or urinary tract (Supplementary Tables S7 and S8 online). Finally, to verify the diagnoses of the remaining potential cases, hospital discharge letters, postmortem reports, and any renal histology reports were requested and independently reviewed by M-LB and LP who were blinded to the patients' PPI exposure status. In cases where there was some uncertainty about a patient's diagnosis (17 cases) a renal physician was consulted, and patients in whom interstitial nephritis was secondary to a systemic disease, or who were misdiagnosed, were excluded. Definite cases were patients who presented acutely with interstitial nephritis that was verified by discharge letter or death record, and renal histology. Probable cases were patients with only discharge letter or death record confirmation. The diagnosis date was taken as the index date for each case and their matched controls. We used risk set samplingfrom the study cohort to randomly select 10 controls (blinded to PPI exposure status) for each case, matched by birth year and sex; hence, controls were members of the study cohort who were at risk of developing acute interstitial nephritis on the index date.

### Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome: a review [^1144Wfgi]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Inflammation of renal interstitium and uveal tissue establishes the two components of tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome. Although believed to occur more frequently in young females, a broad spectrum of patients can be affected. Both renal and eye disease can be asymptomatic and may not manifest simultaneously, having independent progressions. Renal disease manifests as acute kidney injury and may cause permanent renal impairment. Eye inflammation can manifest in different anatomical forms, most commonly as bilateral anterior uveitis and may progress to a chronic course. TINU syndrome accounts for approximately 1%-2% of uveitis in tertiary referral centres. A literature review covering the clinical features, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment is presented.

### Acute interstitial nephritis after sequential ipilumumab-nivolumab therapy of metastatic melanoma [^115ybKoL]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The anti-Programmed Death receptor 1 (anti-PD-1) antibodies nivolumab and pembrolizumab are new treatments in metastatic melanoma. Immunotherapies are best known to be responsible for thrombotic microangiopathy. However, immune interstitial nephritis has been described in a patient treated by nivolumab and ipilimumab concomitantly, and three cases of granulomatous interstitial nephritis have been reported with ipilimumab monotherapy. We report herein a case of acute interstitial immune nephritis in a patient treated with nivolumab after ipilimumab for pulmonary metastatic melanoma.

Case Presentation

Interstitial nephritis was diagnosed after acute kidney injury following three cycles and was confirmed by kidney biopsy. Kidney injury responded rapidly to prednisolone, which was then gradually reduced. As a follow-up computed tomography scan indicated mixed response, with minimal size progression of a pulmonary nodule, but a significant reduction in the size of the other nodules, nivolumab was reintroduced after renal function improvement. Low-dose corticosteroids were first maintained during nivolumab treatment and subsequently discontinued. Only one month after prednisolone discontinuation, creatinine levels increased. A second kidney biopsy confirmed relapse of acute interstitial nephritis.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, this is the first case of nivolumab-induced acute interstitial immune nephritis. This case highlights that anti-PD-1 immunotherapy may be continued when renal function is adequate, and this requires close interaction between dermatologists and nephrologists. This adverse effect should be made known to prescribers as nivolumab is associated with significant improvement of survival in metastatic melanoma and may be used in many different types of cancer.

### P053 Interstitial nephritis from IBD: complicated conclusions [^116s65Aq]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Case

BACKGROUND: Kidney injury in IBD is challenging. Tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) is linked to aminosalicylates, but also described in drug-naïve patients, suggesting that TIN may be a direct manifestation of IBD. We describe three cases of TIN in IBD to illustrate the challenges in determining the etiology of the injury.

Cases

Case #1: 58-year-old male with a horseshoe kidney deformity, uncontrolled hypertension, GERD and small bowel stricturing Crohn's disease (CD), previously on mercaptopurine and allopurinol, subsequently transitioned to adalimumab, maintaining clinical and radiologic remission. Two years later, he developed acute kidney injury in setting of high fevers and sweats, with negative infectious evaluation. Medications included adalimumab, PPI, valacyclovir and torsemide. Renal biopsy revealed TIN with dense, zonal and focal granulomatous features suggestive of drug-induced hypersensitivity, chronic infection, sarcoidosis or an extra-intestinal manifestation of CD. Case #2: 45-year-old female with SLE, nephrolithiasis, GERD, hypertension and ulcerative colitis (UC), initially on mesalamine, then vedolizumab, with clinical and endoscopic remission. Her SCr increased at the time of her UC diagnosis, and worsened over 6 months while on mesalamine, vedolizumab, PPI and losartan. Renal biopsy demonstrated acute and chronic TIN with eosinophils raising concern for an allergic/drug-induced injury. Nephrology concluded that her TIN was secondary to either UC or one of her medications. Case #3: 33-year-old male with UC transitioned to vedolizumab, having failed budesonide and mesalamine. He had latent TB and received 9 months of isoniazid. While on mesalamine, vedolizumab and PPI, he developed fever, chills and night sweats, with an acute rise in SCr, prompting discontinuation of meds. Three months later, still in remission and with improved SCr, he restarted vedolizumab. A year later he developed low-grade fever with elevated SCr, prompting discontinuation. Renal biopsy revealed acute and chronic TIN with severe interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy and focal global glomerulosclerosis. He started prednisone and remained off other IBD therapy for 6 months, but repeat colonoscopy revealed mild colitis. He restarted mesalamine, but again developed elevated SCr 2 months later. Repeat renal biopsy revealed TIN with less interstitial fibrosis and focal global glomerulosclerosis, and nephrology suggested his interstitial nephritis was likely secondary to UC over his medications. He started azathioprine with significant improvement in SCr and clinical remission of UC.

Discussion

In all three cases, neither nephrology consultation nor renal biopsy helped distinguish the etiology of renal injury, defaulting to either the IBD meds or an extra-intestinal manifestation of IBD, and not accounting for the acute inflammatory symptoms in two of the cases. While literature review reveals several cases that allege kidney injury as an extra-intestinal target of IBD serious doubts remain. TIN secondary to aminosalicylates is well-documented, but there are few reports of adalimumab-induced granulomatous TIN and only one report of vedolizumab-induced TIN. Each of our patients had well-controlled IBD and multiple confounding variables that could impact kidney function or cause TIN, including hypertension and multiple potential culprit medications, illustrating the dilemma of determining the etiology of renal injury in IBD patients.

### Aetiology of acute / subacute nephritic syndrome: results from kidney biopsy registries in Japan and Europe [^114azVTy]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute interstitial nephritis was the third most common diagnosis in the present study but accounted for only 6% of all cases of ANS in both Europe and Japan. In the Czech Registry of Renal Biopsies, AIN was found in 3.3% of all biopsies performed with 24.7% presenting with the nephritic syndrome. In Romania, 40% of patients with biopsy-verified AIN presented with nephritic syndrome. The definition of ANS in this study was based on the clinical setting, without knowledge of whether the underlying condition was of glomerular or non-glomerular origin. Accordingly, patients later found to have non-glomerular diseases, such as AIN, were not excluded. We consider this approach clinically relevant, as it reflects real-life practice where it is not possible to distinguish between these entities at initial patient evaluation. A definitive diagnosis can be established only after kidney biopsy, when the clinical presentation is integrated with histopathological findings.

A small subset of patients also met criteria for nephrotic syndrome, presenting with a mixed nephrotic–nephritic picture. Within this group, AAV and IgAN/IgAV remained the most common diagnoses. Membranous nephropathy was observed more frequently in this group compared to the overall study population. Microscopic hematuria is not uncommon in membranous nephropathy, and such patients may present with a clinical picture consistent with ANS. However, the concomitant presence of marked proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia likely reinforce the indication for kidney biopsy.

The median age of the European patients was 10 years younger than that of the Japanese patients. This could reflect differences in biopsy practices, a possible greater inclination to perform kidney biopsies in patients of advancing age in Japan, or differences in the disease spectrum between the studied regions. It should also be noted that the median age of the overall population in Japan is greater than in most European countries. An increasing age at the time of biopsy and a larger proportion of patients > 65 years undergoing kidney biopsy have been described from different regions, although this trend has not been observed in all studies. As shown in previous studies, AAV was more prevalent in older age groups, whereas IgAN/IgAV was more frequently found in younger patients. Accordingly, the higher age of patients in this study compared to others could be one of the factors contributing to the greater frequency of AAV reported. Japanese patients with AAV were older than their European counterparts, which may also be attributable to the predominance of MPO-ANCA–positive AAV in Japan, as patients with MPO-ANCA positivity are typically older than those with PR3-ANCA positivity.

### Aetiology of acute / subacute nephritic syndrome: results from kidney biopsy registries in Japan and Europe [^112ktnmq]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, the predominant underlying diagnoses in patients presenting with acute/subacute nephritic syndrome in both Europe and Japan are AAV, IgAN/IgAV and AIN. The clinical triad of hematuria, proteinuria and reduced eGFR represents a strong indication for kidney biopsy, where underlying conditions necessitating urgent management may be identified. Knowledge of similarities and differences between regions can aid in our understanding of how disease patterns are influenced by environmental and genetic factors, as well as factors related to the healthcare system.

### Mortality after acute kidney injury and acute interstitial nephritis in patients prescribed immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy [^117LhoPt]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, acute kidney injury (AKI) is common, and can occur either from kidney injury unrelated to ICI use or from immune activation resulting in acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). In this study, we test the hypothesis that occurrence of AIN indicates a favorable treatment response to ICI therapy and therefore among patients who develop AKI while on ICI therapy, those with AIN will demonstrate greater survival compared with others with AKI.

Methods

In this observational cohort study, we included participants initiated on ICI therapy between 2013 and 2019. We tested the independent association of AKI and estimated AIN (eAIN) with mortality up to 1 year after therapy initiation as compared with those without AKI using time-varying Cox proportional hazard models controlling for demographics, comorbidities, cancer type, stage, and therapy, and baseline laboratory values. We defined eAIN as those with a predicted probability of AIN > 90th percentile derived from a recently validated diagnostic model.

Results

Of 2207 patients initiated on ICIs, 617 (28%) died at 1 year and 549 (25%) developed AKI. AKI was independently associated with higher mortality (adjusted HR, 2.28 (95% CI 1.90 to 2.72)). Those AKI patients with eAIN had more severe AKI as reflected by a higher peak serum creatinine (3.3 (IQR 2.1–6.1) vs 1.4 (1.2–1.9) mg/dL, p < 0.001) but exhibited lower mortality than those without eAIN in univariable analysis (HR 0.43 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.89)) and after adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and cancer type and severity (adjusted HR 0.44 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.93)).

Conclusion

In patients treated with ICI, mortality was higher in those with AKI unrelated to ICI but lower in those where the underlying etiology was AIN. Future studies could evaluate the association of biopsy-proven or biomarker-proven AIN with mortality in those receiving ICI therapy.

### Severe leptospirosis similar to pandemic (H1N1) 2009, Florida and Missouri, USA [^116AcrV8]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

These cases of severe leptospirosis were reported during the 2009 influenza pandemic. Although pulmonary hemorrhage (experienced by patients 2 and 3) is increasingly recognized as a severe manifestation of leptospirosis, it is also a known complication of influenza. ILI was initially diagnosed in patient 1, but symptom progression and clinical complications, combined with a history of animal exposure, prompted the physician to consider leptospirosis and to initiate appropriate antimicrobial drug therapy.

Autopsies are critical in determining the reasons for death after undiagnosed illness. Pulmonary involvement in cases of leptospirosis is characterized by congestion and hemorrhage, usually without prominent inflammatory infiltrates; pulmonary involvement in cases of severe pandemic (H1N1) 2009 typically manifests as diffuse alveolar damage. Postmortem diagnosis of leptospirosis was supported by characteristic histopathologic findings, including pulmonary hemorrhage and interstitial nephritis, and was confirmed by immunohistochemical tests. Our report illustrates the need for autopsies in unexpected deaths, even if the cause appears obvious in a specific clinical and epidemic setting.

Leptospirosis ceased being nationally notifiable in the United States in 1994 and is likely underdiagnosed because it is not routinely considered in differential diagnoses. However, outbreaks with exposures similar to the case-patients we studied have been periodically reported in the United States. Because leptospirosis commonly manifests as acute febrile illness, cases can be underrecognized during infectious-disease epidemics (e.g. dengue). Leptospirosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of acute febrile illness in the United States and other industrialized countries. Epidemiologic clues include recreational or occupational water exposure; animal exposure (including rodents) in the home or the workplace, travel to tropical areas, and water exposure during travel. These risk factors for leptospirosis are increasing in industrialized countries. Thorough patient-history reviews and consideration of alternative diagnoses are needed for cases of respiratory illness during an influenza pandemic.

### Aetiology of acute / subacute nephritic syndrome: results from kidney biopsy registries in Japan and Europe [^113Eqak4]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 1023 patients from Europe and 2477 from Japan presenting with ANS were included in the study. Patient selection is shown in Supplementary Figure S1 (Additional file 1). In Europe, 59.2% of the patients were male, the median age was 58 years (IQR 41–70), and the median eGFR was 24 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (IQR 12–44). Among the Japanese patients, 53.9% were male, the median age was 68 years (IQR 57–74), and the median eGFR at the time of kidney biopsy was 20 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (IQR 11–35) (Table 1). The estimated GFR was higher in Europe compared to Japan (Table 1; Fig. 1). The most prevalent cause of ANS in both regions was anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV), accounting for 36.8% of all cases in Europe and 47.0% in Japan. This was followed by immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy/vasculitis (IgAN/IgAV) at 21.7% in Europe and 11.2% in Japan, and acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) at 6.2% in Europe and 6.0% in Japan (Table 1). Demographic and clinical characteristics for the eight most common disease categories are shown in Table 2. In Europe, 1.7% of patients had post-infectious glomerulonephritis, compared with 3.4% in Japan. The most common diagnoses in patients fulfilling criteria for nephrotic syndrome in addition to acute/subacute nephritic syndrome are presented in Supplementary Table S1 (Additional file 1).

### Acute glomerulonephritis [^114DBcTp]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Glomerulonephritis is a heterogeneous group of disorders that present with a combination of haematuria, proteinuria, hypertension, and reduction in kidney function to a variable degree. Acute presentation with full blown nephritic syndrome or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is uncommon and is mainly restricted to patients with post-infectious glomerulonephritis, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies-associated vasculitis, and anti-glomerular basement membrane disease. Most frequently, patients present with asymptomatic haematuria and proteinuria with or without reduced kidney function. All glomerulonephritis disorders can show periods of exacerbation, but disease flairs characteristically occur in patients with IgA nephropathy or C3 glomerulopathy. The gold standard for the diagnosis of a glomerulonephritis is a kidney biopsy, with a hallmark glomerular inflammation that translates into various histopathological patterns depending on the location and severity of the glomerular injury. Traditionally, glomerulonephritis was classified on the basis of the different histopathological patterns of injury. In the last few years, substantial progress has been made in unravelling the underlying causes and pathogenetic mechanisms of glomerulonephritis and a causal approach to the classification of glomerulonephritis is now favoured over a pattern-based approach. As such, glomerulonephritis can be broadly classified as immune-complex glomerulonephritis (including infection-related glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and cryoglobulinaemic glomerulonephritis), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies-associated (pauci-immune) glomerulonephritis, anti-glomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis, C3 glomerulopathy, and monoclonal immunoglobulin-associated glomerulonephritis. We provide an overview of the clinical presentation, pathology, and the current therapeutic approach of the main representative disorders in the spectrum of glomerulonephritis.

### Acute kidney injury associated with human granulocytic anaplasmosis: a case report [^115q93CJ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Tick-borne illnesses are a growing problem in the United States. Human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), carried by the Ixodes scapularis tick, is caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum. While the clinical manifestations of HGA may be protean, ranging from asymptomatic infection to life-threatening multiorgan failure, renal involvement is uncommon. We report a case of a 64-year-old man presenting with a febrile illness and acute nephritis in the setting of HGA infection. The patient's kidney biopsy was characterized by a membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis pattern and acute interstitial inflammation. After appropriate antibiotic treatment and high-dose steroids, the patient had a marked improvement in kidney function, although a subsequent recrudescence of nephritis required a 6-month course of additional steroids. As the prevalence of tick-borne diseases continues to spread across the United States, raising awareness of the potential for atypical presentations is important, particularly because early diagnosis and treatment can be curative and prevent further complications.

### Lack of evidence for viral etiology in symptomatic chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) in Sri Lanka [^112YtXph]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is characterized by a reduced GFR, increased albuminuria, or other signs of kidney damage lasting more than 3 months duration, irrespective of the etiology. While CKD can frequently be attributed to a defined cause such as diabetes, glomerulonephritis, infection, vascular disease or genetic disorders, the etiology of chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) remains unclear. A high prevalence of CKDu has been reported in farming communities in tropical countries worldwide, including Sri Lanka. In Sri Lanka, CKDu is primarily identified in and around north-central region of the country.

CKDu has been an emerging cause of mortality during the past two decades among people with low socio-economic status in the dry zone of Sri Lanka. The disease is mainly considered to be asymptomatic until stages with severely impaired GFR are reached. However, recently a transient Sym-CKDu with histological features of acute interstitial nephritis has been reported. Common symptoms associated with Sym-CKDu include fever, dysuria and arthralgias. Kidney biopsy studies in symptomatic patients have demonstrated early tubulointerstitial changes and active inflammation. These findings led to the hypothesis of a sequel of events: an agent yet to be identified initiates acute tubulointerstitial injury, which leads to irreversible lesions and subsequently progresses towards kidney failure. Symptoms during the acute stage are nonspecific; hence this transient illness could be camouflaged among other nonspecific febrile illnesses or even attributed to strenuous work in a hot, humid climate.

Presently, among the possible etiologies mainly environmental toxins and/or heat stress with repetitive dehydration are primarily discussed and investigated. Conversely, several reports also point towards an infectious cause, in particular a viral infection. However, such a viral etiology has never been proven, nor has it been formally ruled out. The presentation with symptoms such as fever, arthralgia and myalgias seems suggestive of an infectious cause, but both toxins and heat stress may cause similar symptoms. Most of these insults could also induce acute histological responses similar to the lesions described in Sym-CKDu, as well as chronic interstitial nephritis. Arguably, analyzing CKDu at an earlier stage could provide a better chance of identifying the injurious agent.

Here we performed an observational prospective cohort study of symptomatic patients with a feverish syndrome presenting in an outpatient clinic in a CKDu endemic region of Sri Lanka. We report eGFR trajectories in this cohort, a detailed description of patient characteristics of individuals losing eGFR over time and the absence of any evidence supporting a viral etiology.

### An unusual form of kidney injury without glomerulonephritis in microscopic polyangiitis: a case report [^112RadZ3]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a group of disorders that affect small-sized vessels predominantly and have similar histopathological features in kidney involvement. Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), a kind of AAV, is a significant cause of pulmonary-renal syndrome. Although MPA has been reported at all ages, intensive and severe clinics generally occur in older adults. Clinical manifestations are various in MPA; most of the patients present with constitutional symptoms including; fatigue, fever, arthralgia, or weight loss at diagnosis or months prior to diagnosis. The hazard of respiratory failure due to severe pulmonary hemorrhage and permanent kidney dysfunction due to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN), therefore prompt identification of the disease, is critical. Furthermore, these consequences can be prevented by proper treatment. The treatment of MPA includes vigorous immunosuppression strategies. ANCA test has diagnostic significance on AAV. The immunofluorescence assay (IFA) usually has a perinuclear staining pattern (P-ANCA), and enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISA) detect antibodies to myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA) in MPA.

Kidney involvement is noted in approximately 80–100% of patients with MPA cases, and the clinic spectrum ranges from microscopic hematuria to severe kidney injury with dialysis requirement. Kidney involvement of MPA presents with evident glomerulonephritis (GN) in almost all cases. Pauci-immune necrotizing and crescentic GN is the typical histological feature in AAV. Nevertheless, renal involvement of systemic vasculitis occasionally may be in the form of tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN).

Acute interstitial nephritis is a kidney pathology that typically leads to a decrease in kidney function and is characterized by an inflammatory cell infiltration in the interstitium. It is frequently induced by drug therapy. Also, caused by autoimmune disorders, systemic disease, several infections, and tubulointerstitial nephritis with uveitis (TINU) syndrome. However, a few cases were reported, a purely tubulointerstitial injury without glomerular lesions in patients with MPA. Herein, we describe life-threatening pulmonary-renal syndrome accompanied by an unexpected renal component. We present an unusual form of kidney injury by MPA, which resulted in dialysis requirements.

### Systemic sarcoidosis presenting as a rare combination of interstitial nephritis with necrotizing vasculitis and urinary retention due to prostate involvement: a case report [^117S8WVs]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease with various clinical presentations that commonly involves the lungs, skin, lymph nodes, eyes, and other organs, including the kidneys. Granulomatous inflammation is the hallmark pathological feature of renal involvement in sarcoidosis. Although the condition exhibits diverse kidney manifestations, including interstitial nephritis and glomerular disease, small-vessel vasculitis is rare. Moreover, prostate involvement in sarcoidosis is unusual, with few cases of prostate-related symptoms having been reported. Herein, we present an extremely rare case of sarcoidosis with acute kidney injury (AKI) due to a combination of interstitial nephritis with small-vessel vasculitis and urinary retention caused by prostate involvement.

### Mortality after acute kidney injury and acute interstitial nephritis in patients prescribed immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy [^114rWjFn]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

We conducted several sensitivity analyses. First, we tested the association of eAIN with mortality where eAIN was defined as those with top 3% of AIN probability based on our diagnostic model. Second, we conducted a landmark analysis where exposure was noted at 90 days after initiation of ICI therapy and held constant thereafter. This analysis only included those who survived at 90 days. Third, we began follow-up at initiation of ICI therapy without excluding the first 15-day period. Fourth, we excluded those participants who received ICI therapy as part of a clinical trial (n = 781). We present two models for each of these sensitivity analyses similar to the primary analysis. Finally, we present mortality rates (per 1000-person years) by deciles of predicted probabilities of AIN. We conducted all analyses using STATA (V.15.1) and SAS (V.9.4; SAS Institute).

### Acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis leading to acute renal failure following multiple hornet stings [^114xPoaq]. BMC Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Zhang et al reported for the first time that acute tubulointerstitial nephritis could lead to acute renal failure in these patients. It was postulated by them that, as these patients have other allergic manifestations like serum sickness-like reaction, delayed skin eruption, and possible vasculitis and as many components of the insect venom are polypeptides so theoretically, these allergens can mediate various types of renal injuries, such as immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis, interstitial nephritis, renal microangiitis, or vasculitis.

Subsequently Chao et al reported a case with both acute interstitial nephritis and tubulopathy after wasp bites. The role of steroids in the setting of tubulointerstitial nephritis has also been discussed in these two reports. Our patient also had acute renal failure due to acute tubulointerstitial nephritis which responded to steroid therapy. The cause of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis is not clear. There was no history of any nephrotoxic drug intake so it could be due to hypersensitivity to the venom. This patient also had anemia at presentation but there was no evidence of hemolysis and the peripheral blood film was consistent with nutritional anemia which recovered on follow up with appropriate supplementation.

In conclusion, rare causes of acute renal failure following hornet bite like tubulo-interstitial nephritis should be considered in a patient with persistent oliguria and azotemia and renal biopsy should be undertaken as institution of steroid therapy may help in recovery of renal function and preventing development of interstitial fibrosis.

### Light-chain-mediated acute tubular interstitial nephritis: a poorly recognized pattern of renal disease in patients with plasma cell dyscrasia [^1152rkt4]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Context

Acute renal failure may be the first clinical presentation in patients with plasma cell dyscrasia. Recognition of the unusual interstitial inflammatory lesion associated with monoclonal light chains and renal failure described herein is important to guide clinicians in requesting appropriate tests to confirm plasma cell dyscrasia and providing adequate treatment.

Objective

To describe an unusual pattern of tubular interstitial nephritis in patients with underlying plasma cell dyscrasia characterized by an interstitial inflammatory reaction associated with deposition of light chains along tubular basement membranes.

Design

Eight cases of light-chain-mediated acute tubular interstitial nephritis were identified from the archives of 4296 kidney biopsy specimens. In all cases, routine light microscopic examination, direct immunofluorescence, and electron microscopic examination were performed. Ultrastructural immunogold labeling was performed in specimens with inconclusive findings and in specimens from patients with no clinical history of plasma cell dyscrasia.

Results

All patients presented with acute renal failure. Light microscopy revealed acute tubular interstitial nephritis. In some of the cases, direct immunofluorescence and electron microscopy failed to show definitive evidence of light-chain deposition along tubular basement membranes. Ultrastructural immunogold labeling aided the demonstration of monotypical light chains along some tubular basement membranes. No light chains were present in other renal compartments.

Conclusions

Accumulation of light chains along tubular basement membranes may induce an interstitial process that mimics acute tubular interstitial nephritis. Recognition of this unusual pattern of renal disease in patients with plasma cell dyscrasia requires ancillary diagnostic techniques.

### Hantavirus infection with renal failure and proteinuria, Colorado, USA, 2019 [^116jcD19]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure
Chest radiographs displaying bibasilar patchy interstitial opacities in patient with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Colorado, USA. A) Posteroanterior view. B) Lateral view.

Using a qualitative assay (Quest Diagnostics Infectious Diseases,), we detected IgM and IgG against recombinant hantavirus antigens derived from both Old and New World hantaviruses in patient samples. Testing at the Colorado Public Health Laboratory confirmed Sin Nombre virus (SNV)–specific IgM of 1:6,400 (expected result < 1:100). The patient recovered by day 6, with no residual symptoms. Three weeks later, his creatinine was within reference levels (1.07 mg/dL).

This patient's primary manifestations of hantavirus infection were reversible acute kidney injury and proteinuria. Respiratory symptoms were mild; his respiratory rate was slightly elevated, and chest radiograph disclosed interstitial infiltrates suggestive of mild HPS. Clinical HFRS manifestation can range from asymptomatic infection to acute renal failure with proteinuria, hematuria, and oliguria. Severity has been correlated with a specific hantavirus strain. Proteinuria is due to hantavirus nephritis, which is transient and usually resolves in 2 weeks. When acute interstitial nephritis occurs, it may manifest as acute tubular necrosis with histologic evidence of glomerular and endothelial damage.

HFRS caused by Puumala virus (nephropathia epidemica) or SEOV is generally mild and associated with a benign long-term prognosis. Diagnosis is facilitated by a high index of suspicion, a complete history including occupational and travel history, recognition of characteristic clinical symptoms, serologic or PCR testing, and exclusion of other infections. HFRS should be suspected in patients with acute renal failure, fever, hemorrhage, headache, and abdominal, back, or orbital pain; who live in rural areas; or who have possible rodent exposure within the previous 7 weeks. Because hantavirus infection rarely manifests as kidney disease in the United States, clinicians might be less aware of HFRS. At least 1 other SNV case has been reported with renal involvement requiring transient hemodialysis. General management is supportive, and most patients recover fully; few develop chronic renal sequelae.

Because of serologic cross-reactivity between SNV and SEOV, we lack a final etiology in this case. Our findings are also limited by the absence of viral sequencing and nephritis pathology analysis confirmation. However, our findings indicate that clinical recognition of renal signs and rapid detection of hantavirus infections can reduce risk for serious outcomes.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^115spsC7]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Assessment for acute kidney disorder (AKD) includes evaluation for volume depletion (e.g., lightheadedness or dizziness, hypotension, orthostasis); for urinary obstruction with symptoms of voiding dysfunction, flank pain, or hematuria, elevated post-void bladder volume, or evidence of obstruction on kidney imaging (e.g., hydronephrosis); and for suspicion of acute glomerular or interstitial disease (e.g., hematuria, dysmorphic RBCs or RBC casts, new onset or acute increase in albuminuria) with recent illness (e.g., infection), constitutional or rheumatologic symptoms, rash, edema, and hemoptysis.

### Acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis leading to acute renal failure following multiple hornet stings [^116B4zjg]. BMC Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Hornet stings are generally associated with local and occasionally anaphylactic reactions. Rarely systemic complications like acute renal failure can occur following multiple stings. Renal failure is usually due to development of acute tubular necrosis as a result of intravascular haemolysis, rhabdomyolysis or shock. Rarely it can be following development of acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis.

Case Presentation

We describe a young male, who was stung on face, head, shoulders and upper limbs by multiple hornets (Vespa orientalis). He developed acute renal failure as a result of acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis and responded to steroids.

Conclusion

Rare causes of acute renal failure like tubulo-interstitial nephritis should be considered in a patient with persistent oliguria and azotemia following multiple hornet stings. Renal biopsy should be undertaken early, as institution of steroid therapy may help in recovery of renal function.

Zopiclone, a relatively new nonbenzodiazepine short-acting hypnotic medication is prescribed frequently for insomnia. The authors report a case of zopiclone-induced acute interstitial nephritis in a young, otherwise healthy man. The patient presented with anuric acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis. Kidney biopsy results showed acute interstitial nephritis with a prominent eosinophilic infiltrate in the interstitium. He recovered his renal function after stopping the medication and receiving corticosteroids.

Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS), also referred to as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), is a severe hypersensitivity drug reaction affecting the skin and multiple internal organ systems. We report a 47-year-old man with DIHS/DRESS and comorbidities (fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus, valsartan-induced photosensitivity, vitiligo and acute interstitial nephritis). Although acute interstitial nephritis usually appears in the early phase, his is a rare case of acute interstitial nephritis more than 2 years after the onset of DIHS/DRESS.

### Glomerulonephritis [^111tFKsq]. Pediatrics in Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Glomerulonephritis (GN) encompasses several disorders that cause glomerular inflammation and injury through an interplay of immune-mediated mechanisms, host characteristics, and environmental triggers, such as infections. GN can manifest solely in the kidney or in the setting of a systemic illness, and presentation can range from chronic and relatively asymptomatic hematuria to fulminant renal failure. Classic acute GN is characterized by hematuria, edema, and hypertension, the latter 2 of which are the consequence of sodium and water retention in the setting of renal impairment. Although presenting signs and symptoms and a compatible clinical history can suggest GN, serologic and urinary testing can further refine the differential diagnosis, and renal biopsy can be used for definitive diagnosis. Treatment of GN can include supportive care, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade, immunomodulatory therapy, and renal transplant. Prognosis is largely dependent on the underlying cause of GN and can vary from a self-limited course to chronic kidney disease. This review focuses on lupus nephritis, IgA nephropathy, IgA vasculitis, and postinfectious GN.

### AASLD practice guidance on acute-on-chronic liver failure and the management of critically ill patients with cirrhosis [^116fmSJ7]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD practice guidance — acute kidney injury (AKI) differential and HRS-AKI definition in critically ill cirrhosis notes that critically ill patients with cirrhosis can have structural or functional causes of AKI, with structural causes mostly acute tubular necrosis, acute glomerulonephritis, and, rarely, acute interstitial nephritis, while functional causes related to hemodynamic abnormalities are much more common; it states that HRS-AKI is now being adopted using the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes definition and is defined as an increase in s Cr ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 48 h or ≥ 50% from baseline while fulfilling diagnostic criteria for HRS Type 1; currently published clinical trials used the older 2007 ICA definition of HRS1 with a threshold of ≥ 2.5 mg/dL in < 14 days without structural renal disease or preexisting azotemia; as estimated by the Translational Research Investigating Biomarker Endpoints in AKI Consortium, 50% of AKI episodes in cirrhosis were PRA and 35% related to ATN, with the remainder related to HRS-AKI and postrenal causes very uncommon.

### Clinical and radiological features of extra-pulmonary sarcoidosis: a pictorial essay [^111MgYB5]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The aim of this manuscript is to describe radiological findings of extra-pulmonary sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is an immune-mediated systemic disease of unknown origin, characterized by non-caseating epitheliod granulomas. Ninety percent of patients show granulomas located in the lungs or in the related lymph nodes. However, lesions can affect any organ. Typical imaging features of liver and spleen sarcoidosis include visceromegaly, with multiple nodules hypodense on CT images and hypointense on T2-weighted MRI acquisitions. Main clinical and radiological manifestations of renal sarcoidosis are nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and acute interstitial nephritis. Brain sarcoidosis shows multiple or solitary parenchymal nodules on MRI that enhance with a ring-like appearance after gadolinium. In spinal cord localization, MRI demonstrates enlargement and hyperintensity of spinal cord, with hypointense lesions on T2-weighted images. Skeletal involvement is mostly located in small bone, showing many lytic lesions; less frequently, bone lesions have a sclerotic appearance. Ocular involvement includes uveitis, conjunctivitis, optical nerve disease, chorioretinis. Erythema nodosum and lupus pernio represent the most common cutaneous manifestations encountered. Sarcoidosis in various organs can be very insidious for radiologists, showing different imaging features, often non-specific. Awareness of these imaging features helps radiologists to obtain the correct diagnosis.

Teaching Points

- Systemic sarcoidosis can exhibit abdominal, neural, skeletal, ocular, and cutaneous manifestations.
- T2 signal intensity of hepatosplenic nodules may reflect the disease activity.
- Heerfordt's syndrome includes facial nerve palsy, fever, parotid swelling, and uveitis.
- In the vertebrae, osteolytic and/or diffuse sclerotic lesions can be found.
- Erythema nodosum and lupus pernio represent the most common cutaneous manifestations.

### Diagnostic work-up and specific causes of acute kidney injury [^116MgyqL]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in critically ill patients and associated with grim short- and long-term outcome. Although in the vast majority of cases AKI is multifactorial, with sepsis, shock and nephrotoxicity accounting for most episodes, specific causes of AKI are not uncommon. Despite remaining uncertainties regarding their prevalence in the ICU, prompt recognition of specific aetiologies of AKI is likely to ensure timely management, limit worsening of renal dysfunction, and ultimately limit renal and systemic consequences of AKI. The ability to recognize conditions that may be associated with specific aetiologies and the appropriate use of clinical imaging, biological and immunological tests, along with optimal assessment of the need for renal biopsies, should be part of routine ICU care. In this review, we summarize uncertainties, current knowledge and recent advances regarding specific types of AKI. We describe the most common specific causes as well as rare aetiologies requiring urgent management, and outline available tools that may be used during the diagnostic work-up along with their limitations.

### The increasing rates of acute interstitial nephritis in Australia: a single centre case series [^116YVck2]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's first report into acute kidney injury demonstrated a significant increase in the incidence of acute-tubulo interstitial nephritis, the ICD-10 code representing both acute interstitial nephritis and pyelonephritis, in women aged less than 55 years. In contrast, recent case series have reported rising rates of drug induced acute interstitial nephritis predominantly among elderly patients. Due to several limitations with the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report, this new trend requires further investigation to determine if rates of acute interstitial nephritis are truly increasing among younger Australian women.

Methods

Patients who underwent a renal biopsy at a single center from 2000 to 2015 were reviewed and those with biopsy confirmed acute interstitial nephritis were selected. Cause of acute interstitial nephritis, patient demographics, co-morbidities and renal indices for these patients when available were recorded and compared.

Results

Eight hundred ninety-eight patients who underwent renal biopsy from 2000 to 2015 were reviewed and 40 patients were identified with biopsy confirmed acute interstitial nephritis. The rate of acute interstitial nephritis increased significantly over the study period (4 patients/2.2% of biopsies performed in 2000–03 vs. 19 patients/6.7% of all biopsies performed in 2012–15; p = 0.002). There was a marked increase in the number of women with AIN in the last four years of the study (2 patients and 2.1% of biopsies performed in women in 2000–2003 compared with 13 patients and 9.0% of biopsies performed in women in 2012–2015). Immune mediated causes of acute interstitial nephritis and NSAID associated AIN were more common in women (9 females vs. 3 males), occurred more frequently in the last eight years of the study and predominantly in patients under 55 years of age.

Conclusions

Our study demonstrates a significant increase in the number of patients with biopsy confirmed AIN. Also, we provide preliminary evidence in support of an increase in rates of younger women with immune mediated acute interstitial nephritis. These results support the findings of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and suggest that younger women may be at higher risk of immune mediated and NSAID associated acute interstitial nephritis.

### The increasing rates of acute interstitial nephritis in Australia: a single centre case series [^111o6UnR]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The current findings also confirm that while AIN can occur in any age group, increased use of NSAIDS, antibiotics and PPIs combined with higher rates of renal impairment put elderly patients at greater risk. Specifically, patients with PPI/H2-induced AIN and antibiotic-induced AIN tended to be older (median age 72.3 years and 66.8 years, respectively). Patients with NSAID use were predominantly female (80%) and younger than other patients with a drug induced AIN with a median age of 60.3 yrs. Also, NSAID associated AIN only occurred from 2008 onwards and this trend may also be contributing to the increase in AIN in younger women seen in our study and by the AIHW. It has been decades since NSAID use among young Australian women was linked with kidney injury, with more recent Australian studies showing that NSAID use in Australia is more common in elderly patients. In contrast, our findings suggest a reversion to previous community behaviors of analgesic overuse among younger, predominantly female cohorts.

The majority of AIN patients have a benign course and a complete or partial renal recovery. Although follow-up data was only available for some of the patients in this study, it indicated that most patients had a marked improvement in serum creatinine at two weeks (median sCr 136 μmol/L) and near complete renal recovery on the final serum creatinine measured (median sCr 99 μmol/L). This improvement was independent of age, gender, patient co-morbidity or cause. Only 3 patients required RRT, and two of these had pre-existing CKD.

The treatment of AIN is largely empiric, with withdrawal or treatment of the causative agent the most effective intervention. Traditionally, a course of high dose oral prednisone (with or without intravenous methylprednisone) has been prescribed, particularly in patients with an idiopathic or immune mediated cause. Reports on the effectiveness of steroids in both these and drug induced AIN is unproven and based on evidence from uncontrolled, retrospective studies. The present findings corroborate these previous results; steroid treatment did not make a significant difference in renal function at two weeks and on the final serum creatinine measured. However, follow-up data was available for a proportion of our patient cohort and conclusions should be tentatively drawn.

### Different renal manifestations associated with very early onset pediatric inflammatory bowel disease: case report and review of literature [^117XEXcQ]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Inflammatory bowel diseases are characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. In particular, Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis represent the two most common types of clinical manifestations. Extraintestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel diseases represent a common complications, probably reflecting the systemic inflammation. Renal involvement is reported in 4–23% of cases. However, available data are limited to few case series and retrospective analysis, therefore the real impact of renal involvement is not well defined.

Case presentation

We report the case of a 10-years old male affected by very early onset unclassified-Inflammatory bowel diseases since he was 1-year old, presenting with a flare of inflammatory bowel diseases associated with acute kidney injury due to granulomatous interstitial nephritis. Of interest, at 7-year-old, he was treated for IgA nephropathy.

To our knowledge, no previous reports have described a relapse of renal manifestation in inflammatory bowel diseases, characterized by two different clinical and histological phenotypes.

Conclusions

The link between the onset of kidney injuries with flares of intestinal inflammation suggest that nephritis maybe considered an extra-intestinal manifestation correlated with active inflammatory bowel disease. However, if granulomatous interstitial nephritis represents a cell-mediated hypersensitivity reaction than a true extraintestinal manifestation of inflammatory bowel diseases is still not clarified. We suggest as these renal manifestations here described may be interpreted as extraintestinal disorder and also considered as systemic signal of under treatment of the intestinal disease.

### A comprehensive review of imaging findings in COVID-19-status in early 2021 [^1146c4ZQ]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) presenting with proteinuria and hematuria is a severe possible complication of COVID-19, which imparts high mortality. In a study from the United States, there was a 37% incidence of 37% of AKI among COVID-19 patients, of whom one-third had diagnosis within 24 h after admission, and 14% even required dialysis. Renal pathophysiology is probably multifactorial, but SARS-CoV-2 may directly target renal cells via ACE2, as is supported by certain histopathological findings. Another possibility is that AKI is caused by cytokine-storm during the infection, as can occur during infections with influenza and other viruses. Of course, other potential etiologies of AKI in critical illness situations also remain relevant, among which are organ volume depletion, interstitial nephritis, ARDS, or rhabdomyolysis. Renal imaging findings are rarely reported in the COVID-19 literature, the most common being signs on MR of renal infarction, namely sharply demarcated, possibly patchy hypoenhancing or non-enhancing areas in the kidney. In pathophysiological terms, this kind of lesion is most probably attributable to the global coagulopathy that can occur in COVID-19.

Although myalgia is a commonly reported symptom among COVID-19 patients, musculoskeletal manifestations are most probably underdiagnosed, such that so far only one imaging result is yet available in the literature, being an MR study of acute myositis. We emphasize that new COVID-19 manifestations such as peripheral nerve disease or neuromusculoskeletal disorders seem likely to emerge with time, in keeping with the precedent set by SARS-CoV-1. However, there are not yet reports of such findings in SARS-CoV-2 patients.

Another rare manifestation of COVID-19 is cutaneous lesions including maculopapular rash, vesicular lesions, and livedoid/necrotic lesions, with the latter possibly being associated with a more severe course of COVID-19. A single-center observational study from Italy first reported that dermatologic manifestations occurred in 20% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. There was no significant correlation between severity of respiratory symptoms and dermatologic manifestations, and there are not yet any specific imaging findings of cutaneous manifestations reported in the literature.

### Aspirin and omeprazole (aspirin and omeprazole delayed-release tab) [^111ZTsyf]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

5.5 Interaction with Ticagrelor

Maintenance doses of aspirin above 100 mg reduce the effectiveness of ticagrelor in preventing thrombotic cardiovascular events. Avoid concomitant use of ticagrelor with the 325 mg/40 mg tablet strength of ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.6 Renal Failure

Avoid ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/minute). Regular use of aspirin is associated in a dose-dependent manner with an increased risk of chronic renal failure. Aspirin use decreases glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow especially with patients with pre-existing renal disease [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

5.7 Presence of Gastric Malignancy

In adults, response to gastric symptoms with ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional gastrointestinal follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who experience gastric symptoms during treatment with ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA or have a symptomatic relapse after completing treatment. In older patients, also consider an endoscopy.

5.8 Acute Interstitial Nephritis

Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including omeprazole. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA if acute interstitial nephritis develops [see Contraindications (4)].

5.9 Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea

Published observational studies suggest that PPI-containing therapy like ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD), especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Use the lowest dose and shortest duration of ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA appropriate to the condition being treated.

### Acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis leading to acute renal failure following multiple hornet stings [^111oK6WH]. BMC Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Insect stings and bites are known to cause a variety of allergic reactions and direct toxic effects. Stinging insects are classified as hymenoptera which includes apids (honey bees, Africanized bees) and vespids (wasps, yellow jackets & hornets). Hornet stings are generally followed by minor allergic reactions and rarely anaphylaxis. However multiple stings can sometimes lead to angioedema, vasculitis, encephalitis and acute renal failure. Usually acute renal failure is due to acute tubular necrosis secondary to intravascular hemolysis, rhabdomyolysis or shock. Rarely it can be due to the development of tubulo-interstitial nephritis. In this report we describe a young male who had multiple hornet stings (Vespa orientalis) and developed acute renal failure as a result of tubulo-interstitial nephritis.

### Varenicline induced acute interstitial nephritis in the setting of idiopathic membranous glomerulonephritis [^1167fH4z]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Varenicline is a nicotinic receptor partial agonist indicated for the cessation of smoking. It is regarded as having no or minimal renal toxicity. A single case report has linked it to acute interstitial nephritis.

Case presentation

A 56 year-old female with a long-standing history of idiopathic membranous glomerulonephritis presented on routine follow-up with an unexpected rise in her serum creatinine from a stable baseline of 225 umol/L to 319 umol/L Biopsy revealed acute interstitial nephritis. There were no preceding clinical events other than the initiation of varenicline therapy three months prior. This was discontinued with no improvement in renal function. A ten week course of prednisone was initiated and creatinine levels returned to baseline. Shortly after prednisone therapy was completed, renal function worsened but the patient declined further immunosuppressive therapy. Exposure to varenicline therapy two years prior had also resulted in a reversible decline in kidney function.

Conclusion

This is only the second case report to document varenicline-induced acute interstitial nephritis. A careful medication history and renal biopsy were essential in identifying the etiology of the acute kidney injury in this patient with a complex renal history.

### Nephrotoxicity of anticancer treatment [^117JRnbG]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Severe adverse systemic drug events occur commonly as a result of treatment of cancer patients. Nephrotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents remains a significant complication limiting the efficacy of the treatment. A variety of renal disease and electrolyte disorders can result from the drugs that are used to treat malignant disease. The kidneys are a major elimination pathway for many antineoplastic drugs and their metabolites. Tumour lysis syndrome, an emergency in haematooncology, occurs most often after the initiation of cytotoxic therapy in patients with high-grade lymphomas and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Chemotherapeutic agents can affect the glomerulus, tubules, interstitium and renal microvasculature, with clinical manifestations that range from asymptomatic elevation of serum creatinine to acute renal failure requiring dialysis. Some factors such as intravascular volume depletion, as well as concomitant use of other drugs or radiographic ionic contrast media, can potentiate or contribute to the nephrotoxicity. Cytotoxic agents can cause nephrotoxicity by a variety of mechanisms. The most nephrotoxic chemotherapeutic drug is cisplatin, which is often associated with acute kidney injury. Many other drugs such as alkylating agents, antimetabolites, vascular endothelial growth factor pathway inhibitors and epidermal growth factor receptor pathway inhibitors may have toxic effects on the kidneys. The aim of this review is to discuss the issue of nephrotoxicity associated with chemotherapy. In routine clinical practice, monitoring of kidney function is mandatory in order to identify nephrotoxicity early, allowing dosage adjustments or withdrawal of the offending drug.

### Red blood cell casts in acute interstitial nephritis… [^111rBXjh]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

A 45-year-old woman receiving hydralazine and hydrochlorothiazide therapy was found to have a reduced glomerular filtration rate, a positive antinuclear antibody reaction, and RBC casts in the urinary sediment. Glomeruli with normal morphology were found on renal biopsy; however, a mild interstitial nephritis was observed that predominantly involved the distal tubules. The etiology of this inflammatory process is unknown. Changes in distal tubular function correlated with the morphology: acidification was impaired whereas concentrating ability was normal. Although RBC casts have been thought to be diagnostic of glomerular diseases, the present case demonstrates that tubulointerstitial disease can be responsible for RBC cast formation.

### Ibuprofen-associated renal dysfunction… [^11176MPk]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Ibuprofen-associated, acute, reversible renal failure with hyperkalemia, tubular necrosis, and proteinuria developed in a patient who had no predisposing underlying disease. A renal biopsy specimen revealed mesangial hypercellularity without glomerular crescent formation. A profound interstitial nephritis with focal inflammatory cell infiltrates of predominantly mononuclear cells and neutrophils as well as focal tubular destruction was seen. Vasculitis was not observed. Ultrastructural studies confirmed the light microscopic diagnosis of a tubulointerstitial nephritis and, in addition, indicated the presence of electron-dense mesangial and subepithelial deposits. Direct immunofluorescence examination showed diffuse mesangial IgM and C3 deposition as well as vascular C3 deposition. Renal failure rapidly resolved after discontinuation of ibuprofen therapy and initiation of steroid therapy, with return to normal levels of serum creatinine, urea nitrogen, potassium, and sodium.

Proteinuria also resolved. Marasco WA, Gikas PW, Azziz-Baumgartner R, Hyzy R, Eldredge CJ, Stross J. Ibuprofen-Associated Renal Dysfunction: Pathophysiologic Mechanisms of Acute Renal Failure, Hyperkalemia, Tubular Necrosis, and Proteinuria. Arch Intern Med. 1987; 147: 2107–2116.

### Oxacillin nephritis… [^113kqHQi]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Acute interstitial nephritis secondary to administration of antibiotics is a well-described entity. Oxacillin, however, has never been directly implicated. An 80-year-old man had a rising creatinine level and eosinophiluria while receiving oxacillin sodium. These findings disappeared when use of the drug was discontinued. We conclude that oxacillin is an additional penicillin that can cause interstitial nephritis. Tillman DB, Oill PA, Guze LB. Oxacillin Nephritis. Arch Intern Med. 1980;
