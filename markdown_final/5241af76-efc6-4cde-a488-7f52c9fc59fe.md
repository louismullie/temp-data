## Question

Physiology of diuretics in exacerbation of CHF

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the physiology of diuretics in the context of acute heart failure exacerbations, specifically focusing on mechanisms, resistance, dosing strategies, monitoring, and outcomes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of congestion in acute heart failure and why diuretics are first-line. Then, I should verify the renal mechanisms of loop diuretics and how heart failure alters their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Next, I will examine diuretic resistance and its mechanisms. After that, I need to review dosing strategies, including initial IV dosing, bolus versus infusion, and combination therapy. Then, I should confirm monitoring approaches, including natriuresis-guided titration. Finally, I will evaluate outcomes, safety, and guideline-aligned discharge planning, and synthesize a practical, stepwise approach with caveats and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic target: acute heart failure admissions are overwhelmingly driven by congestion from volume redistribution and retention, with elevated filling pressures and neurohormonal activation that promote sodium and water retention, so the immediate therapeutic goal is decongestion to euvolemia using loop diuretics as first-line therapy, which is consistently endorsed by major guidelines and contemporary reviews [^113ReMqF] [^114LWDGi].

> I will now examine the mechanism of loop diuretics. They inhibit the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter in the thick ascending limb, increasing natriuresis and calciuresis and obligating water excretion, thereby reducing plasma volume, venous return, and filling pressures, which translates into rapid symptom relief in pulmonary and systemic congestion, a principle embedded in both historical and current guideline frameworks [^113rg2vf] [^113ReMqF].

> Wait, let me verify how heart failure alters diuretic pharmacology. Reduced renal perfusion from low cardiac output and high central venous pressures, gut edema impairing oral absorption, hypoalbuminemia altering protein binding, and avid distal nephron sodium reabsorption all blunt loop diuretic response, necessitating higher doses, IV administration, and sometimes combination therapy to achieve the same natriuretic effect, which is repeatedly emphasized in pathophysiology reviews and expert statements [^116hQNS3] [^114hxaG5] [^114poBeZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about simply escalating the loop dose. I should confirm the concept of diuretic resistance, which arises from RAAS and SNS activation, distal tubular compensatory hypertrophy, and the braking phenomenon, all of which limit natriuresis and can require sequential nephron blockade or alternative strategies to restore efficacy, as detailed in mechanistic and clinical reviews [^116hQNS3] [^114hxaG5] [^113pMEmb].

> Next, I should review initial IV dosing. Guidelines and consensus recommend converting the total daily oral loop dose to IV and starting at 1–2.5 times that dose, with 2–2.5× favored in DOSE-era analyses, and for diuretic-naïve patients, 40–80 mg IV furosemide is typical, recognizing that underdosing is common and associated with longer length of stay and persistent congestion [^114DeRrU] [^111cV58x] [^111MGtVU].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought continuous infusion might be clearly superior to bolus for decongestion. Let me reconsider and check the highest-quality data, because DOSE showed no difference in global symptom assessment or creatinine change between bolus and infusion, and a 2024 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence for clinically meaningful superiority of continuous infusion over bolus, despite older or smaller studies suggesting more diuresis with infusion, so the practical takeaway is that either strategy is acceptable with close monitoring and dose titration [^115XTBUA] [^115MJc1J] [^115fanwC].

> I need to ensure I address combination therapy for diuretic resistance. Sequential nephron blockade with a thiazide-type agent or acetazolamide can augment natriuresis when loop monotherapy is inadequate, but I should double-check the balance of benefits and risks: CLOROTIC showed more weight loss with hydrochlorothiazide but more renal impairment without symptom benefit, whereas ADVOR showed improved decongestion with acetazolamide and shorter length of stay without clear renal safety signals, and guidelines advise reserving thiazides for refractory cases and monitoring electrolytes closely [^114BNHTx] [^116dAttL] [^1151Ln3a] [^116E5MVj].

> Let me think about monitoring. I should confirm that natriuresis-guided titration is feasible and physiologically sound, with PUSH-AHF demonstrating increased 24–48 hour natriuresis using spot urine sodium targets, though without mortality or rehospitalization benefit, and expert consensus endorsing early assessment of natriuresis to individualize diuretic intensification, which I should frame as improving decongestion efficiency rather than hard outcomes [^117JYihV] [^111WLHZC] [^115c8MSP].

> Next, I should review outcomes and safety. Loop diuretics reliably relieve congestion but have not shown mortality benefit, and higher doses or continuous strategies can precipitate transient worsening renal function and electrolyte disturbances, so persistent congestion at discharge is common and prognostically harmful, reinforcing the need to achieve adequate decongestion before discharge while avoiding excessive diuresis [^112z6NhT] [^115XTBUA] [^111wnvFM].

> I should confirm discharge planning. Guidelines emphasize resolving congestion prior to discharge and providing a diuretic adjustment plan, with observational data suggesting that increasing loop dose at discharge is associated with fewer 30-day readmissions, although this requires careful patient selection and close follow-up to mitigate risks of overdiuresis and electrolyte derangements [^11712kA5] [^114rTE4a] [^113ggybE].

> But wait, what if the presentation is hypertensive acute heart failure? I need to check that vasodilators may be prioritized early alongside diuretics in that phenotype, and that diuretics should be verified as indicated for true volume overload rather than redistributive congestion, aligning with emergency care policies and phenotype-specific guidance to avoid harm from indiscriminate diuresis [^1133CB3u] [^1178gcpR] [^116CSkhf].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach while keeping uncertainties in mind: confirm congestion and start IV loop at 1–2.5× the home oral dose or 40–80 mg if naïve, reassess at 2–6 hours and escalate dose or add a second agent if natriuresis is inadequate, consider acetazolamide or a thiazide for resistance with close labs, avoid premature discontinuation until euvolemia is achieved, and transition with a flexible dosing plan and early GDMT optimization, recognizing that while this aligns with guidelines and trial signals, definitive outcome benefits from diuretic strategies remain limited and require individualized risk–benefit assessment [^114DeRrU] [^111MGtVU] [^116E5MVj] [^11712kA5].

Diuretics relieve congestion in CHF exacerbations by **inhibiting renal sodium reabsorption**, increasing natriuresis and diuresis, and lowering intravascular volume and cardiac filling pressures [^1145PfSn]. Loop diuretics are **first-line** because of their rapid, potent effect [^117E54vJ]; however, resistance is common due to neurohormonal activation and distal nephron compensation [^116hQNS3], often requiring higher doses, continuous infusion, or sequential nephron blockade with thiazides or acetazolamide [^116E5MVj] [^114BNHTx]. Early IV loop diuretics improve symptoms and reduce hospital stay [^115pYvGb] [^117E54vJ], but **must be titrated to avoid renal dysfunction and electrolyte disturbances** [^112z6NhT] [^11712kA5]. Natriuresis-guided strategies can optimize response and limit adverse effects [^117JYihV] [^111WLHZC].

## Pathophysiology of congestion in CHF exacerbations

Congestion in CHF reflects **fluid redistribution and retention** from elevated left-sided pressures and neurohormonal activation (RAAS, SNS, AVP) [^114LWDGi], causing sodium and water retention, increased intravascular volume, and elevated cardiac filling pressures that drive dyspnea, edema, and organ congestion [^111WLHZC] [^114LWDGi].

---

## Mechanism of action of diuretics

Diuretics reduce congestion by **increasing sodium and water excretion** [^1145PfSn], lowering intravascular volume, and decreasing cardiac filling pressures [^1159j1KD].

| **Diuretic class** | **Mechanism of action** | **Site of action** | **Clinical effect** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Loop diuretics (furosemide, torsemide, bumetanide) | Inhibit Na-K-2Cl cotransporter | Ascending loop of Henle | - Potent natriuresis <br/> - Rapid symptom relief |
| Thiazide diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide, metolazone) | Inhibit Na-Cl cotransporter | Distal convoluted tubule | - Sequential nephron blockade <br/> - Overcome resistance |
| Aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone, eplerenone) | Block mineralocorticoid receptor | Collecting duct | - Additive natriuresis <br/> - Cardiorenal benefit |
| SGLT2 inhibitors (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin) | Inhibit SGLT2 in proximal tubule | Proximal tubule | - Osmotic diuresis <br/> - Cardiorenal benefit |

---

Loop diuretics are **first-line** for rapid decongestion [^117E54vJ]; thiazides or acetazolamide are added for resistance [^116E5MVj] [^11626Rm1], and aldosterone antagonists or SGLT2 inhibitors provide additional natriuresis and cardiorenal benefit [^notfound].

## Clinical evidence supporting diuretic use in CHF exacerbations

- **Early IV loop diuretics** reduce dyspnea, edema, and length of stay [^115pYvGb] [^114DeRrU].
- **High-dose strategies** increase diuresis but may worsen renal function; titration is key [^115XTBUA] [^112z6NhT].
- **Sequential nephron blockade** with thiazides or acetazolamide improves diuretic response in resistance [^116E5MVj] [^114BNHTx].
- **Natriuresis-guided therapy** enhances diuretic efficiency and may reduce adverse effects [^117JYihV] [^111WLHZC].

---

## Limitations and adverse effects of diuretic therapy

- **Renal dysfunction**: WRF is common, especially at high doses or with combination therapy [^115XTBUA] [^114BNHTx].
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hypomagnesemia require monitoring [^111RxGAz] [^116E5MVj].
- **Neurohormonal activation**: May blunt response and worsen outcomes if not addressed [^116hQNS3] [^111WLHZC].
- **Diuretic resistance**: Occurs in ~20–30% and predicts worse outcomes [^116hQNS3].

---

## Strategies to optimize diuretic therapy

- **Initial dosing**: Start IV loop at 1–2.5× the home oral dose [^114DeRrU] [^111cV58x].
- **Monitoring**: Use urine output, weight, and natriuresis to guide titration [^117JYihV] [^111WLHZC].
- **Combination therapy**: Add thiazide or acetazolamide for resistance [^116E5MVj] [^114BNHTx].
- **Adjuncts**: Consider vasodilators, inotropes, or ultrafiltration in refractory cases [^111vwuTT] [^111r2iY7].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

ESC and ACC/AHA/HFSA recommend **prompt IV loop diuretics** for fluid overload [^1129dhbW] [^11712kA5], with titration to relieve congestion and a plan for discharge adjustment [^11712kA5]. Combination therapy is reasonable for inadequate response, and natriuresis-guided strategies are emerging to personalize care [^116E5MVj] [^117JYihV].

---

Diuretics are the cornerstone for relieving congestion in CHF exacerbations, with **loop diuretics first-line** and combination or natriuresis-guided strategies used to overcome resistance and minimize adverse effects [^1129dhbW] [^116E5MVj] [^117JYihV].

### Beyond diuretics: management of volume overload in acute heart failure syndromes [^111r2iY7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Diuretics are an established foundation of therapy for patients with chronic heart failure (HF) as well as for those hospitalized for treatment of acute HF syndromes. Despite the accepted use of diuretics in acute HF syndromes, treatment patterns with diuretics vary widely, and there are no data from randomized studies on the benefit of diuretics on morbidity or mortality in patients hospitalized with acute HF syndromes. Additional pharmacologic therapies that complement or replace diuretics in this setting, especially in patients with diuretic resistance, include positive inotropes, nitrovasodilators, and natriuretic peptides, but data are likewise lacking on important clinical outcomes. Ultrafiltration has also been used as a nonpharmacologic strategy to treat patients with acute HF syndromes who exhibit resistance to diuretics. Effective monitoring of volume status with newer modalities may allow more selective use of diuretics and diuretic-like modalities, but additional randomized trial data are clearly needed to establish ideal strategies to promote volume removal in acute HF syndromes.

### Great debate: in patients with decompensated heart failure, acetazolamide in addition to loop diuretics is the first choice [^115wbBZW]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Contra

Chronic HF and acute decompensated HF belong to the most common hospital admission diagnoses in the Western world. Following an initial cardiac injury and development of myocardial damage, subsequent cardiac decompensations are associated with increased myocardial load responsible for the structural and functional deterioration of the failing myocardium. Clinical hallmarks of acute decompensated HF are congestion, volume overload, and systemic hypoperfusion.

Decongestive strategies in acute heart failure

Decongestion through enhanced diuresis is one of the most important early treatment goals in patients with acute decompensated HF. Diuretic therapies are primarily based on loop diuretics along with additional pharmacotherapeutic options for increasing urine output. This includes primarily loop diuretics but also other pharmacotherapies such as acetazolamide (a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acting in the proximal tubule of the kidney) and HCTZ (a competitor for the sodium–chloride cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule, leading to increased natriuresis and urine production).

It has been decades since the introduction of new therapies for acute decompensated HF. Several trials testing in patients with acute decompensated HF failed to show the benefit of novel pharmacotherapies on post-discharge outcomes, thus highlighting a critical unmet need. Administration of natriuretic peptides (nesiritide or ularitide), vasopressin antagonism, and ultrafiltration, in addition to standard diuretic regimens have not shown consistent clinical benefits in patients with acute decompensated HF.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^111vwuTT]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Acute heart failure — ultrafiltration is not supported as first-line therapy; the CARESS-HF trial failed to demonstrate a benefit of ultrafiltration compared with a prescribed stepwise escalation of diuretic therapy, and available evidence does not support ultrafiltration as a first-line therapy for acute HF, and its use should be reserved for patients with persistent congestion refractory to escalation of diuretic therapies.

### Great debate: in patients with decompensated heart failure, acetazolamide in addition to loop diuretics is the first choice [^11626Rm1]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Given the lack of scientific evidence, the 2021 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines on HF recommend intravenous (i.v.) loop diuretics for all patients with AHF (Class I, level of evidence C, i.e. expert consensus) and consider the combination of a loop diuretic with thiazide-type diuretics in patients with resistant oedema (IIa, B).

Luckily, in 2022, three seminal trials on medical treatments to relieve congestion additive to loop diuretics have been published.

In patients with AHF (reduced and preserved ejection fractions) and volume overload in the ADVOR (Acetazolamide in Decompensated Heart Failure with Volume Overload) trial, i.v. application of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide for 3 days in addition to i.v. loop diuretics led to more efficient decongestion and higher cumulative urine output and natriuresis. The CLOROTIC (Safety and Efficacy of the Combination of Loop with Thiazide-type Diuretics in Patients with Decompensated Heart Failure) trial demonstrated that the addition of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) to i.v. loop diuretic therapy improved the diuretic response in patients with AHF, although there was no significant difference in patient-reported dyspnoea. In a novel design using a 'win ratio' as the primary endpoint, the EMPULSE (EMPagliflozin 10 mg compared with placebo, initiated in patients hospitalized for acUte heart faiLure who have been StabilisEd) study randomized patients with acute de novo or decompensated HF after stabilization (3 days of median time from hospital admission to randomization) to the SGLT2i empagliflozin or placebo. After 90 days, a clinical benefit occurred significantly more often in patients treated with empagliflozin vs. placebo; also, total mortality and HF readmissions were reduced. Furthermore, in a subanalysis, all decongestion-related endpoints such as weight loss, haemoconcentration, and clinical congestion score (dyspnoea, orthopnoea, and fatigue) were favourably affected by the addition of empagliflozin to furosemide.

### New medical therapies for heart failure [^116bsjGt]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) can rightfully be called the epidemic of the 21(st) century. Historically, the only available medical treatment options for HF have been diuretics and digoxin, but the capacity of these agents to alter outcomes has been brought into question by the scrutiny of modern clinical trials. In the past 4 decades, neurohormonal blockers have been introduced into clinical practice, leading to marked reductions in morbidity and mortality in chronic HF with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Despite these major advances in pharmacotherapy, our understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms of HF from epidemiological, clinical, pathophysiological, molecular, and genetic standpoints remains incomplete. This knowledge gap is particularly evident with respect to acute decompensated HF and HF with normal (preserved) LVEF. For these clinical phenotypes, no drug has been shown to reduce long-term clinical event rates substantially. Ongoing developments in the pharmacotherapy of HF are likely to challenge our current best-practice algorithms. Novel agents for HF therapy include dual-acting neurohormonal modulators, contractility-enhancing agents, vasoactive and anti-inflammatory peptides, and myocardial protectants. These novel compounds have the potential to enhance our armamentarium of HF therapeutics.

### Tolvaptan in patients hospitalized with acute heart failure: rationale and design of the TACTICS and the SECRET of CHF trials [^112cUrJD]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Congestion is a primary reason for hospitalization in patients with acute heart failure (AHF). Despite inpatient diuretics and vasodilators targeting decongestion, persistent congestion is present in many AHF patients at discharge and more severe congestion is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Moreover, hospitalized AHF patients may have renal insufficiency, hyponatremia, or an inadequate response to traditional diuretic therapy despite dose escalation. Current alternative treatment strategies to relieve congestion, such as ultrafiltration, may also result in renal dysfunction to a greater extent than medical therapy in certain AHF populations. Truly novel approaches to volume management would be advantageous to improve dyspnea and clinical outcomes while minimizing the risks of worsening renal function and electrolyte abnormalities. One effective new strategy may be utilization of aquaretic vasopressin antagonists. A member of this class, the oral vasopressin-2 receptor antagonist tolvaptan, provides benefits related to decongestion and symptom relief in AHF patients. Tolvaptan may allow for less intensification of loop diuretic therapy and a lower incidence of worsening renal function during decongestion. In this article, we summarize evidence for decongestion benefits with tolvaptan in AHF and describe the design of the Targeting Acute Congestion With Tolvaptan in Congestive Heart Failure Study (TACTICS) and Study to Evaluate Challenging Responses to Therapy in Congestive Heart Failure (SECRET of CHF) trials.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Diuretics in heart failure — key clinical considerations note that diuretics produce symptomatic benefits more rapidly than any other drug for HF and can relieve pulmonary and peripheral edema within hours or days, whereas effects of digitalis, ACEIs, or beta-blockers may require weeks or months; diuretics are the only drugs used for the treatment of HF that can adequately control the fluid retention of HF, and attempts to substitute ACEIs for diuretics can lead to pulmonary and peripheral congestion; diuretics should not be used alone in the treatment of Stage C HF, with risk of decompensation reduced when combined with an ACEI and a beta-blocker; appropriate use is key because inappropriately low doses result in fluid retention, whereas inappropriately high doses cause volume contraction and increase the risk of hypotension with ACEIs and vasodilators and the risk of renal insufficiency with ACEIs and ARBs, and optimal use is the cornerstone of successful HF treatment.

Self‐care behaviour to respond appropriately to symptoms

Appropriate responses to symptoms include patients adjusting their diuretic dose, contacting a health care provider, and decreasing activity level as well as fluid and salt intake.

Current guidelines and evidence

### Protocolized natriuresis-guided diuretic therapy in acute heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115c8MSP]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute heart failure (AHF) is one of the leading causes of hospitalization worldwide. Volume overload plays an important role in these admissions, being the primary cause of a patients signs and symptoms. The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines classify the use of loop diuretics in the acute and chronic management of congestion as class 1 A of recommendation. However, the optimal dose and monitoring strategy of loop diuretics to maximize diuresis in AHF remain controversial.

Traditional but imprecise methods of monitoring diuresis, such as weight changes, may overestimate fluid loss, leading to residual volume overload. This has been associated with increased rehospitalization and mortality rates among heart failure (HF) patients. A recent ESC consensus statement highlights that the primary goal of therapy in AHF is to achieve complete decongestion and restore euvolemic state. In this context, urinary sodium measurement has emerged as a potential tool to optimize diuretic therapy, especially within the first 24 h. ESC proposed measurement of urinary sodium two hours after the initial diuretic dose, with a result > 50 mmol indicating an effective dose of loop diuretics.

Most evidence supporting the use of urinary sodium to guide diuresis comes from non-randomized studies or small randomized controlled trials (RCTs), lacking sufficient power to establish definitive clinical benefits. Therefore, we aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of natriuresis-guided diuretic therapy compared to standard management in patients with AHF.

Diuretics in hospitalized patients: decongestion strategy (COR/LOE). COR 1, LOE B-NR states that patients with heart failure (HF) admitted with evidence of significant fluid overload should be promptly treated with intravenous loop diuretics to improve symptoms and reduce morbidity. COR 1, LOE B-NR states that for patients hospitalized with HF, therapy with diuretics and other guideline-directed medications should be titrated with a goal to resolve clinical evidence of congestion to reduce symptoms and rehospitalizations. COR 1, LOE B-NR states that for patients requiring diuretic treatment during hospitalization for HF, the discharge regimen should include a plan for adjustment of diuretics to decrease rehospitalizations. COR 2a, LOE B-NR states that in patients hospitalized with HF when diuresis is inadequate to relieve symptoms and signs of congestion, it is reasonable to intensify the diuretic regimen using either a higher doses of intravenous loop diuretics or b. addition of a second diuretic.

### Outcomes associated with a strategy of adjuvant metolazone or high-dose loop diuretics in acute decompensated heart failure: a propensity analysis [^114CJa7x]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The principal finding of this study is that in a large and diverse real‐world population, using statistical methodology to reduce the influence of confounding by indication, adjuvant metolazone use during ADHF was independently and strongly associated with hyponatremia, hypokalemia, WRF, and decreased long‐term survival. This risk associated with metolazone appeared to be largely mediated through these in‐hospital acute adverse events. However, when the use of HDLDs were subjected to the same analytic methodology, there was no risk for hyponatremia, hypokalemia, or mortality. In light of the existing randomized trial data to support the safety of aggressive loop diuretic dosing, 23 and the currently presented findings suggesting a mortality disadvantage with metolazone as well as an increased risk of electrolyte disturbances and WRF, routine escalation of loop diuretic doses may be the preferred approach for the management of ADHF until adequately powered trials are available to more definitively inform this question.

The primary treatment for ADHF is intravenous loop diuretic, and in most patients, this therapy at modest doses is adequate to improve symptoms. 24 However, compensatory sodium reabsorption that occurs in the distal convoluted tubule, the site of action of thiazide diuretics, is an important cause for diuretic resistance. 25 The addition of a thiazide or thiazide‐like diuretic (ie, metolazone) to loop diuretics, often referred to as sequential nephron blockade, inhibits compensatory distal tubular sodium reabsorption, thereby enhancing natriuresis. 26 Furthermore, unlike loop diuretics, thiazides do not directly stimulate renin secretion at the macula densa and therefore do not activate the renin angiotensin aldosterone system to the same extent. 27 Physiologically this seems like an attractive approach to decongestion, one that is supported in the current heart failure practice guidelines, despite no randomized trials comparing combination diuretic therapy with a thiazide to loop diuretics alone. 4 In fact, most studies examining metolazone use in HF are small, single‐center retrospective analyses without a control arm, published over 25 years ago, that focused on end points like urinary volume and sodium concentration as opposed to clinical outcomes. 8, 10, 28, 29 Nevertheless, the cumulative existing evidence in only 350 patients does illustrate that metolazone produces a 3‐fold increase in natriuresis, increases weight loss and improves diuresis in patients who were previously not suitable for hospital discharge. 7, 8, 9, 10, 28, 29, 30

### Clinical importance of urinary sodium excretion in acute heart failure [^111wnvFM]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The treatment of acute heart failure (AHF) has not changed over the last decades and is focused on the alleviation of congestion, volume overload, and shortening the time spent in hospital. 1, 2 As compared with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, prognosis of patients admitted for worsening heart failure is extremely poor, with almost 30–40% of patients dying within the first year, and a substantial number is rehospitalized for heart failure shortly after discharge.

Despite current treatment with loop diuretics, vasodilators and oxygen, 25% of patients with AHF still have residual signs of congestion at discharge. 3 Most of the decongestion that is achieved during hospitalization is actually achieved early after admission, with the effect of therapy decreasing in subsequent days. While loop diuretics are the most important drugs in AHF, it has also proven extremely difficult to assess its treatment effect by evaluating congestion status after start of therapy, but it is clear now that more rigorous and quick diuretic response is associated with better outcomes. 4, 5, 6, 7

Recently, a consensus paper from the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) on diuretic therapy has proposed to investigate either spot urinary sodium and/or diuresis very early after diuretic initiation in AHF. 8 It is proposed to intensify or expand (loop) diuretic treatment if natriuresis or diuresis are insufficient based on these metrics. However, scientific evidence for this recommendation is limited, since there are only scarce contemporary data on urinary sodium concentrations in spot urine in patients admitted for worsening heart failure. To further understand the physiology of natriuresis in AHF, and to put the consensus paper into clinical perspective in a contemporary AHF population, we investigated the clinical importance of urinary sodium excretion in AHF patients.

### Natriuresis-guided therapy in acute heart failure: rationale and design of the pragmatic urinary sodium-based treatment algoritHm in acute heart failure (PUSH-AHF) trial [^114rnme8]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

PUSH‐AHF is a pragmatic, single‐centre, randomized, controlled, open‐label trial to evaluate the effect of natriuresis‐guided therapy compared with standard of care on diuretic response, decongestion and clinical outcomes in patients with acute HF (Figure 1). The trial is approved by the ethics committee of the University Medical Centre Groningen, the Netherlands, and is conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference of Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. All participants provide written informed consent. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04606927). Enrolment has started in February 2021 and is expected to be completed in September 2023.

Figure 1
In patients with acute heart failure, loop diuretics are the first and only recommended choice of treatment aimed at relieving congestion by increasing diuresis and natriuresis. Actively assessing natriuresis and using this to optimize diuretic treatment could improve decongestion and clinical outcomes.

Study participants

The study population consists of male and female patients (≥ 18 years old) presenting with acute HF requiring intravenous loop diuretics (Table 1). The diagnosis of acute HF will be assessed by the treating physician based on the current ESC HF guidelines and can be both de novo or an exacerbation of known HF. Patients will be enrolled as soon as the diagnosis of acute HF is made and the first in‐hospital dose of intravenous loop diuretic is administered. Key exclusion criteria include dyspnoea primarily due to non‐cardiac causes or severe renal impairment requiring dialysis or ultrafiltration (Table 1). The inclusion and exclusion criteria were intentionally left broad to include a generalizable, real‐life, contemporary acute HF cohort.

### Diuretic strategies in patients with acute decompensated heart failure [^115XTBUA]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

Loop diuretics are an essential component of therapy for patients with acute decompensated heart failure, but there are few prospective data to guide their use.

Methods

In a prospective, double-blind, randomized trial, we assigned 308 patients with acute decompensated heart failure to receive furosemide administered intravenously by means of either a bolus every 12 hours or continuous infusion and at either a low dose (equivalent to the patient's previous oral dose) or a high dose (2.5 times the previous oral dose). The protocol allowed specified dose adjustments after 48 hours. The coprimary end points were patients' global assessment of symptoms, quantified as the area under the curve (AUC) of the score on a visual-analogue scale over the course of 72 hours, and the change in the serum creatinine level from baseline to 72 hours.

Results

In the comparison of bolus with continuous infusion, there was no significant difference in patients' global assessment of symptoms (mean AUC, 4236 ± 1440 and 4373 ± 1404, respectively; P = 0.47) or in the mean change in the creatinine level (0.05 ± 0.3 mg per deciliter [4.4 ± 26.5 μmol per liter] and 0.07 ± 0.3 mg per deciliter [6.2 ± 26.5 μmol per liter], respectively; P = 0.45). In the comparison of the high-dose strategy with the low-dose strategy, there was a nonsignificant trend toward greater improvement in patients' global assessment of symptoms in the high-dose group (mean AUC, 4430 ± 1401 vs. 4171 ± 1436; P = 0.06). There was no significant difference between these groups in the mean change in the creatinine level (0.08 ± 0.3 mg per deciliter [7.1 ± 26.5 μmol per liter] with the high-dose strategy and 0.04 ± 0.3 mg per deciliter [3.5 ± 26.5 μmol per liter] with the low-dose strategy, P = 0.21). The high-dose strategy was associated with greater diuresis and more favorable outcomes in some secondary measures but also with transient worsening of renal function.

Conclusions

Among patients with acute decompensated heart failure, there were no significant differences in patients' global assessment of symptoms or in the change in renal function when diuretic therapy was administered by bolus as compared with continuous infusion or at a high dose as compared with a low dose.

### Decongestion in acute heart failure [^1178SLXV]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Congestion is a major reason for hospitalization in acute heart failure (HF). Therapeutic strategies to manage congestion include diuretics, vasodilators, ultrafiltration, vasopressin antagonists, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and potentially also novel therapies such as gut sequesterants and serelaxin. Uncertainty exists with respect to the appropriate decongestion strategy for an individual patient. In this review, we summarize the benefit and risk profiles for these decongestion strategies and provide guidance on selecting an appropriate approach for different patients. An evidence-based initial approach to congestion management involves high-dose i.v. diuretics with addition of vasodilators for dyspnoea relief if blood pressure allows. To enhance diuresis or overcome diuretic resistance, options include dual nephron blockade with thiazide diuretics or natriuretic doses of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Vasopressin antagonists may improve aquaresis and relieve dyspnoea. If diuretic strategies are unsuccessful, then ultrafiltration may be considered. Ultrafiltration should be used with caution in the setting of worsening renal function. This review is based on discussions among scientists, clinical trialists, and regulatory representatives at the 9th Global Cardio Vascular Clinical Trialists Forum in Paris, France, from 30 November to 1 December 2012.

### Outcomes associated with a strategy of adjuvant metolazone or high-dose loop diuretics in acute decompensated heart failure: a propensity analysis [^116iMt4Z]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The primary therapeutic objective in the majority of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) hospitalizations is relief of congestion. 1, 2 Intravenous loop diuretics form the mainstay of decongestive therapy, but unfortunately, resistance to these agents is common. 3 Both US and European Heart Failure (HF) guidelines state that when diuresis remains inadequate with loop diuretic therapy, either escalation of loop diuretic dose or the addition of a thiazide diuretic may be considered to intensify the regimen, yet these recommendation are based on limited data to support the relative safety of each appraoch. 4, 5, 6 Notably, sequential nephron blockade further limits the ability of the kidney to regulate fluid and electrolyte excretion beyond loop diuretic monotherapy, potentially leading to complications such as hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and worsening renal function (WRF). 7, 8, 9, 10

In the current analysis we set out to better understand the relationship between the use of the thiazide‐type diuretic metolazone, high‐dose loop diuretics (HDLDs), and adverse outcomes during and after ADHF therapy. The ideal study design would involve a randomized controlled trial of metolazone powered for all‐cause mortality, but unfortunately such a trial is unlikely to be performed for the foreseeable future. Therefore, our approach was to use epidemiologic methods known to reduce confounding by indication, such as propensity score adjustment, to examine the above associations. Notably, these methods have been previously shown to eliminate the relationship between HDLDs and inferior outcomes, thus providing a positive control to the methodology while directly evaluating the alternative approach of high‐dose loop diuretic use. 11

### Obesity and the response to intensified diuretic treatment in decompensated heart failure: a DOSE trial substudy [^116afH6M]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Obesity could attenuate diuretic effectiveness in treatment of acute decompensated heart failure (HF).

Methods and Results

The DOSE trial randomized 308 subjects with acute HF to low- versus high-intensification intravenous diuretic therapy. We tested for statistical interactions between obesity and dosing strategy across clinical end points. After 72 hours of treatment, obese subjects (body mass index > 30 kg/m(2); n = 173) had greater volume loss than nonobese subjects (n = 119) but similar improvements in dyspnea and freedom from congestion. Both groups had greater fluid loss with high-intensification treatment. Obese subjects had a higher incidence of worsening renal function (WRF) at 72 hours with low-intensification treatment, compared with nonobese subjects. In contrast, nonobese and obese subjects had similar incidence of WRF with high-intensification treatment. There were no differences between obese and nonobese subjects in time to discharge and 60-day freedom from death, emergency department visit, or rehospitalization.

Conclusions

The incidence of WRF was greater in obese than in nonobese subjects with low-intensification treatment. However, the frequency of WRF was equivalent in obese and nonobese subjects with high-intensification treatment. Additional studies are needed to assess whether obese patients with acute HF benefit from an initial high-intensification treatment strategy.

### Patterns of diuretic titration during inpatient management of acute decompensated heart failure [^1114pbyr]. American Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hospitalization rates for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) have increased, resulting in 6.5 million hospital days annually. Despite this, optimal diuretic strategies for managing ADHF remain unclear, highlighting the need to analyze diuretic practice patterns in ADHF treatment.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of adults hospitalized for ADHF, regardless of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) between January 1, 2014 and December 21, 2021 at a large, quaternary healthcare system to determine diuretic practice patterns. We performed multivariable regression analyses to assess time to initial, second, and maximum diuretic therapy with hospital length of stay (LOS) and 30-day readmission.

Results

Among 4,298 adults admitted for ADHF (mean age 63 years, 62% male, 52% LVEF ≤ 40%) median time to max diuretic therapy was 1.8 (0.7, 3.8) days. Median time to initial IV loop diuretic dose was 3.6 (2.1, 6.5) hours, while time to second dose of IV loop diuretic dose was 10.2 (6.3, 15.1) hours. Time to initial IV loop diuretic, time to second IV loop diuretic dose, and time to maximum diuretic therapy were all positively associated with increased LOS but were not associated with 30-day readmission. There was wide variation in loop diuretic escalation strategies and use of sequential nephron blockade.

Conclusion

There was wide variation in diuretic strategies at a single academic medical center. Increased time to initial IV loop diuretic, time between diuretic doses, and longer time to max diuretic therapy were associated with increased LOS but were not associated with 30-day readmission suggesting different diuretic strategies may affect patient outcomes and warrant dedicated investigation in the future.

Practical use of beta-blockers — risks of treatment: fluid retention and worsening HF indicates initiation of treatment has produced 4 types of adverse reactions, and initiation of therapy with a beta-blocker can cause fluid retention that is usually asymptomatic and is detected primarily by an increase in body weight but may become sufficiently marked to cause worsening symptoms of HF; physicians should ensure that patients are not volume overloaded before a beta-blocker is initiated, should monitor patients closely for increases in weight and for worsening signs and symptoms of HF, and should augment the dose of diuretic if weight increases whether or not other signs or symptoms of worsening HF are present; the occurrence of fluid retention or worsening HF is not generally a reason for the permanent withdrawal of treatment, as such patients generally respond favorably to intensification of conventional therapy and once treated remain excellent candidates for long-term treatment with a beta-blocker.

Diuretics in hospitalized heart failure: synopsis and supportive context. Intravenous loop diuretic therapy provides the most rapid and effective treatment for signs and symptoms of congestion leading to hospitalization for HF. Titration to achieve effective diuresis may require doubling of initial doses, adding a thiazide diuretic, or adding an MRA that has diuretic effects in addition to its cardiovascular benefits. A major goal of therapy is resolution of the signs and symptoms of congestion before discharge, as persistent congestion scored at discharge has been associated with higher rates of rehospitalizations and mortality. Most patients who have required intravenous diuretic therapy during hospitalization for HF will require prescription of loop diuretics at discharge to decrease recurrence of symptoms and hospitalization. As background, diuretic therapy with oral furosemide was the cornerstone of HF therapy for ≥ 20 years before construction of the modern bases of evidence for HF therapies.

### Heart failure drug treatment [^1113JZUw]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Heart failure is the most common cardiovascular reason for hospital admission for people older than 60 years of age. Few areas in medicine have progressed as remarkably as heart failure treatment over the past three decades. However, progress has been consistent only for chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. In acutely decompensated heart failure and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, none of the treatments tested to date have been definitively proven to improve survival. Delaying or preventing heart failure has become increasingly important in patients who are prone to heart failure. The prevention of worsening chronic heart failure and hospitalisations for acute decompensation is also of great importance. The objective of this Series paper is to provide a concise and practical summary of the available drug treatments for heart failure. We support the implementation of the international guidelines. We offer views on the basis of our personal experience in research areas that have insufficient evidence. The best possible evidence-based drug treatment (including inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and β blockers) is useful only when optimally implemented. However, implementation might be challenging. We believe that disease management programmes can be helpful in providing a multidisciplinary, holistic approach to the delivery of optimal medical care.

### Loop diuretics in acute heart failure: beyond the decongestive relief for the kidney [^114GBUa1]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

In patients with acute heart failure (AHF), the risk of death or rehospitalization within 60 days from admission ranges from 30 to 60%, depending on the population studied. The symptoms that drive hospital admission are linked to congestion, and loop diuretics are the most common initial therapeutic approach (used in 90% of cases). These agents promptly improve symptoms and have been shown to reduce dyspnea scores and peripheral edema. However, loop diuretics have been associated with increased rates of mortality and readmission in a graded fashion with cumulative dose and with continuous infusions. It is unclear whether this association is due to confounding by indication or whether adverse events lead to clinically meaningful outcomes accounting for these observations. In this context, neither European Society of Cardiology nor American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines provide any specific recommendation regarding starting and maintaining dosage, oral or intravenous infusion, and time course of treatment. Thus, despite the clinical efficacy of these drugs in providing decongestion and symptomatic improvement, several questions remain to be answered about the optimal approach in any given patient providing diuresis and decongestion but not tipping the balance leading to acute kidney injury (AKI), electrolyte disturbances, and worse outcomes.

### Clinical effects and safety of different strategies for administering intravenous diuretics in acutely decompensated heart failure: a randomised clinical trial [^113zZnDw]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The mainstay of treatment for acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is intravenous diuretic therapy either as a bolus or via continuous infusion.

Objectives

We evaluated the clinical effects and safety of three strategies of intravenous furosemide administration used in emergency departments (EDs) for ADHF.

Methods

We performed a multicentre, randomised, parallel-group study. Patients with ADHF were randomised within 2h of ED arrival to receive furosemide by continuous infusion (10mg/h, group 1) or boluses (20mg/6h, group 2; or 20mg/8h, group 3). The primary end point was total diuresis, and secondary end points were dyspnoea, orthopnoea, extension of rales and peripheral oedema, blood pressure, respiratory and heart rates, and pulse oximetry, which were measured at arrival and 3, 6, 12 and 24h after treatment onset. We also measured serum creatinine, sodium and potassium levels at arrival and after 24h.

Results

Group 1 patients (n = 36) showed greater 24h diuresis (3705mL) than those in groups 2 (n = 37) and 3 (n = 36) (3093 and 2670mL, respectively; p < 0.01), and this greater diuretic effect was observed earlier. However, no differences were observed among groups in the nine secondary clinical end points evaluated. Creatinine deterioration developed in 15.6% of patients, hyponatraemia in 9.2%, and hypokalaemia in 19.3%, with the only difference among groups observed in hypokalaemia (group 1, 36.3%; group 2, 13.5%; group 3, 8.3%; p < 0.01).

Conclusions

In patients with ADHF attending the ED, boluses of furosemide have a smaller diuretic effect but provide similar clinical relief, similar preservation of renal function, and a lower incidence of hypokalaemia than continuous infusion.

Trial Registration Number

This randomised trial was registered in the European Clinical Trial Database (EudraCT) with the reference number 2008–004488–20.

### Flexible diuretic titration in chronic heart failure: where is the evidence? [^115S2ogt]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Several sets of heart failure (HF) consensus/guideline statements support the use of a flexible diuretic dosing regimen for HF outpatient management of fluid overload-related signs and symptoms. However, despite the widespread acceptance of such an approach, the evidence supporting the effectiveness of this approach in improving clinical outcomes is unknown. The primary objective of this manuscript was to summarize and review the evidence supporting the use of a flexible diuretic regimen in the management of outpatient heart failure patients.

Methods and Results

A systematic review was performed, and 9 studies were identified relevant to the question of flexible diuretic titration in the setting of chronic heart failure. Among the 9 studies, 5 were randomized. Three of the randomized trials included flexible diuretic titration as part of a broader multifaceted disease management program, and only 2 were designed to specifically evaluate the sole contribution of flexible diuretic titration. Collectively, data from all of the studies reviewed supported the idea that flexible and individualized diuretic dosing is potentially associated with reduced emergency room visits, reduced rehospitalization, and improved quality of life in HF patients with reduced ejection fraction.

Conclusions

To date, only 2 randomized clinical studies were identified that were designed to determine the effects of a flexible diuretic dosing regimen in outpatient HF patients with reduced ejection fraction. Data are lacking in HF patients with preserved ejection fraction. There is a critical need to test this strategy in well designed prospective randomized clinical trials.

### Continuous versus bolus intermittent loop diuretic infusion in acutely decompensated heart failure: a prospective randomized trial [^1159j1KD]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The use of intravenous loop diuretics is a cornerstone of therapy for acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF) treatment, especially in patients admitted with pulmonary congestion and volume overload. Significant concerns have been raised regarding the risks and benefits of loop diuretics, especially about the dosage and administration regimen. Recent guidelines recommend the use of loop diuretics to reduce left ventricular filling pressure, avoid pulmonary edema, and alleviate peripheral fluid retention. Therapeutic recommendations focus primarily on symptom relief because there are no specific strategies showing a clear benefit in the outcome of ADHF. Despite the ubiquity of loop diuretic administration, high quality data supporting their efficacy and best modality of administration are lacking. In addition, impaired renal function has consistently been proven to be an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes and a leading reason why higher doses and continuous infusions are used. The use of high doses of loop diuretics has been associated with unfavorable neuroendocrine activation, worsening renal function, electrolyte disturbances, and a poor outcome. Although loop diuretics are the most commonly used drugs in ADHF treatment, their short- and long-term effects are relatively unknown; thus, it is recommended to administer the lowest dosage to patients with ADHF in order to relieve their symptoms. Some studies have provided guidelines for the administration of these drugs in clinical practice, but data interpretation remains challenging due to the frequent exclusion of patients with kidney disease from major ADHF clinical trials. Therefore, it is not clear if continuous infusion is better than intermittent boluses in terms of decongestion, maintenance of renal filtration function, and prognosis. In theory, intermittent boluses could lead to more unfavorable hemodynamic changes, be associated with a higher rate of diuretic resistance due to suboptimal drug levels in the renal tubules, and result in a rebound in sodium reabsorption. On the other hand, continuous administration should provide more constant delivery of diuretic into the tubule, potentially reducing this phenomenon. Additionally, continuous infusion may induce an increased dieresis, reducing systemic and pulmonary congestion more efficaciously, thus avoiding sudden blood pressure reduction induced by bolus administration. However, for the same reasons, continuous infusion is associated with sustained neuroendocrine activation and electrolyte imbalance that could potentially be reduced by intermittent administration.

### The use of diuretics in heart failure with congestion-a position statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^115RN2Sg]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

The vast majority of acute heart failure episodes are characterized by increasing symptoms and signs of congestion with volume overload. The goal of therapy in those patients is the relief of congestion through achieving a state of euvolaemia, mainly through the use of diuretic therapy. The appropriate use of diuretics however remains challenging, especially when worsening renal function, diuretic resistance and electrolyte disturbances occur. This position paper focuses on the use of diuretics in heart failure with congestion. The manuscript addresses frequently encountered challenges, such as (i) evaluation of congestion and clinical euvolaemia, (ii) assessment of diuretic response/resistance in the treatment of acute heart failure, (iii) an approach towards stepped pharmacologic diuretic strategies, based upon diuretic response, and (iv) management of common electrolyte disturbances. Recommendations are made in line with available guidelines, evidence and expert opinion.

### Dissecting the "CHF admission": an evidence-based review of the evaluation and management of acute decompensated heart failure for the hospitalist [^1154uEqq]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is one of the most common conditions managed by hospitalists. Here we review the most recent evidence applicable to hospitalists for the diagnosis, risk stratification, and management of patients presenting with ADHF. By following a structured approach based on the patient's symptoms, history, physical examination, and laboratory testing, the clinician can make the diagnosis of heart failure efficiently. Because patients exhibit a wide spectrum of risk for adverse outcomes, both in the hospital and after discharge, assessing for clinical factors associated with these outcomes is essential. Congestion should be managed primarily with diuretics, and vasodilators may be helpful in certain patients. Given high rates of readmission, hospitalists should ensure that patients received evidence-based therapy, heart failure education is performed, and follow-up is in place before discharge.

### Continuous infusion versus intermittent boluses of furosemide in acute heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115fanwC]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute heart failure is a common cause of hospital admission. This study aims to compare continuous infusion and intermittent boluses of furosemide in treating acute heart failure.

Methods

Electronic searches were performed on PubMed, Medline, Scopus, and EMBASE. English articles comparing intermittent boluses and continuous infusion of furosemide in treating acute heart failure were included. Non-comparative studies or articles, and articles that did not report specific data for acute heart failure patients were excluded. Primary endpoints included post-treatment daily urine output, weight, length of stay, and serum sodium, potassium, and creatinine. Secondary endpoints included other pre-treatment and treatment variables. Post hoc trial sequential analysis (TSA) was performed on selected variables.

Results

Ten randomized controlled trials were included with a total of 735 patients (371 with intermittent boluses and 364 with continuous infusion). Mean daily urine output (P < .001) and weight loss (P = 0.04) were significantly higher in the continuous infusion group. Other variables were not significantly different between the two groups. TSA showed that current evidence is sufficient to draw the above conclusions about mean daily urine output, but more studies were required to compare the 2 regimens in terms of weight loss.

Conclusion

Choice of furosemide regime in acute heart failure remains physician preference. Both bolus and continuous infusion yields satisfactory outcomes.

### Proximal versus distal diuretics in congestive heart failure [^112iW3Qo]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Volume overload represents a hallmark clinical feature linked to the development and progression of heart failure (HF). Alleviating signs and symptoms of volume overload represents a foundational HF treatment target that is achieved using loop diuretics in the acute and chronic setting. Recent work has provided evidence to support guideline-directed medical therapies, such as sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists, as important adjunct diuretics that may act synergistically when used with background loop diuretics in people with chronic HF. Furthermore, there is growing interest in understanding the role of SGLT2 inhibitors, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and MR antagonists in treating volume overload in patients hospitalized for acute HF, particularly in the setting of loop diuretic resistance. Thus, the current review demonstrates that: (i) SGLT2 inhibitors and MR antagonists confer long-term cardioprotection in chronic HF patients but it is unclear whether natriuresis or diuresis represents the primary mechanisms for this benefit, (ii) SGLT2 inhibitors, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and thiazide diuretics increase natriuresis in the acute HF setting, but implications on long-term outcomes remain unclear and warrants further investigation, and (iii) a multi-nephron segment approach, using agents that act on distinct segments of the nephron, potentiate diuresis to alleviate signs and symptoms of volume overload in acute HF.

Pharmacological management

Diuretics

While almost universally used in the management of HFrEF to relieve symptoms and signs of congestion, there is little evidence for a mortality benefit associated with diuretic use. Loop diuretics are first-line treatments and recommended in cases of acute heart failure. Dose escalation may be necessary during decompensations associated with times of intercurrent infection, acute coronary syndrome or acute arrhythmia. High doses or intravenous administration may be required with renal impairment, where patients are diuretic resistant, or where there is reduced bioavailability associated with gut oedema. In the congested state, elevated serum creatinine commonly relates to reduced glomerular flow rates due to higher pressures in the efferent arterioles — a consequence of elevated central venous pressure. Escalation of intravenous diuretic therapy rather than dose reduction is indicated in this context. Where cardiac function is improved by other therapies, diuretic dose may need to be reduced, as well as at times of insensible fluid losses — for example, during periods of extreme heat or diarrhoeal illness.

Addition of a thiazide diuretic to encourage natriuresis by blocking reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubules can be helpful in diuretic-resistant patients. These patients will need closer monitoring of electrolytes and a low threshold for potassium replacement.

Four pillars of disease-modifying treatment

The neurohormonal model of heart failure is key to understanding the efficacy of disease-modifying medical therapy and is summarised in figure 4. More recent evidence for the significant benefits related to reducing heart failure admissions associated with SGLT2i expands our understanding of the pathophysiology of heart failure and cements these agents as fundamental keystones in the management of HFrEF.

Figure 4
Overview of homeostatic mechanisms in HFREF. BNP, B-type natriuretic peptide; HFrEF, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

Many patients with HFrEF have a degree of renal impairment prior to commencing therapy. Due to their mode of action, some further deterioration in renal function is to be expected with renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) — this usually stabilises and ultimately is renoprotective. Pragmatic UK consensus guidelines are available when assessing renal impairment in the patient with HFrEF. Acute kidney injury is often cited as a cause for discontinuing RAASi but such reflex response should be avoided in favour of careful monitoring and consideration of other factors leading to reductions in estimated glomerular filtration rate. Occasionally hyperkalaemia may limit RAASi and newer potassium-binding agents may have a role here, but the prognostic benefit of this approach is yet to be determined.

### Loop diuretic resistance in heart failure: resistance etiology-based strategies to restoring diuretic efficacy [^114hxaG5]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Loop diuretics are a cornerstone of symptom management for nearly all patients with heart failure. Diuretic resistance is a clinical problem with similar presentation despite diverse and multiple etiologies. Although the exact incidence is not known, diuretic resistance occurs frequently and can increase the length of hospitalization. Despite the prevalence of loop diuretic prescription in heart failure and frequency of diuretic resistance, current heart failure guidelines provide nonspecific guidance on strategies to restore diuretic efficacy. Providers are left with many questions regarding the optimum diuretic titration strategy in the setting of diuretic resistance. In light of these highly prevalent uncertainties, we present a case vignette-structured literature review of the mechanisms of diuretic resistance and recommend therapeutic strategies based on the resistance etiology to improve diuretic response in acute decompensated heart failure.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Heart failure practice guideline implementation — isolated provider interventions and disease-management systems: "A recent controlled trial has shown that the simple dissemination of an HF guideline followed by written and verbal reminders about recommended actions was unable to change the treatment of HF in the intensive care unit", and "Basic physician education and passive dissemination of guidelines alone are generally insufficient to sustain quality improvement". The report notes that "Chart audit and feedback of results, reminder systems to consider use of specific medicines or tests, and the use of local opinion leaders have had variable results", whereas "Multifactorial interventions that simultaneously attack different barriers to change tend to be more successful than isolated efforts", so "dissemination of a practice guideline must be accompanied by more intensive educational and behavioral interventions to maximize the chances of improving physician practice patterns". For disease-management systems, "Observational studies and randomized controlled trials have shown that disease-management programs can reduce the frequency of hospitalization and can improve quality of life and functional status", and "Patients at high risk for clinical deterioration or hospitalization are likely to benefit from disease-management programs and represent those for whom such interventions are most likely to be cost-effective". One randomized trial targeted elderly patients "who had been hospitalized for HF, had a prior history of HF, had 4 or more hospitalizations within 5 years, and had an HF exacerbation caused by an acute MI or uncontrolled hypertension", and reported that "Patients randomized to the disease-management program had significantly fewer hospitalizations".

### Optimal initial intravenous loop Diuretic Dosing in acute decompensated heart Failure [^111cV58x]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Hospitalization rates for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) are increasing in the United States. Between 2012 and 2017, there was a 26% increase in ADHF hospitalizations. Among adults hospitalized for ADHF, approximately 1 in 4 will be rehospitalized or die within 30 days after discharge. An inadequate diuretic response is an independent predictor of readmission in patients with ADHF. Therefore, current guidelines emphasize prompt initiation of intravenous (IV) loop diuretics in patients with ADHF and volume overload. However, effectively reducing volume overload in ADHF is challenging as up to 50% of patients are discharged with unrelieved congestion. Identification of more effective diuretic optimization strategies during ADHF hospitalizations are crucial to reducing readmission and heart failure (HF)-related morbidity.

The Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation (DOSE) trial and the Randomized Evaluation of Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction Patients with Acute Heart Failure and Dopamine trial provided valuable insights into aiding to define optimal initial IV diuretic dosing in ADHF. Collectively, these trials suggest the optimal initial loop diuretic dosing strategy should be 2 to 2.5 times the home oral loop diuretic dose as an IV bolus. However, there is wide practice variation and multiple factors contribute to receiving optimal initial IV diuretic dosing in ADHF as defined by DOSE and Randomized Evaluation of Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction Patients with Acute Heart Failure and Dopamine. For example, clinicians may be hesitant to use higher IV doses among patients on higher doses of home oral loop diuretic doses due to concern about side effects or intolerance, despite guideline support of improved decongestion. The degree to which patients with ADHF receive optimal IV loop diuretic dosing and whether home loop diuretic dose is associated with initial IV diuretic dosing remains unclear. Additionally, whether receiving optimal initial IV loop diuretic dosing is associated with improved hospital length of stay (LOS) or 30-day readmissions is also unclear. Therefore, among patients on chronic home oral loop diuretic therapy hospitalized for ADHF at a large quaternary healthcare system, we evaluated: 1) the frequency of receiving optimal initial IV loop diuretic dosing; 2) the association between baseline home oral loop diuretic dose and receiving optimal initial IV loop diuretic dose; 3) the association between receiving optimal initial IV diuretic dose and hospital LOS; and 4) the association between receiving optimal initial IV diuretic dosing and 30-day all-cause and HF-related readmission.

### Diuretic response in acute heart failure-pathophysiology, evaluation, and therapy [^116hQNS3]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2015). Medium credibility.

The administration of loop diuretics to achieve decongestion is the cornerstone of therapy for acute heart failure. Unfortunately, impaired response to diuretics is common in these patients and associated with adverse outcomes. Diuretic resistance is thought to result from a complex interplay between cardiac and renal dysfunction, and specific renal adaptation and escape mechanisms, such as neurohormonal activation and the braking phenomenon. However, our understanding of diuretic response in patients with acute heart failure is still limited and a uniform definition is lacking. Three objective methods to evaluate diuretic response have been introduced, which all suggest that diuretic response should be determined based on the effect of diuretic dose administered. Several strategies have been proposed to overcome diuretic resistance, including combination therapy and ultrafiltration, but prospective studies in patients who are truly unresponsive to diuretics are lacking. An enhanced understanding of diuretic response should ultimately lead to an improved, individualized approach to treating patients with acute heart failure.

### The added value of hypertonic saline solution to furosemide monotherapy in patients with acute decompensated heart failure: a meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^112zkMEF]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Currently, acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) represents a high burden of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Treatment of fluid overload is a major issue in the management of ADHF patients, with loop diuretics (e.g. furosemide) being the cornerstone therapy. In some patients, usual doses of loop diuretics are not enough to relieve symptoms of congestion, and up to half of the patients leave the hospital with persistent fluid overload which is associated with rehospitalizations and higher mortality. This insufficient response, known as diuretic resistance, has been shown to contribute to worsening heart failure during hospitalization, prolonged lengths of stay, and increased mortality. Adding other diuretics, such as thiazides or metolazone, acting in different sites in the nephron is a common practice trying to address diuretic resistance. However, this strategy requires careful monitoring of electrolytes, especially sodium and potassium, and renal function. Thus, use of hypertonic saline solution (HSS) in combination with furosemide has emerged as a novel therapeutic approach.

The addition of HSS to furosemide is based on its property to recall free water contained in the interstitial spaces, increasing the intravascular compartment during diuretic therapy. Subsequently, HSS can prevent the decline in effective arterial circulating volume and the consequent possible decrease in renal blood flow, being the main reason to be considered in scenarios like refractory decompensated heart failure. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta‐analysis to assess the effects of HSS plus furosemide versus furosemide alone in ADHF patients.

### Natriuresis-guided diuretic therapy in acute heart failure: a pragmatic randomized trial [^117JYihV]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study PUSH-AHF was published by Jozine M Ter Maaten and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Nat Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the PUSH-AHF study, the trial question was: what is the role of natriuresis-guided diuretic therapy in patients with acute HF? In the PUSH-AHF study, the study design was: single center, open label, RCT. In the PUSH-AHF study, the population was: 310 patients (138 female, 172 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with acute HF requiring treatment with intravenous loop diuretics. The key exclusion criteria were severe renal impairment requiring ultrafiltration or dialysis; dyspnea due to other causes. In the PUSH-AHF study, the interventions were: n = 150 natriuresis-guided therapy (natriuresis determined at set timepoints, prompting treatment intensification if spot urinary sodium levels < 70 mmol/L) n = 160 standard of care (intravenous loop diuretic without any treatment intensification). In the PUSH-AHF study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in urinary sodium excretion at 24 hours (409 mmol vs. 345 mmol; AD 63 mmol, 95% CI 18 to 109). In the PUSH-AHF study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death from all causes or HF rehospitalization at 180 days (31% vs. 31%; HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.38) Significant increase in natriuresis at 48 hours (653 mmol vs. 575 mmol; AD 78 mmol, 95% CI 10 to 145) No significant difference in HF rehospitalization (17% vs. 17%; HR 0.96, 96% CI 0.56 to 1.67). In the PUSH-AHF study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in renal events. In the PUSH-AHF study, the conclusion was: in patients with acute HF requiring treatment with intravenous loop diuretics, natriuresis-guided therapy was superior to standard of care with respect to urinary sodium excretion at 24 hours.

### Acute heart failure: current pharmacological treatment and perspectives [^114LWDGi]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute heart failure (AHF) represents the most frequent cause of unplanned hospital admission in patients older than 65 years. Symptoms and clinical signs of AHF (e.g. dyspnoea, orthopnoea, oedema, jugular vein distension, and variation of body weight) are mostly related to systemic venous congestion secondary to various mechanisms including extracellular fluids, increased ventricular filling pressures, and/or auto-transfusion of blood from the splanchnic into the pulmonary circulation. Thus, the initial management of AHF patients should be mostly based on decongestive therapies on admission followed, before discharge, by rapid implementation of guideline-directed oral medical therapies for heart failure. The therapeutic management of AHF requires the identification and rapid diagnosis of the disease, the diagnosis of the cause (or triggering factor), the evaluation of severity, the presence of comorbidities, and, finally, the initiation of a rapid treatment. The most recent guidelines from ESC and ACC/AHA/HFSA have provided updated recommendations on AHF management. Recommended pharmacological treatment for AHF includes diuretic therapy aiming to relieve congestion and achieve optimal fluid status, early and rapid initiation of oral therapies before discharge combined with a close follow-up. Non-pharmacological AHF management requires risk stratification in the emergency department and non-invasive ventilation in case of respiratory failure. Vasodilators should be considered as initial therapy in AHF precipitated by hypertension. On the background of recent large randomized clinical trials and international guidelines, this state-of-the-art review describes current pharmacological treatments and potential directions for future research in AHF.

### Diuretic potentiation strategies in acute Heart Failure [^111evRSk]. JACC: Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Several trials have evaluated diuretic-based strategies to improve symptoms and outcomes in patients with acute heart failure (AHF). The authors sought to summarize the effect of different combination strategies on symptoms, physical signs, physiological variables, and outcomes in patients with AHF. Twelve trials were identified that assessed the addition of thiazide diuretics, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, vasopressin receptor antagonists, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, or loop diuretic intensification to conventional therapy for AHF. The trials evaluated short-term markers of congestion and symptoms, and none were powered for clinical outcomes. Short-term responses (such as relief from dyspnea, physical signs of congestion, and weight change) varied greatly across studies; all diuretic strategies were accompanied by short-term increases in serum creatinine and did not demonstrate benefits on mortality or recurrent heart failure events. The available evidence suggests that intensification of loop diuretic agents produces relief of physical signs of decongestion, but the importance of different strategies for short-term decongestion strategy for health status and long-term outcomes has not been established.

Diuretics in heart failure — patient selection and dosing advises that diuretics should be prescribed to all patients who have evidence of, and to most patients with a prior history of, fluid retention and should generally be combined with an ACEI and a beta-blocker, as few patients with HF will be able to maintain dry weight without diuretics; for initiation and maintenance, the most commonly used loop diuretic is furosemide, though some respond to torsemide due to superior absorption and longer duration of action; outpatient therapy is commonly started with low doses and increased until urine output rises and weight decreases, generally by 0.5 to 1.0 kg daily, with further dose or frequency escalations (i.e., twice-daily dosing) possibly required; the ultimate goal is elimination of clinical evidence of fluid retention, and diuretics are generally combined with moderate dietary sodium restriction (3 to 4 g daily).

### Enhanced decongestive therapy in patients with acute heart Failure: JACC review topic of the week [^1156b5ce]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Because signs of congestion are associated with adverse outcomes in patients with acute heart failure (AHF), attempts were made to decongest patients as much as possible with diuretic agents (loop diuretic agents, thiazides, acetazolamide) or mechanical devices. Those interventions improved signs of congestion but failed to meaningfully improve patients' symptoms, improve quality of life, or reduce early readmissions or deaths. Recent studies have shown that implementation of guideline-directed medical therapies after an AHF admission led to both more decongestion and improved symptoms, quality of life, and outcomes. Therefore, for most patients with AHF whose symptoms and congestion can be controlled with loop diuretic agents, the main focus should be rapid guideline-directed medical therapy uptitration. Enhanced decongestion, ie, adding a second-line diuretic agent to a loop diuretic agent, should be reserved for those patients who do not respond to loop diuretic agents.

### Continuous versus bolus intermittent loop diuretic infusion in acutely decompensated heart failure: a prospective randomized trial [^114KwYW3]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation (DOSE) trial was a prospective, double-blind study in which researchers randomly assigned 308 subjects with ADHF to high-dose versus low-dose and continuous versus intermittent infusion of furosemide. This study did not reveal positive outcomes in either primary or secondary endpoints comparing continuous infusion to a bolus regimen. However, there were higher rates of acute kidney injury (AKI) in the high-dose arm. Thus, equipoise remains on this issue. Our study aimed to evaluate the effects of continuous infusion of furosemide in comparison with a twice daily regimen at similar doses, on biomarker and clinical parameters.

### Combining loop with thiazide diuretics for decompensated heart failure: the CLOROTIC trial [^114BNHTx]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

The study CLOROTIC was published by Joan Carles Trullàs and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Eur Heart J. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the CLOROTIC study, the trial question was: what is the effect of hydrochlorothiazide addition to loop diuretic therapy in patients with acute HF? In the CLOROTIC study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the CLOROTIC study, the population was: 230 patients (111 female, 119 male). The inclusion criteria were hospitalized adult patients with acute decompensated HF. The key exclusion criteria were unstable on admission; treatment with inotropic agents; or any thiazide
diuretic during the month before admission. In the CLOROTIC study, the interventions were: n = 114 hydrochlorothiazide (at a dose of 25–100 mg/day, adjusted according to GFR, plus intravenous furosemide regimen) n = 116 placebo (matching placebo plus intravenous furosemide regimen). In the CLOROTIC study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in weight at 72 hours (2.3 kg vs. 1.5 kg; AD 1.14 kg, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.84). In the CLOROTIC study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in patient-reported dyspnea using area under curve for the VAS at 72 hours (960 vs. 720; AD 240, 95% CI -436.98 to 916.98) Significant increase in weight reduction at 96 hours (2.5 kg vs. 1.5 kg; AD 1.57 kg, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.35) No significant difference in patient-reported dyspnea using area under curve for the VAS at 96 hours (1500 vs. 1320; AD 180, 95% CI -389.96 to 749.96). In the CLOROTIC study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in reduction in eGFR > 50%. significant differences in impaired renal function (46.5% vs. 17.2%), elevation in creatinine > 26.5 umol/L (46.5% vs. 17.2%). In the CLOROTIC study, the conclusion was: in hospitalized adult patients with acute decompensated HF, hydrochlorothiazide was superior to placebo with respect to reduction in weight at 72 hours.

### Optimal initial intravenous loop Diuretic Dosing in acute decompensated heart Failure [^111bd5T5]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the substantial morbidity linked to suboptimal diuresis in ADHF, the symptomatic relief from congestion provided by optimal dosing, and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Heart Failure Guidelines' endorsement for rapid, appropriate IV diuretic administration during hospitalization, quality outcome benchmarks are yet to be established. Data suggest that up to 50% of ADHF patients are discharged with persistent signs of unresolved congestion, and an inadequate diuretic response often predicts a poor prognosis for HF-related morbidity and mortality. The current analysis supports the needs for including initial IV loop diuretic dosing in the management of ADHF. Additionally, GDMT initiation and optimization during hospitalizations should be a central focus in tandem with decongestion strategies. Despite the mixed population of HFrEF and HFpEF in our study, the use of GDMT upon admission was suboptimal and should be a focus for future research.

### Natriuretic peptides: role in the diagnosis and management of heart failure: a scientific statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Heart Failure Society of America and Japanese heart failure society [^1162zeGo]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Mechanistic and prognostic insights across heart failure stages — determinants of natriuretic peptide release and outcome thresholds. A common misconception is that concentrations of BNP or NT-proBNP mainly reflect congestion in all domains; during stabilized disease, the main determinant of BNP or NT-proBNP concentrations is transmural wall stress, helping explain prognostication in stage A or B HF and strong associations with cardiac remodeling in stage C HF. Among acute HF presentations, following diuretic therapy, robust NT-proBNP reduction is strongly linked to subsequent favorable courses, whereas in stage C HFrEF without exaggerated congestion, early decrease in NT-proBNP to < 1000 pg/mL following adjustment by guideline-directed medical therapy was linked to a 74% reduction in subsequent cardiovascular death/HF hospitalization and greater improvement in LVEF by 1 year with larger NT-proBNP reductions.

### American college of cardiology / American Heart Association chronic heart failure evaluation and management guidelines: relevance to the geriatric practice [^115yovp1]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Heart failure (HF) is the only cardiovascular disease with increasing incidence and prevalence. Most HF patients are older adults. With the aging of the population and effective treatment of hypertension and coronary artery disease, the two major underlying causes of HF, the number of older Americans with HF is expected to rise significantly in the coming decades. HF is the number one hospital discharge diagnosis for older adults. It is one of the causes of frequent hospital readmissions, reflecting acute decompensation and compromised quality of life for patients and increased cost and resource use for the healthcare system. It is also associated with approximately 300,000 deaths annually, most in older adults. Advances in the management of HF in the past several decades have significantly decreased the mortality and morbidity associated with this condition. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and spironolactone on survival and quality of life of HF patients, but there is evidence of underuse of evidence-based care for HF. Several national guidelines have been published since 1994 that recommended evidence-based evaluation and management of HF. In 1995, the American College of Cardiologists (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) published their first HF guidelines that recommended left ventricular (LV) function evaluation for all patients presenting with HF and use of ACE inhibitors for all patients with LV systolic dysfunction (LVSD) unless contraindicated. The guidelines recommended the use of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate in patients who could not use ACE inhibitors. In addition, digoxin was recommended in patients with HF due to LVSD but not adequately responsive to ACE inhibitors and diuretics and in those with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular rates. Diuretic use was recommended for symptomatic patients with evidence of fluid overload. Use of anticoagulation was restricted to patients with atrial fibrillation or to those with a history of systemic or pulmonary embolism. Beta-blockers were reserved for HF patients after acute myocardial infarctions. Recent advances in the management of HF called for a revision of the guidelines.

Purpose

The purpose of revising the 1995 ACC/AHA guidelines was to incorporate recent advances in pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to HF treatment and to assist physicians in clinical decision-making in the management of HF.

Methods

The ACC/AHA invited representatives from the American College of Chest Physicians, the Heart Failure Society of America, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine to participate in the preparation of the guidelines. The writing committee searched pertinent medical literature in English using computerized databases such as MEDLINE and EMBASE and manually searching the bibliographies of the selected articles. The writing committee classified HF into four stages, including patients who are at high risk for developing HF. According to this new classification, Stage A and B represent asymptomatic patients, the former at high risk for developing HF but no structural disorder, the latter with structural disorders of the heart. Stage C encompasses patients with underlying structural heart disorders who are symptomatic, either currently or in the past. Stage D includes end-stage HF patients. This new classification is intended to complement the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification of HF into Class I (asymptomatic), Class II (symptomatic on less than ordinary exertion), Class III (symptomatic on ordinary exertion), and Class IV (symptomatic at rest).

Results

The recommendations are categorized into those for evaluation and management.

### Decongestion in acute heart failure: is it time to change diuretic-centred paradigm? [^11597CLT]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Congestion is a common cause of clinical deterioration and the most common clinical presentation at admission in acute heart failure (HF). Therefore, finding effective and sustainable ways to alleviate congestion has become a crucial goal for treating HF patients. Congestion is a result of complex underlying pathophysiology; therefore, it is not a direct cause of the disease but its consequence. Any therapy that directly promotes sodium/water removal only, thus targeting only clinical symptoms, neither modifies the natural course of the disease nor improves prognosis. This review aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the current decongestive therapies and propose a new (not diuretic-centred) paradigm of long-term congestion management in HF that attempts to correct the underlying pathophysiology, thus improving congestion, preventing its development, and favourably altering the natural course of the disease rather than merely treating its symptoms.

### Discharge diuretic dose and 30-day readmission rate in acute decompensated heart failure [^114rTE4a]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Loop diuretics play a crucial role in symptom management in patients with fluid overload. There is a paucity of data regarding optimal diuretic dose at hospital discharge for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) patients requiring loop diuretics.

Objective

To compare all-cause 30-day readmission in ADHF patients on chronic loop diuretics who had an increase in loop diuretic dose at discharge (relative to their preadmission dose) with patients without a change or a decrease in loop diuretic dose at discharge.

Methods

This was a multicenter, retrospective cohort study. Institutional review board approval was obtained. Patients admitted with a primary discharge diagnosis of heart failure, evidence of fluid overload, and reduced ejection fraction were included. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on total daily loop diuretic dose at discharge: those discharged on an increased dose and those discharged on a dose less than or equal to their preadmission dose.

Results

A total of 131 patient admissions met inclusion criteria; 50 had an increase in loop diuretic dose at discharge, and 81 were discharged with no change or a decrease in diuretic dose. Patients in the increased dose group had an all-cause 30-day readmission rate of 20% compared with 38% of patients with no change or a decrease in diuretic dose (adjusted odds ratio = 0.320; 95% CI = 0.117–0.873).

Conclusion

In patients admitted for ADHF with reduced ejection fraction and evidence of fluid overload, an increase in loop diuretic dose at discharge was associated with a reduced rate of 30-day hospital readmission.

### Great debate: in patients with decompensated heart failure, acetazolamide in addition to loop diuretics is the first choice [^114XNNUc]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Thiazide diuretics outperform acetazolamide on diuretic response

Another recent study in this field was the CLOROTIC trial that had a comparable study design and tested the hypothesis that oral HCTZ on top of a standard diuretic regimen leads to an increase in diuresis in patients with acute decompensated HF. Over the course of 3 days, the additional treatment with HCTZ led to an increase in urine production of ∼375 mL per 24 h and better weight loss but no changes in diuretic efficiency (millilitre urine production per milligram furosemide) in the HCTZ group compared with placebo. While patients showed more pronounced weight loss, the authors noted a lack of improvement in clinical symptoms (dyspnoea score) in the HCTZ group. Finally, the HCTZ group showed a higher frequency of WRF compared with placebo. Thus, it is unlikely that the results of the CLOROTIC trial will have a major clinical impact on the treatment algorithms of patients with acute decompensated HF.

### Acute heart failure is a malignant process: but we can induce remission [^116dAttL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

After the initial stabilization, multiple treatments have been proposed to further improve patients' symptoms beyond the first hours of admission. Although many of the interventions studied do show improvement in symptoms and signs, especially of congestion, none has been shown to improve patients' outcomes. The focus of many of these studies was decongestion. In the diuretic strategies in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (DOSE) trial assessing different diuretic strategies during an admission for AHFthe authors compared bolus with continuous infusion of loop diuretics and a high‐ versus low‐dose loop diuretic strategy in a 2‐by‐2 factorial design. Comparing bolus versus continuous infusion, the study did not show any significant difference in patients' global assessment of symptoms or in the mean change in creatinine level. For the second comparison of a high‐ versus a low‐dose strategy, there was a nonsignificant trend toward greater improvement in patients' global assessment of symptoms in the high‐dose group. However, with respect to outcomes, death, rehospitalization, or emergency department visit occurred in 42% of subjects within the 60‐day follow‐up period, with no significant difference between the groups, comparing continuous diuretics versus bolus (hazard ratio [HR], 1.15 [95% CI, 0.83–1.60]; P = 0.41) or the high‐dose loop diuretics group and the low‐dose group (HR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.60–1.16]; P = 0.28). In the ADVOR (Acetazolamide in Decompensated Heart Failure With Volume Overload) study, successful decongestion occurred in 42.2% of patients in the acetazolamide group and in 30.5% in the placebo group. Acetazolamide treatment was associated with higher cumulative urine output and natriuresis, findings consistent with better diuretic efficiency. However, symptoms were not improved with respect to EuroQol 5‐dimension visual analog scale at day 4, a prespecified secondary end point. In fact, EuroQol 5‐dimension visual analog scale improved numerically more in control, with mean changes of 10.3 versus 9.4 points. Nor was there reduction in readmission; death from any cause or rehospitalization for HF occurred in 29.7% of the patients in the acetazolamide group and in 27.8% of the patients in the placebo group through 3 months of follow‐up (P = not significant). Similar results were seen study in the CLOROTIC (Combining Loop With Thiazide Diuretics for Decompensated Heart Failure) study, which randomized 230 patients with AHF and a history of dependence on furosemide, 80 to 240 mg/d, for at least a month to hydrochlorothiazide or placebo. The study showed a significant 0.8‐kg higher weight loss at 72 hours in the active group, but there were no improvements in patients' dyspnea and there was an increase in renal impairment and hypokalemia in the active group. The risk of HF readmissions (37.7% versus 34.5%) and death (20.2% versus 16.4%) at 90 days were numerically higher in the active group. In the EVEREST (Efficacy of Vasopressin Antagonism in Heart Failure Outcome Study With Tolvaptan), the aquaretic agent tolvaptan significantly improved secondary end points of day 1 patient‐assessed dyspnea, day 1 body weight, and day 7 edema. As for the primary outcomes, within a median of 9.9 months, 25.9% in the tolvaptan group and 26.3% in the placebo group died, whereas the composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for HF occurred in 42% in the tolvaptan group and 40.2% in the placebo group. In the PROTECT (Placebo‐Controlled Randomized Study of the Selective A1 Adenosine Receptor Antagonist Rolofylline for Patients Hospitalized With Acute Heart Failure and Volume Overload to Assess Treatment Effect on Congestion and Renal Function), rolofylline was not beneficial with respect to the primary success/no change/failure end point compared with placebo. More patients in the rolofylline group than in the placebo group met the criteria for treatment success (40.6% versus 36.0%), but the proportion of treatment failures was also higher in the rolofylline group compared with the placebo group (21.8% versus 19.8%). Within 60 days, 30.7% of the patients in the rolofylline group compared with 31.9% of the patients assigned to placebo died or were readmitted for cardiovascular or renal causes (P = not significant). Rates of death over a period of 180 days were similar: 17.9% in the rolofylline group and 17.4% in the placebo group (P = not significant).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Dual nephron blockade and adjunct diuretic strategies — when high furosemide doses are not effective, dual nephron blockade with the addition of either a thiazide-like diuretic or a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (acetazolamide) can be considered. In the CLOROTIC trial of patients with acute HF, adding hydrochlorothiazide to an IV loop diuretic resulted in an increased diuretic response and more weight loss without a change in patient-reported dyspnea, although those receiving hydrochlorothiazide exhibited increases in serum creatinine, hypokalemia, and impaired kidney function compared with placebo, and the study was stopped prematurely due to slow enrollment, making clinical safety conclusions difficult to assess. Chlorothiazide has a short elimination half-life but is substantially more expensive, and observational data suggest that it does not increase net 24-hour urine output when compared with oral metolazone. Metolazone can be added to the IV loop diuretic at 2.5- to 5-mg doses once or twice daily. In the ADVOR trial, acetazolamide added to a loop diuretic for 3 days exhibited a greater rate of successful decongestion (42.2% vs 30.5%; P < 0.001) and a shorter duration of hospital stay compared with placebo, with no statistically significant differences in renal safety, hypokalemia, or hypotension between groups. The randomized PUSH-AHF trial showed greater natriuresis when diuretic agents were guided by spot urine sodium concentrations, without a difference in mortality or HF rehospitalization.

### Continuous infusion versus bolus injection of loop diuretics in congestive heart failure [^111RxGAz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Loop diuretics, when given as intermittent bolus injections in acutely decompensated heart failure, may cause fluctuations in intravascular volume, increased toxicity and development of tolerance. Continuous infusion has been proposed to avoid these complications and result in greater diuresis, hopefully leading to faster symptom resolution, decrease in morbidity and possibly, mortality.

Objectives

To compare the effects and adverse effects of continuous intravenous infusion of loop diuretics with those of bolus intravenous administration among patients with congestive heart failure Class III-IV.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to 2003), EMBASE (1980 to 2003) and the HERDIN database. We also contacted pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of continuous intravenous infusion versus bolus intravenous administration of loop diuretics in congestive heart failure were included

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility, methodological quality and did data extraction. Included studies were assessed for validity. Authors were contacted when feasible. Adverse effects information was collected from the trials.

Main Results

Eight trials involving 254 patients were included. In seven studies which reported on urine output, the output (as measured in cc/24 hours) was noted to be greater in patients given continuous infusion with a weighted mean difference (WMD) of 271 cc/24 hour (95%CI 93.1 to 449; p < 0.01). Electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia) were not significantly different in the two treatment groups with a relative risk (RR) of 1.47 (95%CI 0.52 to 4.15; p = 0.5). Less adverse effects (tinnitus and hearing loss) were noted when continuous infusion was given, RR 0.06 (95%CI 0.01 to 0.44; p = 0.005). Based on a single study, the duration of hospital stay was significantly shortened by 3.1days with continuous infusion WMD -3.1 (95%CI -4.06 to -2.20; p < 0.0001) while cardiac mortality was not significantly different in the two treatment groups, RR 0.47 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.69; p < 0.0001). Based on two studies, all cause mortality was not significantly different in the two treatment groups, RR 0.52 (95%CI 0.38 to 0.71; p < 0.0001).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Currently available data are insufficient to confidently assess the merits of the two methods of giving intravenous diuretics. Based on small and relatively heterogenous studies, this review showed greater diuresis and a better safety profile when loop diuretics were given as continuous infusion. The existing data still does not allow definitive recommendations for clinical practice and larger studies should be done to more adequately settle this issue.

### Continuous infusion versus bolus injection of loop diuretics for acute heart failure [^115MJc1J]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute heart failure (AHF) is new onset of, or a sudden worsening of, chronic heart failure characterised by congestion in about 95% of cases or end-organ hypoperfusion in 5% of cases. Treatment often requires urgent escalation of diuretic therapy, mainly through hospitalisation. This Cochrane review evaluated the efficacy of intravenous loop diuretics strategies in treating AHF in individuals with New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification III or IV and fluid overload.

Objectives

To assess the effects of intravenous continuous infusion versus bolus injection of loop diuretics for the initial treatment of acute heart failure in adults.

Search Methods

We identified trials through systematic searches of bibliographic databases and in clinical trials registers including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CPCI-S on the Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry platform (ICTRP), and the European Union Trials register. We conducted reference checking and citation searching, and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. The latest search was performed on 29 February 2024.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults with AHF, NYHA classification III or IV, regardless of aetiology or ejection fraction, where trials compared intravenous continuous infusion of loop diuretics with intermittent bolus injection in AHF. We excluded trials with chronic stable heart failure, cardiogenic shock, renal artery stenosis, or end-stage renal disease. Additionally, we excluded studies combining loop diuretics with hypertonic saline, inotropes, vasoactive medications, or renal replacement therapy and trials where diuretic dosing was protocol-driven to achieve a target urine output, due to confounding factors.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened papers for inclusion and reviewed full-texts. Outcomes included weight loss, all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, readmission following discharge, and occurrence of acute kidney injury. We performed risk of bias assessment and meta-analysis where data permitted and assessed certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

The review included seven RCTs, spanning 32 hospitals in seven countries in North America, Europe, and Asia. Data collection ranged from eight months to six years. Following exclusion of participants in subgroups with confounding treatments and different clinical settings, 681 participants were eligible for review. These additional study characteristics, coupled with our strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, improve the applicability of the body of the evidence as they reflect real-world clinical practice. Meta-analysis was feasible for net weight loss, all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, readmission, and acute kidney injury. Literature review and narrative analysis explored daily fluid balance; cardiovascular mortality; B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) change; N-terminal-proBNP change; and adverse incidents such as ototoxicity, hypotension, and electrolyte imbalances. Risk of bias assessment revealed two studies with low overall risk, four with some concerns, and one with high risk. All sensitivity analyses excluded trials at high risk of bias. Only narrative analysis was conducted for 'daily fluid balance' due to diverse data presentation methods across two studies (169 participants, the evidence was very uncertain about the effect). Results of narrative analysis varied. For instance, one study reported higher daily fluid balance within the first 24 hours in the continuous infusion group compared to the bolus injection group, whereas there was no difference in fluid balance beyond this time point. Continuous intravenous infusion of loop diuretics may result in mean net weight loss of 0.86 kg more than bolus injection of loop diuretics, but the evidence is very uncertain (mean difference (MD) 0.86 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 1.28; 5 trials, 497 participants; P < 0.001, I² = 21%; very low-certainty evidence). Importantly, sensitivity analysis excluding trials with high risk of bias showed there was insufficient evidence for a difference in bodyweight loss between groups (MD 0.70 kg, 95% CI -0.06 to 1.46; 3 trials, 378 participants; P = 0.07, I² = 0%). There may be little to no difference in all-cause mortality between continuous infusion and bolus injection (risk ratio (RR) 1.53, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.90; 5 trials, 530 participants; P = 0.19, I² = 4%; low-certainty evidence). Despite sensitivity analysis, the direction of the evidence remained unchanged. No trials measured cardiovascular mortality. There may be little to no difference in the length of hospital stay between continuous infusion and bolus injection of loop diuretics, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD -1.10 days, 95% CI -4.84 to 2.64; 4 trials, 211 participants; P = 0.57, I² = 88%; very low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis improved heterogeneity; however, the direction of the evidence remained unchanged. There may be little to no difference in the readmission to hospital between continuous infusion and bolus injection of loop diuretics (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.16; 3 trials, 400 participants; P = 0.31, I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis continued to show insufficient evidence for a difference in the readmission to hospital between groups. There may be little to no difference in the occurrence of acute kidney injury as an adverse event between continuous infusion and bolus injection of intravenous loop diuretics (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.49; 3 trials, 491 participants; P = 0.92, I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis continued to show that continuous infusion may make little to no difference on the occurrence of acute kidney injury as an adverse events compared to the bolus injection of intravenous loop diuretics.

Authors' Conclusions

Analysis of available data comparing two delivery methods of diuretics in acute heart failure found that the current data are insufficient to show superiority of one strategy intervention over the other. Our findings were based on trials meeting stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure validity. Despite previous reviews suggesting advantages of continuous infusion over bolus injections, our review found insufficient evidence to support or refute this. However, our review, which excluded trials with clinical confounders and RCTs with high risk of bias, offers the most robust conclusion to date.

### Clinical and research considerations for patients with hypertensive acute heart failure: a consensus statement from the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine and the Heart Failure Society of America acute heart failure working group [^116CSkhf]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Management approaches for patients in the emergency department (ED) who present with acute heart failure (AHF) have largely focused on intravenous diuretics. Yet, the primary pathophysiologic derangement underlying AHF in many patients is not solely volume overload. Patients with hypertensive AHF (H-AHF) represent a clinical phenotype with distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms that result in elevated ventricular filling pressures. To optimize treatment response and minimize adverse events in this subgroup, we propose that clinical management be tailored to a conceptual model of disease that is based on these mechanisms. This consensus statement reviews the relevant pathophysiology, clinical characteristics, approach to therapy, and considerations for clinical trials in ED patients with H-AHF.

### Diuretic use in heart failure and outcomes [^114bCPiq]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Diuretics are frequently administered to relieve congestive symptoms in patients with heart failure (HF). Despite their widespread use, prospective data on the potential of diuretics to modulate HF-related morbidity and mortality are scarce. Diuretic efficacy may be limited by adverse neurohormonal activation and by "congestion-like" symptoms that may occur in the absence of fluid overload. Herein, we review the current knowledge on diuretic use and outcomes in HF.

### Combination diuretic therapy to counter renal sodium avidity in acute heart failure: trials and tribulations [^113pMEmb]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

In contrast to significant advances in the management of patients with chronic heart failure over the past few years, there has been little change in how patients with acute heart failure are treated. Symptoms and signs of fluid overload are the primary reason for hospitalization of patients who experience acute decompensation of heart failure. Intravenous loop diuretics remain the mainstay of therapy in this patient population, with a significant subset of them showing suboptimal response to these agents leading to incomplete decongestion at the time of discharge. Combination diuretic therapy, that is, using loop diuretics along with an add-on agent, is a widely applied strategy to counter renal sodium avidity through sequential blockade of sodium absorption within renal tubules. The choice of the second diuretic is affected by several factors, including the site of action, the anticipated secondary effects, and the available evidence on their efficacy and safety. While the current guidelines recommend combination diuretic therapy as a viable option to overcome suboptimal response to loop diuretics, it is also acknowledged that this strategy is not supported by strong evidence and remains an area of uncertainty. The recent publication of landmark studies has regenerated the interest in sequential nephron blockade. In this article, we provide an overview of the results of the key studies on combination diuretic therapy in the setting of acute heart failure and discuss their findings primarily with regard to the effect on renal sodium avidity and cardiorenal outcomes.

### Worsening of chronic heart failure: definition, epidemiology, management and prevention. A clinical consensus statement by the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^111tB2rr]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Episodes of worsening symptoms and signs characterize the clinical course of patients with chronic heart failure (HF). These events are associated with poorer quality of life, increased risks of hospitalization and death and are a major burden on healthcare resources. They usually require diuretic therapy, either administered intravenously or by escalation of oral doses or with combinations of different diuretic classes. Additional treatments may also have a major role, including initiation of guideline-recommended medical therapy (GRMT). Hospital admission is often necessary but treatment in the emergency service or in outpatient clinics or by primary care physicians has become increasingly used. Prevention of first and recurring episodes of worsening HF is an essential component of HF treatment and this may be achieved through early and rapid administration of GRMT. The aim of the present clinical consensus statement by the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology is to provide an update on the definition, clinical characteristics, management and prevention of worsening HF in clinical practice.

### Need for a unified decision-making tool for ultrafiltration therapy in heart failure; call for action [^115hZA5X]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Although ultrafiltration portends several theoretical advantages over the standard therapy for acute decompensated heart failure, it might not be the optimal treatment for all patients presenting with an episode of decompensation. It is not yet clear how to prospectively identify the subset of patients that would benefit from this therapeutic modality. Based on the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying acute decompensated heart failure, early ultrafiltration therapy can be an appropriate initial management strategy for those patients with diuretic resistance whose associated renal dysfunction is related to hemodynamic changes rather than a structural abnormality. In the absence of widely accepted consensus guidelines, ultrafiltration use is currently subject to considerable variations among physicians. A clinical tool (eg, a scoring system) that is based on the individual patient's characteristics is therefore needed to prospectively identify the appropriate candidates for this therapy. Using this system is likely to portend better outcomes while helping to avoid unnecessary exposure to potential risks of extracorporeal therapies.

### Diuretics: still the mainstay of treatment [^117WKERh]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The mainstay of treatment of acute decompensated heart failure is diuretic therapy. While there are no data showing a morbidity or mortality benefit from the use of chronic diuretic therapy, diuretics rapidly improve symptoms associated with volume overload. Thus, despite concerns that some diuretics may cause harm by neurohormonal activation, these agents continue to be the first-line treatment for patients with heart failure. There is no conclusive evidence that one means of diuresis is better than another. When administration of moderate doses of loop diuretics is not sufficient, patients can be treated with higher doses, continuous infusions, or the addition of a thiazide diuretic or aldosterone antagonist. Diuretics improve symptoms but should be used in addition to other agents that improve the long-term outcome of patients with heart failure.

### Randomized controlled trial of urinE chemiStry guided aCute heArt faiLure treATmEnt (ESCALATE): rationale and design [^115thu1G]. American Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Diuresis to achieve decongestion is a central aim of therapy in patients hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). While multiple clinical trials have investigated initial diuretic strategies for a designated period of time, there is a paucity of evidence to guide diuretic titration strategies continued until decongestion is achieved. The use of urine chemistries (urine sodium and creatinine) in a natriuretic response prediction equation accurately estimates natriuresis in response to diuretic dosing, but a randomized clinical trial is needed to compare a urine chemistry-guided diuresis strategy with a strategy of usual care. The urinE chemiStry guided aCute heArt faiLure treATmEnt (ESCALATE) trial is designed to test the hypothesis that protocolized diuretic therapy guided by spot urine chemistry through completion of intravenous diuresis will be superior to usual care and improve outcomes over the 14 days following randomization. ESCALATE will randomize and obtain complete data on 450 patients with acute heart failure to a diuretic strategy guided by urine chemistry or a usual care strategy. Key inclusion criteria include an objective measure of hypervolemia with at least 10 pounds of estimated excess volume, and key exclusion criteria include significant valvular stenosis, hypotension, and a chronic need for dialysis. Our primary outcome is days of benefit over the 14 days after randomization. Days of benefit combines patient symptoms captured by global clinical status with clinical state quantifying the need for hospitalization and intravenous diuresis. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04481919.

### Optimal initial intravenous loop Diuretic Dosing in acute decompensated heart Failure [^1111F753]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Optimal initial IV diuretic dosing in adults admitted for ADHF only occurred in 67.9% of patients and higher home loop diuretic dose was associated with a substantially lower likelihood of optimal initial IV diuretic dosing. While loop diuretics remain the mainstay of therapy for ADHF, there is a great need to improve current diuretic management strategies.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE: Current optimal initial diuretic management is low, especially in patients taking higher home oral loop diuretic doses. Initial optimal intravenous loop diuretic dosing was not associated with 30-day readmission or length of stay.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: A novel diuretic quality management benchmark and a comprehensive diuretic management strategy are needed to improve quality of care for patients hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112z6NhT]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Heart failure hospitalization — diuretic management and ultrafiltration are summarized as follows: Evidence of persistent congestion at discharge has been reported in 25% to 50% of patients, and diuresis should not be discontinued prematurely because elevations in the range of 0.3 mg/dL do not predict worse outcomes except when patients are discharged with persistent congestion. In the DOSE (Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation) trial, there were no significant differences in patients' global assessment of symptoms or in the change in renal function when diuretic therapy was administered by bolus versus continuous infusion or at a high dose versus a low dose; however, patients in the low-dose group were more likely to require a 50% increase in the dose at 48 hours. Addition of low-dose dopamine to diuretic therapy in the setting of reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) did not improve outcomes overall, although a subset analysis showed increased urine output and weight loss in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 40% with significant interaction of effect with LVEF. Bedside ultrafiltration initiated early after admission increased fluid loss, with decreased rehospitalizations in some studies when compared with use of diuretics without systematic escalation, but was also associated with adverse events related to intravenous catheters.

### Self-care of heart failure patients: practical management recommendations from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^114poBeZ]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice and patients' perspectives

Reactions to symptoms need to be adapted to the individual patient. Due to changes in the patients' condition (either HF related to other reasons) the medication regimen might need to be changed (see part on side effects and medication), physical activity level and exercise training decreased, or a (temporary) change in their sodium or fluid intake needed.

Furthermore, diuretic therapy is used to treat signs and/or symptoms of congestion.

The goal of diuretic therapy is to achieve and maintain euvolaemia with the lowest achievable dose. However, clinical assessment of euvolaemia may be difficult and many patients remain congested despite increase in HF therapy. 119 The dose of the diuretic must be adjusted according to individual needs over time. A patient‐directed flexible diuretic dosing schedule based on personalized variation in fluid‐related signs and symptoms is safe in patients with chronic HF. Some patients and families might not feel comfortable making decisions to change medications or lifestyle and need support from the health care providers.

Professional attitudes and behaviour
Provide individualized information to support self‐care management to patients and caregivers. Patients may adjust diuretic therapy and/or alert their health care team in case of increasing signs and symptoms (e.g. dyspnoea, oedema, hypotension), or a sudden unexpected weight gain of > 2 kg in 3 days as a rule of thumb; however, this may need to be tailored to the individual patient.
In selected euvolaemic/hypovolaemic patients, the use of a diuretic drug might be (temporarily) discontinued.
In patients with severe generalized congestion, especially in those with gut oedema, the effect of oral furosemide may be altered due to inadequate gastro‐intestinal absorption. A change in diuretics or a switch to intravenous furosemide is recommended in order to increase diuresis, reduce generalized congestion and gut oedema and re‐establish gastro‐intestinal absorption for oral diuretics.
Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors and diuretic therapy continued during acute hypovolaemic illness significantly increase the risk of acute kidney injury and/or hyperkalaemia. One or more of these agents may need to be temporarily stopped or its dose reduced during illness. Particularly the diuretics and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists migth need to be reduced/temporarily stopped (early).

### Rationale and design of the aquapheresis versus intravenous diuretics and hospitalization for heart failure (AVOID-HF) trial [^114Msvma]. American Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In patients hospitalized with acutely decompensated heart failure, unresolved signs and symptoms of fluid overload have been consistently associated with poor outcomes. Regardless of dosing and type of administration, intravenous loop diuretics have not reduced heart failure events or mortality in patients with acutely decompensated heart failure. The results of trials comparing intravenous loop diuretics to mechanical fluid removal by isolated venovenous ultrafiltration have yielded conflicting results. Studies evaluating early decongestive strategies have shown that ultrafiltration removed more fluid and was associated with fewer heart failure-related rehospitalization than intravenous loop diuretics. In contrast, when used in the setting of worsening renal function, ultrafiltration was associated with poorer renal outcomes and no reduction in heart failure events.

Methods

The AVOID-HF trial seeks to determine if an early strategy of ultrafiltration in patients with acutely decompensated heart failure is associated with fewer heart failure events at 90 days compared with a strategy based on intravenous loop diuretics. Study subjects from 40 highly experienced institutions are randomized to either early ultrafiltration or intravenous loop diuretics. In both treatment arms, fluid removal therapies are adjusted according to the patients' hemodynamic condition and renal function. The study was unilaterally terminated by the sponsor in the absence of futility and safety concerns after the enrollment of 221 subjects, or 27% of the originally planned sample size of 810 patients.

Conclusions

The AVOID-HF trial's principal aim is to compare the safety and efficacy of ultrafiltration vs that of intravenous loop diuretics in patients hospitalized with acutely decompensated heart failure. Because stepped treatment approaches are applied in both ultrafiltration and intravenous loop diuretics groups and the primary end point is time to first heart failure event within 90 days, it is hoped that the AVOID-HF trial, despite its untimely termination by the sponsor, will provide further insight on how to optimally decongest patients with fluid-overloaded heart failure.

Patients with acute decompensated heart failure are usually critically ill and require immediate treatment. However, most are not volume overloaded. Emergency department (ED) management is based on rapid initiation of noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation and aggressive titration of nitrates. Afterload reduction with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor can be considered. A diuretic should not be administered before optimal preload and afterload reduction has been achieved. Short-term inotropic therapy can be considered in select patients with cardiogenic shock and acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) who fail to respond to standard therapy.

### Natriuresis-guided therapy in acute heart failure: rationale and design of the pragmatic urinary sodium-based treatment algoritHm in acute heart failure (PUSH-AHF) trial [^1145PfSn]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The primary treatment goal of patients admitted with acute HF is achieving euvolaemia with the use of loop diuretics. Unfortunately, a large number of patients with acute HF show insufficient response to diuretics, resulting in residual congestion and poor outcomes, such as high rates of HF rehospitalizations. Natriuresis is a sensitive marker of response to loop diuretic therapy and allows for early identification of patients with insufficient diuretic response. Urinary sodium therefore has all the characteristics required for a marker that can be used to actively assess diuretic response and to consequently guide decongestive treatment, using a stepwise approach. The PUSH‐AHF is the first trial to assess the effect of natriuresis‐guided enhanced diuretic therapy compared with standard of care on total natriuresis and clinical outcomes. If the PUSH‐AHF is able to show superiority of natriuresis‐guided therapy over standard of care, this will pave the way for more individualized diuretic therapy in patients with acute HF.

Current treatment of patients with acute heart failure and the rationale for the enhanced diuretic treatment protocol

Acute HF is characterized by signs and symptoms due to redistribution and excessive fluid retention, for which loop diuretics are the first and only guideline‐recommended treatment. Loop diuretics inhibit the sodium–chloride–potassium co‐transporter in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, resulting in sodium and chloride excretion with concomitant water excretion. Several mechanisms, such as impaired resorption, neurohormonal activation and compensatory proximal and distal tubular sodium reabsorption, contribute to loop diuretic resistance in patients with acute HF. Despite it being well known that higher diuretic doses are required in patients with HF, due to the above described mechanisms, increasing diuretic doses will over time become less effective. Insufficient response to diuretics is therefore common and a large number of patients are discharged with residual congestion after an admission for acute HF. Yet, evidence‐based data on dosing and adjustment of loop diuretics in acute HF are currently lacking. The Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation (DOSE) trial failed to show a benefit of high doses of loop diuretics compared with low‐dose loop diuretics using a randomized, double‐blind approach. A possible explanation of the neutral results of the DOSE study might be due to the enrolment and randomization of patients with both a good and an insufficient diuretic response whereas no additional effect of higher doses is expected in patients with a good diuretic response. In contrast, in patients with an insufficient diuretic response, intensification of the diuretic treatment could lead to improved decongestion and consequent better outcomes.

### Optimal initial intravenous loop Diuretic Dosing in acute decompensated heart Failure [^114xZ4D6]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Optimizing HF medical therapy from admission to discharge is critical in reducing morbidity and mortality associated with ADHF hospitalizations. Performance and quality benchmarks such as initiating GDMT before discharge and implementing thorough monitoring and follow-up postdischarge have been shown to reduce HF readmissions. While individual strategies for hospital diuretic management can reduce patient-reported congestion and improve urine output, they have not been shown to reduce hospital LOS, readmissions, or mortality. To enhance the quality of care for diuretic management in ADHF patients, a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach is required early in hospital management, akin to the early, goal-directed therapy bundles used in septic shock. The concept of early "door-to-diuretic" has shown promising outcomes, associating with reduced 30-day readmission and mortality. Therefore, a comprehensive approach should include the early administration of optimal initial IV diuretics, coupled with vigilant monitoring and diuretic adjustment based on patient response to both initial and subsequent dosing. The inclusion of key collaborators involved in the first 24 hours of admission is crucial to these time-sensitive efforts and includes first responders, the emergency department team, and any admitting teams (both cardiology and non-cardiology services). The recently concluded Efficacy of a Standardized Diuretic Protocol in Acute Heart Failure and Pragmatic Urinary Sodium-based Treatment Algorithm in Acute Heart Failure trials provide valuable insights into such strategies with standardized natriuresis-guided diuretic strategies in patients admitted for ADHF.

### Rationale and design of the "Safety and efficacy of the combination of loop with thiazide-type diuretics in patients with decompensated heart failure (CLOROTIC) trial: " A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to determine the effect of combined diuretic therapy (loop diuretics with thiazide-type diuretics) among patients with decompensated heart failure [^113QthY3]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Fluid overload refractory to loop diuretic therapy can complicate acute or chronic heart failure (HF) management. The Safety and Efficacy of the Combination of Loop with Thiazide-type Diuretics in Patients with Decompensated Heart Failure (CLOROTIC) trial (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01647932) will test the hypothesis that blocking distal tubule sodium reabsorption with hydrochlorothiazide can antagonize the renal adaptation to chronic loop diuretic therapy and improve diuretic resistance.

Methods

CLOROTIC is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter study. Three hundred and four patients with decompensated HF will be randomly assigned to receive hydrochlorothiazide or placebo in addition to a furosemide regimen. The main inclusion criteria are: age ≥ 18 years, history of chronic HF (irrespective of etiology and/or ejection fraction), admission for acute decompensation, and previous treatment with an oral loop diuretic for at least 1 month before randomization. The 2 coprimary endpoints are changes in body weight and changes in patient-reported dyspnea during hospital admission. Morbidity, mortality, and safety aspects will also be addressed.

Conclusions

CLOROTIC is the first large-scale trial to evaluate whether the addition of a thiazide diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide) to a loop diuretic (furosemide) is a safe and effective strategy for improving congestive symptoms resulting from HF. This trial will provide important information and will therefore have a major impact on treatment strategies and future trials in these patients.

### Loop diuretic therapy in heart failure: the need for solid evidence on a fluid issue [^116RksQW]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Heart failure (HF) is a common condition associated with substantial cost, morbidity, and mortality. Because results of clinical trials in the acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) setting have been mostly neutral, loop diuretics remain the mainstay of treatment.

Hypothesis

Loop diuretic use may be associated with unfavorable outcomes.

Methods

A MEDLINE literature search was performed to identify articles relating to heart failure and loop diuretics. The current evidence on the risks and benefits of loop diuretics for the treatment of ADHF is reviewed.

Results

Loop diuretics are associated with symptomatic improvements in congestion, urine output, and body weight, but have shown no long-term mortality benefit. Loop diuretics, especially at high doses, are associated with worsened renal function and other poor outcomes.

Conclusions

Loop diuretics still prove useful in HF treatment, but risk-benefit analysis of these agents in the treatment of ADHF requires a well-designed prospective study.

Objectives of diuretic therapy

Loop diuretics have a Class I recommendation in all ejection fraction classes to treat signs and symptoms of congestion, but in contrast to other medical therapies, robust clinical trial evidence to guide the use of loop diuretics is sparse, which is reflected in a Class C recommendation. Moreover, the appropriate use of diuretics remains challenging, especially in the setting of worsening renal function (WRF), diuretic resistance, and electrolyte disturbances. Thorough knowledge of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of diuretics is therefore mandatory to use them effectively (Figure 1).

Despite routine use of high-dose loop diuretics, many patients are discharged with residual clinical signs of volume overload, which is a strong predictor of poor outcomes. Although the ESC HF guidelines have a Class I recommendation (level of evidence C), only 15% of patients were free from clinical congestion after 72 h of treatment in the DOSE study. Sequential diuretic therapy has been suggested as a way to achieve better decongestion, but reliable evidence on the optimal diuretic agents, dosing schedule, and route of administration has been lacking. Importantly, the ESC HF guidelines have a Class I recommendation (level of evidence C) that patients hospitalized for HF should not be discharged with persistent signs of congestion.

Why should acetazolamide be used as a first-line agent in addition to loop diuretics in acute heart failure with volume overload?

### Clinical and research considerations for patients with hypertensive acute heart failure: a consensus statement from the society of academic emergency medicine and the Heart Failure Society of America acute heart failure working group [^112Doch9]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Management approaches for patients in the emergency department (ED) who present with acute heart failure (AHF) have largely focused on intravenous diuretics. Yet, the primary pathophysiologic derangement underlying AHF in many patients is not solely volume overload. Patients with hypertensive AHF (H-AHF) represent a clinical phenotype with distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms that result in elevated ventricular filling pressures. To optimize treatment response and minimize adverse events in this subgroup, we propose that clinical management be tailored to a conceptual model of disease based on these mechanisms. This consensus statement reviews the relevant pathophysiology, clinical characteristics, approach to therapy, and considerations for clinical trials in ED patients with H-AHF.

### Effect of admission oral diuretic dose on response to continuous versus bolus intravenous diuretics in acute heart failure: an analysis from diuretic optimization strategies in acute heart failure [^117NVoWD]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Results from the DOSE-AHF study suggest that an initial continuous infusion of loop diuretics is not superior to bolus dosing with regard to clinical endpoints in acute heart failure. We hypothesized that outpatient furosemide dose was associated with congestion and poorer renal function and explored the hypothesis that a continuous infusion may be more effective in patients on higher outpatient diuretic doses.

Methods

The DOSE-AHF study randomized 308 patients within 24 hours of admission to high versus low initial intravenous diuretic dose given as either a continuous infusion or bolus. We compared baseline characteristics and assessed associations between mode of administration (bolus vs continuous) and outcomes in patients receiving high-dose (≥ 120 mg furosemide equivalent, n = 177) versus low-dose (< 120 mg furosemide equivalent, n = 131) outpatient diuretics.

Results

Patients on higher doses of furosemide were less frequently on renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (P = 0.01) and had worse renal function and more advanced symptoms. There was a significant interaction between outpatient dose and mode of therapy (P = 0.01) with respect to net fluid loss at 72 hours after adjusting for creatinine and intensification strategy. Admission diuretic dose was associated with an increased risk of death or rehospitalization at 60 days (adjusted hazard ratio 1.08 per 20-mg increment in dose, 95% CI 1.01–1.16, P = 0.03).

Conclusions

In acute heart failure, patients on higher diuretic doses have greater disease severity and may benefit from an initial bolus strategy.

### Urinary sodium analysis: the key to effective diuretic titration? European journal of heart failure expert consensus document [^111WLHZC]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

In patients with heart failure, neurohumoral activation leads to increased renal sodium avidity across the entire renal tubules, resulting in a positive sodium and water balance, leading to decompensated heart failure requiring intravenous diuretics. As the dose of diuretic therapy required to achieve euvolaemia is difficult to estimate due to considerable intra- and interindividual differences, the European Society of Cardiology recommends assessment of the diuretic response within hours either via evaluation of the urinary sodium concentration or via urinary volume after initial diuretic administration. All diuretic agents enhance sodium excretion to a different extent depending on their side of action across the renal tubules, and renal adaptation mechanisms due to neurohumoral stimulation. Impaired sodium excretion, even in the presence of fluid loss, is associated with worse clinical outcomes. Therefore, assessing urinary sodium excretion is considered a good and direct marker of the diuretic efficacy. Such natriuresis-guided protocols have been tested prospectively by the Pragmatic Urinary Sodium-based algoritHm in Acute Heart Failure and the Efficacy of a Standardized Diuretic Protocol in Acute Heart Failure study, both demonstrating increased natriuresis and diuresis. Moreover, the Readily Available Urinary Sodium Analysis in Patients with Acute Decompensated Heart Failure study has demonstrated that a nurse-led natriuresis-guided protocol is feasible through the use of a point-of-care urinary sodium sensor, allowing an immediately readable urinary sodium result, enabling fast changes in diuretic therapy. This review summaries the rationale, current evidence and gaps supporting the role of urinary sodium concentration in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.

Diuretic therapy (Figure 6) — in hospitalized heart failure, initiate IV loop diuretics early (ED or immediately after admission) with an initial dose usually 1–2.5 times total daily oral loop diuretic agent in furosemide equivalents, and prescribe IV diuretics every 8–12 hrs or continuous while measuring daily weights and urine output and monitoring vital signs and congestion; consider addition of SGLT inhibitors for chronic therapy and consider adjunct diuretic agent such as acetazolamide. For Adequate diuresis, continue diuretics with target relief of congestion and plan for transition to oral therapy. For Inadequate diuresis, usually increase loop diuretic agent dose by 50%-100% and consider other thiazides or additional diuretic agents. For Refractory to diuretics, change course by escalating diuretics, considering additional diuretic agents or other decongestion strategies, and consider hemodynamic monitoring to guide therapy.

### Proximal versus distal diuretics in congestive heart failure [^112qPLms]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

SUMMARY

Contemporary adjunct proximal and distal diuretics have been shown to elicit clear clinical benefit in the setting of acute and chronic HF. SGLT2 inhibitors and MR antagonists both cause short-term increases in natriuresis and diuresis; however, these mechanisms may not represent the primary actions responsible for long-term cardioprotection in chronic HF patients. Similarly, short-term treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors, CA inhibitors, and thiazide diuretics increase natriuresis in the acute HF setting, however, implications on long-term outcomes remain unclear and warrant further investigation to elucidate optimal treatment regimes. Last, a multi-nephron segment approach, using agents that act on distinct segments of the nephron, can further augment diuresis to alleviate signs and symptoms of volume overload in the acute setting. Future trials are required to determine efficacy of the multi-nephron segment approach whereby mechanisms of multiple therapies converge on similar nephron segments.

Decongestion with diuretic and adjunctive therapy — initial inpatient dosing and continuation: Establishing an effective diuretic regimen is crucial for achieving decongestion, and first doses, often given in the emergency department (ED), are generally based on previous home loop diuretic doses, as in the DOSE (Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation) trial. For patients already on outpatient loop diuretics, the total daily dose should be changed to an oral furosemide equivalent and administered intravenously (IV) at 1 to 2.5 times the total daily dose. For patients not previously on outpatient diuretics, the initial furosemide dose usually is around 40 to 80 mg IV daily. In the DOSE trial, initiation of the 2.5 times higher dose led to 37% more fluid loss, 43% more weight loss, and greater dyspnea relief by 72 hours. Diuretic agents are usually continued throughout the early hospital stay, either by IV bolus every 8 to 12 hours or by continuous IV infusion.

Emergency department diuretic therapy in acute heart failure — recommendations state: Level A recommendations: None specified. Level B recommendations: Treat patients with moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema resulting from acute heart failure with furosemide in combination with nitrate therapy. Level C recommendations: Aggressive diuretic monotherapy is unlikely to prevent the need for endotracheal intubation compared with aggressive nitrate monotherapy, and diuretics should be administered judiciously given the potential association between diuretics, worsening renal function, and the known association between worsening renal function at index hospitalization and long-term mortality.

Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) — volume overload and diuretic management — states that approximately 70% of patients with ADHF have signs and symptoms of elevated ventricular filling pressures, and that loop diuretics such as furosemide, torsemide, and bumetanide are the mainstay of treatment for volume overload; HF specialists should select the most appropriate agent, dose, and route, recognize the deleterious effects of excessive diuretic use and select the lowest effective dose, and when resistance occurs must reassess the plan, adjust dose, use synergistic diuretics, and initiate therapies that augment cardiac output and renal blood flow, while balancing chronic neurohumoral blockade against hemodynamic derangements during ADHF.

### Loop diuretics in acute heart failure: beyond the decongestive relief for the kidney [^1145gCMA]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Current goals in the acute treatment of heart failure are focused on pulmonary and systemic decongestion with loop diuretics as the cornerstone of therapy. Despite rapid relief of symptoms in patients with acute decompensated heart failure, after intravenous use of loop diuretics, the use of these agents has been consistently associated with adverse events, including hypokalemia, azotemia, hypotension, and increased mortality. Two recent randomized trials have shown that continuous infusions of loop diuretics did not offer benefit but were associated with adverse events, including hyponatremia, prolonged hospital stay, and increased rate of readmissions. This is probably due to the limitations of congestion evaluation as well as to the deleterious effects linked to drug administration, particularly at higher dosage. The impaired renal function often associated with this treatment is not extensively explored and could deserve more specific studies. Several questions remain to be answered about the best diuretic modality administration, global clinical impact during acute and post-discharge period, and the role of renal function deterioration during treatment. Thus, if loop diuretics are a necessary part of the treatment for acute heart failure, then there must be an approach that allows personalization of therapy for optimal benefit and avoidance of adverse events.
