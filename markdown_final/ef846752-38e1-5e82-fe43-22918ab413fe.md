## Question

Meaning of IGE 458

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "IGE 458" means. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "IGE 458" refers to total serum IgE versus allergen-specific IgE. Then, I should verify the units and reference intervals for total IgE. Next, I will consider what a value of 458 implies clinically, including how to interpret it in the context of atopy, asthma phenotyping, and very high IgE states. After that, I need to check for potential assay interferences and the need for clinical correlation. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable interpretation with caveats and next steps.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because precision matters here. "IGE" almost certainly refers to immunoglobulin E, and "458" most plausibly reflects a quantitative total serum IgE result, typically reported in international units per milliliter (IU/mL), rather than a specific allergen code or a batch number, which would be formatted differently in laboratory reports [^876349c9].

> Wait, let me verify the units and reference ranges so I don't jump to conclusions. Total IgE is standardized against the WHO 75/502 reference, and most adult reference laboratories cite a normal range around 0–100 IU/mL, though "normal" varies with age and population, and values above 100 IU/mL are generally considered elevated. Very high levels, often defined as ≥ 1,000 IU/mL, warrant specific workups for secondary causes and comorbidities [^876349c9] [^2a6d068d].

> Hold on, I should verify what 458 IU/mL signifies clinically. A total IgE of 458 IU/mL is clearly elevated above typical adult reference limits and supports a predisposition to atopy, but it is not diagnostic of allergic disease by itself. Sensitization does not equal clinical allergy, and total IgE lacks specificity for any single allergen or disease, so results must be interpreted alongside the clinical history and, when appropriate, allergen-specific IgE testing or oral food challenges [^66c10322] [^44e45357] [^f23b67a4].

> I need to check the clinical contexts where total IgE is actually useful. Total IgE helps characterize phenotypes in severe asthma and is required to determine dosing for anti-IgE therapy such as omalizumab. It is also used in the diagnostic and monitoring algorithm for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, where serial IgE trends inform treatment response, and very high levels (≥ 1,000 IU/mL) should prompt evaluation for secondary causes and, in adults, cardiovascular risk assessment [^818ca93d] [^876349c9] [^4db4f1cc] [^2a6d068d].

> But wait, what if the elevation is nonspecific or assay-related? I should double-check for potential interferences. Very high total IgE can cause nonspecific binding in some specific IgE assays, leading to false positives; laboratories often mitigate this by diluting samples and reviewing patterns of multi-allergen positivity. Additionally, total IgE can be elevated in parasitic infections, certain immunodeficiencies, and other nonallergic conditions, so a broad clinical review is prudent when values are markedly elevated [^52bb357d] [^2a6d068d].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line so I don't overstate anything. A total IgE of 458 IU/mL is moderately elevated and consistent with atopic predisposition, but it is not diagnostic of allergy on its own. The next steps are to correlate with symptoms and exposure history, consider targeted allergen-specific IgE testing or skin testing when indicated, and use total IgE strategically for asthma phenotyping or ABPA monitoring rather than as a screening tool. If the patient has severe asthma or suspected ABPA, total IgE becomes particularly actionable for management decisions [^66c10322] [^818ca93d] [^4db4f1cc].

---

The value "IGE 458" most likely refers to a **total serum IgE level of 458 IU/mL** [^876349c9], which is moderately elevated above the typical adult reference range (0–100 IU/mL). This level suggests **atopy or allergic sensitization** [^66c10322] but is not diagnostic of any specific allergy; it must be interpreted with clinical history and, if needed, allergen-specific IgE testing [^44e45357]. Very high IgE (> 1,000 IU/mL) can signal conditions like allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis [^4db4f1cc] or primary immunodeficiency, but 458 IU/mL is not in that range. Management is guided by symptoms and exposure history, not by the total IgE alone [^f23b67a4].

---

## Clinical significance of total IgE levels

Total IgE is a **nonspecific marker** of allergic sensitization; levels vary with age, genetics, and environment [^66c10322]. In adults, a total IgE of 458 IU/mL is moderately elevated and suggests atopy, but it does not identify the specific allergen or confirm clinical allergy [^44e45357].

---

## Interpretation of IgE 458 IU/mL

| **Clinical context** | **Interpretation** | **Recommended actions** |
|-|-|-|
| General adult population | Moderately elevated; suggests atopy or allergic sensitization | - Correlate with clinical history <br/> - Consider specific IgE testing if indicated [^44e45357] |
| Patients with allergic symptoms (e.g. asthma, rhinitis, eczema) | Consistent with atopy; supports allergic etiology | - Identify specific allergens with skin or serum testing [^cd0589d5] <br/> - Implement avoidance and targeted therapy [^cd0589d5] |
| Patients with suspected ABPA or immunodeficiency | Not diagnostic; consider further evaluation if symptoms suggest these conditions | - Test for Aspergillus-specific IgE [^4db4f1cc] <br/> - Evaluate for immunodeficiency if recurrent infections [^2a6d068d] |

---

## Clinical conditions associated with elevated IgE

Moderately elevated IgE (100–1,000 IU/mL) is common in **atopic diseases** (asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis) [^e877c86b] and parasitic infections. Very high IgE (> 1,000 IU/mL) raises concern for ABPA [^4db4f1cc], primary immunodeficiencies (e.g. Hyper-IgE syndrome), or certain malignancies [^notfound].

---

## Limitations of total IgE measurement

Total IgE is **nonspecific** and cannot identify the causative allergen; false positives/negatives occur, and results vary by assay [^876349c9]. Thus, total IgE should be interpreted alongside clinical history and, when indicated, allergen-specific IgE or skin testing [^44e45357].

---

## Clinical management considerations

Management should be **symptom-driven**, not IgE-driven:

- **Confirm sensitization**: Use specific IgE or skin testing to identify triggers [^cd0589d5].
- **Avoidance and pharmacotherapy**: Tailor to identified allergens and symptom severity [^cd0589d5].
- **Monitor trends**: Serial IgE can be useful in select conditions (e.g. ABPA) [^4db4f1cc].
- **Referral**: Consider allergy/immunology for complex cases or very high IgE [^2a6d068d].

---

## Conclusion

An IgE of 458 IU/mL is a **moderately elevated, nonspecific marker** of atopy. It supports allergic risk but does not diagnose a specific allergy; management should be guided by symptoms, exposure, and, when needed, allergen-specific testing [^66c10322].

## References

### Usefulness of specific IgE antibody tests: a progress report [^75bdc4d0]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Learning Objectives

To enable the readers to recognize some of the history, problems, progress, interpretation, and present status of assays for specific IgE (s-IgE) antibodies.

Data Sources

Peer-reviewed literature in the field.

Study Selection

Key articles were selected by the author.

Results

Clinical and analytical studies have differed widely in their conclusions as to the performance of tests for s-IgE. Study conclusions depend on the testing method used, the allergen(s) studied, patient selection, and, most importantly, the standards used for comparison. Today, only a handful of the once commercially developed assays still exist, and some of these still do not compare well to an analytical ideal standard. However, with the extent of regulation and economic pressures, most of the surviving s-IgE tests are considerably improved over what had existed before them.

Conclusions

Allergic diseases with multiple symptom patterns seem to be increasing in modern societies. Objective methods are needed to differentiate allergic origins from other mechanisms that cause similar symptoms. Accurate, quantitative, and objective methods for s-IgE measurement are now available and can be used effectively in clarifying allergic diagnoses when interpreted in conjunction with the clinical history.

### IgE-binding epitopes: a reappraisal [^a1899946]. Allergy (2011). Low credibility.

Here, we discuss various questions related to IgE epitopes: What are the technical possibilities and pitfalls, what is currently known, how can we put this information into hypothetical frameworks and the unavoidable question: how useful is this information for patient care or allergenicity prediction? We discuss the information obtained by (i) 3D structures of allergen-antibody complexes; (ii) analysis of allergen analogues; (iii) mimics without obvious structural similarity; (iv) mAbs competing with IgE; (v) repertoire analysis of cloned IgEs, and other developments. Based on limited data, four suggestions are presented in the literature: (i) IgE might be more cross-reactive than IgG; (ii) IgE might be more often directed to immunologically 'uninviting' surfaces; (iii) IgE epitopes may tend to cluster and (iv) IgE paratopes might have a higher intrinsic flexibility. While these are not proven facts, they still can generate hypotheses for future research. The hypothesis is put forward that the IgE repertoire of switched B-cells is less influenced by positive selection, because positive selection might not be able to rescue IgE-switched B cells. While this might be of interest for the discussion about mechanisms leading to allergen-sensitization, we need to be modest in answering the 'clinical relevance' question. Current evidence indicates the IgE-epitope repertoire is too big to make specific IgE epitopes a realistic target for diagnosis, treatment or allergenicity prediction. In-depth analysis of a few selected IgE epitope-peptides or mimitopes derived from allergen-sequences and from random peptide libraries, respectively, might well prove rewarding in relation to diagnosis and prognosis of allergy, particularly food allergy.

### Diagnosing IgE-mediated food allergy: how to apply the latest guidelines in clinical practice [^fefc802c]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

People suspected of food allergy require accurate diagnosis to help manage their condition and get appropriate care. Recent guidelines summarize the latest evidence about diagnosing IgE-mediated food allergy, but they do not describe how to address practical issues when testing. There is a need to translate guideline recommendations into a practical common pathway that all centers dealing with food allergy can use.

Objective

The Global Network of Centres of Excellence for Anaphylaxis & Food Allergy—ANAcare developed a pathway to help clinicians apply the latest diagnostic guidelines and overcome implementation challenges.

Methods

The pathway is based on reviewing guidelines, research and clinical feedback, plus consensus of experts from 13 countries.

Results

We describe practical tips that clinicians can use when taking a detailed clinical history and testing people with suspected IgE-mediated food allergy. Tests for IgE sensitization such as skin prick tests and specific IgE are readily available and inexpensive. However, they only demonstrate sensitization, not clinical allergic disease, so they need to be interpreted in the context of the clinical history. A controlled oral food challenge may also be needed to identify which foods the person is experiencing reactions to and what quantity can be tolerated.

Conclusions

Correct diagnosis is essential to support individualized management. Allergy centers around the world can use our practical tips to help avoid under- and overdiagnosis.

The discovery of IgE and its role in allergic inflammation

While the discovery of IgE in 1966 brought to an end the search for the elusive reagin, it unlocked an era of discovery that investigated the genetics, structure, functions and clinical applications of this immunoglobulin. As has been recognised since the early part of the twentieth century, IgE has unique properties among the immunoglobulin isotypes in its abilities both to induce extremely rapid pathological responses and to act as a highly sensitive immunological amplifier. Furthermore, it is well established that IgE levels are increased in patients affected by atopic conditions and that IgE provides the critical link between the antigen recognition role of the adaptive immune system and the effector functions of mast cells and basophils at mucosal and cutaneous sites of environmental exposure. These functions have made IgE an attractive target for pharmacological intervention with IgE blockade having clinical potential across many different therapy areas.

### IgE-associated allergic disorders: recent advances in etiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^84f72c0a]. Allergy (2016). Low credibility.

IgE-associated allergic diseases belong to the most common inflammatory conditions. Their clinical manifestation ranges from mild symptoms to life-threatening episodes. Often patients experience a reduction in physical and psychologic well-being and suffer from a decreased quality of life due to disease activity. The continuously rising number of people that are affected by an allergic condition indicates an urgent need for better diagnostics and more efficient treatment options. Recent progress in the understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying IgE-associated allergic disorders has led to the identification of novel therapeutic targets and the development of drug candidates that are currently under evaluation. In this review, we highlight studies and clinical trials, which have helped to gain further insight in the etiology of IgE-associated allergic conditions as well as advances in the development of diagnostic tools and therapeutic approaches recently published in Allergy (European Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology).

### Fifty years later: emerging functions of IgE antibodies in host defense, immune regulation, and allergic diseases [^e877c86b]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Fifty years ago, after a long search, IgE emerged as the circulating factor responsible for triggering allergic reactions. Its extremely low concentration in plasma created significant hurdles for scientists working to reveal its identity. We now know that IgE levels are invariably increased in patients affected by atopic conditions and that IgE provides the critical link between the antigen recognition role of the adaptive immune system and the effector functions of mast cells and basophils at mucosal and cutaneous sites of environmental exposure. This review discusses the established mechanisms of action of IgE in pathologic immediate hypersensitivity, as well as its multifaceted roles in protective immunity, control of mast cell homeostasis, and its more recently revealed immunomodulatory functions.

### IgE receptors [^e83ef467]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

IgE receptors are implicated as important components of the immunological pathway in allergic and inflammatory diseases. Recent investigations have begun to unravel the structure, signal transduction and function of IgE receptors from different cell types in rodent and human systems. Studies of the mechanisms involved might provide opportunities for therapeutic intervention strategies in the treatment of allergic and hypersensitivity reactions.

### IgE and mast cells in allergic disease [^b5d89938]. Nature Medicine (2012). Excellent credibility.

Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies and mast cells have been so convincingly linked to the pathophysiology of anaphylaxis and other acute allergic reactions that it can be difficult to think of them in other contexts. However, a large body of evidence now suggests that both IgE and mast cells are also key drivers of the long-term pathophysiological changes and tissue remodeling associated with chronic allergic inflammation in asthma and other settings. Such potential roles include IgE-dependent regulation of mast-cell functions, actions of IgE that are largely independent of mast cells and roles of mast cells that do not directly involve IgE. In this review, we discuss findings supporting the conclusion that IgE and mast cells can have both interdependent and independent roles in the complex immune responses that manifest clinically as asthma and other allergic disorders.

### The enigma of IgE + B-cell memory in human subjects [^b35a2fce]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the origin and fate of the IgE-switched B cell has been markedly improved by studies in mouse models. The immediate precursor of the IgE-switched B cell is either a relatively naive nonswitched B cell or a mature IgG-switched B cell. These 2 routes are referred to as the direct and indirect pathways, respectively. IgE responses derived from each pathway differ significantly, largely reflecting the difference in time spent in a germinal center and thus time for clonal expansion, somatic hypermutation, affinity maturation, and acquisition of a memory phenotype. The clinical and therapeutic implications for IgE responses in human subjects are still a matter of debate, largely because the immunization procedures used in the animal models are significantly different from classical atopic sensitization to allergens from pollen and mites. On the basis of the limited information available, it seems likely that these atopic IgE responses are characterized by a relatively low IgG/IgE ratio, low B-cell memory, and modest affinity maturation, which fits well with the direct switching pathway. It is still unresolved how the IgE response evolves to cover a wide epitope repertoire involving many epitopes per allergen, as well as many different allergens from a single allergen source.

### New developments in fcepsilonRI regulation, function and inhibition [^6faa4590]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2007). Medium credibility.

The high-affinity Fc receptor for IgE (FcepsilonRI), a multimeric immune receptor, is a crucial structure for IgE-mediated allergic reactions. In recent years, advances have been made in several important areas of the study of FcepsilonRI. The first area relates to FcepsilonRI-mediated biological responses that are antigen independent. The second area encompasses the biological relevance of the distinct signalling pathways that are activated by FcepsilonRI; and the third area relates to the accumulated evidence for the tight control of FcepsilonRI signalling through a broad array of inhibitory mechanisms, which are being developed into promising therapeutic approaches.

### How IgE upregulates the allergic response [^54687219]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

For several decades it has been known that IgE is central to the allergic response. In recent years, however, IgE has been described as having several actions in addition to passively arming the mast cell or basophil by binding to their high affinity IgE receptors. Recent studies have revealed roles for IgE in the regulation of its own receptor expression and in contributing to cell survival. Furthermore, the presence of trimeric high-affinity IgE receptors on leukocytes other than mast cells and basophils, together with the discovery of previously unknown functions of the beta subunit of the complex, has added to the complexity of IgE modulation of the allergic response.

### Is IgE or eosinophils the key player in allergic asthma pathogenesis? Are we asking the right question? [^2358c893]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Despite focusing on IgE for several years, there has been relatively little consideration of pathways outside that of the mast cell and the acute phase reaction. In fact, after the discovery of IgE a great deal of attention was paid to explaining the mechanisms of acute allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis. Around the late 1970s, the role of IgE was believed to be limited to the activation of mast cells and basophils leading to the release of mediators that induced the acute phase of allergic inflammation and were responsible for the acute symptoms. From a clinical perspective, the early phase of an allergic reaction, occurring within a few minutes of exposure, is followed by the late phase, which is more complex in terms of the cellular and molecular ‘components’ involved. It is known that allergic patients sensitised to perennial allergens (or polysensitised) are constantly exposed to these substances resulting in ongoing inflammation. Observation of a time-limited early phase reaction is a rare occurrence that, in any case, develops into a late phase reaction as a consequence of the production of several mediators, cytokines and chemokines by activated mast cells and basophils. In the early 1990s, the discovery of Th2 lymphocytes, their role in controlling IgE production and in the late phase of allergic inflammation, reduced the biological importance of IgE antibodies. Thus, traditionally IgE antibodies were believed to be responsible for the classic “early phase” of an allergic reaction and considered to have only a minor (peripheral) role in the “late phase” reaction. During this period, IgE lost some “popularity” and was only considered of importance from a diagnostic perspective to confirm forms of allergic asthma through skin and in vitro testing. In particular, total IgE did not have any diagnostic significance. Despite interest in IgE antibodies being lessened, a number of studies achieved decidedly important results regarding not only the biological role of IgE but also the therapeutic effects of IgE-blocking mAbs. This was the turning point in defining the biological role of IgE and, in 2003, the introduction of omalizumab, a humanised mAb that selectively binds to IgE, for the treatment of moderate to severe persistent allergic asthma (and later also chronic idiopathic urticaria), marked a milestone in both mAb and anti-IgE therapy. The coming decades will likely witness further advances in our understanding of IgE biology, together with the introduction of next-generation anti-IgE therapies and innovative strategies to manipulate the IgE axis and modulate allergic disease.

### Advances in IgE testing for diagnosis of allergic disease [^66c10322]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Since its discovery in 1967, IgE antibody detection in skin and blood has identified a state of allergic sensitization and served as a necessary but not sufficient risk factor that requires objective symptoms to make the definitive diagnosis of human allergic disease. More recently, quantitative IgE antibody levels in serum against allergenic extracts, molecules, and epitopes have pushed its application into more accurately identifying the specificity of the allergic response for targeting immunotherapy, predicting allergic symptom severity after allergen exposure, and attempting to distinguish tolerance from food allergy. This review examines new in vivo and in vitro developments in the design, performance, interference, and application of the methods used to identify allergic sensitization. The increasing accepted applications of molecular allergen and allergen epitope-based IgE antibody measurements, especially as applied to food allergy diagnosis and management, are highlighted as state-of-the-art advances. Despite these major advances in allergic sensitization documentation, their ultimate value requires integration by the clinician with the patient's history and pretest probability of disease.

8 STATEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the aforementioned data and results, we make the following statements and recommendations (Table 1, Table 2).

Table 2 
Recommendations

It is important that manufacturers of commercially available sIgE tests communicate their data on diagnostic allergen preparation, standardization, quality control, including background definition, and inform whether their method provides quantitative results by referring to the WHO IgE standard. Development of in‐house methods for sIgE testing necessitates expertise with such methods and is rather expensive and laborious. It would be helpful if in‐house assays could aspire to  aforementioned prerequisites for commercially available tests, although in reality it is difficult to be able to include a WHO IgE standard reference. Regarding diagnostics we also stress exposure assessment by a questionnaire combined with measurement of the allergen load in the specific environment; this allows the risk of allergic disorders to be estimated. Surveillance of high risk subjects (eg, those with high level of sIgE antibodies) and individuals in “at‐risk” sites, especially workplaces, are recommended in order to take appropriate preventive measures and to optimize medication.

### Diagnosing IgE-mediated food allergy: how to apply the latest guidelines in clinical practice [^feb489cf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

This report is an important step toward addressing these challenges. It is novel in that it combines disparate recommendations from recent guidelines into a common practical pathway that can be used by all centers dealing with food allergy. We showcase how to apply guidelines in practice and provide tips to cope with challenges.

We provide practical steps for health care professionals working with people suspected of food allergy. Our target audience is professionals working in allergy centers, as well as in other hospital roles and in primary care. Not every clinic or setting will be able to undertake all the steps mentioned. We hope that describing a clear pathway concordant with recent guidelines will encourage referrals to other centers where necessary and develop more local capacity and capability over time. Different geographic regions can use this pathway to implement guidelines more consistently and harmonize how diagnostic tests are performed. This may also support more comparable data from different centers to enhance research.

Current testing guidelines for IgE-mediated food allergy

Determining the need for allergy testing and identifying the most accurate testing methods are critical in making relevant diagnoses, as well as limiting overtesting and overdiagnosis. Guidelines in the USA and Europe recommend specific IgE tests in patients with relevant medical history focusing on foods suspected of causing allergic reactions.Specific IgE test results alone are not considered diagnostic of IgE-mediated food allergy (ie, they indicate sensitisation and must be considered with clinical history).If clinical history and IgE tests are not highly predictive, an oral food challenge (OFC) is recommended.Characteristics of recommended food-specific IgE tests and OFCs are detailed in table 1.

### Serological IgE analyses in the diagnostic algorithm for allergic disease [^884d283b]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). Low credibility.

IgE antibody analyses using serological methods are an integral part of the diagnostic evaluation of a patient for allergic disease. They serve to clarify whether a state of sensitization exists in the patient as one of the many risk factors for elicitation of allergic symptoms. This overview examines the role that IgE antibody measurements play in the diagnostic algorithm when considering the pretest likelihood of disease on the basis of the patient's clinical history. Each of the 4 allergen groups (inhalants, venoms, drugs, and foods) are discussed in the context of the various in vitro and in vivo modalities for evaluating sensitization to allergens. Both the past and present analytical methods for IgE antibody detection and quantification in serum are critiqued. Causes for discordant IgE antibody levels with allergy symptoms are discussed with a special focus on analytically valid but clinically irrelevant positive IgE responses. Finally, applications are discussed where allergenic molecules provide enhanced analytical and diagnostic sensitivity and specificity when compared with results generated with allergen extract-based IgE assays.

### Targeting IgE in allergic disease [^ad6a6939]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Immunoglobulin E (IgE) represents the least abundant antibody isotype in human serum. Nevertheless, it has the ability to induce potent allergic reactions. As a key component in the development and manifestation of hypersensitivity responses against usually non-hazardous foreign substances, IgE has become a major target of investigation and the subject of multiple therapeutic approaches for the treatment of allergies. Recent advances in the understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying IgE-associated allergic disorders have led to the generation of new drug candidates that are currently in development or under clinical evaluation. In this review, we highlight molecular and structural mechanisms underlying the different anti-IgE molecules and suggest a concept of multi-level targeting using a new class of disruptive IgE inhibitors to potentially optimize treatment efficacy.

### IgE receptor and signal transduction in mast cells and basophils [^bb690b7a]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

There are many aspects of mast cell and basophil biology that are being explored today. Notably, there is a wide variety of studies of the roles these two cell types play in the development of a multitude of diseases and the role they play in the general immune response. But the original reasons for studying these two cells types--because they are considered crucial to immediate hypersensitivity reactions--remain a driving force for research. These two cell types express the complete high affinity IgE receptor and aggregation of this receptor results in the secretion of multiple potent mediators that cause many of the signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction. Understanding more about the biology of the receptor and the signaling that it initiates remains important to the development of new therapeutic approaches to inhibit this reaction.

### Allergen immunotherapy and / or biologicals for IgE-mediated food allergy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d244ddc0]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS

There may be merit in allergen‐specific immunotherapy and/or biologicals for a carefully selected group of patients, but there are also downsides including (mainly mild) reactions to manage, relatively long treatment periods and benefits potentially only lasting whilst people maintain the regimen.

Immunotherapy is also specific to the culprit food(s) and requires exposure to allergens, which may be off‐putting for some. We know little about how patient motivation to sustain the therapy may differ in various parts of the world or based on patient characteristics. When making patient‐centred shared decisions about whether to offer immunotherapy and/or biologicals to an individual, clinicians and patients need to weigh up factors such as patient preferences, motivation, accessibility and cost alongside the evidence about safety and effectiveness.

### The role of immunoglobulin E in allergy and asthma [^4d164ae6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

It has been nearly a century since the first suggestion that a soluble factor in plasma or serum might be responsible for the symptoms of allergic disease and asthma, and more than 30 yr since immunoglobulin E (IgE) was identified as the key molecule in mediating what are now described as type 1 hypersensitivity reactions (allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, food allergy, atopic dermatitis, some forms of drug allergy, and insect sting allergy). Since that time, many of the details of the inflammatory cascade underlying allergy and asthma have been elucidated, and IgE is now known to play a key upstream role. The goals of this report are to review the cellular and molecular events set in motion by IgE and to examine the evidence for its participation in both the immediate allergic response and the late-phase or chronic inflammatory response in the skin and lungs.

### How to diagnose IgE-mediated food allergy [^5a0acb08]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergy is an immune response, typically to a food protein. Accurate diagnosis reduces unnecessary dietary restrictions and economic and psychological burden on patients and caregivers but relies on a rigorous clinical history, specific IgE diagnostic tests and, where needed, oral food challenge. Increased awareness is needed around which patients to test for IgE-mediated food allergy, as well as terms commonly associated with IgE-mediated food allergy testing, in order to optimise patient diagnosis and management. Herein, we describe approaches to diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergy, appropriate interpretation of results and risks of overtesting.

### Allergen immunotherapy: a practice parameter third update [^e4b4ea16]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Medium credibility.

Allergen immunotherapy—diagnostic confirmation and eligibility—requires that a definitive diagnosis depend on allergy testing and that treatment decisions align with specific IgE results and exposure history. Immediate hypersensitivity skin testing is generally the preferred method for specific IgE, and immunotherapy should be considered when positive tests correlate with suspected triggers and exposure. Immunotherapy should not be given to patients with negative specific IgE tests or to those with positive tests that do not correlate with suspected triggers, clinical symptoms, or exposure; the presence of specific IgE alone does not necessarily indicate clinical sensitivity, and there is no evidence that immunotherapy for any allergen is effective in the absence of specific IgE antibodies.

### New treatments and the future role of immunotherapy: anti-IgE [^5f7cb702]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The review outlines an overview of anti-IgE, along with a description of the production and mechanism of action of the finished molecule. The immunologic effect of the drug and the drug complexes are detailed, and proof of efficacy is offered. The review also speculates about the role of anti-IgE in clinical use, along with potential future therapies, including gene substitution and genetic alteration.

Data Sources

The author reviewed literature studying IgE and anti-IgE antibody.

Study Selection

The expert opinion of the author was used to select relevant data.

Results

The injection of anti-IgE results in four proven reactions: free antibody is bound; not bound antibody is not dislodged to any degree; plasma B cell production of IgE drops; and high-affinity Fc epsilon RI and low-affinity Fc epsilon RII on mast cells and basophils are downregulated.

Conclusions

Based on observation of clinical reaction, anti-IgE is truly immunotherapy. Current opinion among clinical investigators about the impact of the impending approval of this new drug is that it will not replace standard immunotherapy. How it will fit into the armamentarium of physicians dealing with allergic disease, and protocols for its use, are still being debated.

### Immunoglobulin E as a biomarker in asthma [^851d94c1]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic disease that affects children and adults with significant morbidity and mortality. It is multifactorial, with genetic and environmental factors affecting the overall course of the disease. Both specific and total immunoglobulin (Ig)E can be used in specific phenotypes such as allergic asthma. Using IgE as a biomarker for asthma provides a target for management and treatment. Biotherapeutics continue to emerge as important advances in asthma treatment, and their effect on IgE and its biomarker role continue to be studied.

### The production and regulation of IgE by the immune system [^e3ce4b96]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

IgE not only provides protective immunity against helminth parasites but can also mediate the type I hypersensitivity reactions that contribute to the pathogenesis of allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis. Despite the importance of IgE in immune biology and allergic pathogenesis, the cells and the pathways that produce and regulate IgE are poorly understood. In this Review, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of the production and the regulation of IgE in vivo, as revealed by studies in mice, and we discuss how these findings compare to what is known about human IgE biology.

### The evolution of IgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity and its immunological value [^27f66ca1]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

The allergic phenotype manifests itself in a spectrum of troublesome to life-threatening diseases, from seasonal hay fever, through the food allergies, atopic eczema, asthma, to anaphylaxis. Allergy, that is an overreaction to allergen in hypersensitive individuals, results from the production of IgE, mast cell and basophil sensitisation and degranulation, requiring a range of medications to manage the conditions. Yet it is highly likely that allergy evolved for a purpose and that allergic diseases are accidental consequences of an insufficiently regulated immune response. This article presents a viewpoint from which to restore the immunological reputation of the allergic phenotype. We consider the evolutionary origins of potential allergens, toxins and parasites, and how they might have influenced early-mammal species in existence when IgE first developed. We conclude that the allergic phenotype has likely saved the lives of many more mammals than have ever died from allergy, so justifying the positive role of IgE in our evolution.

### A new framework for the interpretation of IgE sensitization tests [^26d5d46a]. Allergy (2016). Low credibility.

IgE sensitization tests, such as skin prick testing and serum-specific IgE, have been used to diagnose IgE-mediated clinical allergy for many years. Their prime drawback is that they detect sensitization which is only loosely related to clinical allergy. Many patients therefore require provocation tests to make a definitive diagnosis; these are often expensive and potentially associated with severe reactions. The likelihood of clinical allergy can be semi-quantified from an IgE sensitization test results. This relationship varies though according to the patients' age, ethnicity, nature of the putative allergic reaction and coexisting clinical diseases such as eczema. The likelihood of clinical allergy can be more precisely estimated from an IgE sensitization test result, by taking into account the patient's presenting features (pretest probability). The presence of each of these patient-specific factors may mean that a patient is more or less likely to have clinical allergy with a given test result (post-test probability). We present two approaches to include pretest probabilities in the interpretation of results. These approaches are currently limited by a lack of data to allow us to derive pretest probabilities for diverse setting, regions and allergens. Also, cofactors, such as exercise, may be necessary for exposure to an allergen to result in an allergic reaction in specific IgE-positive patients. The diagnosis of IgE-mediated allergy is now being aided by the introduction of allergen component testing which may identify clinically relevant sensitization. Other approaches are in development with basophil activation testing being closest to clinical application.

### Local and systemic IgE in the evaluation and treatment of allergy [^d2fa0e04]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Traditional descriptions of type I hypersensitivity and its manifestations center on systemic immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions to inciting antigens. Hence, many current diagnostic and therapeutic measures are based on systemic skin testing for allergy, systemic pharmacotherapy, and immunotherapy. Recent developments in rhinology and pulmonology, particularly in defining the phenomenon of local IgE production in various airway inflammatory conditions, have an impact on both medical and surgical diagnosis and management of these conditions. This review includes a discussion of allergy as a systemic disease, current systemic diagnostic and management strategies for allergy, and local IgE presence and synthesis in the upper and lower airways.

### The role of allergen-specific IgE, IgG and IgA in allergic disease [^ba2c088c]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

This article reviews the role of IgE, IgG and IgA in allergic inflammation and induction of immune tolerance in early life as well as after allergen immunotherapy. IgE, IgG and IgA result from class switching events after IgM‐bearing B cells undergo activation and differentiation in lymph nodes in response to antigen or allergen. IgG antibodies accumulate to the highest levels in lymph and blood, providing broad systemic protection. IgA is primarily secreted across mucosal barriers or into breast milk, providing an immune barrier at these interfaces. IgE is found at the lowest concentration systemically as it becomes sequestered at cell surfaces through binding to its high‐affinity receptor. Furthermore, targeting of IgE with anti‐IgE antibodies as well as the effects of passive immunization with allergen‐specific IgG is considered and discussed.

### Regulatory constraints in the generation and differentiation of IgE-expressing B cells [^2c3f204f]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

B cells expressing antibodies of the immunoglobulin E (IgE) isotype are rare, yet are heavily implicated in the pathogenesis of allergies and asthma. This review discusses recent methodological advances that permit sensitive probing of IgE-expressing (IgE(+)) B cells in vivo and have accordingly clarified the basic behavior and fate of IgE(+) B cells during immune responses in mouse models. IgE antibody secreting plasma cells can arise from extrafollicular foci, germinal centers, and memory B cells. However, compared to B cells expressing other isotypes, IgE(+) B cells are susceptible to multiple additional regulatory constraints that restrict the size of the IgE(+) B cell pool at each stage, coordinately limiting the overall magnitude, affinity, and duration of the IgE antibody response.

These data should be considered the tip of the iceberg in unraveling the multiple factors that might be driving MC activation in an individual. The challenge now is to delve deeper, taking into account the many other potential activators of MCs present in asthmatic airways, and find where there is commonality in the signaling pathways, so that multiple MC activation pathways can be targeted effectively at the same time pharmacologically.

### Human IgE antibody serology: a primer for the practicing north American allergist / immunologist [^295ae732]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

The allergist/immunologist judiciously diagnoses allergic disease by using confirmatory IgE antibody data from in vivo and in vitro assays after the collection of a clinical history. After an overview of historical events, clinically available allergen-specific IgE assays from Phadia, Siemens, and Hycor are contrasted by their design and performance characteristics. The assays share comparable working ranges, analytical sensitivities, and excellent precision, reproducibility, and linearity to a performance standard of <15% coefficients of variation. However, multiple interlaboratory studies have confirmed that the 3 IgE antibody assays either detect different populations of IgE antibody or do not measure the same antibodies with comparable efficiencies. The clinical consequence is that IgE antibody results from the 3 assays are not interchangeable or equivalent. Data generated with one assay cannot be directly extrapolated to published predictive outcomes based on IgE antibody levels from a different assay. The transition from allergen extract-based to allergenic components reagents is discussed, emphasizing the chip-based microarray's strength in identifying IgE antibody cross-reactivity. US Food and Drug Administration-cleared point-of-care IgE antibody lateral flow cassettes are overviewed. Finally, IgE antibody concentration, affinity, clonality (epitope specificity), and specific activity (specific/total IgE ratio) are examined as humoral immune response parameters measured by serologic assays that affect effector cell degranulation and ultimately allergic disease expression.

### Past, present, and future of anti-IgE biologics [^f7204326]. Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

About 20 years after the identification of immunoglobulin E (IgE) and its key role in allergic hypersensitivity reactions against normally harmless substances, scientists have started inventing strategies to block its pathophysiological activity in 1986. The initial concept of specific IgE targeting through the use of anti-IgE antibodies has gained a lot of momentum and within a few years independent research groups have reported successful generation of first murine monoclonal anti-IgE antibodies. Subsequent generation of optimized chimeric and humanized versions of these antibodies has paved the way for the development of therapeutic anti-IgE biologicals as we know them today. With omalizumab, there is currently still only one therapeutic anti-IgE antibody approved for the treatment of allergic conditions. Since its application is limited to the treatment of moderate-to-severe persistent asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria, major efforts have been undertaken to develop alternative anti-IgE biologicals that could potentially be used in a broader spectrum of allergic diseases. Several new drug candidates have been generated and are currently assessed in pre-clinical studies or clinical trials. In this review, we highlight the molecular properties of past and present anti-IgE biologicals and suggest concepts that might improve treatment efficacy of future drug candidates.

### Intrinsic and extrinsic regulation of IgE B cell responses [^c34347ad]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Stringent regulation of IgE antibody production is critical for constraining allergic responses. This review discusses recent advances in understanding cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that regulate the genesis and fate of IgE B cells. B cell-intrinsic regulation of IgE is orchestrated by the IgE B Cell Receptor (BCR). Through its antigen-independent signaling and low surface expression, the IgE BCR drives IgE B cells to differentiate into short-lived plasma cells and/or undergo apoptosis, restricting IgE-expressing cells from entering long-lived compartments. The pivotal extrinsic regulators of IgE responses are T follicular helper cells (T FH ). T FH produce IL-4 and IL-21, which, respectively, are the major activating and inhibitory cytokines for IgE class-switching. Other newly identified T follicular subsets also contribute to IgE regulation. Although IgE responses are normally constrained, recent studies suggest that specific conditions can induce the formation of IgE responses with enhanced affinity or longevity, effectively 'breaking the rules' of IgE regulation.

### Allergen immunotherapy and / or biologicals for IgE-mediated food allergy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a7ddd531]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

2.5 Synthesis of results

We used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to synthesize data about each outcome.

We pooled intention‐to‐treat data using random‐effects Mantel‐Haenszel meta‐analysis (Revman 5.4) because the studies included different populations, regimes and time periods and to avoid overweighting large but imprecise studies.

We divided studies based on the food allergy and therapy route. We undertook subgroup analysis based on risk of bias, age, allergy severity, comparator and threshold tolerated. In sensitivity analysis, we used a continuity correction (adding 0.05 to numerators and denominators) where there were no events in each study arm for severe or life‐threatening events, anaphylaxis and adrenaline use.

We used funnel plots to help assess publication bias. We quantified the heterogeneity of studies using the I2 statistic, with values <25% indicating low heterogeneity.

All task force members developed conclusions by consensus, recognizing any potential conflicts of interest, which were declared in advance. We used standardized GRADE statements to summarize the conclusions(S4 lists our wording conventions). We used the word ‘may’ to represent low certainty evidence, ‘probably’ for moderate certainty and ‘resulted in’ for high certainty evidence.

### Are our impressions of allergy test performances correct? [^3b4ae8ee]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical diagnosis is often subjective and susceptible to bias, yet it is the primary standard by which diagnostic tests are judged. Consequently, our opinions regarding various diagnostic tests may not be entirely accurate.

Objective

To investigate the accuracy of the clinical history compared with concordant skin and quantitative specific IgE (s-IgE) measurements.

Methods

Consecutive, consenting patients (N = 152) at 2 different allergy centers were examined by history and physical examination (HPE) alone to determine their sensitivity to 7 common allergens. Results were classified as positive, negative, or indeterminate. The HPE results were then compared to concordant skin prick testing (SPT) and s-IgE measurements and to quantitative IgE antibody measurements with and without knowledge of the SPT results.

Results

Diagnosis by HPE deviated considerably from concordant SPT and s-IgE results. This deviation differed between allergists and allergens, reflecting a positive HPE bias that averaged 22%. Seventy-six percent of the HPE results judged indeterminate were resolved as negative. Using additional information from the quantification of s-IgE antibodies, considerable differences between the sites in the level of s-IgE associated with a positive HPE result with and without SPT results were observed.

Conclusions

Relative to the SPT and quantification of s-IgE antibodies, the diagnosis by HPE alone to common allergens is not consistent. Discrepancies were dependent on both allergen and allergist. The quantitative s-IgE data revealed that allergists use available information from the HPE and SPT differently. Since the HPE is the primary standard used in judging test efficacy (sensitivity and specificity), our current impressions of test performances are not likely to be accurate.

### Anti-IgE: lessons learned from effects on airway inflammation and asthma exacerbation [^8d37ee90]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Omalizumab is an mAb that binds free IgE and ultimately reduces the density of IgE-loaded receptors on IgE effector cells. Because IgE effector cells, such as mast cells and basophils, are a source of proinflammatory chemokines, cytokines, and proteases, it is not surprising that omalizumab has anti-inflammatory effects, most notably large effects in reducing airway eosinophilia. What has been surprising is the nature of the clinical effects of omalizumab. Rates of exacerbation in omalizumab-treated patients are approximately half those in placebo-treated patients. This important clinical effect has occurred despite the fact that omalizumab does not improve nonspecific bronchial hyperesponsiveness and does not have large effects on airflow. The unsuspected dissociations among asthma outcomes uncovered during clinical trials of omalizumab remind us that mysteries remain for how inflammation, remodeling, and airway function are linked in asthma.

### On the role of antibody affinity and avidity in the IgE-mediated allergic response [^34142cc7]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 2 
Strength of interaction between antibody and antigen. (A) Difference between antibody affinity and avidity displayed by monovalent or multivalent antigen binding, respectively. (B, C) Lateral movement at 37°C facilitates multivalent and high‐avidity binding of IgE antibodies to allergens, while temperatures below the Krafft point at (e.g. 4°C) inhibit lateral movement and multivalent binding. Figure created with®.

Most classical physico‐chemical analysis is performed in solution, in part to avoid the effects of multivalent binding. Nevertheless, standard antibody binding assays, such as ELISA, surface plasmon resonance, and biolayer interferometry are performed with antibodies in solution; their ligands are, however, typically bound to two‐dimensional surfaces. This opens the possibility for antibodies to bind their ligands with two arms, a problem that is typically avoided by complicated coating techniques, including coating at low density to avoid avidity effects (caused by multivalent binding), as affinity (referring to monovalent binding) is much better defined by classical binding models than avidity. However, a notion often overseen is that most pathogens (i) are recognized on two‐dimensional surfaces and (ii) are highly polyvalent and therefore prone to bind antibodies in a multivalent fashion. Indeed, natural IgM antibodies bind viral particles with great efficiency due to decavalent binding which makes many antibodies stick like glue even if the binding affinity of an individual variable region is low and barely measurable.Hence, avidity may be more important in a real‐life setting. In the case of IgE bound to FcεRI on the surface of effector cells, nature adds one level of complexity: lateral diffusion. While in ELISA plates ligands are fixed on plastic, in real‐life setting IgE molecules bound to FcεRI can rapidly diffuse along the cell surface membrane, a process that strongly facilitates multivalent, high‐avidity binding of IgE antibodies to allergens (Figure 2B). In this context, it is interesting to note that the restriction of the movement of receptor‐bound IgE within the two dimensions of the cell membrane results in high local concentrations of the IgE molecules as well as allergens bound to IgE. Indeed, 10,000 molecules bound to the cell surface of regular sized cells may exhibit a local concentration of >10 −6 M within the membrane.In addition, membrane bound molecules diffuse on the cell surface with a high velocity, allowing them to circle the cell once every second.Hence, all these properties foster multivalent binding of single allergens to membrane bound IgE recognizing different epitopes on the allergen. Indeed, we could show that IgE antibodies exhibiting an affinity as low as 10 −6 M for the allergen Fel d 1, were nevertheless able to bind multivalently to FcεRI‐bound IgE on basophils and mast cells and cause degranulation of the cells.This was not possible if the membrane was brought below the Krafft point, the temperature at which cholesterol in membranes freezes, not allowing for lateral diffusion of molecules (Figure 2C). Thus, lateral diffusion of IgE allows for multivalent binding of allergen, causing high‐avidity interactions, and consequently, low‐affinity IgE antibodies can trigger cellular activation.This effect may be particularly pronounced for dimeric allergens. Indeed, a case in point is the cat allergen Fel d 1, which is naturally dimeric and causes particularly strong allergies.These data may also explain the often unexpectedly high cross‐reactivity between structurally unrelated allergens such as birch allergens and latex. Moreover, other allergens such as Api g 1 (celery), Cry j 2 (Japanese cedar), or Ole e 1 (olive) also commonly occur as dimers.Interestingly, many allergens that are considered to be monomeric (e.g. Bet v 1, Der p 2) still harbour the ability to form dimers, depending on parameters such as protein concentration or pH.The dimerization of allergens often leads to increased allergenicity, highlighting the importance of multivalency and avidity interactions in allergic reactions.

### IgE regulation and roles in asthma pathogenesis [^98f0f305]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Asthma and the predisposition to produce IgE are inherited as linked traits in families. In patients IgE levels correlate with asthma severity and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The concept that IgE plays a critical role in asthma pathogenesis has driven the development of IgE blockers, which are currently being introduced into clinical use. This review focuses on the mechanisms whereby IgE participates both in immediate hypersensitivity responses in the airways and in the induction of chronic allergic bronchial inflammation. The molecular genetic events that give rise to IgE production by B cells and the cellular and cytokine factors that support IgE production in the bronchial mucosal microenvironment are discussed. It is clear that much remains to be learned regarding the roles of IgE in asthma and the genetic and environmental influences that lead to its production. Over the next few years, the emerging experience with anti-IgE in patients will provide a more complete understanding of the mechanisms whereby IgE contributes to disease, as well as the therapeutic potential of its inhibition.

### The regulation of immunoglobulin E class-switch recombination [^b21aed1c]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2003). Medium credibility.

Immunoglobulin E (IgE) isotype antibodies are associated with atopic disease, namely allergic rhinitis, asthma and atopic dermatitis, but are also involved in host immune defence mechanisms against parasitic infection. The commitment of a B cell to isotype class switch to an IgE-producing cell is a tightly regulated process, and our understanding of the regulation of IgE-antibody production is central to the prevention and treatment of atopic disease. Both those that are presently in use and potential future therapies to prevent IgE-mediated disease take advantage of our existing knowledge of the specific mechanisms that are required for IgE class switching.

### Clinical significance of very high IgE levels (≥ 1000 IU / mL): population-based study of 118, 211 adults [^2a6d068d]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig 2 
Suggested algorithm for clinical management of asymptomatic adult patients with serum IgE ≥ 1000 IU/mL. First, rule out allergic disorders such as atopic dermatitis and asthma, as well as parasitic infections. Management then depends on patient’s age group. Screening for eosinophilic disorders, including CBC, should be conducted in all age groups. For young adults (18-30 years), investigate IEI by first looking for red flags,then performing basic immune assessment. For patients aged 31-64 years with IgE ≥ 1000 IU/mL, follow guidelines for assessing 10-year CVD risk and treat other CVD risk factors accordingly. CBC, Complete blood count; LDL, low-density lipoprotein; SBP, systolic blood pressure.

Regarding CVD risk, we suggest following the European Society of Cardiology guidelines by estimating the 10-year CVD risk in patients with IgE levels ≥1000 IU/mL. If the risk is low, risk modifiers and treatment benefits should be considered. If the risk is moderate to high, treatment should be initiated with the goal of achieving a systolic blood pressure of 130-140 mm Hg and a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of <70 mg/dL. If the risk is high, treatment should be targeted to achieve a systolic blood pressure of <130 mm Hg and a low-density lipoprotein level of <55 mg/dL.

### Immunoglobulin E response in health and disease beyond allergic disorders [^17e0cc25]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

Immunoglobulin E is the latest discovered of immunoglobulin family and has been long associated with anaphylaxis and worm expulsion. Immunoglobulin E, along with mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils, is also a hallmark of type 2 immunity which is dysregulated in numerous diseases such as asthma, rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and eosinophilic esophagitis in addition to anaphylaxis as aforementioned. However, recent advances have shed light on IgE regulation and memory explaining the low level of free IgE, the scarcity of IgE plasma cells that are mainly short live and the absence of IgE memory B cells in homeostatic conditions. Furthermore, IgE was implicated in inflammatory conditions beyond allergic disorders where IgE-mediated facilitated antigen presentation can enhance cellular and humoral response against autoantigens in systemic lupus or chronic urticaria leading to more severe disease and even against neoantigen facilitating tumor cell lysis. At last, IgE was unexpectedly associated with allograft rejection or atheromatous cardiovascular diseases where precise mechanisms remain to be deciphered. The purpose of this review is to summarize these recent advances in IgE regulation, biology, and physiopathology beyond allergic diseases opening whole new fields of IgE biology to explore.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^6f588889]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Food-specific IgE allergy evaluation—For IgE antibody–associated food allergies, percutaneous skin tests (prick/puncture) and serum assays are highly sensitive (generally >85%) but only modestly specific (approximately 40% to 80%); they are well suited when suspicion is high, are not effective for indiscriminate screening, and therefore generally should not be used for that purpose. Intracutaneous (intradermal) skin tests for foods are potentially dangerous, are overly sensitive, increase the chance of a false-positive test result, and are not recommended. Based on studies in infants and children, increasingly higher concentrations of food specific IgE antibodies correlate with an increasing risk for a clinical reaction. A trial elimination diet may be helpful to determine if a disorder with frequent or chronic symptoms is responsive to dietary manipulation, and graded oral food challenge is a useful means to diagnose an adverse reaction to food. Additional diagnostic tests under investigation include atopy patch tests (APTs) and tests for IgE binding to specific epitopes, and rational selection and interpretation of tests require consideration of epidemiology and immunopathophysiology, estimation of prior probability, and understanding of test utility and limitations.

### The role of allergen-specific IgE, IgG and IgA in allergic disease [^ef75c0f1]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Immunoglobulin E (IgE)‐mediated allergy is the most common hypersensitivity disease affecting more than 30% of the population. Exposure to even minute quantities of allergens can lead to the production of IgE antibodies in atopic individuals. This is termed allergic sensitization, which occurs mainly in early childhood. Allergen‐specific IgE then binds to the high (FcεRI) and low‐affinity receptors (FcεRII, also called CD23) for IgE on effector cells and antigen‐presenting cells. Subsequent and repeated allergen exposure increases allergen‐specific IgE levels and, by receptor cross‐linking, triggers immediate release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells and basophils whereas IgE‐facilitated allergen presentation perpetuates T cell–mediated allergic inflammation. Due to engagement of receptors which are highly selective for IgE, even tiny amounts of allergens can induce massive inflammation. Naturally occurring allergen‐specific IgG and IgA antibodies usually recognize different epitopes on allergens compared with IgE and do not efficiently interfere with allergen‐induced inflammation. However, IgG and IgA antibodies to these important IgE epitopes can be induced by allergen‐specific immunotherapy or by passive immunization. These will lead to competition with IgE for binding with the allergen and prevent allergic responses. Similarly, anti‐IgE treatment does the same by preventing IgE from binding to its receptor on mast cells and basophils. Here, we review the complex interplay of allergen‐specific IgE, IgG and IgA and the corresponding cell receptors in allergic diseases and its relevance for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of allergy.

sIgE tests detect circulating IgE antibodies to suspected allergens, but the predictive value of sIgE levels varies across patient populations and may be associated with a patient’s age, ethnicity, geographical location and concomitant allergic diseases (such as atopic dermatitis).False-positive results can occur with sIgE tests because of a high degree of non-specific binding in the test or high total IgE levels in some patients.Also, sIgE results from different laboratories are not directly comparable, as slightly different forms of antigens may be used and produce variable outcomes.

Food allergy serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) quantitation—probability-based risk of clinical food allergy increases as the quantity of serum food specific IgE increases, and thus the higher the value, the more specific the test becomes; however, when levels are undetectable, 5% to 20% may still have reactions, so clinical history is important in interpretation of results.

Diagnosis of IgE-mediated venom allergy—testing indications and approach: Summary Statement 4 states to perform skin tests and/or serum tests for IgE to stinging insect venoms on patients who are candidates for VIT (Strong Recommendation; A evidence), and diagnostic testing should be performed when the history is consistent with the indications for VIT. Before ordering testing, clinicians should discuss likely recommendations based on positive or negative results and whether potential benefit might exceed potential harm. Diagnostic testing is recommended based on clinical history even when the systemic reaction was many years or decades earlier, and when there has been a sting without a reaction after the systemic reaction, the risk of anaphylaxis can persist. The presence of venom-specific IgE antibodies is usually confirmed by intradermal skin testing, and skin prick tests at concentrations up to 100 µg/mL can be performed before intradermal tests but are not used by all clinicians.

### Allergic cross-reactivity: from gene to the clinic [^fd5ec5f9]. Allergy (2004). Low credibility.

A large number of allergenic proteins have now their complete cDNA sequences determined and in some cases also the 3D structures. It turned out that most allergens could be grouped into a small number of structural protein families, regardless of their biological source. Structural similarity among proteins from diverse sources is the molecular basis of allergic cross-reactivity. The clinical relevance of immunoglobulin E (IgE) cross-reactivity seems to be influenced by a number of factors including the immune response against the allergen, exposure and the allergen. As individuals are exposed to a variable number of allergenic sources bearing homologous molecules, the exact nature of the antigenic structure inducing the primary IgE immune response cannot be easily defined. In general, the 'cross-reactivity' term should be limited to defined clinical manifestations showing reactivity to a source without previous exposure. 'Co-recognition', including by definition 'cross-reactivity', could be used to describe the large majority of the IgE reactivity where co-exposure to a number of sources bearing homologous molecules do not allow unequivocal identification of the sensitizing molecule. The analysis of reactivity clusters in diagnosis allows the interpretation of the patient's reactivity profile as a result of the sensitization process, which often begins with exposure to a single allergenic molecule.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^3e9a9bc1]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Food allergy diagnostic testing—percutaneous skin tests (prick/puncture tests) and serum specific immunoglobulin E (IgE)—are described as highly sensitive (generally >85%) but only modestly specific (approximately 40% to 80%), with utility best when suspicion is high; sensitivity of a positive test result is generally more than 0.7 and in most studies exceeds 0.85, whereas specificity is lower, generally in the range of 0.4 to 0.8; these characteristics mean a negative test result has high utility to rule out IgE-mediated reactions, panels of food allergy tests should not be performed without consideration of the history, and they generally should not be used for indiscriminate screening; the serum assay for specific IgE may be less sensitive than skin prick tests, although in many cases the sensitivity is similar.

### The implications of nomenclature [^c3482e04]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

To be able to draw the right conclusions from clinical research, it is essential that words have the same meaning to all researcher and clinicians.

Objective

To present the new nomenclature for allergy and discuss its influence on conclusions drawn from clinical studies with one example illustrating that conclusions change with the use of definitions and nomenclature.

Methods

To review one recent study at odds with the new allergy nomenclature. Atopy is defined as a personal or familial tendency to produce immunoglobulin (Ig)E antibodies in response to low doses of allergens, usually proteins, and to develop typical symptoms such as asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, or eczema/dermatitis. Allergy is defined as a hypersensitivity reaction initiated by immunologic mechanisms and divided into IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated allergy. What has been called atopic diseases, eg, infantile eczema, can be caused by both IgE-mediated allergy (atopy) and non-Ig-mediated mechanisms. In the study, two groups of mothers/infants were given either Lactobacillus GG or placebo with the incidence of infantile eczema as primary outcome parameter.

Results

The study analyzed concludes that probiotic bacteria supplied to mother and child prevents infantile eczema development caused by both IgE-mediated (atopy) and non-IgE-mediated allergic mechanisms. The study also shows that IgE sensitization was similar in the two groups. Thus, "atopic disease" was prevented (subjective evaluation), whereas atopy, ie, IgE induction was not prevented.

Conclusions

Nomenclature is of utmost importance to interpret results in allergy research. If preventive measures, such as oral treatment with Lactobacilli, have an effect, this should be tested against a single mechanism of disease rather than against a disease caused by several mechanisms. However, in the study Lactobacilli are said to prevent atopic disease, and also that Lactobacilli do not hinder development of IgE sensitization, one of the mechanisms causing this disease.

### Phenotype consensus is required to enable large-scale genetic consortium studies of food allergy [^35e0ba60]. Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

What determines a convincing history of an IgE‐mediated allergic reaction to a specific food is controversial. In practice, allergists use experienced clinical judgment regarding history, symptoms, and testing to make a diagnosis of FA. Several definitions and scores describing an allergic response were considered, including the World Allergy Organization definition of anaphylaxis (online supplement) 4 and the Astier score for reaction severity 5 (Table S2), but neither included all criteria deemed to be essential for a convincing history of FA. We therefore agreed that for the purposes of phenotyping for genetic studies, a convincing history should involve the following: a) exposure by ingestion of the food allergen b) onset of symptoms within 2 hours of exposure with resolution within 24 hours, and c) only objective symptoms (Table 1b). Two‐organ system involvement is not required and treatment is not considered. Local symptoms through contact of the food allergen with the skin or oral mucosa are not sufficient. Reactions solely identified by subjective symptoms (Table 1b) or linked to unclear exposure (ie, after consuming multiple food allergens and cross‐contamination) (Table 1b) are not considered convincing. Some subjective symptoms were identified by allergists in the group as having weight in a clinical history of FA, but most felt that these symptoms and anaphylaxis would be accompanied by objective symptoms.

Table 1b 
Objective versus subjective symptoms occurring within 2 h of ingestion of allergen

Tier 4 of statement 2 is the most controversial as the challenge is to define “minimal criteria” for FA. Many large‐scale genetic studies lack a detailed clinical history but have laboratory testing, allowing the allergic individuals in these studies to be captured by Tier 4. While we realize that this may lead to the inclusion of some individuals with asymptomatic sensitization, there was consensus that Tier 4, using the currently accepted 95% PPV cutoffs for SPT or sIgE (Table 1c, Table S1 online supplement), will generate a reasonable level of certainty to allow international collaboration at the most inclusive level. However, there is a trade‐off as categories become less stringent—available samples will increase, but at the cost of potential misclassification.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^5b53add2]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Specific IgE assay quality control—All assays for allergen specific IgE antibody should have known positive and negative control sera for each lot, and known positive and negative sera should be included in each assay for each allergen; results should not be reported if control sera are not within 95% confidence limits. Guidance also states the source and stability of allergen-specific control sera should be specified and confirmation of allergen IgE specificity should be identified for each allergen in internal controls. Laboratories should establish expected reference ranges with homologous antisera for relevant populations, and FDA clearance for commonly available allergosorbents only requires a maximum of 100 specific IgE positive serum samples.

### The role of allergen-specific IgE, IgG and IgA in allergic disease [^8e9ad64f]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

6 FUTURE PERSPECTIVES

The important role of IgE in type 1 allergic diseases has been known for a very long time. The functional role of allergen‐specific IgG and IgA antibodies induced by AIT has shown their ability to interfere with the interaction of IgE with the allergen. In addition, transplacental or breastfeeding‐mediated transfer of immune complexes of maternal IgG with allergens to the foetus may protect against sensitization to allergens in early life.

The knowledge we have gained over the last two decades has been instrumental in developing novel therapeutic approaches by targeting IgE itself with anti‐IgE antibodies or receptor‐targeting antibodies, enhancing blocking antibodies by AIT or even passive transfer of allergen‐specific IgG to allergic patients (see Box 1 for methods used to measure these allergen‐specific antibodies and their function in more detail). This knowledge may help to further establish the relevance of blocking antibodies as a biomarker for clinical effects of AIT.

Finally, this may lead to future therapeutic approaches such as combination treatments with therapeutic antibodies and AIT or OIT (eg combination with anti‐IgE, allergen‐specific IgG or cytokine‐directed antibody therapies), as well as preventive approaches such as maternal allergen vaccination to enhance delivery of allergen‐specific IgG and IgA antibodies during pregnancy and early life to prevent sensitization to respiratory and food allergens.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^dee1c51a]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Allergen specific IgE assays—calibration, regulatory controls, and comparative sensitivity—are calibrated using heterologous interpolation against the WHO 75/502 human IgE reference serum, and FDA clearance for modified specific IgE tests requires use of homologous internal control allergen sera whenever this is possible to obtain. The precise sensitivity of these immunoassays compared with prick/puncture skin tests has been reported to range from less than 50% to more than 90%, with the average being approximately 70% to 75% for most studies; similar sensitivity ranges pertain when immunoassays are compared with symptoms induced after natural or controlled organ challenge tests.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^4f26dab9]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Allergen-specific IgE immunoassays—summary statements 117–124—emphasize that interpretation requires clinical correlation and that performance varies by allergen. Interpretation of specific IgE test results requires correlation with the history, physical examination, and, in some cases, symptoms directly observed after natural or laboratory exposure to allergens, and this cannot be accomplished by commercial remote practice laboratories that base immunotherapy recommendations on a history form and specific IgE results. Because the constitutive allergenicity, potency, and stability are variable among commercial allergen extract reagents, sensitivity and the positive predictive value of both prick/puncture and specific IgE tests generally tend to be higher among pollens, stable anaphylactogenic foods, house dust mite, certain epidermals, and fungi compared with venoms, drugs, and chemicals. Proper interpretation of specific IgE tests needs to take into consideration variables such as binding affinity or avidity of allergens, solid-phase systems, cross-reactive proteins and glycopeptides, specific IgG antibodies in the test system, and high total serum IgE (>20,000 IU). A multiallergen (up to 15 allergens bound to a linear solid-phase system) test can screen for atopic status, after which allergen specific tests are required for more definitive evaluation. Specific IgE immunoassays are not recommended as a definitive confirmatory test for several specific clinical conditions; they provide neither diagnostic nor prognostic information in the cord blood of newborn infants and do not have sufficient sensitivity for foolproof prediction of anaphylactic sensitivity to venoms or penicillins. Under special clinical conditions (widespread skin disease, patients receiving skin test suppressive therapy, uncooperative patients, or when history suggests an unusually greater risk of anaphylaxis from skin testing), specific IgE immunoassays may be preferable to skin testing. Determination of allergen specificity by inhibition of specific IgE binding is a unique attribute of specific IgE testing. Automated systems using multiple allergen assays are being rapidly developed, and one is cleared by the FDA for the simultaneous measurement of 10 allergens.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^3ba386f1]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Complementary skin and specific IgE testing—Summary Statement 199 states that, because of predictive inconsistencies of both skin and serum specific IgE tests, patients with a convincing history of venom-induced systemic reactions should be evaluated by both methods. (D) It explains that neither test alone is fully accurate and some insect allergic patients show positive results to only one but not the other test, so it is therefore important to perform the other test when 1 test result is negative in a patient with a clear history of severe reaction to stings; the need to perform specific IgE tests or repeat skin testing when initial skin test results are negative is most clear in patients who have had severe anaphylactic reactions, but there is no consensus about whether this should be done in all candidates for venom immunotherapy with negative skin test results.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^ed46aa4d]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Allergen presentation and assay accuracy—conditions that reduce sensitivity: An adequate presentation of the allergen in the assay is essential for optimal sensitivity, and inaccuracies can occur when the protein recognized by IgE is a minor constituent of the preparation and thus of the solid phase, when the recognized protein is labile because of its molecular structure or proteolytic enzymes, or when the chemical linkage to the solid phase destroys or sterically hinders the epitope recognized by IgE.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^52bb357d]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Specific IgE testing—total IgE assessment and mitigation of nonspecific binding: Ideally, a total serum IgE should be performed on all serum samples that are assayed for allergen specific IgE antibody. If the total serum IgE level is high (eg, 20,000 IU/mL for some assays), steps such as automatic dilution should be taken by the laboratory to ensure that the assay results for specific IgE are true positives and not the result of nonspecific binding in the assay. A clue to possible nonspecific binding is a report of weakly positive IgE antibody results with multiple allergens. Since IgG antibody is often present in quantities greatly exceeding the quantity of IgE antibody, specific IgG antibody may bind to available sites of the allergosorbent, thereby preventing subsequent IgE binding and leading potentially to falsely low or negative test results.

### IgE and fcepsilonRI regulation [^ca9d1fb3]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

The high-affinity immunoglobulin (Ig)E receptor, FcepsilonRI, regulates the action of mast cells and basophils and therefore, regulates the expression of atopic disease. There have been several recent observations that demonstrate new behaviors for this receptor. The control of FcepsilonRI expression, control of cell function by FcepsilonRI, and expression of FcepsilonRI on other cell types are important new areas of understanding currently being explored.

### A revised nomenclature for allergy. An EAACI position statement from the EAACI nomenclature task force [^49f3c2b5]. Allergy (2001). Low credibility.

This report has been prepared by an EAACI task force representing the five EAACI Sections and the EAACI Executive Committee composed of specialists that reflect the broad opinion on allergy expressed by various clinical and basic specialties dealing with allergy. The aim of this report is to propose a revised nomenclature for allergic and related reactions that can be used independently of target organ or patient age group. The nomenclature is based on the present knowledge of the mechanisms which initiate and mediate allergic reactions. However, the intention has not been to revise the nomenclature of nonallergic hypersensitivity.

### The role of allergen-specific IgE, IgG and IgA in allergic disease [^89faf0f9]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergy is the most common hypersensitivity disease affecting more than 30% of the population. Exposure to even minute quantities of allergens can lead to the production of IgE antibodies in atopic individuals. This is termed allergic sensitization, which occurs mainly in early childhood. Allergen-specific IgE then binds to the high (FcεRI) and low-affinity receptors (FcεRII, also called CD23) for IgE on effector cells and antigen-presenting cells. Subsequent and repeated allergen exposure increases allergen-specific IgE levels and, by receptor cross-linking, triggers immediate release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells and basophils whereas IgE-facilitated allergen presentation perpetuates T cell-mediated allergic inflammation. Due to engagement of receptors which are highly selective for IgE, even tiny amounts of allergens can induce massive inflammation. Naturally occurring allergen-specific IgG and IgA antibodies usually recognize different epitopes on allergens compared with IgE and do not efficiently interfere with allergen-induced inflammation. However, IgG and IgA antibodies to these important IgE epitopes can be induced by allergen-specific immunotherapy or by passive immunization. These will lead to competition with IgE for binding with the allergen and prevent allergic responses. Similarly, anti-IgE treatment does the same by preventing IgE from binding to its receptor on mast cells and basophils. Here, we review the complex interplay of allergen-specific IgE, IgG and IgA and the corresponding cell receptors in allergic diseases and its relevance for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of allergy.

### Newly defined allergens in the WHO / IUIS allergen nomenclature database during 01 / 2019-03 / 2021 [^95006c8b]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Every scientific discipline relies on unambiguously naming and describing the molecules, cells, and organisms that are the objects of their studies. These are the tasks of the nomenclature committees that enable effective communication among the various research areas. For example, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistryis the universally recognized authority on chemical nomenclature. The complexity of the immune system requires worldwide efforts on nomenclature issues.These include consensus nomenclatures for cytokines and chemokines, their receptors, and monoclonal antibodies for phenotyping immune cells.The WHO/IUIS Nomenclature Committeealso includes the Allergen Nomenclature Sub‐Committee (ANSC), an international body of experts, currently headed by Richard E. Goodman, who review submissions of potential allergens, assign unambiguous allergen names and maintain the allergen nomenclature database (ANDB).The WHO/IUIS ANSC assigns official allergen names to purified natural or recombinant proteins that are characterized by standard methods of biochemistry and molecular biology and that bind IgE of individuals who are allergic to the source of the protein. The application for a unique name from the ANSC prior to publication is a key step required by most journals to ensure unambiguous communications between researchers, clinicians, pharmaceutical companies, and regulatory authorities regarding specific allergens. All 106 allergens described in this article had to undergo the same reviewing process developed by the Sub‐Committee.So far, 58 of these 106 allergens have been published in peer‐reviewed journals after having been assigned their official names.

### Homeostatic serum IgE is secreted by plasma cells in the thymus and enhances mast cell survival [^4039577c]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Increased serum levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE) is a risk factor for various diseases, including allergy and anaphylaxis. However, the source and ontogeny of B cells producing IgE under steady state conditions are not well defined. Here, we show plasma cells that develop in the thymus and potently secrete IgE and other immunoglobulins, including IgM, IgA, and IgG. The development of these IgE-secreting plasma cells are induced by IL-4 produced by invariant Natural Killer T cells, independent of CD1d-mediated interaction. Single-cell transcriptomics suggest the developmental landscape of thymic B cells, and the thymus supports development of transitional, mature, and memory B cells in addition to plasma cells. Furthermore, thymic plasma cells produce polyclonal antibodies without somatic hypermutation, indicating they develop via the extra-follicular pathway. Physiologically, thymic-derived IgEs increase the number of mast cells in the gut and skin, which correlates with the severity of anaphylaxis. Collectively, we define the ontogeny of thymic plasma cells and show that steady state thymus-derived IgEs regulate mast cell homeostasis, opening up new avenues for studying the genetic causes of allergic disorders.

### Ratios of specific igGover IgE antibodies do not improve prediction of peanut allergy nor of its severity compared to specific IgE alone [^98e4cce1]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

How to explain the apparent discrepancy between a positive association of IgG 4 and allergy and symptom severity, and its proposed protective role? Overall, absolute quantities of IgG 4 are significantly higher than of IgE, both in tolerant subjects and allergic patients. However, our data show that in patients with IgE levels >100 ng/mL (> ~40kU/L) the IgG 4 levels are comparable. The range of IgE levels showed an approximately 50.000‐fold difference between highest and lowest, this was around 5000‐fold for IgG 4. This explains why the ratio of IgG 4 /IgE decreased with severity while at the same time IgE and IgG 4 levels both increased with the severity of allergic reactions. The differences in ratios is greatly affected by the increase of specific IgE, which is much steeper compared to IgG 4.

Can differences in IgG 4 antibodies improve the predictive accuracy compared to IgE against peanut and in particular Ara h 2? The accuracy of the IgG 4 /IgE ratio in predicting the outcome of peanut challenges, with an AUC of 0.86 (95% CI 0.77‐0.94), was comparable to IgE alone (0.90, 95% CI 0.87‐0.96). Also for the severity of symptoms, its predictive accuracy was comparable to that of IgE alone (AUC 0.76, 95% CI 0.69‐0.84 vs 0.80, 95% CI 0.73‐0.87). Overall, it is clear that, although IgG 4 /IgE is significantly associated with protection in a peanut challenge, in the equation specific IgE on its own is the decisive risk factor for allergy and severity. Using a cut‐off of Ara h 2 > 0.6 kU A /L to identify severe patients, we found a sensitivity of 95% and a NPV of 86.1%, thus ruling out severe peanut allergy with high certainty. On the other hand, a cut‐off of 47 kU A /L corresponded to a specificity of 94% and PPV of 90%. High specificity indicates a low false positive rate (rule in severe reactions) but the consequence is that ~50% have a negative test and need additional evaluation.

### Molecular and cellular targets of anti-IgE antibodies [^7393816d]. Allergy (2005). Low credibility.

Immunoglobulin E (IgE) was the last of the immunoglobulins discovered. It is present in very low amounts (nano- to micro-gram per ml range) in the serum of normal healthy individuals and normal laboratory mouse strains and has a very short half-life. This contrasts with the other immunoglobulin classes, which are present in much higher concentrations (micro- to milligram per ml range) and form a substantial component of serum proteins. Immunoglobulins play a role in homeostatic mechanisms and they represent the humoral arm of defence against pathogenic organisms. Since IgE antibodies play a key role in allergic disorders, a number of approaches to inhibit IgE antibody production are currently being explored. In the recent past the use of nonanaphylactic, humanized anti-IgE antibodies became a new therapeutic strategy for allergic diseases. The therapeutic rational beyond the idea derives from the ability of the anti-IgE antibodies to bind to the same domains on the IgE molecule that interact with the high-affinity IgE receptor, thereby interfering with the binding of IgE to this receptor without cross-linking the IgE on the receptor (nonanaphylactic anti-IgE antibodies). Treatment with anti-IgE antibodies leads primarily to a decrease in serum IgE levels. As a consequence thereof, the number of high-affinity IgE receptors on mast cells and basophils decreases, leading to a lower excitability of the effector cells reducing the release of inflammatory mediator such as histamine, prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Experimental studies in mice indicate that injection of some monoclonal anti-IgE antibodies also inhibited IgE production in vivo. The biological mechanism behind this reduction remains speculative. A possible explanation may be that these antibodies can also interact with membrane bound IgE on B cells, which could interfere the IgE production.

### Ontogeny of human IgE-expressing B cells and plasma cells [^f1fac241]. Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background

IgE‐expressing (IgE +) plasma cells (s) provide a continuous source of allergen‐specific IgE that is central to allergic responses. The extreme sparsity of IgE + cells in vivo has confined their study almost entirely to mouse models.

Objective

To characterize the development pathway of human IgE + s and to determine the ontogeny of human IgE + s.

Methods

To generate human IgE + cells, we cultured tonsil B cells with‐4 and anti‐40. Usingand‐, we examined the phenotype of generated IgE + cells, the capacity of tonsil B‐cell subsets to generate IgE + s and the class switching pathways involved.

Results

We have identified three phenotypic stages of IgE + development pathway, namely (i) IgE + germinal centre (GC)‐like B cells, (ii) IgE + ‐like ‘plasmablasts’ and (iii) IgE + s. The same phenotypic stages were also observed for IgG1 + cells. Total tonsil B cells give rise to IgE + s by direct and sequential switching, whereas the isolatedB‐cell fraction, the main source of IgE + s, generates IgE + s by sequential switching.differentiation of IgE + cells is accompanied by the down‐regulation of surface expression of the short form of membrane IgE, which is homologous to mouse, and the up‐regulation of the long form of, which is associated with an enhanced B‐cell survival and expressed in humans, but not in mice.

Conclusion

Generation of IgE + s from tonsilB cells occurs mainly via sequential switching from IgG. The/ratio may be implicated in survival of IgE + B cells duringdifferentiation and allergic disease.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^eff2dc7e]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Inhibition of specific IgE antibody binding—method and performance threshold: The most expedient method for determining specificity is to add a small quantity of a homologous allergen in the fluid phase to inhibit most IgE binding, which usually indicates that IgE binding reflects specific recognition of the allergenic protein. If IgE is being nonspecifically bound, either most serum samples are positive or there is a relationship between total serum IgE concentration and increased assay positivity to multiple lectin-containing allergens. For demonstrating specific inhibition, it should be possible to inhibit at least 80% of the specific IgE binding in a dose response manner.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^876349c9]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Total serum IgE assays—reporting, standardization, applications, and assay performance—are reported in international units or nanograms per milliliter (1 IU/mL = 2.44 ng/mL), and total IgE is cross-standardized with the WHO 75/502 human reference IgE serum verified by periodic proficiency surveys. Clinical applications are of modest value; high serum IgE concentrations occur in allergic bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA), with therapeutic response evaluated by serial IgE values, and total serum IgE is required for assessing the suitability of a patient for omalizumab therapy and determining the initial dose. For most commercial methods, total serum IgE determinations should be accurate to 2 significant digits and the coefficient of variation for repeated assays should be less than 10%, and interlaborational coefficients of variation should remain less than 20% when assay parallelism is maintained. A technical issue, the hook effect, describes samples with very high total IgE that produce results identical to those of samples with much lower IgE; to avoid this, some laboratories assay samples at 2 dilutions expecting the more dilute sample to be quantitatively lower, and if not, the sample needs to be rediluted and reassayed until appropriate dilution is clear.

### Clinical immunology review series: an approach to the use of the immunology laboratory in the diagnosis of clinical allergy [^48af0190]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

In the last 10 years UK immunology laboratories have seen a dramatic increase in the number and range of allergy tests performed. The reasons for this have been an increase in the incidence of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergic disease set against a background of greater public awareness and more referrals for assessment. Laboratory testing forms an integral part of a comprehensive allergy service and physicians treating patients with allergic disease need to have an up-to-date knowledge of the range of tests available, their performance parameters and interpretation as well as the accreditation status of the laboratory to which tests are being sent. The aim of this review is to describe the role of the immunology laboratory in the assessment of patients with IgE-mediated allergic disease and provide an up-to-date summary of the tests currently available, their sensitivity, specificity, interpretation and areas of future development.

To the Editor :

We read with interest the report by Haider and colleagues, who concluded from the study of four UK birth cohorts that there is “no evidence for a sequential atopic march progression”. They investigated whether early-life eczema, wheeze, or genetic factors increased the risk of atopic multimorbidity. We would like to highlight limitations in this study design, methodology, and interpretation of the results, which we think are common to other studies evaluating the atopic march.

The definition of atopy implies predisposition toward development of allergen-specific IgE. Therefore, it is possible that the atopic march should only be considered in participants with allergen sensitization excluding non–IgE-associated atopic dermatitis and nonatopic transient wheezers. Although the initial reports did not include food allergy (FA) in the definition of atopic march, we, like the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Atopic March Consensus report, believe it needs to be included. However, only one of the four cohorts here assessed FA, limited to peanut allergy. We propose that it is IgE sensitization (with or without barrier dysfunction) that drives atopic march, and without IgE sensitization, there is no atopy or march.

Although the large and prospectively collected pool of data from these birth cohorts is a remarkable achievement, there were some methodological concerns as they relate to evaluating the atopic march. Questionnaire-based studies do not accurately reflect true atopic diseases and are biased with both under- and overdiagnosis. Physician diagnosis is needed for more accurate estimates of atopic conditions, which we did in a birth cohort of 200 infants followed into young adulthood. Diagnoses of atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and recurrent wheeze were rendered based on clinical exams by the same physician repeatedly within the first year of life and again at 5, 11, and 20 years of age. Food sensitization was assessed, and symptoms of food hypersensitivity were reported based on parental and participant interviews. In our study, early-onset (<12 months of age) atopic dermatitis was a significant risk factor for later development of allergic respiratory disease, and those with AD and food hypersensitivity had the highest risk for progression.

### Epigenome-wide association study of total serum immunoglobulin E in children: a life course approach [^6e50dc73]. Clinical Epigenetics (2018). Low credibility.

To better understand the molecular origins and progression of IgE-mediated responses, we sought to conceptualize the association between epigenome-wide differential methylation in DNA from blood cells and serum IgE measures using a life course framework (Fig. 1). Specifically, we used methylation data from DNA from blood cells at two distinct time points—birth and mid-childhood (mean age = 7.8 years)—to quantify and dissect the influence of prenatal and childhood factors on IgE. We hypothesize that (1) epigenetic marks in cord blood DNA reflecting the prenatal environment serve as early markers of IgE-mediated allergic response susceptibility in childhood, (2) some epigenetic marks established at birth may be associated with IgE levels in childhood independent of factors operating postnatally, and (3) childhood environmental influences—captured by changes in DNA methylation levels between cord blood and mid-childhood peripheral blood—reflect the progression and manifestation of IgE-mediated allergic responses.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^f23b67a4]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis (AR)—allergen-specific IgE testing and other diagnostics: Allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) can be determined by testing the patient’s serum with an in vitro test, and antihistamines and other medications (eg, tricyclic antidepressants and β-blockers) do not need to be withheld. Using blood allergy testing instead of skin testing may be preferred when special skin conditions such as dermographism or severe eczema are present. While both skin prick and serum-specific IgE tests have similar diagnostic properties, the skin prick test is generally considered to be more sensitive, and another potential advantage of skin testing is that it is less expensive than blood testing. Clinicians should use their best judgment when deciding which method of IgE-specific testing to use for a given patient, and given the lack of conclusive evidence of superiority of one test over another, patient preference for and the availability of skin or blood testing should play a role in deciding which test to use. The text emphasizes that detection of sensitization to an allergen is not equivalent to a clinical diagnosis and that, in the absence of clinical symptoms, positive skin or blood testing does not mean that the patient has an allergy to that allergen. For other diagnostic tests in suspected AR—acoustic rhinometry, olfactory testing, rhinomanometry, nasal nitric oxide measurements, testing for food allergy, and nasal allergen challenges—there is insufficient evidence to make recommendations for or against their use, though provider knowledge may reasonably lead to different IgE-specific testing modalities including skin prick testing, blood or serum testing, intradermal testing, intradermal dilutional testing, or combinations thereof.

### Peanut allergy diagnosis: a 2020 practice parameter update, systematic review, and GRADE analysis [^afcf8f86]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Peanut allergy sensitization and positive test thresholds—Allergic sensitization is denoted by detectable allergen‑specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) via serologic assay or skin prick test (SPT), with SPT most commonly considered “positive” when the wheal is 3 mm greater than a glycerinated saline control; for serum specific IgE, instruments typically have a detection limit of 0.1 kU_A/L and an upper reporting limit of 100 kU_A/L, with historical reporting conventions shifting from <0.35 kU_A/L (positive ≥0.36 kU_A/L) to using 0.1 kU_A/L as the reporting limit (positive 0.11 kU_A/L), creating interpretive uncertainty for 0.11 kU_A/L to 0.35 kU_A/L, and many clinicians would only consider sensitization >0.7 kU_A/L as clinically relevant; class designations are reported but have no clinical relevance, and in this document “positive” refers to detection of sensitization, which is unequivocally not synonymous with a clinical diagnosis that requires a demonstrated clinical history of allergy plus detectable sensitization or, in very circumscribed instances, very high levels of sensitization in certain infants with particular preexisting risk factors who have never ingested peanut previously.

Classification of Generalized Epilepsies

Epilepsies are classified as generalized, focal, generalized and focal, and unknown.The next classification level was epilepsy syndrome, which cannot always be diagnosed, but informs management, prognosis, and genetic counseling. Among the genetic generalized epilepsies (GGEs) (Figure 1), there are the IGE and epileptic encephalopathies.The major IGE are childhood absence epilepsy, juvenile absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), and epilepsy with GTCS alone, with overlap between syndromes.

Figure 1 
Classification of Genetic Generalized Epilepsies

GGE Syndromes Beyond IGE

GGEs include distinct seizure types.Epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures is an epileptic encephalopathy characterized by seizures causing falls. Two other syndromes with signature seizures can manifest as developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (abundant epileptiform activity associated with developmental slowing or regression), as a static intellectual disability (no clear association between interictal activity and cognitive function), or as normal intellect. Epilepsy with eyelid myoclonia is characterized by rapid eyelid fluttering and photosensitivity, often associated with very brief absence seizures. Epilepsy with myoclonic absences presents as absence seizures with tonic upper limb abduction and superimposed 3-Hz myoclonus. Myoclonic epilepsy in infancy may be associated with intellectual disability or normal cognition.

Classifications are vital for clinicians and researchers but may artificially simplify and divide a complex spectrum and advance an illusion of understanding.

Furthermore, serial terminologies create inconsistent nosologies across physician groups. Evolving and overlapping terms and diagnoses may foster misdiagnoses. For example, epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures may be misdiagnosed as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Asymmetric or focal EEG or clinical features can cause misdiagnosis of focal epilepsy and mistreatment (Figure 2). The overlap of focal and generalized epilepsies warrants greater study.

### The role of CD23 in the regulation of allergic responses [^8357cdce]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

8 CONCLUSION

The general goal of disease‐modifying allergy immunotherapy is to reduce IgE responses, while enhancing IgG and regulatory T cell responses. While evidence from experimental disease models as well as allergic patient studies on CD23 is still lacking, evidence shows that i) CD23 can absorb and clear IgE from the serum in a non‐inflammatory fashion, ii) CD23 reduces the synthesis of IgE from B cells, iii) CD23 regulates antigen‐specific IgG and T cell responses. Together, those factors lead us to believe that CD23 deserves a closer look as a therapeutic target in allergies.

### Immunological methods for diagnosis and monitoring of IgE-mediated allergy caused by industrial sensitizing agents (IMExAllergy) [^034478fe]. Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

Historically, 0.35 kUA/l of allergen‐sIgE was considered to be the cutoff point where an individual was considered as a threshold for positivity of the immunoassay, demonstrating sensitization. 29 The current recommendation to clinical laboratories, by a consensus guidance document, 23 is that sIgE levels must be reported as analytical measurements down to the cleared limit of quantitation of the assays, which is usually 0.1 kUA/l. The limit of quantitation within an assay is set to ensure that reported low quantitative results are comfortably above background signal (noise—chemical, instrument and from non–specific IgE binding). Thus, all test results above the limit of quantitation should be regarded as true allergen‐sIgE antibodies. Historically, sIgE ≥ 0.35 kU A /l was considered to be clinically relevant, however, it is now considered that clinicians should interpret IgE levels in the context of the clinical history, rather than have a defined cutoff point. 29 See Supporting information (page S18) for more details.

It is important to understand that the presence of sIgE is an indicator of sensitization, it is not proof of allergic disease and is only clinically relevant when there are objectively defined allergic symptoms that are temporally associated with a known allergen exposure. 27 A positive IgE test that is concordant with the patient's history and/or a challenge test confirms “allergy” to a particular allergen and can be used as confirmatory evidence of sensitization to manage the patient appropriately and encourage improvement of environmental control measures within the workplace.

4.1 What is commercially available and suitable?

New allergens are continually being identified within the workplace, for example, horticultural nematode, Steinernema feltiae. 30 The list of commercially available occupational allergens is very restricted, for example, Thermo Fisher (Phadia) currently has only 36 ImmunoCAPs for occupational allergens, although they do also provide others such as animal allergens, for example, rat and mouse. The limited availability of commercial assays for the measurement of sIgE is a significant problem within the field of occupational allergy and asthma that necessitates the use of “in‐house” assays to measure sIgE to noncommercially available allergens.

There are many allergens and some components available for CAP tests; however, there are only a limited number of occupational HMW allergen components, for ImmunoCAP, for example, there are nine recombinant latex allergens. Availability of allergen components has led to improved diagnosis of sensitization in some cases. 31, 32, 33, 34

### The role of CD23 in the regulation of allergic responses [^88e529e4]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

IgE, the key molecule in atopy has been shown to bind two receptors, FcεRI, the high‐affinity receptor, and FcεRII (CD23), binding IgE with lower affinity. Whereas cross‐linking of IgE on FcεRI expressed by mast cells and basophils triggers the allergic reaction, binding of IgE to CD23 on B cells plays an important role in both IgE regulation and presentation. Furthermore, IgE‐immune complexes (IgE‐ICs) bound by B cells enhance antibody and T cell responses in mice and humans. However, the mechanisms that regulate the targeting of the two receptors and the respective function of the two pathways in inflammation or homeostasis are still a matter of debate. Here, we focus on CD23 and discuss several mechanisms related to IgE binding, as well as the impact of the IgE/antigen‐binding on different immune cells expressing CD23. One recent paper has shown that free IgE preferentially binds to FcεRI whereas IgE‐ICs are preferentially captured by CD23. Binding of IgE‐ICs to CD23 on B cells can, on one hand, regulate serum IgE and prevent effector cell activation and on the other hand facilitate antigen presentation by delivering the antigen to dendritic cells. These data argue for a multifunctional role of CD23 for modulating IgE serum levels and immune responses.

### Allergen immunotherapy: a practice parameter third update [^bea21f05]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Medium credibility.

Allergen immunotherapy extract—component selection and clinical relevance: immunotherapy extract should contain only clinically relevant allergens and the physician should be familiar with local and regional aerobiology and indoor and outdoor allergens, paying special attention to potential allergens in the patient’s own environment. Only clinically relevant allergens should be included in the allergen immunotherapy treatment, because the omission of clinically relevant allergens from an allergic patient’s allergen immunotherapy extract contributes to the decreased effectiveness of allergen immunotherapy, whereas inclusion of all allergens to which IgE antibodies are present without establishing clinical relevance might dilute the content of other allergens and make allergen immunotherapy less effective, and inclusion of allergens to which the patient does not have demonstrable specific IgE might result in new sensitization rather than induction of tolerance. As with interpreting positive immediate hypersensitivity skin test results, there must be a clinical correlation with in vitro allergen-specific IgE levels and a clinical history of an allergic disease; there is no evidence to support the administration of immunotherapy based solely on results of serum specific IgE testing, which is not recommended, and there are no data to support allergen immunotherapy as a treatment for non–IgE-mediated symptoms of rhinitis or asthma.

5 IgE AND IgE RECEPTOR‐TARGETING THERAPIES FOR TREATING ALLERGIES

Another group of antibodies that prevent histamine release by basophils and mast cells are the anti‐IgE antibodies. They exert their effect by preventing IgE from binding to FcεRI and CD23 (Figures 1 and 2). Binding of IgE to CD23 may involve different portions of CD23 and interestingly can be blocked with omailizumab which also blocks IgE binding to the high‐affinity receptor for IgE.In addition, anti‐IgE has a similar inhibitory effect as AIT‐induced IgG and IgA antibodies that block IgE‐mediated T‐cell activation.

The structures of the ectodomain regions of FcεRI and CD23 in complexes with IgE‐Fc have revealed how these two distinct receptors interact with IgE.IgE binding to its two receptors is regulated through unique conformational changes in the IgE‐Fc domain that enable an allosteric competition between low and high‐affinity receptors.IgE binding to FcεRI occurs through the tips of the two IgE Cε3 domains, engaging both antibody heavy chains in an asymmetric ‘open’ conformation.In contrast, CD23 binding occurs to a distinct surface of the IgE‐Fc at the junction between Cε3‐Cε4 domains and favours a ‘closed’ conformation that inhibits FcεRI binding.High‐affinity binding to FcεRI leads to the prebinding of serum IgE to receptor‐expressing cells, sensitizing them to respond upon allergen exposure and cross‐linking. In contrast, IgE binding to CD23 is of lower affinity and is stabilized through avidity effects, most notably by IgE‐allergen complex formation. Strikingly, IgE bound to FcεRI is incredibly stable, persisting on peripheral mast cells for weeks‐months and impacting the safety and speed of AIT/OIT approaches.
