Provide a concise paragraph summarizing the likely cause of neuropathy.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a concise paragraph summarizing the likely cause of neuropathy, focusing on the etiology and pattern of diabetic neuropathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the primary etiologic driver and what prospective data and guidelines say about glycemic control. Then, I should verify the key pathogenic mechanisms repeatedly implicated in the literature. Next, I need to check emerging contributors like inflammation. After that, I should confirm modifiers that distinguish type 1 from type 2 diabetes and explain the different impact of glucose control. Then, I will review independent additive causes such as alcohol use. Next, I should define the characteristic clinical–pathologic pattern of neuropathy. Finally, I will synthesize these elements into a tight, clinically useful framework with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the core etiologic signal. Diabetic neuropathy risk and progression track with chronic hyperglycemia; optimizing glucose clearly prevents or delays neuropathy in type 1 diabetes, and is recommended as a primary prevention strategy in T1DM and to slow progression in both T1DM and T2DM by the ADA 2025 standards of care [^112tU71u] [^114GzJEj] [^115LHpiU]. Wait, I should double-check my wording about effect size across types: I initially almost said tight control "halts" neuropathy in both types, but hold on — that overstates the effect in T2DM, where benefits on neuropathy are more modest compared with T1DM, a point supported by prospective data and reiterated in guideline language to pair glycemic optimization with broader risk-factor control in T2DM [^111F8KFX] [^114qgXFQ].

> Next, I should review the mechanistic pathways. Multiple convergent lines of evidence implicate hyperglycemia-driven polyol pathway flux, accumulation of advanced glycation end-products, oxidative stress, and endoneurial microvascular dysfunction leading to ischemia as interlocking mechanisms of axonal injury and repair failure in diabetic neuropathy; let me verify that these remain the canonical pillars across reviews and translational studies, which they do [^111F8KFX] [^1158mkWx] [^114qN5vn]. I need to ensure I am not overemphasizing any single pathway; the weight of evidence still favors a multifactorial metabolic–neurovascular model rather than a unitary cause [^111F8KFX].

> I will now examine emerging contributors. Inflammation has moved from a peripheral hypothesis to a more central role, with recent analyses highlighting immune signaling, neuroinflammation, and cytokine-driven injury in peripheral nerves; wait, let me verify that this is supported by higher-credibility updates — yes, a 2025 review consolidates experimental and clinical implications for inflammatory mechanisms in diabetic peripheral neuropathy [^116fjuR5]. But wait, what if the gut–nerve axis is relevant here as well? There are low-credibility syntheses linking gut dysbiosis to neuropathy via inflammatory and oxidative pathways; I should mention this cautiously as hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^112dCiBq].

> Let me consider disease modifiers that explain phenotype and treatment response differences between T1DM and T2DM. In T2DM, additive cardiometabolic factors — hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and broader metabolic syndrome biology — contribute to neuropathy risk and progression, which likely explains why glycemic control alone confers smaller neuropathy benefits and why guidelines emphasize comprehensive risk-factor optimization alongside glucose lowering; I should double-check this alignment with ADA and primary care guidance, which it does [^111xb6us] [^116twWNM] [^116QMFz5]. Hmm, wait a minute, does clinical literature also emphasize heterogeneity and multifactorial drivers in T2DM neuropathy management? Yes, contemporary reviews in T2DM highlight earlier diagnosis and multifactorial risk reduction due to the complex pathophysiology [^1137Ebuh].

> I should confirm independent but additive etiologies. Alcohol can cause neuropathy via direct neurotoxicity, oxidative stress, microglial activation, and nutrient deficiencies (notably thiamine), and in the setting of diabetes appears to act as a causator and/or accelerator, with largely nonoverlapping mechanisms that render nerve injury additive; hold on, I should verify the additive concept — it is specifically noted that alcoholic and diabetic distal symmetric polyneuropathies exert additive peripheral nerve damage, which strengthens the counseling imperative to reduce alcohol exposure [^112R5L4p] [^116Bs26G].

> Next, I should review the pathological and clinical pattern. The prototypical manifestation is a length-dependent, distal symmetric sensorimotor polyneuropathy with a "dying-back" axonopathy pattern; small fibers are often affected early, producing pain, dysesthesias, and thermal allodynia, followed by large-fiber involvement with vibration loss, proprioceptive deficits, and gait instability; let me verify this against contemporary neuromuscular summaries and practice reviews, which confirm this staged fiber involvement and distal symmetric pattern [^113YQmwP] [^116Rofy5] [^116phtxZ]. I need to ensure I am not ignoring atypical phenotypes; focal mononeuropathies and radiculoplexus neuropathies can occur but are not the dominant pattern in the metabolic neuropathy of diabetes [^113YQmwP].

> Let me synthesize succinctly, keeping the chain of causality tight. Diabetic neuropathy is driven primarily by chronic hyperglycemia, which initiates a multifactorial cascade — polyol pathway activation, AGE accumulation, oxidative stress, and neurovascular insufficiency — with superimposed inflammatory signaling that together produce progressive length-dependent axonal injury beginning in small fibers and advancing to large-fiber dysfunction; glucose optimization prevents or delays neuropathy most robustly in T1DM, whereas in T2DM the contribution of hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and broader metabolic syndrome biology necessitates comprehensive risk-factor control because glycemic benefits are more modest, and alcohol exposure represents an independent additive neurotoxin that can accelerate injury, culminating in distal symmetric sensorimotor polyneuropathy with typical small-fiber–predominant early symptoms and later large-fiber deficits [^112tU71u] [^111xb6us] [^111F8KFX] [^116fjuR5] [^112R5L4p] [^113YQmwP].

---

The most likely cause of neuropathy is **diabetes mellitus** [^113YQmwP] [^1165mLaJ], with chronic hyperglycemia driving distal symmetric polyneuropathy [^114Yregc] via metabolic and microvascular injury, oxidative stress, and advanced glycation end products [^111F8KFX] [^1158mkWx]. Risk increases with poor glycemic control, longer diabetes duration, and metabolic syndrome [^111xb6us]; prediabetes also raises neuropathy risk [^111ZoRKr] [^1111XTRT]. Other common causes include alcohol use [^112R5L4p], **nutritional deficiencies (especially B12)** [^116Rofy5], and medications, particularly chemotherapeutic agents; less frequent causes include autoimmune, infectious, and genetic disorders. Management centers on optimizing **glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid control** [^112tU71u] [^116twWNM]; for pain, **gabapentinoids, SNRIs, TCAs, or sodium channel blockers** may be used [^112YjwVR] [^112ThFLs]; **opioids are not recommended** [^117Sc3X7] [^115StD1R].

### Diabetic neuropathy [^114Yregc]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2019). Low credibility.

The global epidemic of prediabetes and diabetes has led to a corresponding epidemic of complications from these disorders. The most prevalent complication is neuropathy, specifically distal symmetric polyneuropathy, commonly referred to as diabetic neuropathy in this context. Diabetic neuropathy is characterized by a loss of sensory function beginning distally in the lower extremities, often accompanied by pain and significant morbidity. Over time, at least 50% of individuals with diabetes develop diabetic neuropathy.

Glucose control can effectively halt the progression of diabetic neuropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, although the effects are more modest in those with type 2 diabetes mellitus. These findings have prompted new efforts to understand the aetiology of diabetic neuropathy and led to 2017 recommendations on prevention and treatment approaches specific to each type of diabetes. Concurrently, new guidelines for managing painful diabetic neuropathy, emphasizing the use of distinct drug classes while avoiding opioids, have been introduced.

While our understanding of the complexities of diabetic neuropathy has substantially evolved over the past decade, the distinct mechanisms underlying neuropathy in type 1 and type 2 diabetes remain unknown. Future discoveries in disease pathogenesis will be crucial to addressing all aspects of diabetic neuropathy, from prevention to treatment.

This systematic review and meta‐analysis revealed that pre‐diabetic patients had a greater risk of peripheral neuropathy compared to healthy subjects. Therefore, policymakers and public health bodies need to give special attention to preventive strategies and effective lifestyle interventions for pre‐diabetic patients to reduce the risk of neuropathy and its consequences. Further well‐designed longitudinal and interventional research is needed to identify associated factors for the development of neuropathy among pre‐diabetics, as well as the benefits of lifestyle interventions.

### Progressive axonal dysfunction precedes development of neuropathy in type 2 diabetes [^111F8KFX]. Diabetes (2012).

The prevalence of diabetes has increased dramatically in the last three decades, currently affecting an estimated 285–347 million people worldwide. Neuropathy remains one of the most common and troubling complications of diabetes, affecting up to 50% of all patients. The development of neuropathy greatly increases the morbidity of diabetes and significantly affects quality of life. Typically presenting as a distal sensorimotor polyneuropathy, diabetic neuropathy produces prominent symptoms, including neuropathic pain, numbness, tingling, weakness, and balance problems. Furthermore, secondary complications may lead to serious further morbidity, including ulceration, fractures, amputations, and even death.

The pathophysiology underlying the development of diabetic neuropathy remains unclear but has been linked to multiple metabolic and neurovascular factors. Glycemic control and glycated hemoglobin levels correlate with the incidence of neuropathy, and tight glycemic control may slow the progression of diabetic neuropathy. However, glycemic control alone is not sufficient to account for the development of neuropathy, and a range of other factors may contribute, including the accumulation of advanced glycation end products, reductions in blood flow, and oxidative stress. Given the high risk of morbidity arising from diabetic neuropathy, early detection and intervention is crucial prior to the onset of neuropathic symptoms. However, neuropathy in diabetic patients remains underdiagnosed, and early identification is problematic.

### Diagnosis and management of sensory polyneuropathy [^116Rofy5]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

Sensory polyneuropathies, caused by dysfunction of peripheral sensory nerve fibers, are a heterogeneous group of disorders ranging from common diabetic neuropathy to rare sensory neuronopathies. The presenting symptoms, acuity, time course, severity, and subsequent morbidity vary, depending on the fiber type affected and the underlying cause. Damage to small thinly myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers results in neuropathic pain, whereas damage to large myelinated sensory afferents leads to proprioceptive deficits and ataxia. These disorders have diverse causes, including metabolic, toxic, infectious, inflammatory, autoimmune, and genetic conditions. Idiopathic sensory polyneuropathies are common but should be considered a diagnosis of exclusion.

The diagnostic evaluation involves electrophysiologic testing, including nerve conduction studies, histopathologic analysis of nerve tissue, serum studies, and sometimes autonomic testing and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Treatment depends on the underlying cause and may include immunotherapy, risk factor mitigation, symptomatic treatment, and gene therapy. Recently developed RNA interference and antisense oligonucleotide therapies offer hope for transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy. Many disorders lack specific treatments, making symptomatic and supportive management necessary. More research is needed into the underlying pathophysiology of nerve damage in these polyneuropathies to guide advances in treatment.

### Alcohol consumption as a causator and/or an accelerator of neuropathy in people with diabetes is regularly overlooked [^112R5L4p]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

Alcohol-induced neuropathy is attributed to the activation of spinal cord microglia, oxidative stress, free radical damage, and activation of mGlu5-receptors in the spinal cord. Additionally, there is activation of the sympathoadrenal and hypothalamic-pituitary axes. Nutritional deficiencies, particularly of thiamine, and the direct toxic effect of alcohol and its metabolites, especially acetaldehyde, on the nerve may also contribute. There is minimal overlap between the pathophysiologies of alcoholic and diabetic distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP), indicating that peripheral nerve damage from these conditions is likely to be additive.

An actual threshold of alcohol intake necessary for the development of alcohol-induced neuropathy is unidentified. However, the most significant risk factor is lifetime alcohol dose, with neuropathy being more prevalent in chronic alcoholism than in episodic alcoholism. Other risk factors include genetics, male gender, and the type of alcohol consumed, with a higher risk associated with wine compared to beer or spirits.

### Diabetes distal peripheral neuropathy: Subtypes and diagnostic and screening technologies [^113ri2KT]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2022). Low credibility.

Diabetes distal symmetrical peripheral neuropathy (DSPN) is the most prevalent form of neuropathy in industrialized countries, substantially increasing the risk for morbidity and premature mortality. DSPN may manifest with small-fiber disease, large-fiber disease, or a combination of both. This review summarizes:

- **DSPN subtypes (small- and large-fiber disease)**: Attention is given to clinical signs and patient symptoms.
- **Technological diagnosis and screening for large- and small-fiber disease**: This includes a comprehensive literature review of published studies from 2015 to the present (N = 66).

Review findings, informed by the most up-to-date research, advance critical understanding of DSPN large- and small-fiber screening technologies, including those designed for point-of-care use in primary care and endocrinology practices.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^115MgECo]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetic neuropathy, more specifically with respect to clinical assessment, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend eliciting a careful history. They advise assessing either temperature or pinprick sensation (small-fiber function) and vibration sensation using a 128-Hz tuning fork (for large-fiber function) for the assessment of distal symmetric polyneuropathy. It is also important to obtain annual 10-g monofilament testing in all patients with diabetes to identify feet at risk for ulceration and amputation.

### Mechanisms and management of diabetic painful distal symmetrical polyneuropathy [^115C5CGt]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Diagnosing and assessing the severity of DSPN and painful DSPN involves understanding a broad spectrum of presentations. Patients may show severe painful symptoms with few signs, or conversely, they may present with a foot ulcer after losing all sensation, reporting no prior pain or discomfort. When questioned, these patients might describe their feet feeling "numb" or "dead". It is well recognized that the severity of symptoms does not always correlate with the severity of the deficit observed during clinical examination.

The American Diabetes Association Consensus Statement recommends that diagnosing painful DSPN in clinical practice should be a clinical evaluation based on the patient's pain description and typical features of peripheral neuropathy. These features include a reduction in sensory modalities and the absence or reduction of ankle and knee reflexes. Because DSPN is a diagnosis of exclusion, a thorough clinical history along with a peripheral neurological and vascular examination of the lower limbs is crucial. This thorough examination helps exclude other causes of neuropathic and leg/foot pain, such as peripheral vascular disease, arthritis, malignancy, alcohol abuse, and spinal canal stenosis. Nerve conduction studies are rarely helpful in practice, but they can assist in excluding other pain causes such as entrapment syndromes. Patients exhibiting asymmetrical symptoms or signs — such as the loss of an ankle jerk in one leg only, rapid symptom progression, or a predominance of motor symptoms and signs — should be assessed with care.

### Neuropathy [^111ouUJv]. Canadian Journal of Diabetes (2018). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic neuropathy, more specifically with respect to systemic therapy, the DC 2018 guidelines recommend considering the following agents, alone or in combination, for the treatment of patients with painful peripheral neuropathy:

- **Gabapentin**: An anticonvulsant medication used to alleviate neuropathic pain.
- **Pregabalin**: A medication similar to gabapentin, utilized in the management of neuropathic pain.
- **Valproate**: Often used to treat seizures, this agent can also help manage peripheral neuropathy.
- **Amitriptyline**: A tricyclic antidepressant that is effective in relieving neuropathic pain.
- **Duloxetine or venlafaxine**: Both medications are serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors that assist in managing pain associated with diabetic neuropathy.

### Mechanisms and management of diabetic painful distal symmetrical polyneuropathy [^116phtxZ]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Neuropathies are the most common long-term microvascular complications of diabetes, affecting individuals with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Up to 50% of older patients with type 2 diabetes show evidence of a distal neuropathy. These neuropathies are characterized by a progressive loss of nerve fibers that impacts both autonomic and somatic divisions of the nervous system. The clinical features of diabetic neuropathies vary significantly, though only a minority are associated with pain. This review focuses primarily on the most common painful neuropathy, chronic sensorimotor distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSPN). DSPN has significant detrimental effects on its sufferers and is linked to an increased risk of foot ulceration, Charcot neuroarthropathy, and higher mortality.

In addition to DSPN, there are other rarer neuropathies associated with painful symptoms. These include acute painful neuropathy, which often follows periods of unstable glycemic control, mononeuropathies (e.g. cranial nerve palsies), radiculopathies, and entrapment neuropathies (e.g. carpal tunnel syndrome). The most prevalent form of diabetic polyneuropathy, accounting for over 90% of cases, is typical DSPN or chronic DSPN.

The Toronto Diabetic Neuropathy Expert Group defines DSPN as "a symmetrical, length-dependent sensorimotor polyneuropathy attributable to metabolic and microvessel alterations resulting from chronic hyperglycemia exposure and cardiovascular risk covariates". An abnormality of nerve conduction (NC) tests, often subclinical, is common.

### Plantar pressure distribution in diverse stages of diabetic neuropathy [^115nZPxh]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Diabetic foot ulceration in patients with diabetes could be associated with high plantar pressure caused by diabetic neuropathy. Therefore, one potential method to identify high-risk legs in diabetic patients with neuropathy is to characterize elevated plantar pressure distributions.

- **Objective**: Comparing the plantar pressure distribution in diabetic patients who suffer from neuropathy with those without neuropathy.

- **Methods and materials**: Plantar pressure distribution was recorded in the following categories: 38 diabetic patients without neuropathy, and 30, 40, and 34 patients with mild, moderate, and severe neuropathy, respectively.

- **Results**: Patients suffering from severe neuropathy exhibited higher maximum peak plantar pressure at the midfoot, heel, and medial forefoot. The peak pressure at the midfoot was significantly different among the following categories: patients without neuropathy (32.3 ± 17.9 kPa), mild neuropathic (24.0 ± 17.9 kPa), moderate neuropathic (21.5 ± 12.6 kPa), and severe neuropathic (22.9 ± 10.7 kPa) groups (p = 0.02).

- **Conclusion**: The progression of diabetic neuropathy is associated with increased peak plantar pressure.

### Neuropathy and related findings in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications study [^117DhfrM]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) enrolled 1,441 patients with type 1 diabetes between 1983 and 1989. At study entry, participants were randomly assigned to intensive insulin therapy (INT), targeting near-normal glycemia, or conventional insulin therapy (CON) according to the standard of care at that time. Microvascular diabetes complications were assessed during the DCCT, including the development and progression of the peripheral and cardiovascular autonomic manifestations of diabetic neuropathy.

In 1993, after an average of 6.5 years of follow-up, the DCCT investigators reported that INT significantly reduced the incidence of diabetic neuropathy, similar to findings for diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy. INT was subsequently widely accepted as the standard of care for type 1 diabetes. At DCCT end, DCCT CON participants were taught INT, and all participants were encouraged to adhere as closely as possible to an intensive diabetes treatment regimen. They were then returned to their prior healthcare providers for ongoing care.

The observational Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) follow-up was established to monitor the long-term effects of prior INT compared with prior CON treatment on the development and progression of more advanced microvascular complications and cardiovascular disease in the DCCT cohort. Diabetic neuropathy represents a clinically diverse group of disorders having differing anatomic distribution, clinical course, and underlying pathophysiology, but ultimately thought to reflect metabolic and other factors.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2012 [^117DEEY1]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

All patients should be screened for distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DPN) starting at the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, five years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, and at least annually thereafter using simple clinical tests. Electrophysiological testing is rarely needed, except in situations where clinical features are atypical. Screening for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy should be instituted at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and five years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Special testing is rarely needed and may not affect management or outcomes. Medications for the relief of specific symptoms related to painful DPN and autonomic neuropathy are recommended, as they improve the quality of life for the patient.

The diabetic neuropathies are heterogeneous with diverse clinical manifestations. They may be focal or diffuse. Most common among the neuropathies are chronic sensorimotor DPN and autonomic neuropathy. Although DPN is a diagnosis of exclusion, complex investigations to exclude other conditions are rarely needed.

The early recognition and appropriate management of neuropathy in patients with diabetes are important for several reasons: 1) nondiabetic neuropathies may be present in patients with diabetes and may be treatable; 2) numerous treatment options exist for symptomatic diabetic neuropathy; 3) up to 50% of DPN may be asymptomatic, placing patients at risk for insensate injury to their feet; and 4) autonomic neuropathy, particularly cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy, is associated with significant risk factors.

### Diabetic neuropathy: Understanding the nexus of diabetic neuropathy, gut dysbiosis and cognitive impairment [^112dCiBq]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Diabetic neuropathy is a traditional and one of the most prevalent complications of diabetes mellitus. The exact pathophysiology of diabetic neuropathy is not fully understood; however, oxidative stress and inflammation are proven to be major underlying mechanisms of neuropathy, which are described in detail. Gut dysbiosis is being studied for various neurological disorders, and its impact on diabetic neuropathy is also explained. Diabetic neuropathy also causes a loss in an individual's quality of life, and one such adverse event is cognitive dysfunction. The interrelation between neuropathy, cognitive dysfunction, and the gut is reviewed.

- **Methods**: The exact mechanism is not understood, but several hypotheses, cross-sectional studies, and systematic reviews suggest a relationship between cognition and neuropathy. The review has collected data from various review and research publications that justify this interrelationship.

- **Results**: The multifactorial etiology and pathophysiology of diabetic neuropathy are described with special emphasis on the role of gut dysbiosis. There might exist a correlation between neuropathy and cognitive impairment caused simultaneously in diabetic patients.

- **Conclusions**: This review summarizes the relationship that might exist between diabetic neuropathy, cognitive dysfunction, and the impact of a disturbed gut microbiome on its development and progression.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2012 [^112yvbVV]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Amputation and foot ulceration, consequences of diabetic neuropathy and/or peripheral arterial disease (PAD), are common major causes of morbidity and disability in people with diabetes. Early recognition and management of risk factors can prevent or delay adverse outcomes.

The risk of ulcers or amputations is increased in people who have the following risk factors:

- **Previous amputation**: Increases the likelihood of future complications.
- **Past foot ulcer history**: Indicates potential risk for further foot problems.
- **Peripheral neuropathy**: Reduces sensation, increasing injury risk.
- **Foot deformity**: Deforms pressure points, leading to ulcer risk.
- **Peripheral vascular disease**: Compromises blood flow, impairing healing.
- **Visual impairment**: Limits the ability to detect foot problems.
- **Diabetic nephropathy (especially patients on dialysis)**: Raises complication risk.
- **Poor glycemic control**: Aggravates diabetes-related complications.
- **Cigarette smoking**: Impairs circulation, escalating foot issues.

Many studies have been published proposing a range of tests to identify patients at risk for foot ulceration, creating confusion among practitioners regarding which screening tests should be adopted in clinical practice. An ADA task force was assembled in 2008 to summarize recent literature in this area and recommend what should be included in the comprehensive foot exam for adult patients with diabetes. Their recommendations are summarized below, but clinicians should refer to the task force report for further details and practical descriptions of how to perform components of the comprehensive foot examination.

### Neuropathy of impaired glucose tolerance and its measurement [^114uBY1K]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) was originally shown in the prospective Whitehall Study to carry an increased risk of large-vessel disease only. Whether or not IGT may also confer an increased risk for microvascular complications is not clear. Although microalbuminuria has been shown to be increased in those with IGT compared with control subjects, the incidence of retinopathy (IGT 6.7% vs. NGT 5.8%) and moderate neuropathy (IGT 5.7% vs. NGT 2.8%) have been found to be similar.

Nevertheless, it has been proposed that IGT may cause neuropathy. However, little is new in clinical medicine; over 40 years ago, Ellenberg suggested that neuropathy may indeed occur in pre-diabetes, although it is interesting that the interpretation was that factors other than hyperglycemia may cause the neuropathy. The recent resurgence of interest in IGT neuropathy is based on four separate studies of patients with idiopathic small-fiber neuropathy, where the prevalence of IGT was found to be 34–35.6%, three times the prevalence in age-matched control subjects. We believe the interpretation of these studies has significant limitations because the populations studied were selected for the presence of idiopathic small-fiber neuropathy, rather than IGT. Furthermore, as pointed out by Dyck et al. in a critical review, the association between IGT and neuropathy remains to be confirmed in an ongoing prospective study. Added to this, the relationship between the metabolic syndrome and its component constituents to IGT neuropathy has come under scrutiny.

Diabetic neuropathy is the most common neuropathy in industrialized countries and is associated with a wide range of clinical manifestations. The vast majority of patients with clinical diabetic neuropathy have a distal symmetrical form of the disorder that progresses following a fiber-length-dependent pattern, with sensory and autonomic manifestations predominating. This pattern of neuropathy is associated with progressive distal axonopathy. Patients experience pain, trophic changes in the feet, and autonomic disturbances.

Occasionally, patients with diabetes can develop focal and multifocal neuropathies that include cranial nerve involvement and limb and truncal neuropathies. This neuropathic pattern tends to occur after 50 years of age, and mostly in patients with long-standing diabetes mellitus. Length-dependent diabetic polyneuropathy does not show any trend towards improvement, and it either relentlessly progresses or remains relatively stable over a number of years. Conversely, the focal diabetic neuropathies, which are often associated with inflammatory vasculopathy on nerve biopsies, remain self-limited, sometimes following a relapsing course.

### The pathogenesis and management of painful diabetic neuropathy: a review [^116N1Ppv]. Diabetic Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Painful diabetic neuropathy has always been a challenging complication of diabetes mellitus. Emerging theories suggest that early dysaesthesia associated with painful neuropathy may act as a marker for the development of the 'at risk' foot, allowing preventative clinical strategies to be undertaken. The mechanisms of neuropathic pain are complex. The authors' intentions are to help members of the diabetes care team better understand and appreciate the diverse symptoms reported by patients. The various treatments available for painful neuropathy are discussed in detail. Robust comparative studies on such treatments are, however, unavailable, and the authors have designed a logical approach to management based on best evidence and their own clinical experience.

### Diabetic peripheral neuropathy in people with type 2 diabetes: too little too late [^1137Ebuh]. Diabetic Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy in people with type 2 diabetes is poorly managed due to its insidious onset, delayed diagnosis, and complex etiology. This results not only from hyperglycemia but also from factors such as aging, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and obesity. Since there is no US Food and Drug Administration-approved disease-modifying therapy for diabetic peripheral neuropathy, the key to ameliorating it in type 2 diabetes must be earlier diagnosis and timely multifactorial risk factor reduction. The management of painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy also requires a detailed appraisal of the choice of therapy, considering efficacy, patient preferences, comorbidities, side effect profiles, and potential for abuse.

### Diabetic neuropathies: Clinical manifestations and current treatment options [^113mMe5y]. Nature Clinical Practice. Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Diabetic neuropathies are a heterogeneous group of disorders that encompass a wide range of abnormalities. They can be focal or diffuse, proximal or distal, affecting both peripheral and autonomic nervous systems, and they cause morbidity with a significant impact on the quality of life for individuals with diabetes, potentially leading to early mortality. Distal symmetric polyneuropathy, the most common type of diabetic neuropathy, typically involves both small and large nerve fibers. Small-nerve-fiber neuropathy often presents with pain but lacks objective signs or electrophysiologic evidence of nerve damage and is recognized as a component of impaired glucose tolerance and metabolic syndromes. The greatest risk associated with small-fiber neuropathy is foot ulceration, which may lead to gangrene and amputation.

Large-nerve-fiber neuropathies produce numbness, ataxia, and uncoordination, impairing daily activities and leading to falls and fractures. A thorough history and detailed physical examination are essential for diagnosis. Symptomatic therapy is available, and newer treatment modalities based on etiological factors are being explored, holding the potential for significant impact on morbidity and mortality. Preventive strategies and patient education continue to be crucial in reducing complication rates and mortality.

### Executive summary: Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2010 [^111rhAon]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

**Neuropathy screening and treatment**: All patients should be screened for distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DPN) at diagnosis and at least annually thereafter, using simple clinical tests. Electrophysiological testing is rarely needed, except in situations where the clinical features are atypical. Screening for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy should be instituted at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Special testing is rarely needed and may not affect management or outcomes. Medications for the relief of specific symptoms related to DPN and autonomic neuropathy are recommended, as they improve the quality of life of the patient.

### Novel insights on diagnosis, cause and treatment of diabetic neuropathy: Focus on painful diabetic neuropathy [^114GWyPv]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Diabetic neuropathy is common, often under or misdiagnosed, and causes substantial morbidity with increased mortality. Defining and developing sensitive diagnostic tests for diabetic neuropathy is key not only to implementing earlier interventions but also to ensuring that the most appropriate endpoints are employed in clinical intervention trials. This is critical as many potentially effective therapies may never progress to the clinic, not due to a lack of therapeutic effect, but because the endpoints were not sufficiently sensitive or robust to identify benefit.

Apart from improving glycaemic control, there is no licensed treatment for diabetic neuropathy. However, a number of pathogenetic pathways remain under active study. Painful diabetic neuropathy is a cause of considerable morbidity and, while many pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions are currently used, only two are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.

We address the important issue of the 'placebo effect' and also consider potential new pharmacological therapies as well as nonpharmacological interventions in the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2010 [^116qLT4Q]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Amputation and foot ulceration, consequences of diabetic neuropathy and/or peripheral artery disease (PAD), are common and significant causes of morbidity and disability in people with diabetes. Early recognition and management of risk factors can prevent or delay adverse outcomes.

The risk of ulcers or amputations is increased in people who have the following risk factors:

- **Previous amputation**: Past incidents contribute to heightened vulnerability.
- **Past foot ulcer history**: Recurrence risk is elevated for those with a history.
- **Peripheral neuropathy**: Nerve damage increases risk of injuries.
- **Foot deformity**: Abnormal structure can lead to pressure sores.
- **Peripheral vascular disease**: Compromised blood flow raises risk.
- **Visual impairment**: Difficulty in foot inspection can delay treatment.
- **Diabetic nephropathy (especially patients on dialysis)**: Affects circulation and healing.
- **Poor glycemic control**: High blood sugar exacerbates complications.
- **Cigarette smoking**: Impairs blood circulation and healing processes.

Many studies have been published proposing a range of tests that might usefully identify patients at risk of foot ulceration, creating confusion among practitioners as to which screening tests should be adopted in clinical practice. An ADA task force was therefore assembled in 2008 to concisely summarize recent literature in this area and recommend what should be included in the comprehensive foot exam for adult patients with diabetes. Their recommendations are summarized below, but clinicians should refer to the task force report for further details and practical descriptions of how to perform components of the comprehensive foot examination.

### Diabetic neuropathies: Update on definitions, diagnostic criteria, estimation of severity, and treatments [^112UkhcY]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Estimating severity requires greater attention in the context of diabetic neuropathies. For patients with diabetes, it is inadequate to simply categorize them as having or not having diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSPN); the severity of the condition must also be determined. A reliable objective and quantitative measure, such as nerve conduction (NC) abnormality, should be considered the minimal criterion for diagnosing DSPN. In the absence of NC value assessments, only a possible or probable diagnosis of DSPN can be made. The severity of DSPN is a composite of neuropathy symptoms, physical signs, neurophysiologic test abnormalities, and other dysfunctions and impairments. Therefore, cumulative scores of various neurologic signs, symptoms, neurophysiologic test abnormalities, or functional activity measures may indicate the condition's severity.

An alternative approach to estimating severity involves grading severity levels. Dyck described the stages of severity as follows:

- **Grade 0**: No abnormality of NC, such as a sum of 5 NC normal deviates less than the 95th percentile or another suitable NC criterion.
- **Grade 1a**: Abnormality of NC, such as a sum of 5 NC normal deviates equal to or greater than the 95th percentile, but without symptoms or signs.
- **Grade 1b**: NC abnormality of stage 1a plus neurologic signs typical of DSPN, but without neuropathy symptoms.
- **Grade 2a**: NC abnormality of stage 1a with or without signs (if present, less than 2b) and with typical neuropathic symptoms.
- **Grade 2b**: NC abnormality of stage 1a and a moderate degree of weakness (approximately 50%) in ankle dorsiflexion, with or without neuropathy symptoms.

### Painful diabetic neuropathy [^114aetr1]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a worldwide epidemic, and associated neuropathy is its most costly and disabling complication. Given the rising prevalence of painful diabetic neuropathy, it is increasingly important that we understand the best ways to diagnose and treat this condition. Diagnostic tests in this field are evolving rapidly. These include the use of skin biopsies to measure small unmyelinated fibers, as well as even newer techniques that can measure both small unmyelinated fibers and large myelinated fibers in the same biopsy.

The main treatments for painful diabetic neuropathy remain management of the underlying diabetes and drugs for the relief of pain. However, emerging evidence points to major differences between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, including the ability of glycemic control to prevent neuropathy. Enhanced glucose control is much more effective at preventing neuropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes than in those with type 2 disease. This dichotomy emphasizes the need to study the pathophysiologic differences between the two types of diabetes, because different treatments may be needed for each condition.

The impact of the metabolic syndrome on neuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes may account for the difference between the two types of diabetes and requires further study. Finally, neuropathic pain is under-recognized and undertreated despite an ever-evolving list of effective drugs. Evidence exists to support several drugs, but the optimal sequence and combination of these drugs are still to be determined.

### Screening for diabetic peripheral neuropathy in resource-limited settings [^111PdgDj]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). High credibility.

Diabetic neuropathy is the most common microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus and a major risk factor for diabetes-related lower-extremity complications. Diffuse neuropathy is the most frequently encountered pattern of neurological dysfunction and presents clinically as distal symmetrical sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Due to the increasing public health significance of diabetes mellitus and its complications, screening for diabetic peripheral neuropathy is essential. Consequently, a review of the principles that guide screening practices, especially in resource-limited clinical settings, is urgently needed.

- **Evidence-based assessments**: Numerous methods are used to detect diabetic peripheral neuropathy. In accordance with guideline recommendations from the American Diabetes Association, International Diabetes Federation, International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot, and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, a screening algorithm for diabetic peripheral neuropathy based on multiphasic clinical assessment should be employed. This includes stratification according to risk of developing diabetic foot syndrome, individualized treatment, and scheduled follow-up, particularly in resource-limited settings.

- **Conclusions**: Screening for diabetic peripheral neuropathy in resource-limited settings requires a practical and comprehensive approach in order to promptly identify affected individuals. The principles of screening for diabetic peripheral neuropathy are: multiphasic approach, risk stratification, individualized treatment, and scheduled follow-up. Regular screening is essential to improve patient outcomes.

### The spectrum of neuropathy in diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance [^117Joj3G]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the neuropathy associated with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and diabetes mellitus (DM), as determined by oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT).

- **Methods**: Patients with peripheral neuropathy of unknown cause were prescribed OGTT. The duration of neuropathic symptoms, neuropathic pain, neuropathy classification, nerve conduction test results, and intraepidermal nerve fiber densities (IENFD) were compared between IGT and DM groups.

- **Results**: Seventy-three patients completed OGTT; 41 (56%) had abnormal results. Of these 41 patients, 26 had IGT and 15 had DM. Patients with IGT had less severe neuropathy than patients with diabetes, as measured by sural nerve amplitudes (p = 0.056), sural nerve conduction velocities (p = 0.03), and distal leg IENFD (p = 0.01). Patients with IGT had predominantly small fiber neuropathy compared to patients with DM (p = 0.05), who had more involvement of large nerve fibers.

- **Conclusions**: The neuropathy associated with IGT is milder than the neuropathy associated with DM. Small nerve fibers are prominently affected and may be the earliest detectable sign of neuropathy in glucose dysmetabolism. OGTT is appropriate in patients with idiopathic neuropathy.

### Diabetic neuropathy collection: Introduction to diabetic neuropathy [^112XaySw]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

The initial symptoms of diabetic neuropathy can progress to motor system involvement, which manifests as weakness occurring in more distal areas but moves proximally as the disease progresses. Autonomic symptoms also emerge, typically later in the disease course. These may affect the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary systems, and involve sweat glands. Cardiac autonomic symptoms are generally not present in the early stages of autonomic neuropathy and can be detected through cardiac autonomic testing.

- **Most common type of diabetic neuropathy**: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy, or distal symmetrical polyneuropathy, is the most common form and is characterized by the 'glove and stocking' distribution of nerve damage. Although autonomic neuropathy is also prevalent, peripheral neuropathy remains the most frequently encountered.

- **Prevention of diabetic neuropathy**: It differs between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, maintaining good glycaemic control can prevent or halt the progression of diabetic neuropathy. However, for type 2 diabetes, the effectiveness of this approach remains uncertain.

### Diabetes mellitus and the peripheral nervous system: manifestations and mechanisms [^1158mkWx]. Muscle & Nerve (2007). Low credibility.

Diabetes targets the peripheral nervous system with several different patterns of damage and several mechanisms of disease. Diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) is a common disorder involving a large proportion of diabetic patients, yet its pathophysiology is controversial. Mechanisms considered have included polyol flux, microangiopathy, oxidative stress, abnormal signaling from advanced glycation end products, and growth factor deficiency. Although some clinical trials have demonstrated modest benefits in disease stabilization or pain therapy in DPN, robust therapy capable of reversing the disease is unavailable. In this review, general aspects of DPN and other diabetic neuropathies are examined, including a summary of recent therapeutic trials. A particular emphasis is placed on the evidence that the neurobiology of DPN reflects a unique yet common and disabling neurodegenerative disorder.

### International neuropathy workshop of 2009: Introduction to the final reports [^111tpkQh]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Neuropathies are among the most common long-term complications of diabetes, affecting up to 50% of patients. Their clinical features vary immensely, and patients may present with a wide spectrum of specialties, for example, from neurology to urology, or from cardiology to podiatry. Neuropathies are typically characterized by a progressive loss of nerve fibers, affecting both principal divisions of the peripheral nervous system. The epidemiology and natural history of diabetic neuropathies remain poorly defined.

The International Consensus Workshop in Toronto in 2009 was convened due to the absence of clear, universally accepted guidelines regarding the definition of diabetic neuropathies. This has resulted in significant variation in how neuropathy is diagnosed across different centers and countries. A preliminary summary report of the Toronto meeting was published in 2010. The series of papers published in this issue of Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews are the detailed reports from each sub-group of the Consensus panel.

- **Problems with definitions and classification of neuropathy**: These reviews cover the issues related to the definitions and classification of neuropathy.
- **Management of painful neuropathy and small fiber neuropathies**: This section tackles the management of painful neuropathy and the sub-group of small fiber neuropathies.
- **Autonomic neuropathies**: There are also three papers on autonomic neuropathies, covering cardiovascular autonomic neuropathies as well as other areas including gastrointestinal, urogenital, and pseudomotor neuropathies.

This series of papers provides detailed information on the diverse aspects of diabetic neuropathy.

### Screening for diabetic peripheral neuropathy in resource-limited settings [^111u7Pki]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Low credibility.

Neuropathy is an important risk factor for diabetes-related lower-extremity complications, which collectively contribute to the increasing global disability burden, especially among adults aged 50–69 years. Due to the public health implications of DM and its complications in resource-limited settings, this narrative review aims to summarize the general principles of screening for diabetic peripheral neuropathy based on established and emerging evidence in order to delineate a practical approach to identifying adult patients at risk for diabetes-related foot disease and its complications.

Medical literature published in English between 1770 and 2023 was identified and considered for the review. The primary search strategy involved retrieval of relevant literature from health sciences databases (EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and PubMed) and grey literature (Google Scholar, Opengrey, Scopus, Virtual Health Library, Web of Science Core Collection, and organization websites) using a combination of keywords and Boolean operators: "comprehensive foot examination" AND "diabetic foot"; diabetes AND "microvascular complications"; ("diabetic foot" OR "diabetic foot syndrome"); ("diabetic peripheral neuropathy" OR "distal symmetrical polyneuropathy"); "diabetic peripheral neuropathy" AND guideline; epidemiology AND "diabetic peripheral neuropathy"; ("non-painful diabetic neuropathy" OR "painless diabetic neuropathy"); "painful diabetic neuropathy" AND treatment; "diabetic peripheral neuropathy" AND "risk factors"; prevention AND "diabetic peripheral neuropathy".

Medications for the relief of specific symptoms related to painful DPN and autonomic neuropathy are recommended, as they improve the quality of life of the patient (E).

The diabetic neuropathies are heterogeneous with diverse clinical manifestations. They may be focal or diffuse. Most common among the neuropathies are chronic sensorimotor DPN and autonomic neuropathy. Although DPN is a diagnosis of exclusion, complex investigations to exclude other conditions are rarely needed.

The early recognition and appropriate management of neuropathy in patients with diabetes are important for several reasons:

1. Nondiabetic neuropathies may be present in patients with diabetes and may be treatable.
2. A number of treatment options exist for symptomatic diabetic neuropathy.
3. Up to 50% of DPN may be asymptomatic, and patients are at risk for insensate injury to their feet.
4. Autonomic neuropathy, particularly CAN, is associated with substantial morbidity and.

### Polymorphic variants and risk of diabetic peripheral neuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^114qgXFQ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). High credibility.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic disease that has become increasingly prevalent in the last decades, with around 79% of affected individuals residing in low- and middle-income countries. In Latin America, studies indicate a similar increase in the prevalence of DM, with Mexico, Haiti, and Puerto Rico being the most affected regions.

Neuropathies are clinical syndromes related to microvascular complications in diabetic patients, characterized by variable symptoms, patterns of neurological involvement, risk factors, and causative mechanisms. Half of diabetic neuropathy (DN) cases present as distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP), a common type of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). DSP emerges in the context of metabolic dysfunction and can manifest in about 10–15% of newly diagnosed individuals with type 2 DM, and in 50% of patients living with the disease for ten years.

The estimated global prevalence of DPN in type 2 DM patients is 31.5%. It is characterized by varying clinical expressions, ranging from asymptomatic conditions to painful neuropathic discomfort, diabetic foot, Charcot arthropathy, and non-traumatic lower limb amputations. Early detection and prevention, therefore, are of vital importance.

- **Multifactorial inheritance and risk factors**: Type 2 DM involves multifactorial inheritance and several environmental risk factors, including poor glycemic control, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and depressive symptoms, among others.

### Understanding and treating painful diabetic neuropathy: Time for a paradigm shift [^115MNKyr]. Diabetic Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy (DN) remains unclear, resulting in disappointing progress in the development of effective therapies. There is only a limited understanding of why some patients experience severe chronic pain, while others have painless symptoms. Assessments of the peripheral nerves frequently reveal no differences between painful and painless DN. Evidence is growing that nerve damage in DN is more generalized, affecting the central nervous system, and these central changes are key to the development and persistence of pain in DN.

The advent of new radiological techniques offers non-invasive modalities to study central pathophysiological processes in greater detail. These insights are increasingly leading to the recognition that painful DN is a complex and heterogeneous disorder, necessitating a multimodal approach to treatment.

### The relationship between prediabetes and peripheral neuropathy-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111cD3pE]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Results**:

- **Study selection**: The literature search strategy yielded 839 records, and 515 remained after removing duplicates. After the initial screening based on titles and abstracts, 154 full-text articles were retained and assessed. Ultimately, 26 studies were included in the qualitative assessment and meta-analysis. Separate forest plots in the meta-analysis presented the outcomes of neuropathy based on assessment metrics, showing that neuropathy could worsen in prediabetic patients compared to controls. Results of the quality assessment of included studies, depicted in Table 2, show the majority were of high quality (17 studies), while only one study was of low quality.

- **Quality assessment**: The sample size of the study was 41,821, consisting of 16,009 patients and 25,812 controls. From the 26 studies, we extracted 91 studies because each study may include more than one outcome assessment metric. Only 5 out of 26 studies reported adjusted outcomes, controlling for factors such as age, sex, and BMI.

### Association of peripheral neuropathy with circulating advanced glycation end products, soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products and other risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes [^115Si6Ga]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy remains uncertain, and nonenzymatic glycoxidation is one of the contributing mechanisms. The aim of this study was to assess the respective relationship of diabetic peripheral neuropathy with glycoxidation, compared with other identified risk factors, in patients with type 2 diabetes.

- **Methods**: We included 198 patients with type 2 diabetes and high risk for vascular complications. Circulating concentrations of three advanced glycation end products (carboxymethyllysine, methyl-glyoxal-hydroimidazolone-1, pentosidine) and their soluble receptor (sRAGE) were measured. Peripheral neuropathy was assessed by the neuropathy disability score and the monofilament test, defined as either an abnormal monofilament test and/or a neuropathy disability score ≥ 6. Multivariate regression analyses were performed, adjusting for potential confounding factors for neuropathy: age, gender, diabetes duration, smoking, systolic blood pressure, waist circumference, height, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, glycated haemoglobin, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and lipid profile.

- **Results**: The prevalence of peripheral neuropathy was 20.7%. sRAGE and carboxymethyllysine were independently and positively associated with the presence of peripheral neuropathy. No significant association was found between peripheral neuropathy and methyl-glyoxal-hydroimidazolone-1 or pentosidine. Waist circumference, height, and peripheral arterial occlusive disease were independently associated with peripheral neuropathy.

- **Conclusions**: The study highlights the independent associations of sRAGE and carboxymethyllysine with peripheral neuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes. Further research is needed to explore these relationships and their potential clinical implications.

Neuropathy screening and treatment

All patients should be screened for distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DPN) starting at the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, and at least annually thereafter, using simple clinical tests. Electrophysiological testing is rarely needed, except in situations where the clinical features are atypical. Screening for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) should be instituted at the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Special testing is rarely needed and may not affect management or outcomes. Medications for the relief of specific symptoms related to painful DPN and autonomic neuropathy are recommended, as they improve the quality of life of the patient.

### European association for the study of diabetes 2019 conference: Podcast overview of the conference [^111nmCuT]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

The focus on neuropathy at the conference was significant, as painful neuropathy is a prevalent issue in clinical settings. The research presented on brain imaging techniques helps identify pain causes and explore management strategies. This research provides valuable insights into the mechanisms behind the complexity of pain in diabetic neuropathy.

In the same session, a talk discussed delineating clinical factors related to the complexity of pain. It noted an increase in BMI among those with painful neuropathy, which was also observed in diabetic patients with neuropathy but without pain. Identifying neuropathy based on clinical characteristics remains challenging. However, future research in painful neuropathy is likely to focus on central mechanisms for pain in relation to clinical and neuropathy phenotyping.

### Peripheral neuropathy defined by monofilament insensitivity and diabetes status: NHANES 1999–2004 [^1111XTRT]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

To determine whether diabetes status, including prediabetes, is associated with increased risk of peripheral neuropathy as defined by monofilament insensitivity, this study used data from the 1999–2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n = 7,818). Peripheral neuropathy was defined as one or more insensate sites detected by a Semmes-Weinstein 10-g monofilament. Generalized linear models were used to directly estimate relative risks (RRs) for the association of diabetes status and peripheral neuropathy.

After adjustment, compared with no diabetes, prediabetes [RR 1.11 (95% CI 0.92–1.34)] and undiagnosed diabetes [1.08 (0.73–1.61)] were associated with modest increases in risk of peripheral neuropathy. Diabetes was associated with a 74% higher risk of peripheral neuropathy [1.74 (1.50–2.01)].

In conclusion, diabetes is associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy defined by monofilament insensitivity. Prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes may be associated with only a modest increase in risk.

### Diabetic neuropathies: Update on definitions, diagnostic criteria, estimation of severity, and treatments [^113a611X]. Diabetes Care (2010).

**Conclusions**: Diabetic polyneuropathy is one of the most common long-term complications of diabetes, affecting approximately 50% of all diabetic people. This review by an international panel of experts examines recent literature regarding diagnostic criteria for DPN, painful DPN, and autonomic neuropathy, and makes diagnostic recommendations in the context of clinical practice and research. The review also discusses emerging markers of DPN. Finally, the diagnostic criteria for DPN are likely to evolve with developments in the field, and there is clearly a need for experts in the field to provide periodic updates.

### New trends in the etiopathogenesis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy [^114peh8i]. Journal of Child Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Neuropathy is well recognized as a major complication of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in adults, resulting in significant morbidity and possibly an increased mortality. Both the peripheral and autonomic nervous systems can be involved, and adolescents with diabetes can show early evidence of neuropathy. The pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy remains unclear but is thought to involve various mechanisms. This complication can be traced to the metabolic effects of hyperglycemia and/or other effects of insulin deficiency on the various constituents of the peripheral nerve. The polyol pathway and/or nonenzymatic glycation affecting one or more cell types in the multicellular constituents of the peripheral nerve appear likely to have an inciting role. The role of other factors, such as possible direct neurotrophic effects of insulin and insulin-related growth factors, seems to be relevant.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2011 [^115kWYyK]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Amputation and foot ulceration, consequences of diabetic neuropathy and/or peripheral artery disease (PAD), are common and major causes of morbidity and disability in people with diabetes. Early recognition and management of risk factors can prevent or delay adverse outcomes.

- **Risk factors**: The risk of ulcers or amputations is increased in people who have the following risk factors:
	- Previous amputation
	- Past foot ulcer history
	- Peripheral neuropathy
	- Foot deformity
	- Peripheral vascular disease
	- Visual impairment
	- Diabetic nephropathy (especially patients on dialysis)
	- Poor glycemic control
	- Cigarette smoking

Many studies have been published proposing a range of tests that might usefully identify patients at risk of foot ulceration, creating confusion among practitioners as to which screening tests should be adopted in clinical practice. An ADA task force was therefore assembled in 2008 to concisely summarize recent literature in this area and then recommend what should be included in the comprehensive foot exam for adult patients with diabetes. Their recommendations are summarized below, but clinicians should refer to the task force report for further details and practical descriptions of how to perform components of the comprehensive foot examination.
