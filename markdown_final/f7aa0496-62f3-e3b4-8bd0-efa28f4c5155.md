## Question

A 32-year-old woman, gravida 3 para 1+1, presents at 38+2 weeks of gestation for antenatal counseling. She has a history of one previous lower segment Cesarean section for breech presentation and one prior spontaneous vaginal delivery. Her current pregnancy is a singleton with cephalic presentation, and there are no complications. She expresses a strong preference for a vaginal birth. Her surgical records confirm a transverse lower uterine segment incision. She has no history of uterine rupture, placenta previa, or other contraindications to vaginal delivery. The hospital has facilities for emergency Cesarean section and senior obstetricians are available.

Based on current guidelines, what is the most appropriate recommendation regarding her mode of delivery, and what key points should be included in your counseling?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most appropriate recommendation regarding mode of delivery and the key counseling points for a 32-year-old woman at 38+2 weeks with one prior low transverse cesarean and one prior vaginal delivery, who strongly prefers vaginal birth. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether she is an appropriate candidate for a trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC). Then, I should verify the predicted probability of successful VBAC and how prior vaginal delivery modifies that risk. Next, I will review maternal and neonatal risks, especially uterine rupture, and ensure facility readiness. After that, I should outline intrapartum management and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and counseling plan, including documentation and shared decision-making, and I will double-check for any contraindications I might be missing before concluding.

> Let me first confirm candidacy for TOLAC. With one prior low transverse cesarean, a singleton cephalic pregnancy at term, and no contraindications such as classical incision, prior rupture, or placenta previa, she meets criteria for TOLAC and should be counseled accordingly, which aligns with ACOG and RCOG guidance and is echoed by FIGO recommendations for appropriately selected women [^7af97dd1] [^6b8388c6] [^34750d6e].

> Wait, let me verify the likelihood of success. Prior vaginal delivery is the strongest predictor of VBAC success, with reported success rates around 85–90% in women with a prior vaginal birth, and overall VBAC success ranges from 60–80% depending on factors like indication for prior cesarean, BMI, and labor onset. Given her prior spontaneous vaginal delivery and a non-recurrent indication (breech), her predicted success is high, though I should acknowledge that prediction models exist but are not outcome-proven and should not be used as absolute cutoffs [^3e240030] [^11259a41] [^7af97dd1].

> I need to check the key risks next. Uterine rupture risk with one prior low transverse cesarean is approximately 0.3–0.7%, and the absolute risk of perinatal death associated with planned VBAC is extremely low and comparable to nulliparous women in labor. Importantly, failed TOLAC carries higher maternal morbidity than successful VBAC or elective repeat cesarean, which is why counseling must incorporate individualized risk–benefit discussion and patient preferences [^3e240030] [^7af97dd1] [^a5566b00].

> Hold on, I should verify facility and staffing requirements. TOLAC should occur where emergency cesarean can be performed within about 30 minutes, with continuous electronic fetal monitoring, one-to-one nursing, anesthesia availability, and neonatal resuscitation capacity. The hospital here meets those standards, which supports proceeding with TOLAC if the patient chooses [^c7bd2205] [^34750d6e].

> Next, I should review intrapartum management. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring is recommended because fetal heart rate abnormalities are the most common sign of uterine rupture. Spontaneous labor is preferred when feasible, and if induction is needed, mechanical methods such as transcervical Foley or amniotomy are reasonable, while misoprostol should be avoided and oxytocin used cautiously with counseling about increased rupture risk. Epidural analgesia is not contraindicated and may be offered [^c7bd2205] [^34750d6e] [^10d54717].

> Let me consider alternatives and timing. Elective repeat cesarean at or after 39 weeks is reasonable if she declines TOLAC or if new contraindications arise; earlier scheduled cesarean without indication is discouraged due to neonatal respiratory morbidity. I should confirm that this timing aligns with ACOG guidance on elective delivery timing and RCOG recommendations for planned repeat cesarean [^c4ecca29] [^d39d8e32].

> I should double-check for any overlooked contraindications. There is no mention of classical incision, prior rupture, placenta previa, transverse lie, or other absolute contraindications to vaginal birth, and her prior cesarean was for breech, a non-recurrent indication, which further supports TOLAC candidacy. If any uncertainty about scar type existed, I would obtain operative notes to confirm a low transverse incision before proceeding [^7af97dd1] [^6b8388c6].

> Now, I will synthesize the recommendation. Given her favorable profile, strong preference for vaginal birth, and appropriate facility resources, the most appropriate recommendation is to offer a planned vaginal birth after cesarean with supportive counseling and shared decision-making, while documenting the discussion of risks, benefits, and alternatives. This aligns with ACOG, RCOG, and FIGO positions emphasizing patient-centered care and the safety of appropriately selected TOLAC [^7af97dd1] [^6b8388c6] [^34750d6e].

> Key counseling points I must include are: her high likelihood of VBAC success around 85–90% given prior vaginal delivery; uterine rupture risk about 0.3–0.7% with low transverse scar; the need for continuous fetal monitoring in labor; the possibility of emergency cesarean if complications arise; and the maternal benefits of VBAC compared with repeat cesarean, including fewer infections, less blood loss, and shorter recovery, balanced against the small increase in neonatal risk with planned VBAC. I should also discuss induction preferences and pain control options, including epidural, and ensure her values guide the plan [^3e240030] [^7af97dd1] [^34750d6e].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and logistics. I should record the shared decision-making conversation, confirm the agreed plan, and communicate with the labor team about her history and preferences. A written VBAC pathway or checklist can standardize care and improve safety, and I should confirm that the final decision is documented before the expected date of delivery to avoid last-minute ambiguity [^22a703f9] [^dd0cb28b].

---

The most appropriate recommendation is to **offer a trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC)** [^7af97dd1] because she has a high likelihood of successful VBAC (about 85–90%) [^3e240030] given a prior vaginal delivery and a low transverse uterine incision, and there are no contraindications. Uterine rupture risk is low (about 0.3–0.7%) [^11259a41] and comparable to nulliparous risk, and maternal morbidity is lower with successful VBAC than with planned repeat cesarean. Counsel on the benefits and risks, ensure continuous fetal monitoring [^c7bd2205], and confirm that emergency cesarean is available [^34750d6e]; if she declines TOLAC, schedule repeat cesarean at or after 39 weeks [^d39d8e32].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

ACOG and RCOG recommend offering TOLAC to women with one prior low transverse cesarean, a singleton cephalic pregnancy, and no contraindications, with **shared decision-making** [^7af97dd1] [^6b8388c6]. This patient meets these criteria, and her prior vaginal delivery further increases the likelihood of success [^3e240030].

---

## Likelihood of successful VBAC

Prior vaginal delivery is the strongest predictor of VBAC success, with rates of 85–90% in women with a prior vaginal birth [^3e240030]. Overall, VBAC success ranges from 60–80% [^11259a41], and is higher with spontaneous labor, non-recurrent indications, and longer interdelivery intervals [^11259a41].

---

## Risks and benefits of TOLAC

### Benefits

Benefits include **lower maternal morbidity** — fewer infections, transfusions, and hysterectomies — and **shorter recovery** with less postoperative pain and earlier mobilization [^a5566b00]. Future pregnancies also carry a lower risk of placenta previa, accreta, and adhesions [^3e240030].

---

### Risks

Risks include **uterine rupture** at 0.3–0.7% with a low transverse scar [^11259a41], and a small increase in neonatal mortality compared with planned repeat cesarean (about 1.3 per 10,000) [^f9c6efb4]. Failed TOLAC increases maternal morbidity compared with successful VBAC or elective repeat cesarean [^a5566b00].

---

## Intrapartum management and safety measures

- **Continuous fetal monitoring**: Recommended to detect uterine rupture early [^c7bd2205].
- **One-to-one midwifery care**: Improves outcomes and detection of complications [^34750d6e].
- **Immediate access to emergency cesarean**: Essential for rapid response to rupture or other emergencies [^34750d6e].
- **Epidural analgesia**: Not contraindicated and does not mask rupture pain [^34750d6e].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing decision

- **Prior vaginal delivery**: Strongly predicts VBAC success and reduces rupture risk [^3e240030].
- **Maternal age**: 32 years is not a contraindication; age alone does not mandate cesarean [^ac4df13b].
- **Patient preference**: Strong preference for vaginal birth supports offering TOLAC [^7af97dd1].

---

## Alternative option: planned repeat cesarean section

If TOLAC is declined, **planned repeat cesarean** at or after 39 weeks is recommended to reduce neonatal respiratory morbidity [^d39d8e32]. Risks include higher maternal morbidity, longer recovery, and increased risks in future pregnancies (placenta previa, accreta, adhesions) [^3e240030].

---

## Counseling points

- **High likelihood of success**: 85–90% given prior vaginal delivery [^3e240030].
- **Low rupture risk**: 0.3–0.7% with low transverse scar [^11259a41].
- **Benefits of VBAC**: Lower maternal morbidity, faster recovery, fewer future pregnancy complications [^a5566b00].
- **Risks of TOLAC**: Small increase in neonatal mortality, failed TOLAC morbidity [^f9c6efb4].
- **Intrapartum safety**: Continuous monitoring, experienced staff, rapid access to cesarean [^c7bd2205].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Offer **TOLAC** given her high likelihood of success, low rupture risk, and strong preference. Ensure shared decision-making, continuous monitoring, and readiness for emergency cesarean. If she declines, schedule repeat cesarean at or after 39 weeks [^d39d8e32].

Background

For women who have a caesarean section in their preceding pregnancy, two care policies for birth are considered standard: planned vaginal birth and planned elective repeat caesarean. Currently available information about the benefits and harms of both forms of care are derived from retrospective and prospective cohort studies. There have been no randomised trials, and recognising the deficiencies in the literature, there have been calls for methodologically rigorous studies to assess maternal and infant health outcomes associated with both care policies. The aims of our study are to assess in women with a previous caesarean birth, who are eligible in the subsequent pregnancy for a vaginal birth, whether a policy of planned vaginal birth after caesarean compared with a policy of planned repeat caesarean affects the risk of serious complications for the woman and her infant.

Design

Multicentered patient preference study and a randomised clinical trial.

Inclusion Criteria

Women with a single prior caesarean presenting in their next pregnancy with a single, live fetus in cephalic presentation, who have reached 37 weeks gestation, and who do not have a contraindication to a planned VBAC. Trial Entry & Randomisation: Eligible women will be given an information sheet during pregnancy, and will be recruited to the study from 37 weeks gestation after an obstetrician has confirmed eligibility for a planned vaginal birth. Written informed consent will be obtained. Women who consent to the patient preference study will be allocated their preference for either planned VBAC or planned, elective repeat caesarean. Women who consent to the randomised trial will be randomly allocated to either the planned vaginal birth after caesarean or planned elective repeat caesarean group. Treatment Groups: Women in the planned vaginal birth group will await spontaneous onset of labour whilst appropriate. Women in the elective repeat caesarean group will have this scheduled for between 38 and 40 weeks. Primary Study Outcome: Serious adverse infant outcome (death or serious morbidity).

Sample Size

2314 women in the patient preference study to show a difference in adverse neonatal outcome from 1.6% to 3.6% (p = 0.05, 80% power).

### Birth after previous caesarean birth [^ad3808e1]. RCOG (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cesarean delivery, more specifically with respect to vaginal birth after Cesarean delivery, indications for trial of labor, RCOG 2015 guidelines recommend to consider offering a vaginal birth after previous Cesarean delivery in females with ≥ 2 prior lower segment Cesarean deliveries after counseling by a senior obstetrician. Take into account the risk of uterine rupture and maternal morbidity, and the individual likelihood of successful vaginal birth after previous Cesarean delivery (such as given a history of prior vaginal delivery). Conduct labor in a center with suitable expertise and recourse to immediate surgical delivery.

Mode of delivery counseling—We suggest counseling that vaginal delivery is safe and appropriate if there are no other maternal or fetal indications for cesarean delivery. Counseling should include a discussion of the risks of cesarean delivery, the patient’s comorbidities, and the patient’s preferences and goals. Advancing patient age alone is not an indication for cesarean delivery. (GRADE 2B. Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.)

### ACOG committee opinion: number 265, December 2001. mode of term single breech delivery [^7e644ff7]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Recently, researchers conducted a large, international multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing a policy of planned cesarean birth with planned vaginal birth. Given the results of this exceptionally large and well-controlled clinical trial, the American College of Obstetricians continue their efforts to reduce breech presentations in singleton gestations through the application of external cephalic versions whenever possible. As a result of the findings of the study, planned vaginal delivery of a term singleton breech may no longer be appropriate. In those instances in which breech vaginal deliveries are pursued, great caution should be exercised. Patients with persistent breech presentation at term in a singleton gestation should undergo a planned cesarean delivery. A planned cesarean delivery does not apply to patients presenting in advanced labor imminent or to patients whose second twin is in a nonvertex presentation.

In light of recent studies that further clarify the long-term risks of vaginal breech delivery, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that the decision regarding mode of delivery should depend on the experience of the health care provider Cesarean delivery will be the preferred mode for most physicians because of the diminish-ing expertise in vaginal breech delivery. Planned vaginal delivery of a term singleton breech fetus may be reasonable under hospital-specific protocol guidelines for both eligibility and labor management. Before a vaginal breech delivery is planned, women should be informed that the risk of peri-natal or neonatal mortality or short-term serious neonatal morbidity may be higher than if a cesarean delivery is planned, and the patient's informed con-sent should be documented.

### FIGO good practice recommendations for vaginal birth after cesarean section [^11259a41]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The rising global rate of cesarean section (CS) has prompted renewed focus on vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) as a safe and effective alternative to repeat CS in properly selected women. The FIGO good practice recommendations provide evidence-based recommendations to guide VBAC care. Success rates for VBAC range from 60% to 80%, with the highest likelihood in women with prior vaginal birth, non-recurrent CS indications, interbirth intervals ≥18months, BMI <30kg/m 2 , and spontaneous labor onset. While uterine rupture is the primary concern, its risk remains low at approximately 0.3%-0.7% for women with one prior low transverse CS. Comparisons show that VBAC generally results in similar or better maternal and neonatal outcomes than planned repeat CS, including lower maternal mortality, fewer infections, and shorter hospital stays. This article emphasizes appropriate patient counseling, facility readiness for emergency CS, and continuous fetal monitoring during labor. With proper implementation, VBAC offers a valuable strategy to reduce unnecessary repeat surgeries, improve outcomes, and support informed maternal choice.

5 CONCLUSION

More than half of women with a twin pregnancy had a successful vaginal delivery. The most important risk factor for both planned and intrapartum CS was the first twin in non‐cephalic presentation regardless of the presentation of the second twin.

Strong recommendations for planned CS restrict the choices that women have for the delivery mode. Keeping the option of the vaginal route as the primary mode of delivery in a twin pregnancy maintains the right of the woman to have a vaginal delivery and avoid a uterine scar.

### ACOG committee opinion. mode of term singleton breech delivery. number 265, December 2001. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [^dc1dd861]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2002). Low credibility.

Recently, researchers conducted a large, international multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing a policy of planned cesarean birth with planned vaginal birth. Given the results of this exceptionally large and well-controlled clinical trial, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee on Obstetric Practice recommends that obstetricians continue their efforts to reduce breech presentations in singleton gestations through the application of external cephalic version whenever possible. As a result of the findings of the study, planned vaginal delivery of a term singleton breech may no longer be appropriate. In those instances in which breech vaginal deliveries are pursued, great caution should be exercised. Patients with persistent breech presentation at term in a singleton gestation should undergo a planned cesarean delivery. A planned cesarean delivery does not apply to patients presenting in advanced labor with a fetus in the breech presentation in whom delivery is likely to be imminent or to patients whose second twin is in a nonvertex presentation.

### Multifetal gestations: twin, triplet, and higher-order multifetal pregnancies: ACOG practice bulletin, number 231 [^a2a51d5f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Timing and route of delivery in multifetal gestations—For uncomplicated twin gestations, recommended delivery windows are: dichorionic–diamniotic at 38 0/7–38 6/7 weeks, monochorionic–diamniotic between 34 0/7 weeks and 37 6/7 weeks, and monochorionic–monoamniotic at 32 0/7–34 0/7 weeks. Women with monoamniotic twin gestations should be delivered by cesarean birth to avoid an umbilical cord complication. For diamniotic twin gestations with a vertex-presenting first fetus, patients are candidates for a vaginal birth, and a randomized trial showed planned cesarean delivery did not significantly decrease fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal morbidity compared with planned vaginal delivery (2.2% and 1.9%, respectively; OR [with planned cesarean delivery], 1.16; 95% CI, 0.77–1.74; P=.49). Therefore, in diamniotic twin pregnancies at 32 0/7 weeks of gestation or later with a presenting fetus that is vertex, regardless of the second twin presentation, vaginal delivery is a reasonable option and should be considered provided that an obstetrician with experience in managing a nonvertex presenting second twin is available. In the presence of obstetricians experienced in vaginal delivery of multiple gestations, a planned vaginal delivery of triplets can be considered. Women with one previous low transverse cesarean delivery who are otherwise appropriate for twin vaginal delivery may be considered candidates for trial of labor after cesarean delivery, and administration of neuraxial analgesia in women with multifetal gestations facilitates operative vaginal delivery, external or internal cephalic version, and total breech extraction.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 745—mode of term singleton breech delivery recommendations emphasize shared decision-making, offering external cephalic version when appropriate, and thorough informed consent: The decision regarding the mode of delivery should consider patient wishes and the experience of the health care provider; obstetrician–gynecologists and other obstetric care providers should offer external cephalic version as an alternative to planned cesarean for a woman who has a term singleton breech fetus, desires a planned vaginal delivery of a vertex-presenting fetus, and has no contraindications; external cephalic version should be attempted only in settings in which cesarean delivery services are readily available; planned vaginal delivery of a term singleton breech fetus may be reasonable under hospital-specific protocol guidelines for eligibility and labor management; and if a vaginal breech delivery is planned, a detailed informed consent should be documented—including risks that perinatal or neonatal mortality or short-term serious neonatal morbidity may be higher than if a cesarean delivery is planned.

### VBAC – is it worth the risk? [^aa615751]. Seminars in Perinatology (2003). Low credibility.

Enthusiasm for vaginal birth after cesarean section has waned. As a result, the cesarean birth rate is again on the rise. As a medical community and society we must decide whether the most appropriate question is "What is safest for my baby?" or "Is the risk associated with vaginal birth after cesarean acceptable?" There are risks associated with vaginal birth after cesarean, but in a hospital setting with appropriate resources these risks are low and would still seem to be acceptable.

### Planning for labor and vaginal birth after cesarean delivery: guidelines from the AAFP [^75e28847]. American Family Physician (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cesarean delivery, more specifically with respect to vaginal birth after Cesarean delivery, indications for trial of labor, AAFP 2015 guidelines recommend to encourage females with a history of vaginal birth to plan for labor after Cesarean/vaginal birth after Cesarean unless specific contraindications exist. Discuss reasons for previous Cesarean delivery with patients, as there is limited evidence on other characteristics strongly affecting vaginal birth after Cesarean rates.

### Evaluation of the usefulness of ultrasound measurement of the lower uterine segment before delivery of women with a prior cesarean delivery: a randomized trial [^60ae7c7b]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The main reason to avoid trial of labor after cesarean delivery is the possibility of uterine rupture. Identifying women at risk is thus an important aim, for it would enable women at low risk to proceed with a secure planned vaginal birth.

Objective

To evaluate the impact of proposing mode of delivery based on the ultrasound measurement of the lower uterine segment thickness on a composite outcome of maternal-fetal mortality and morbidity, compared with usual management, among pregnant women with a previous cesarean delivery.

Study Design

This multicenter, randomized, controlled, parallel-group, unmasked trial was conducted at 8 referral university hospitals with a neonatal intensive care unit and enrolled 2948 women at 36 weeks 0 days to 38 weeks 6 days of gestation with 1 previous low transverse cesarean delivery and no contraindication to trial of labor. Women in the study group had their lower uterine segment thickness measured by ultrasound. Those with measurements >3.5 mm, were encouraged to choose a planned vaginal delivery, and those with measurements ≤3.5 mm, were encouraged to choose a planned repeat cesarean delivery. This measurement was not taken in the control group; their mode of delivery was decided according to standard management. The primary outcome was a composite criterion comprising maternal mortality, uterine rupture, uterine dehiscence, hysterectomy, thromboembolic disease, transfusion, endometritis, perinatal death, or neonatal encephalopathy. Prespecified secondary outcomes were repeat cesarean deliveries, elective or after trial of labor.

Results

The study group included 1472 women, and the control group included 1476 women. These groups were similar at baseline. The primary outcome occurred in 3.4% of the study group and 4.3% of the control group (relative risk, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.54-1.13: risk difference, -1.0%; 95% confidence interval, -2.4 to 0.5). The uterine rupture rate in the study group was 0.4% and in the control group 0.9% (relative risk, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.15-1.19). The planned cesarean delivery rate was 16.4% in the study group and 13.7% in the control group (relative risk, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.47), whereas the rates of cesarean delivery during labor were 25.1% and 25.0% (relative risk, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.89-1.14) in the study and control groups, respectively.

Conclusion

Ultrasound measurements of lower uterine segment thickness did not result in a statistically significant lower frequency of maternal and perinatal adverse outcomes than standard management. However, because this study was underpowered, further research should be encouraged.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 205: vaginal birth after cesarean delivery [^fa368614]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin—Future pregnancy after uterine rupture—If the ruptured scar is confined to the lower uterine segment, the rate of repeat rupture or dehiscence in labor is 6%; if the scar includes the upper segment, the repeat rupture rate is reported to be as high as 32% with the most recent report estimating the rate of recurrence to be 15%. Given these rates, it is recommended that women who have had a previous uterine rupture give birth by repeat cesarean delivery before the onset of labor, and because spontaneous labor could occur before 39 weeks of gestation (the earliest recommended time for an elective delivery), the suggested timing of delivery between 36 0/7 weeks and 37 0/7 weeks of gestation should be considered but can be individualized based on the clinical situation.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 745: mode of term singleton breech delivery [^8eeca5ef]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Term singleton breech delivery—Reports describing planned vaginal breech birth used similar eligibility criteria including “gestational age greater than 37 weeks, frank or complete breech presentation, no fetal anomalies on ultrasound examination, adequate maternal pelvis, and estimated fetal weight between 2,500 g and 4,000 g,” with adequate amniotic fluid “defined as a 3-cm vertical pocket.” “Oxytocin induction or augmentation was not offered,” and if a vaginal breech delivery is planned, “a detailed informed consent should be documented—including risks that perinatal or neonatal mortality or short-term serious neonatal morbidity may be higher than if a cesarean delivery is planned.” Evidence states “short-term benefits in neonatal and maternal morbidity and mortality” favor “planned cesarean delivery,” while “Long-term benefits of planned cesarean delivery for these infants and women are less clear.” External cephalic version “provides an opportunity to potentially reduce cesarean delivery,” and “a planned vaginal delivery of a term singleton breech fetus may be reasonable under hospital-specific guidelines,” with the “decision regarding the mode of delivery should consider patient wishes and the experience of the health care provider.” A directive notes, “Obstetricians should offer and perform external cephalic version whenever possible.”

### Toward an ethically responsible approach to vaginal birth after cesarean [^eccc820d]. Seminars in Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

Determining approach to delivery after a previous cesarean is among the most contentious areas of obstetrics. We present a framework for ethically responsible guidelines and practice regarding vaginal birth after cesarean. We describe ethical complexities of 3 key issues that mark the debate: the cesarean delivery rate, safety, and patient autonomy. We then describe a taxonomy of considerations that should inform a responsible framework for guideline development and highlight critical distinctions between types of guidelines that have been blurred in the past. We then forward 2 central claims. First, in otherwise uncomplicated birth after a single previous cesarean, both vaginal birth after cesarean and repeat cesarean should be regarded as reasonable options; women, rather than policymakers, providers, insurance carriers, or hospitals, should determine delivery approach. Second, in complicated cases, providers and policymakers should carefully calibrate the strength of evidence to ensure differential risk and cost are adequate to justify directive guidelines given important variations in values women bring to childbirth.

### A randomized trial of planned cesarean or vaginal delivery for twin pregnancy [^ca11433b]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

Twin birth is associated with a higher risk of adverse perinatal outcomes than singleton birth. It is unclear whether planned cesarean section results in a lower risk of adverse outcomes than planned vaginal delivery in twin pregnancy.

Methods

We randomly assigned women between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days of gestation with twin pregnancy and with the first twin in the cephalic presentation to planned cesarean section or planned vaginal delivery with cesarean only if indicated. Elective delivery was planned between 37 weeks 5 days and 38 weeks 6 days of gestation. The primary outcome was a composite of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal morbidity, with the fetus or infant as the unit of analysis for the statistical comparison.

Results

A total of 1398 women (2795 fetuses) were randomly assigned to planned cesarean delivery and 1406 women (2812 fetuses) to planned vaginal delivery. The rate of cesarean delivery was 90.7% in the planned-cesarean-delivery group and 43.8% in the planned-vaginal-delivery group. Women in the planned-cesarean-delivery group delivered earlier than did those in the planned-vaginal-delivery group (mean number of days from randomization to delivery, 12.4 vs. 13.3; P=0.04). There was no significant difference in the composite primary outcome between the planned-cesarean-delivery group and the planned-vaginal-delivery group (2.2% and 1.9%, respectively; odds ratio with planned cesarean delivery, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 0.77 to 1.74; P=0.49).

Conclusions

In twin pregnancy between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days of gestation, with the first twin in the cephalic presentation, planned cesarean delivery did not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal morbidity, as compared with planned vaginal delivery.

### A new classification allowing assessment of instrumental vaginal-birth practices [^42679aa9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Missing data has led some users of the Robson classification to create a category ‘‘99’’ for these women. We believe this suggestion is very relevant and is why we propose the addition of this “99” group to the Isère classification to make it completely ‘‘totally inclusive’’. The size of the group ‘‘99’’ can be useful to audit the quality of the data. This additional group includes, apart from unclassifiable women, also women with fetal deaths in-utero and medical terminations of pregnancy (therapeutic abortion).
Group 1: Multiple pregnancy
Group 2: Singleton in breech presentation
Group 3: Singleton in cephalic presentation at GA < 37 weeks
Group 4: Singleton in cephalic presentation at GA ≥ 37 weeks, with a history of at least one vaginal birth, spontaneous labor (scarred uterus included)
Group 5: Singleton in cephalic presentation at GA ≥ 37 weeks, with a history of at least one vaginal birth, induced labor (scarred uterus included)
Group 6: Singleton in cephalic presentation at GA ≥ 37 weeks, without previous vaginal birth, spontaneous labor (scarred uterus included)
Group 7: Singleton in cephalic presentation at GA ≥ 37 weeks, without previous vaginal birth, induced labor (scarred uterus included)
Group 99: In-utero fetal death, medical termination of pregnancy (therapeutic abortion), unclassifiable women (missing data)

In order to classify each woman into the appropriate group, only five consecutive questions are needed (Fig. 2). The numbering of the groups was defined according to the order of the questions. For each question, if the answer is positive, the woman is placed in the corresponding group. Conversely, if the answer is negative, the process is continued until a positive answer is given. For groups 4 to 7, the final question concerns the mode of entry into labor, spontaneous or induced.

Fig. 2 
Sequence of the 5 questions allowing each woman to be classified into one of the classification groups (PVB = prior vaginal birth; NPVB = no prior vaginal birth; SL = spontaneous labor; IL = induced labor)

While a multiple pregnancy (group 1) represents only a small proportion of women giving birth, medicalized childbirth, whether by cesarean or by vaginal birth, is very frequent in France for this group.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 745: mode of term singleton breech delivery [^da26dfb8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

There is a trend in the United States to perform cesarean delivery for term singleton fetuses in a breech presentation. The number of practitioners with the skills and experience to perform vaginal breech delivery has decreased. The decision regarding the mode of delivery should consider patient wishes and the experience of the health care provider. Obstetrician-gynecologists and other obstetric care providers should offer external cephalic version as an alternative to planned cesarean for a woman who has a term singleton breech fetus, desires a planned vaginal delivery of a vertex-presenting fetus, and has no contraindications. External cephalic version should be attempted only in settings in which cesarean delivery services are readily available. Planned vaginal delivery of a term singleton breech fetus may be reasonable under hospital-specific protocol guidelines for eligibility and labor management. If a vaginal breech delivery is planned, a detailed informed consent should be documented-including risks that perinatal or neonatal mortality or short-term serious neonatal morbidity may be higher than if a cesarean delivery is planned.

### Mode of delivery preferences in a diverse population of pregnant women [^b18253e4]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the study was to assess women's preferences for vaginal vs cesarean delivery in 4 contexts: prior cesarean delivery, twins, breech presentation, and absent indication for cesarean.

Study Design

This was a cross-sectional study of pregnant women at 24-40 weeks' gestation. After assessing stated preferences for vaginal or cesarean delivery, we used the standard gamble metric to measure the strength of these preferences and the time tradeoff metric to determine how women value the potential processes and outcomes associated with these 2 delivery approaches.

Results

Among the 240 participants, 90.8% had a stated preference for vaginal delivery. Across the 4 contexts, these women indicated that, on average, they would accept a 59-75% chance of an attempted vaginal birth ending in a cesarean delivery before choosing a planned cesarean delivery, indicating strong preferences for spontaneous, uncomplicated vaginal delivery. Variations in preferences for labor processes emerged. Although uncomplicated labor ending in vaginal birth was assigned mean utilities of 0.993 or higher (on a 0-1 scale, with higher scores indicating more preferred outcomes), the need for oxytocin, antibiotics, or operative vaginal delivery resulted in lower mean scores, comparable with those assigned to uncomplicated cesarean delivery. Substantially lower scores (ranging from 0.432 to 0.598) were obtained for scenarios ending in severe maternal or neonatal morbidity.

Conclusion

Although most women expressed strong preferences for vaginal delivery, their preferences regarding interventions frequently used to achieve that goal varied. These data underscore the importance of educating patients about the process of labor and delivery to facilitate incorporation of informed patient preferences in shared decision making regarding delivery approach.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 115: vaginal birth after previous cesarean delivery [^f0ef0806]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Trial of labor after previous cesarean delivery (TOLAC)* provides women who desire a vaginal delivery with the possibility of achieving that goal--a vaginal birth after cesarean delivery (VBAC). In addition to fulfilling a patient's preference for vaginal delivery, at an individual level VBAC is associated with decreased maternal morbidity and a decreased risk of complications in future pregnancies. At a population level, VBAC also is associated with a decrease in the overall cesarean delivery rate (1, 2). Although TOLAC is appropriate for many women with a history of a cesarean delivery, several factors increase the likelihood of a failed trial of labor, which compared with VBAC, is associated with increased maternal and perinatal morbidity (3-5). Assessment of individual risks and the likelihood of VBAC is, therefore, important in determining who are appropriate candidates for TOLAC. The purpose of this document is to review the risks and benefits of TOLAC in various clinical situations and provide practical guidelines for managing and counseling patients who will give birth after a previous cesarean delivery.

### The DiAMOND trial protocol: a randomised controlled trial of two decision aids for mode of delivery among women with a previous caesarean section [ ISRCTN84367722 ] [^ab5a1250]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Over the last 20 years caesarean section (CS) has become an increasingly common method of delivery. The CS rate in the United Kingdom rose from 9% of deliveries in 1980 to 21% in 2001. This increase, and the question of whether CS should be available to women on request, has been the subject of considerable debate. The optimal mode of delivery for women who have experienced a previous CS is complicated by the difficulty in balancing the risks of repeat CS with those of vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC). An evaluation of caesarean delivery by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists reported that first time mothers with term singleton cephalic pregnancies and women with a previous CS account for two thirds of all caesarean deliveries in the US.

The Changing Childbirth report has emphasised the importance of patient choice when decisions need to be made in relation to the management of pregnancy and childbirth. However the views of women who have experienced CS and their preferences for future deliveries have received little attention to date. Obstetricians tend to focus on the risks of uterine rupture and emergency caesarean section in labour, which may influence the advice they give to women uncertain about future mode of delivery. Others have focused on the increased morbidity following CS and on the negative impact of operative delivery on first postnatal contact between the mother and her baby. In Chile, where there is a very high rate of CS in the private sector, only a minority of women reported that they had wanted this method of delivery. In a Scottish study, more women who delivered by elective CS reported they were satisfied with their involvement in the decision making process compared with women who underwent emergency CS. The advantages and disadvantages of planned CS versus planned vaginal delivery has also been debated in north America in response to a growing number of requests for elective CS.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 761: cesarean delivery on maternal request [^9c645829]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Cesarean delivery on maternal request—recommendations and timing— In the absence of maternal or fetal indications for cesarean delivery, a plan for vaginal delivery is safe and appropriate and should be recommended. After exploring the reasons behind the patient’s request and discussing the risks and benefits, if a patient decides to pursue cesarean delivery on maternal request, the following is recommended: in the absence of other indications for early delivery, cesarean delivery on maternal request should not be performed before a gestational age of 39 weeks; and, given the high repeat cesarean delivery rate, patients should be informed that the risks of placenta previa, placenta accreta spectrum, and gravid hysterectomy increase with each subsequent cesarean delivery.

Regarding surgical interventions for cesarean delivery, more specifically with respect to indications for Cesarean delivery, maternal request, SOGC 2018 guidelines recommend to consider pursuing one of the following options, after exploring the reasons behind the patient's request and discussing the risks and benefits, if a patient insists on her choice:

- agree to perform the C-section after 39+0 weeks gestation

- disagree and refer the patient for a second opinion.

### Committee opinion no. 697: planned home birth [^77a9e925]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Planned home birth candidate selection and contraindications—Recent cohort studies reporting comparable perinatal mortality rates among planned home and hospital births describe the use of strict selection criteria for appropriate candidates; these criteria include the absence of any preexisting maternal disease, the absence of significant disease arising during the pregnancy, a singleton fetus, a cephalic presentation, gestational age greater than 36–37 completed weeks and less than 41–42 completed weeks of pregnancy, labor that is spontaneous or induced as an outpatient, and that the patient has not been transferred from another referring hospital. In the absence of such criteria, planned home birth is clearly associated with a higher risk of perinatal death, and the Committee on Obstetric Practice considers fetal malpresentation, multiple gestation, or prior cesarean delivery to be an absolute contraindication to planned home birth.

Trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC)—twin gestation: Outcomes for women with twin gestations who attempt TOLAC are similar to those of women with singleton gestations, with analyses of large populations finding a similar likelihood of achieving VBAC and no greater risk of uterine rupture or maternal or perinatal morbidity. Women with one previous cesarean delivery with a low-transverse incision, who are otherwise appropriate candidates for twin vaginal delivery, are considered candidates for TOLAC.

### Birth after caesarean study – planned vaginal birth or planned elective repeat caesarean for women at term with a single previous caesarean birth: protocol for a patient preference study and randomised trial [^d6acd42c]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2007). Low credibility.

Analysis and Reporting of Results

The initial analysis will examine the baseline characteristics of all women in the study, as an indication of comparability of treatment groups. These characteristics will include maternal age, race, height, weight, smoking history, vaginal birth prior to caesarean section, indication for previous caesarean section and treatment preference. Any differences in these prognostic variables that have treatment imbalance of sufficient magnitude will be controlled for in subsequent analyses. Log binominal regression will be used to adjust binary outcomes for confounders and linear regression for normally distributed outcomes. Comparison of outcomes for women and infants will be analysed for the primary and secondary outcomes on an 'intention to treat' basis, according to their planned care at recruitment. The relative risks and 95% confidence intervals will be reported for the major study outcomes, and the number needed to treat to benefit and the number needed to treat to harm will be calculated.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 205: vaginal birth after cesarean delivery [^ee220e6e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Prediction models for vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC)—scope and variables: the probability that a woman attempting trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) will achieve VBAC depends on her individual combination of factors, and although many scoring systems have limitations, one model was developed specifically for women undergoing TOLAC at term with one prior low-transverse cesarean delivery incision, singleton pregnancy, and cephalic fetal presentation. This model uses information available at the first prenatal visit to generate a predicted probability based on a multivariable logistic regression including maternal age, BMI, race, prior vaginal delivery, history of a VBAC, and indication for prior cesarean delivery, and the predicted probability has reflected the actual probability in the original study population and in other populations in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia.

### Caesarean section versus vaginal delivery for preterm birth in singletons [^c08518c0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Planned caesarean delivery for women thought be in preterm labour may be protective for baby, but could also be quite traumatic for both mother and baby. The optimal mode of delivery of preterm babies for both cephalic and breech presentation remains, therefore, controversial.

Objectives

To assess the effects of a policy of planned immediate caesarean delivery versus planned vaginal birth for women in preterm labour.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (24 April 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing a policy of planned immediate caesarean delivery versus planned vaginal delivery for preterm birth.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Data were checked for accuracy.

Main Results

We included six studies (involving 122 women) but only four studies (involving only 116 women) contributed data to the analyses.Infant There were very little data of relevance to the three main (primary) outcomes considered in this review: There was no significant difference between planned immediate caesarean section and planned vaginal delivery with respect to birth injury to infant (risk ratio (RR) 0.56, 95%, confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 5.62; one trial, 38 women) or birth asphyxia (RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.84 to 3.14; one trial, 12 women). The only cases of birth trauma were a laceration of the buttock in a baby who was delivered by caesarean section and mild bruising in another allocated to the group delivered vaginally.The difference between the two groups with regard to perinatal deaths was not significant (0.29, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.14; three trials, 89 women) and there were no data specifically relating to neonatal admission to special care and/or intensive care unit.There was also no difference between the caesarean or vaginal delivery groups in terms of markers of possible birth asphyxia (RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.84 to 3.14; one trial, 12 women) or Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.60; four trials, 115 women) and no difference in attempts at breastfeeding (RR 1.40, 95% 0.11 to 17.45; one trial, 12 women). There was also no difference in neonatal fitting/seizures (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.32; three trials, 77 women), hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (RR 4.00, 95% CI 0.20 to 82.01;one trial, 12 women) or respiratory distress syndrome (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.10; three trials, 103 women). There were no data reported in the trials specifically relating to meconium aspiration. There was also no significant difference between the two groups for abnormal follow-up in childhood (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.22; one trial, 38 women) or delivery less than seven days after entry (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.24; two trials, 51 women). Mother: There were no data reported on maternal admissions to intensive care. However, there were seven cases of major maternal postpartum complications in the group allocated to planned immediate caesarean section and none in the group randomised to vaginal delivery (RR 7.21, 95% CI 1.37 to 38.08; four trials, 116 women).There were no data reported in the trials specifically relating to maternal satisfaction (postnatal). There was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to postpartum haemorrhage. A number of non-prespecified secondary outcomes were also considered in the analyses. There was a significant advantage for women in the vaginal delivery group with respect to maternal puerperal pyrexia (RR 2.98, 95% CI 1.18 to 7.53; three trials, 89 women) and other maternal infection (RR 2.63, 95% CI 1.02 to 6.78; three trials, 103 women), but no significant differences in wound infection (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.18 to 7.70; three trials, 103 women), maternal stay more than 10 days (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.65; three trials, 78 women) or the need for blood transfusion (results not estimable).

Authors' Conclusions

There is not enough evidence to evaluate the use of a policy of planned immediate caesarean delivery for preterm babies. Further studies are needed in this area, but recruitment is proving difficult.

### Birth after caesarean study – planned vaginal birth or planned elective repeat caesarean for women at term with a single previous caesarean birth: protocol for a patient preference study and randomised trial [^9fb144a2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2007). Low credibility.

Methods/Design

Study Design

Multicentred patient preference study and a randomised clinical trial.

Inclusion Criteria

Women with a single prior caesarean presenting in their next pregnancy with a single, live fetus in cephalic presentation, who have reached 37 weeks gestation, and who do not have a contraindication to a planned VBAC are eligible.

Exclusion Criteria

Women with any of the following are ineligible: more than one prior caesarean birth, vertical, inverted T or unknown uterine incision, previous uterine rupture, previous uterine surgery (including hysterotomy or previous myomectomy involving entry of the uterine cavity or excessive myometrial dissection), previous uterine perforation, multiple pregnancy, any contraindication to vaginal birth (including placenta praevia, transverse lie, active genital herpes infection), cephalo-pelvic disproportion as judged by the clinician, lethal congenital anomaly, fetal anomaly associated with mechanical difficulties at birth (such as hydrops, fetal ascites, hydrocephalus, omphalocele or cystic hygroma).

The inclusion/exclusion criteria are based on guidelines recommended by the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement, and the National Institute for Clinical Effectiveness, UK.

Trial Entry

Ethical approval for this study has been obtained from each of the participating collaborating hospitals. Women at the collaborating hospitals who may be eligible for the study will be given the study information sheet during their pregnancy and a copy of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists information pamphlets 'Vaginal birth after caesarean section – a guide for women' and 'Caesarean birth'. Women will discuss their birth options with their primary caregiver.

Written information that contains a brief summary of the benefits and risks of vaginal birth and elective repeat caesarean given to women with a prior caesarean has been shown to be as effective as a more detailed prenatal education and support program on the proportion of women having a planned VBAC. To maximise the likelihood that women will receive their planned choice for birth care or care allocated at randomisation, eligible women can be recruited from 37 weeks gestation onwards. As it is important to ensure that women in the 'restricted' prospective study who choose a planned elective repeat caesarean would have been eligible for a planned VBAC an obstetrician will confirm that the woman is eligible for a planned vaginal birth at the time of study entry.

Objective

To provide evidence-based guidelines for the provision of a trial of labor (TOL) after Caesarean section.

Outcome

Fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality associated with vaginal birth after Caesarean (VBAC) and repeat Caesarean section.

Evidence

MEDLINE database was searched for articles published from January 1, 1995, to February 28, 2004, using the key words "vaginal birth after Caesarean (Cesarean) section". The quality of evidence is described using the Evaluation of Evidence criteria outlined in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Exam.

Recommendations

1. Provided there are no contraindications, a woman with 1 previous transverse low-segment Caesarean section should be offered a trial of labor (TOL) with appropriate discussion of maternal and perinatal risks and benefits. The process of informed consent with appropriate documentation should be an important part of the birth plan in a woman with a previous Caesarean section (II-2B). 2. The intention of a woman undergoing a TOL after Caesarean section should be clearly stated, and documentation of the previous uterine scar should be clearly marked on the prenatal record (II-2B). 3. For a safe labor after Caesarean section, a woman should deliver in a hospital where a timely Caesarean section is available. The woman and her health care provider must be aware of the hospital resources and the availability of obstetric, anesthetic, pediatric, and operating-room staff (II-2A). 4. Each hospital should have a written policy in place regarding the notification and (or) consultation for the physicians responsible for a possible timely Caesarean section (III-B). 5. In the case of a TOL after Caesarean, an approximate time frame of 30 min should be considered adequate in the set-up of an urgent laparotomy (IIIC). 6. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring of women attempting a TOL after Caesarean section is recommended (II-2A). 7. Suspected uterine rupture requires urgent attention and expedited laparotomy to attempt to decrease maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality (II-2A). 8. Oxytocin augmentation is not contraindicated in women undergoing a TOL after Caesarean section (II-2A). 9. Medical induction of labor with oxytocin may be associated with an increased risk of uterine rupture and should be used carefully after appropriate counseling (II-2B). 10. Medical induction of labor with prostaglandin E2 (dinoprostone) is associated with an increased risk of uterine rupture and should not be used except in rare circumstances and after appropriate counseling (II-2B). 11. Prostaglandin E1 (misoprostol) is associated with a high risk of uterine rupture and should not be used as part of a TOL after Caesarean section (II-2A). 12. A foley catheter may be safely used to ripen the cervix in a woman planning a TOL after Caesarean section (II-2A). 13. The available data suggest that a trial of labor in women with more than 1 previous Caesarean section is likely to be successful but is associated with a higher risk of uterine rupture (II-2B). 14. Multiple gestation is not a contraindication to TOL after Caesarean section (II-2B). 15. Diabetes mellitus is not a contraindication to TOL after Caesarean section (II-2B). 16. Suspected fetal macrosomia is not a contraindication to TOL after Caesarean section (II-2B). 17. Women delivering within 18-24 months of a Caesarean section should be counseled about an increased risk of uterine rupture in labor (II-2B). 18. Postdatism is not a contraindication to a TOL after Caesarean section (II-2B). 19. Every effort should be made to obtain the previous Caesarean section operative report to determine the type of uterine incision used. In situations where the scar is unknown, information concerning the circumstances of the previous delivery is helpful in determining the likelihood of a low transverse incision. If the likelihood of a lower transverse incision is high, a TOL after Caesarean section can be offered (II-2B).

Validation

These guidelines were approved by the Clinical Practice Obstetrics and Executive Committees of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada.

### What is the safest mode of delivery for extremely preterm cephalic / non-cephalic twin pairs? A systematic review and meta-analyses [^7d26b77a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Extreme prematurity, the birth of an infant before 28 weeks’ gestation, contributes significantly to infant mortality and childhood morbidity. Extremely preterm births represent approximately 0.2% of singleton births, but 4.1% of twins births. In extremely preterm twins from 24 to 27 weeks, the most frequent combination of presentations is cephalic/non-cephalic (42.5%) followed by cephalic/cephalic (25.3%) and non-cephalic/non-cephalic (22.6%) which differs significantly from term proportions.

Controversy remains as to the influence of mode of delivery on neonatal outcomes in extremely preterm singletons and twins in general. Some, but not all studies have raised concerns about the safety of vaginal birth for extremely preterm breech singleton infants. In a recent meta-analysis, Grabovac et al. 2017 found that caesarean delivery was associated with a 40% decrease in the odds of mortality and 40% decrease in odds of severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH; grades ≥3) in extremely preterm breech singletons who were actively resuscitated.

In twins, determining the safest mode of delivery is more complex than in singletons, since beyond gestational age, birth order and various presentation combinations need to be considered. For cephalic/non-cephalic twins above 32 weeks, the 2013 randomized controlled trial by Barrett et al. found that trial of labor is safe, but due to their inclusion criteria, could not provide guidance on twin birth before 32 weeks.

While a caesarean section is typically performed when the first twin presents as non-cephalic, vaginal birth is generally attempted when both twins are cephalic. When the first twin is cephalic and the second is non-cephalic, there is less clinical consensus, leading to variations in clinical practice depending on the clinicians’ level of experience, training, and the prevailing obstetrical culture in their location of practice.

When the second twin is breech, the delivery involves a sequence of events which differs from a singleton breech delivery, including delivery through an already dilated cervix, potential for manoeuvres such as breech extraction and external cephalic version, precluding direct extrapolation of singleton data to the mode of delivery of twins. In face of all these considerations, we decided to perform a systematic review of the literature to assess the evidence regarding the safest mode of delivery of extremely preterm cephalic/non-cephalic twin pairs who were actively resuscitated.

Mode of delivery counseling in pregnancy at age 35 years or older—We suggest counseling that vaginal delivery is safe and appropriate if there are no other maternal or fetal indications for cesarean delivery. Counseling should include a discussion of the risks of cesarean delivery, the patient’s comorbidities, and the patient’s preferences and goals. Advancing patient age alone is not an indication for cesarean delivery. (GRADE 2B).

### Providing care for infants born at home [^c4cbe0f8]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Planned home birth considerations (Table 1)—candidate criteria, newborn risks, and system requirements: Potential candidates include absence of preexisting maternal disease and significant disease arising during the pregnancy, a gestation of 37 + 0/7 to 41 + 6/7 weeks, a singleton fetus estimated to be appropriate for gestational age, a cephalic presentation, and labor that is spontaneous or induced as an outpatient. Reported newborn risks in the United States include increased fetal and/or neonatal mortality, increased incidence of neonatal seizures, and higher incidence of an Apgar score <4 at 5 min. Systems needed to support planned home birth include availability of a physician or a midwife certified by the American Midwifery Certification Board or whose education and licensure meet the International Confederation of Midwives Global Standards for Midwifery Education within an integrated and regulated health system; attendance by at least 2 care providers, one of whom is an appropriately trained individual whose primary responsibility is the care of the newborn infant; availability of appropriate equipment for neonatal resuscitation; ready access to medical consultation; and access to safe and timely transport to a nearby hospital with a preexisting arrangement. As stated in Guidelines for Perinatal Care, fetal malpresentation, multiple gestation, and previous cesarean delivery are considered absolute contraindications to planned home birth.

Hypotheses

The primary null hypothesis is that for women who meet the accepted eligibility criteria for planned VBAC, there is no difference in the risk of death or serious adverse outcome up to the time of primary hospital discharge for the infant in women who have a planned VBAC compared with a planned elective repeat caesarean section.

The secondary null hypotheses are that for women, who meet the accepted, eligibility criteria for a planned VBAC, for women who have a planned VBAC compared with planned elective repeat caesarean there is no difference in the risk of serious maternal outcomes up to the time of primary hospital discharge.

### Neonatal outcome in vaginal breech labor at 32 + 0-36 + 0 weeks of gestation: a nationwide, population-based record linkage study [^80311e5e]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In developed countries, 5–9% of all deliveries occur preterm. Preterm pregnancy itself is also known as the most significant risk factor for breech presentation at delivery. Risk factors for breech presentation in preterm deliveries are premature rupture of membranes, preeclampsia, oligohydramnios, fetal growth restriction, and congenital anomalies. Many of these factors are associated with adverse perinatal outcomes in vaginal preterm breech delivery.

In term pregnancies, fetal breech presentation at delivery is a risk factor for adverse neonatal outcomes as vaginal breech labor is associated with increased neonatal short-term morbidity compared to cephalic deliveries. In the Term Breech Trial 2000, cesarean section was recommended for breech deliveries at term to reduce the risks of adverse outcomes of vaginal breech labor. Since then the results of the Term Breech Trial have been disputed and nowadays, in well-selected cases, vaginal breech labor at term is an option in many countries. In singleton preterm breech deliveries without other complications, the optimal mode of birth is still widely debated. A lower Apgar score and an increased need for admission to the neonatal intensive care unit have been associated with preterm vaginal breech labor compared to the neonates born in cephalic presentation. However, a trial of vaginal moderate to late preterm breech labor has not increased neonatal adverse outcomes compared to a planned cesarean section. Nevertheless, other studies have reported reduced neonatal deaths with a cesarean section for preterm breech fetuses. Furthermore, a recently published European cohort study (2019) implied that in very preterm breech labor, fetuses born by cesarean section instead of vaginally had reduced mortality and morbidity.

Most of the existing studies compromise deliveries in very preterm gestational weeks. The other problem of the previous studies is the small patient numbers. Our research aims to reduce the uncertainty regarding preterm breech deliveries at 32 + 0—36 + 6 weeks of gestation and investigate if vaginal preterm labor at 32 + 0—36 + 6 weeks of gestation is feasible.

Term singleton breech—external cephalic version (ECV) recommendations and efficacy: Obstetrician–gynecologists and other obstetric care providers should offer external cephalic version as an alternative to planned cesarean for a woman who has a term singleton breech fetus, desires a planned vaginal delivery of a vertex-presenting fetus, and has no contraindications, and external cephalic version should be attempted only in settings in which cesarean delivery services are readily available. A meta-analysis of eight randomized controlled trials demonstrated a reduction in cesarean delivery of 43% (95% CI, 40–82%) with no significant differences in maternal or fetal complications. A systematic review and meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials found that using epidural or spinal anesthesia increased the success rate of external cephalic version from 37.6% to 59.7% (odds ratio, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.29–1.93), number needed to treat=5, and the frequency of adverse events was not significantly different between groups receiving and not receiving regional anesthesia for external cephalic version.

### Mode of delivery: toward responsible inclusion of patient preferences [^f3130a6b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Deciding when and how to incorporate patient preferences regarding mode of delivery is challenging for both obstetric providers and policymakers. An analysis of current guidelines in four clinical scenarios (prior cesarean, twin delivery, breech presentation, and maternal request for cesarean) indicates that some guidelines are highly prescriptive whereas others are more flexible, based on physicians' discretion or (less frequently) patient preferences, without consistency or explicit rationale for when such flexibility is permissible, advisable, or obligatory. Although patient-choice advocates have called for more patient-responsive guidelines, concerns also have been raised, especially in the context of discussions of cesarean delivery on maternal request, about the dangers of unfettered patient-preference-driven clinical decisions. In this article, we outline a framework for the responsible inclusion of patient preferences into decision making regarding approach to delivery. We conclude, using this framework, that more explicit incorporation of patient preferences is called for in the first three scenarios and indicate why expanding access to cesarean delivery on maternal request is more complicated and would require more data and further consideration.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 205 summary: vaginal birth after cesarean delivery [^eb5e897b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Trial of labor after cesarean delivery (TOLAC) refers to a planned attempt to deliver vaginally by a woman who has had a previous cesarean delivery, regardless of the outcome. This method provides women who desire a vaginal delivery the possibility of achieving that goal-a vaginal birth after cesarean delivery (VBAC). In addition to fulfilling a patient's preference for vaginal delivery, at an individual level, VBAC is associated with decreased maternal morbidity and a decreased risk of complications in future pregnancies as well as a decrease in the overall cesarean delivery rate at the population level (1-3). However, although TOLAC is appropriate for many women, several factors increase the likelihood of a failed trial of labor, which in turn is associated with increased maternal and perinatal morbidity when compared with a successful trial of labor (ie, VBAC) and elective repeat cesarean delivery (4-6). Therefore, assessing the likelihood of VBAC as well as the individual risks is important when determining who is an appropriate candidate for TOLAC. Thus, the purpose of this document is to review the risks and benefits of TOLAC in various clinical situations and to provide practical guidelines for counseling and management of patients who will attempt to give birth vaginally after a previous cesarean delivery.

### FIGO good practice recommendations for vaginal birth after cesarean section [^7db25769]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The rising global rate of cesarean section (CS) has prompted renewed focus on vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) as a safe and effective alternative to repeat CS in properly selected women. The FIGO good practice recommendations provide evidence‐based recommendations to guide VBAC care. Success rates for VBAC range from 60% to 80%, with the highest likelihood in women with prior vaginal birth, non‐recurrent CS indications, interbirth intervals ≥18 months, BMI <30 kg/m 2, and spontaneous labor onset. While uterine rupture is the primary concern, its risk remains low at approximately 0.3%–0.7% for women with one prior low transverse CS. Comparisons show that VBAC generally results in similar or better maternal and neonatal outcomes than planned repeat CS, including lower maternal mortality, fewer infections, and shorter hospital stays. This article emphasizes appropriate patient counseling, facility readiness for emergency CS, and continuous fetal monitoring during labor. With proper implementation, VBAC offers a valuable strategy to reduce unnecessary repeat surgeries, improve outcomes, and support informed maternal choice.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 205: vaginal birth after cesarean delivery [^0927e002]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC)—Level B recommendations specify that those at high risk of uterine rupture (eg, those with previous classical uterine incision or T-incision, prior uterine rupture, or extensive transfundal uterine surgery) and those in whom vaginal delivery is otherwise contraindicated (eg, those with placenta previa) are not generally candidates for planned TOLAC. Given the overall data, it is reasonable to consider women with two previous low-transverse cesarean deliveries to be candidates for TOLAC and to counsel them based on the combination of other factors that affect their probability of achieving a successful VBAC. Women with one previous cesarean delivery with an unknown uterine scar type may be candidates for TOLAC, unless there is a high clinical suspicion of a previous classical uterine incision. Women with one previous cesarean delivery with a low-transverse incision, who are otherwise appropriate candidates for twin vaginal delivery, are considered candidates for TOLAC.

Cesarean delivery on maternal request—definition, U.S. incidence, and evidence scope—is defined as “a primary cesarean delivery on maternal request in the absence of any maternal or fetal indications,” and U.S. cesarean deliveries in 2015 were “more than 1.3 million cesarean deliveries (32% of all births) performed in 2015,” with an estimated “2.5% of all births in the United States” being cesarean delivery on maternal request. The page notes “There is no randomized clinical trial” comparing cesarean delivery with trial of labor for specified singleton term conditions, and describes a “systematic literature review of 1,406 articles.” The expert panel concluded that comparative information “does not provide the basis for a recommendation for either mode of delivery.”

### Birth after previous caesarean birth [^3e240030]. RCOG (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cesarean delivery, more specifically with respect to vaginal birth after Cesarean delivery, antenatal counseling, RCOG 2015 guidelines recommend to counsel females about the following:

- the greatest risk of adverse outcome occurs in a trial of vaginal birth after previous Cesarean delivery resulting in emergency Cesarean delivery.

- planned vaginal birth after previous Cesarean delivery is associated with an approximately 1 in 200 risk of uterine rupture

- the absolute risk of birth-related perinatal death associated with vaginal birth after previous Cesarean delivery is extremely low and comparable to the risk for nulliparous females in labor

- elective repeat C-section is associated with a small increased risk of placenta previa and/or accreta in future pregnancies and of pelvic adhesions complicating any future abdominopelvic surgery

- the risk of perinatal death with elective repeat Cesarean delivery is extremely low but there is a small increase in neonatal respiratory morbidity when elective repeat C-section is performed before 39+0 weeks of gestation which can be reduced with a preoperative course of antenatal corticosteroids

- the success rate of planned vaginal birth after previous Cesarean delivery is 72-75%

- previous vaginal delivery, particularly previous vaginal birth after previous Cesarean delivery, is the single best predictor of successful vaginal birth after previous Cesarean delivery and is associated with a planned vaginal birth after previous Cesarean delivery success rate of 85-90%; recognize that previous vaginal delivery is also independently associated with a reduced risk of uterine rupture

- planned preterm vaginal birth after previous Cesarean delivery has similar success rates to planned term vaginal birth after previous Cesarean delivery but with a lower risk of uterine rupture.

### Multifetal gestations: twin, triplet, and higher-order multifetal pregnancies: ACOG practice bulletin, number 231 [^f11c3c77]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Multifetal pregnancy—Level B recommendations: Based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence (Level B), women who underwent pregnancy reduction from triplets to twins were observed to have lower frequencies of pregnancy loss, antenatal complications, preterm birth, low-birth-weight infants, cesarean delivery, and neonatal deaths with rates similar to those observed in women with spontaneously conceived twin gestations; the chorionicity of a multifetal pregnancy should be established as early in pregnancy as possible and ultrasonographic determination is optimal in the first trimester or early second trimester; routine prophylactic interventions including cerclage, hospitalization, bedrest, tocolytics, and pessary have not been proved to decrease neonatal morbidity or mortality and therefore should not be used based solely on the indication of multifetal gestation; unless a contraindication exists, a course of antenatal corticosteroids should be administered to all patients at risk of delivery within 7 days and who are between 24 weeks and 34 weeks of gestation, irrespective of the fetal number; magnesium sulfate reduces the severity and risk of cerebral palsy in surviving infants if administered when birth is anticipated before 32 weeks of gestation, regardless of fetal number; and women with one previous low transverse cesarean delivery who are otherwise appropriate candidates for twin vaginal delivery may be considered candidates for trial of labor after cesarean delivery.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 761 summary: cesarean delivery on maternal request [^58e82752]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

The incidence of cesarean delivery on maternal request and its contribution to the overall increase in the cesarean delivery rate are not well known, but it is estimated that 2.5% of all births in the United States are cesarean delivery on maternal request. Cesarean delivery on maternal request is not a well-recognized clinical entity. The available information that compared the risks and benefits of cesarean delivery on maternal request and planned vaginal delivery does not provide the basis for a recommendation for either mode of delivery. When a woman desires a cesarean delivery on maternal request, her health care provider should consider her specific risk factors, such as age, body mass index, accuracy of estimated gestational age, reproductive plans, personal values, and cultural context. In the absence of maternal or fetal indications for cesarean delivery, a plan for vaginal delivery is safe and appropriate and should be recommended. After exploring the reasons behind the patient's request and discussing the risks and benefits, if a patient decides to pursue cesarean delivery on maternal request, the following is recommended: in the absence of other indications for early delivery, cesarean delivery on maternal request should not be performed before a gestational age of 39 weeks; and, given the high repeat cesarean delivery rate, patients should be informed that the risks of placenta previa, placenta accreta spectrum, and gravid hysterectomy increase with each subsequent cesarean delivery. This Committee Opinion has been revised to incorporate additional data regarding outcomes and information on counseling, and to link to existing American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' resources.

### Birth after caesarean study – planned vaginal birth or planned elective repeat caesarean for women at term with a single previous caesarean birth: protocol for a patient preference study and randomised trial [^1405c02b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2007). Low credibility.

Justification for a randomised trial and patient preference study of planned VBAC versus planned repeat caesarean

To date, there have been no randomised controlled trials comparing VBAC with elective repeat caesarean section, and the observational studies currently available have limitations. Although the randomised controlled trial is regarded as the 'gold standard' research methodology for assessing the effects of health care interventions, some research questions cannot be fully answered using this design, particularly in situations where patients may have strong treatment preferences and thus decline randomisation.

Patient preferences have been effectively incorporated into a prospective cohort study design previously. The inclusion of women with clear preferences for treatment improves generalisability of the study results, and this design has been used successfully in other studies relating to women's health issues.

Previous cohort studies relating to options for birth after a previous caesarean have been criticised for their striking methodological deficiencies, with strong recommendation that future studies avoid the following pitfalls: lack of comparability of groups, specifically the ERC group not guaranteed to be eligible for VBAC; failure to consider other important baseline comparability factors, poor specificity of the intervention and the importance of co-interventions, and lack of precise and standard outcome measures. In addition the recommendation was that future studies should assess women's views of care and evaluate women's process of decision-making. To specifically address these recommendations, the current research utilises rigorous methodology, using a 'restricted' prospective cohort study and a randomised clinical trial.

A 'restricted' prospective cohort study design utilises the rigour of recruitment, treatment schedules and follow up of the randomised controlled trial. Adoption of this methodology has not been shown to systematically overestimate the magnitude of the treatment effects when compared with the results of randomised controlled trials. Features of importance in the restrictive cohort design include the identification of a 'zero time' for determining a woman's eligibility and baseline features; use of inclusion and exclusion criteria similar to those of clinical trials; adjustment for differences in base-line susceptibility to the outcomes; and the use of statistical methods (eg intention-to-treat analysis) similar to randomised controlled trials.

Using this methodology, we will conduct a, patient preference study and a randomised clinical trial to compare the benefits and risks of a planned VBAC with planned elective, repeat caesarean. Eligible women who consent to be randomised will be entered into the randomised trial. Eligible women who decline randomisation and consent to be entered into the patient preference study will choose their treatment preference and follow the study protocol for that treatment group.

### Cesarean versus vaginal delivery: whose risks? Whose benefits? [^b14dc0c1]. American Journal of Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

We reviewed the risks and benefits of vaginal and cesarean delivery to help frame the inherent trade-offs that should be considered as part of the informed consent discussion between patients and providers. We performed a targeted literature review for common complications of childbirth. Approximately 30% of women will experience a maternal or neonatal complication during childbirth. Both cesarean and vaginal delivery is associated with well-known measurable short- and long-term maternal and neonatal complications and benefits. Childbirth is not risk free. There are data available that can guide the informed consent process with objective quantifiable data that patients and providers can use to weigh risks and benefits of delivery methods.

### Clinical interventions that influence vaginal birth after cesarean delivery rates: systematic review&meta-analysis [^10d54717]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines comparison from the US (2010 version), Canada (2005 version) and United Kingdom (2007 version) show similarities and differences in recommendations for VBAC process. Uterine rupture is identified as the most serious complication among women attempting a trial of labor; however, there is recognition that differences in the definition may contribute to the reported incidence rates. With regards to induction of labor, all three guidelines agree that induction and augmentation of labor is an option for women attempting a VBAC, but there is an increased risk of uterine rupture with inappropriate use of oxytocin. Both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and SOGC recommend against PGE1 for the same outcome, with the SOGC guideline recommending PGE2 only in rare circumstances. All three guidelines agree that women with a history of one or two uncomplicated low-transverse CD and no contraindications to VBAC should be educated, counselled and offered a TOLAC. The SOGC’s updated guidelines (July 2019) continue to support the previous recommendation of offering women (without contraindications) the option of a TOLAC. The new guideline provides details on the likelihood of VBAC (greater among women with spontaneous labor, lower among women with factors that negatively affect this likelihood), the risk of uterine rupture (baseline risk of 0.47% among women with a prior CD; higher relative risk of uterine rupture, but low absolute risks for women attempting TOLAC compared with elective repeat cesarean section; risk greatest for women over 40 weeks of gestation; use of fetal monitoring is recommended as an indicator of the presence of uterine rupture), risk of other outcomes (higher relative risk of maternal and perinatal morbidity, but lower absolute risks for women attempting TOLAC compared with elective repeat cesarean section; higher relative risk of maternal death for elective cesarean section), and recommends against using ultrasonographic measurements of the lower uterine segment to counsel patients on the possibility of a TOLAC.

### SOGC clinical practice guideline: vaginal delivery of breech presentation: no. 226, June 2009 [^c6892e53]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the physiology of breech birth; to discern the risks and benefits of a trial of labour versus planned Caesarean section; and to recommend to obstetricians, family physicians, midwives, obstetrical nurses, anaesthesiologists, pediatricians, and other health care providers selection criteria, intrapartum management parameters, and delivery techniques for a trial of vaginal breech birth.

Options

Trial of labour in an appropriate setting or delivery by pre-emptive Caesarean section for women with a singleton breech fetus at term.

Outcomes

Reduced perinatal mortality, short-term neonatal morbidity, longterm infant morbidity, and short- and long-term maternal morbidity and mortality.

Evidence

Medline was searched for randomized trials, prospective cohort studies, and selected retrospective cohort studies comparing planned Caesarean section with a planned trial of labour; selected epidemiological studies comparing delivery by Caesarean section with vaginal breech delivery; and studies comparing long-term outcomes in breech infants born vaginally or by Caesarean section. Additional articles were identified through bibliography tracing up to June 1, 2008.

Values

The evidence collected was reviewed by the Maternal Fetal Medicine Committee of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) and quantified using the criteria and classifications of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care.

Validation

This guideline was compared with the 2006 American College of Obstetrician's Committee Opinion on the mode of term singleton breech delivery and with the 2006 Royal College of Obstetrician and Gynaecologists Green Top Guideline: The Management of Breech Presentation. The document was reviewed by Canadian and International clinicians with particular expertise in breech vaginal delivery.

### Application of a specific clinical pathway can affect the choice of trial of labor in patients with a history of cesarean delivery [^b5c28da6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective observational single-center study comparing two birth cohorts before and after the implementation of a series of quality improvement (QI) interventions. Therefore, our study reporting followed the Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence 2 (SQUIRE2) recommendations. We included all women who gave birth in our hospital over two time periods - before (January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2015) and after (January 1, 2018 to December 21, 2020) the adoption of measures aimed at reducing cesarean deliveries. For the purpose of this study, we focused on term singleton cephalic pregnancies who previously had a CD.

The primary aim of the study was to assess if the adoption of a specific clinical pathway (QI intervention) can affect the mode of birth in patients with previous history of CD. We hypothesized that the adoption of these specific measures can lead to an increase in TOLAC and VBAC rates. As secondary outcomes were were interested to explore spontaneous labor and induction of labour rates. We also wanted to report on core neonatal outcomes, however, this information was only available for all births in our unit.

Irrespective of the QI interventions, the standard protocol for management of patients with a term singleton pregnancy and previous history of CD with a low transverse incision is to offer a TOLAC (unless vaginal delivery was contraindicated for other reasons). We allow the pregnancy to continue up to 10 days past the estimated date of delivery, as long as the general health of the mother and fetus allowed this. Patients are allowed to undergo induction of labor and are made aware that the preferred option is for labor to start spontaneously because of the associated higher success rate of vaginal birth and lower risk of uterine scar rupture. Patients with a fetal macrosomia are made aware of their reduced probability of achieving VBAC, nevertheless, not immediately denied a TOLAC. Patients with history of two previous CDs and a low transverse incision who request a TOLAC, are allowed to do as long as the labor commenced spontaneously by the estimated date of delivery.

The QI measures adopted to reduce repeat cesarean deliveries were part of a series of complex changes adopted in our clinic in 2016, which we previously reported. The full list of measures is listed in supplemental table S1. Measures related to management of women with previous CD included organizational, staff training and unit policy measures as follows:

• organizational

Full time intrapartum care team on labor ward (the labor group).
Empowering midwives to manage labor, including the adoption of a one-to-one model of intrapartum care.

### Reducing stillbirths: interventions during labour [^75489c44]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Approximately 3–4% of term singleton pregnancies are complicated by breech presentation at term, and in most high-income countries, the majority of these births are handled via either planned or emergency Caesarean section. Whether planned caesarean section for breech presentation at term results in better perinatal outcomes is a contentious issue. An alternative to breech Caesarean section or breech vaginal delivery is external cephalic version, which has been shown to reduce numbers of breech births and breech Caesarean sections without impacting perinatal mortality. Until recently the major evidence for Caesarean section for breech presentation has been derived from patient case studies and register studies lacking sufficient rigor on which to make policy or clinical management recommendations. Here, we review the evidence for impact of planned Caesarean section for breech presentation on perinatal mortality and stillbirth rates.

Shared decision-making

For women with a previous CD, the decision to proceed with a repeat cesarean section or attempt a vaginal delivery will be based on multiple factors. First steps in the decision-making process should be consultation with a healthcare provider regarding maternal and neonatal benefits and risks, for both VBAC (induction/spontaneous onset of labor) and scheduled CD options. Triaging women for VBAC (i.e. women without contraindications) must include maternal characteristics and obstetric history to assist in the prediction of a successful vaginal delivery. Family planning plays a key role. Women who have had one or more prior cesarean deliveries may opt for a trial of vaginal birth or elect to have another CD; this maternal decision impacts future pregnancies and delivery due to the increased risk of abnormal placentation secondary to the additional uterine surgeries. Unexpected severe adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes (e.g. maternal mortality) are important for patient-level counselling and decision-making.

Each woman should be given the opportunity to be counselled early in pregnancy on her available options, with provision of written or on-line patient information literature (e.g. VBAC clinical care pathway, decision aids) to help inform decision-making throughout her pregnancy for optimal delivery outcomes and patient satisfaction.

### FIGO good practice recommendations for vaginal birth after cesarean section [^34750d6e]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

8 SUMMARY OF FIGO RECOMMENDATIONS FOR VBAC

Fetal macrosomia Fetal macrosomia alone is not an absolute contraindication to VBAC, but women with macrosomic fetuses planning VBAC should be counseled regarding the higher likelihood of failure and possible increased risk of uterine rupture. While VBAC can potentially be offered up to an estimated fetal weight of 4500 g, a fetal weight of ≥4000 g increases the likelihood of unsuccessful VBAC. Planned repeat CS should be offered when estimated fetal weight is >4500 g. Favorable factors that increase the likelihood of success in women with suspected fetal macrosomia undergoing VBAC include one previous low transverse CS for a non‐recurrent indication, a prior vaginal birth and prior VBAC, singleton pregnancy, cephalic presentation, term gestation, and spontaneous onset of labor.
Number of previous cesarean sections 5 Women with a single previous CS may be offered VBAC in the absence of any contraindication to vaginal birth. This should be accompanied by appropriate counseling and close intrapartum monitoring. 6 VBAC is generally not recommended after two previous CSs. However, if a woman with two prior CSs and a vaginal birth strongly desires a VBAC, the patient should receive thorough counseling from a senior obstetrician on the associated risks and potential complications, including the increased likelihood of VBAC failure, cesarean birth, and uterine rupture. If the patient still wishes to consider VBAC, this option may be available in some high‐resource facilities. These facilities must have the following prerequisites: one‐to‐one nursing/midwifery care. continuous fetal monitoring. on‐site availability of blood products and transfusion services. immediate access to surgical theater facilities. presence of a surgeon capable of performing emergency hysterectomy on site. 7 There are limited data on the risks of uterine rupture and overall safety to recommend VBAC in women with three or more previous CSs. Therefore, a planned repeat CS is recommended at three or more previous CSs.
Type of uterine incision for previous cesarean section 8 VBAC is safe and associated with low absolute risks of uterine rupture in women with a previous low transverse or low vertical uterine incision (usually described as a vertical incision on the lower (non‐contractile) uterine segment). 9 VBAC is contraindicated in women with previous classical CS (a vertical incision on the upper (contractile) uterine segment), inverted T or J incisions, and previous incisions that extend into the upper uterine segment. A planned repeat CS is recommended in these cases due to the higher risk of uterine rupture.
Method of closure of uterine incision at previous cesarean section 10 Single‐layer closure of a previous low‐segment CS is not an absolute contraindication to VBAC.
Interbirth interval 11 An interbirth interval of at least 18 months is recommended for VBAC for optimal maternal and neonatal outcomes. 12 Women with an interbirth interval of <18 months who are attempting VBAC should be counseled on the higher likelihood of unsuccessful VBAC and adverse outcomes.
Prediction of uterine rupture and VBAC success 13 Routine use of antenatal lower uterine segment thickness measurements for the prediction of uterine rupture in women undergoing VBAC is not recommended, as no ideal thickness cutoff value has been defined for clinical use. Clinical applicability of lower uterine segment thickness measurement in counseling patients whether to attempt VBAC needs to be assessed in prospective observational studies using a standardized method of measurement. 14 Routine use of prediction models to predict VBAC success is not recommended as many of the models lack external validation and are at high risk of bias, hindering generalizability and applicability.
Multiple pregnancy 15 Twin pregnancy is not an absolute contraindication to VBAC. 16 VBAC can be a safe alternative to a planned repeat CS in women with twin gestation and a history of one previous CS with a low transverse incision in the presence of other favorable factors for VBAC, with careful counseling and monitoring. 17 A planned repeat CS is recommended for women with higher order multiple pregnancy with a previous CS.
Breech presentation and external cephalic version 18 Breech presentation is not an absolute contraindication to VBAC in women with a single fetus in breech presentation and a history of one previous low transverse CS, who are otherwise good candidates for VBAC. 19 External cephalic version can be safely attempted in women with a singleton breech presenting fetus and a prior low transverse uterine incision, who are good candidates for VBAC and external cephalic version.
Induction and augmentation of labor during VBAC 20 Induction of labor is not contraindicated in women with one previous low uterine incision, who are otherwise good candidates for VBAC. 21 Women should be well informed that induction of labor is associated with a lower VBAC success, as well as increased risk of uterine rupture. 22 When indicated in women with a previous CS, induction of labor should be performed between 39 and 41 weeks of gestation to increase the chances of success and minimize the risk of uterine rupture. 23 Mechanical methods such as amniotomy and transcervical Foley catheter are recommended for cervical ripening and induction of labor in women with a previous CS. 24 Misoprostol (prostaglandin E 1) should not be used for cervical ripening and induction of labor in women with a previous CS because it is associated with a high risk of uterine rupture. Prostaglandins can be considered if labor induction is indicated in the second trimester. 25 Use of oxytocin for induction of labor or augmentation of labor is not contraindicated in women undergoing VBAC. It should, however, be used cautiously and women should be counseled on the increased risk of uterine rupture.
Assisted vaginal birth during VBAC 26 In carefully selected women undergoing VBAC, a trial of low forceps or outlet forceps, or vacuum, may be attempted by a skilled obstetrician in an operating theater, where immediate recourse to CS can be undertaken, in case of any complication. This is discussed in detail, with recommendations for practice, in an upcoming paper on assisted vaginal birth from the FIGO Committee on Childbirth and PPH.
Facility requirements and intrapartum care during VBAC 28 VBAC should only be performed in facilities with resources for 24‐h emergency CS, blood bank, and NICU backup owing to associated maternal and neonatal risks. 29 Supportive one‐to‐one midwifery/nursing care in labor and continuous electronic fetal monitoring are recommended, as fetal heart rate abnormality is the most common sign of uterine rupture. 30 Epidural analgesia is not contraindicated during VBAC. 31 The same standards and recommendations for evaluating labor progress in women without a previous CS apply to women undergoing VBAC. 32 Routine uterine exploration after VBAC is not recommended in a hemodynamically stable patient with no abnormal vaginal bleeding. 33 Surgical repair of asymptomatic uterine scar dehiscence suspected by uterine exploration after VBAC is not recommended.

### Twin birth study: 2-year neurodevelopmental follow-up of the randomized trial of planned cesarean or planned vaginal delivery for twin pregnancy [^48a77a66]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The Twin Birth Study randomized women with uncomplicated pregnancies, between 32(0/7)-38(6/7) weeks' gestation where the first twin was in cephalic presentation, to a policy of either a planned cesarean or planned vaginal delivery. The primary analysis showed that planned cesarean delivery did not increase or decrease the risk of fetal/neonatal death or serious neonatal morbidity as compared with planned vaginal delivery.

Objective

This study presents the secondary outcome of death or neurodevelopmental delay at 2 years of age.

Study Design

A total of 4603 children from the initial cohort of 5565 fetuses/infants (83%) contributed to the outcome of death or neurodevelopmental delay. Surviving children were screened using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire with abnormal scores validated by a clinical neurodevelopmental assessment. The effect of planned cesarean vs planned vaginal delivery on death or neurodevelopmental delay was quantified using a logistic model to control for stratification variables and using generalized estimating equations to account for the nonindependence of twin births.

Results

Baseline maternal, pregnancy, and infant characteristics were similar. Mean age at assessment was 26 months. There was no significant difference in the outcome of death or neurodevelopmental delay: 5.99% in the planned cesarean vs 5.83% in the planned vaginal delivery group (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-1.41; P = .79).

Conclusion

A policy of planned cesarean delivery provides no benefit to children at 2 years of age compared with a policy of planned vaginal delivery in uncomplicated twin pregnancies between 32(0/7)-38(6/7)weeks' gestation where the first twin is in cephalic presentation.

36 weeks—fetal presentation and external cephalic version (ECV)—assessment of fetal presentation should take place at 36 weeks’ gestation, ideally with ultrasound confirmation; if breech is found, an external cephalic version (ECV) should be offered at 37 weeks if there is no contraindication, and ECV can be offered to patients with or without a previous cesarean birth.

### Does continuity of care impact decision making in the next birth after a caesarean section (VBAC)? a randomised controlled trial [^f9c6efb4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

As an alternative, women who have had a previous lower-segment CS, and an uncomplicated pregnancy, can be offered to attempt a vaginal birth after CS (VBAC). However, a cross-sectional study undertaken in one Australian state (New South Wales) showed that, despite this, the rate of VBAC declined significantly between 1998 and 2006 (from 31% to 19%, respectively) and the proportion of women who attempted a vaginal birth also declined (from 49% to 35%, respectively). In this study, more than half the women (59%) who attempted VBAC were successful.

The best available international evidence suggests that VBAC does not increase the risk of hysterectomy or maternal mortality. Neonatal mortality rate, after adjustments are made for pre-existing fetal anomalies, has been reported to be 24 per 10,000 for women who planned a VBAC compared with 9 per 10,000 for those who planned a repeat CS. Although this results in an increased risk, the absolute risk is small, and comparable to the background risk of neonatal mortality for women having their first baby. In the USA, a large prospective observational study involving nearly 46,000 women showed that planned VBAC was associated with a 1% increased risk of a blood transfusion, a 1% increased risk of endometriosis, and a 0.7% risk of symptomatic uterine rupture. Rates of uterine rupture for women who undergo a planned VBAC have been reported to be in the range of 22–74 per 10,000, compared with a risk of 0.5–2 per10,000 births in women with non-scarred uteri. Other evidence shows a lesser increase in risk of perinatal mortality for VBAC, with a risk difference of 1.5 per 10,000 births compared with repeat caesarean section. Therefore offering women the opportunity to attempt VBAC, in an appropriately staffed and resourced maternity unit, is a safe and ethical innovation to test.

### External cephalic version: ACOG practice bulletin, number 221 [^2a3c29ff]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

External cephalic version (ECV)—background indicates that breech presentation occurs in approximately 3–4% of term pregnancies and there is a high cesarean birth rate for breech presentation; ECV provides a means of reducing cesarean births but implementation varies with an estimated 20–30% of eligible women not being offered ECV. ECV involves applying pressure to a woman’s abdomen to turn the fetus in either a forward or backward roll to achieve a vertex presentation, and once a vertex presentation is achieved, the chances for a vaginal delivery increase; if an ECV attempt is not successful and breech presentation persists, a planned term singleton breech vaginal delivery may be reasonable in some cases with full patient counseling and consent and following specific management protocols.

### The DiAMOND trial protocol: a randomised controlled trial of two decision aids for mode of delivery among women with a previous caesarean section [ ISRCTN84367722 ] [^f8b12e27]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004). Low credibility.

In an attempt to ensure appropriateness of CS in the UK, a set of evidence-based guidelines on indications for CS have recently been published. The guidelines, commissioned by the UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence, make a specific recommendation that for women with a previous CS, the decision should consider maternal preferences and priorities in addition to general discussion of the overall risks and benefits of CS. It is essential that the process of decision making about future mode of delivery is evaluated and enhanced to achieve the safest and most satisfactory outcome for both mother and baby.

It has been proposed that the way in which clinical decisions are made lies on a continuum, from paternalistic (clinician decides) through partnership (clinician and patient share the decision) to informed (patient decides). Although proposed as the preferred approach of determining patients' treatments, some problems with the concepts, terminology and practice of shared medical decision making have recently been highlighted. The appropriateness of the shared model may also depend on the clinical context as well as patients' and clinicians' preferences for involvement in decision making. In addition, there is some evidence that patients and health professionals often have different treatment preferences, potentially making agreement on a treatment strategy more difficult.

Decision aids are designed to help people select between various treatment strategies by providing information on the options and outcomes relevant to a person's health. Decision aids for many clinical conditions have been developed, and evaluations of these decision aids have been the subject of systematic reviews. A north American trial found no difference in terms of VBAC rate between written versus personal counselling interventions that actively promoted vaginal delivery. An Australian trial of a paper-based decision aid for women who have previously experienced CS is currently underway.

The specific content of decision aids may vary, but in general they aim to present more than one strategy for clinical management, help people understand the probable outcomes of treatment choices and allow people to consider the personal value they place on benefits versus harms. Decision aids can take several formats, such as leaflets, interactive videodisks, individualised decision analysis, personal counselling sessions and audio workbooks. Interventions to assist patient decision making can improve knowledge about treatment options, make patients more realistic in their expectations, reduce decisional conflict and increase active involvement in decision making.

### What is the safest mode of delivery for extremely preterm cephalic / non-cephalic twin pairs? A systematic review and meta-analyses [^265041ad]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

We planned to follow the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Version 5.1.0) for randomized studies and the PRISMA guidelines for observational studies. We registered this protocol on PROSPERO (CRD42017056295).

Information sources

We developed separate search strategies with the assistance of an experienced librarian for each database, consisting of medical subject headings (MeSH) and multipurpose terms (.mp), which we used to search Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE from January 1,1994 - the year the guidelines for the use of antenatal corticosteroid were published -, until January 12, 2017, without language restriction (Additional file 1). We also searched for unpublished randomized controlled trials (RCT) onusing the keywords “twin”, “twins”, “multiple pregnancy” and “multiple pregnancies”. We imported all references into a bibliographic software (Endnote X8). We manually searched the references of included studies and relevant systematic reviews for additional articles. We consulted a Maternal Fetal Medicine expert for knowledge on other studies published in this area.

Eligibility

We planned to include all published randomized controlled trials and observational studies (cohort and case-control) comparing mode of delivery in extremely preterm (22 +0 and 27 +6 weeks) dichorionic or monochorionic-diamniotic twins presenting as a cephalic/non-cephalic pair who were actively resuscitated. If a study focused on mode of delivery in twins, but did not stratify the data according to gestational age or presentation, we contacted the authors to obtain these data. If the study population was defined by birth weight only, without data on gestational age, we included twins weighing ≤1000 g, which is approximately the 90th percentile for twins born at 27 weeks.

We excluded other types of publications (e.g. reviews, editorials, commentaries, case studies, conference proceedings, studies published only as abstracts, etc.). We excluded studies with insufficient data, such as <10 twin pairs total or less than five twin pairs per comparison group (i.e. caesarean and vaginal delivery). We excluded studies with data collected prior to 1994, regardless of publication date. If the data spanned 1994, we contacted the authors to confirm antenatal corticosteroid (ANCS) use was the standard of practice at the time of data collection, and included the study if either the authors confirmed that this was the case or were able to provide separate data for after 1994.

### Management of stillbirth: obstetric care consensus No, 10 [^d13198c9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Stillbirth with prior cesarean delivery—labor, cesarean, and uterine rupture risk—trial of labor remains a favorable option in patients with one previous low transverse cesarean delivery, while with a previous classical cesarean delivery or multiple previous cesarean deliveries the delivery plan should be individualized based on individual circumstances and patient preference. In general, cesarean delivery for fetal demise should be reserved for unusual circumstances because it is associated with potential maternal morbidity without any fetal benefit. In women with an increased risk of uterine rupture (eg, history of classical hysterotomy or transfundal surgery), repeat cesarean delivery is a reasonable option, and women with an increased risk of uterine rupture who opt for induction of labor should do so with an understanding of the increased risk; health care providers need to be attuned to signs and symptoms of uterine rupture throughout the labor course.

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^c1e6be71]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Cesarean delivery when presenting late in pregnancy—without current antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV RNA levels are unlikely to be ≤1,000 copies/mL at baseline, and scheduled cesarean birth is likely to provide additional benefit in reducing perinatal transmission unless viral suppression can be documented before 38 weeks gestation; although some experts would recommend cesarean after brief suppression (e.g., <2 weeks), many others would support a vaginal birth as long as plasma HIV RNA was <1,000 copies/mL by the day of birth, and patient-centered counseling and shared decision-making should be used; regardless of mode, presumptive HIV therapy should be considered for the neonate, and for an elite controller presenting in labor without ART, administering IV ZDV and supporting vaginal birth would be reasonable (CIII).

### Birth after previous cesarean delivery: short-term maternal outcomes [^a5566b00]. Seminars in Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

An estimated 40% of the 1.3 million cesarean deliveries performed each year in the United States are repeat procedures. The appropriate clinical management approach for women with previous cesarean delivery remains challenging because options are limited. The risks and benefits of clinical management choices in the woman's health need to be quantified. Thus, we discuss the available published scientific data on (1) the short-term maternal outcomes of trial of labor after cesarean and elective repeat cesarean delivery, (2) the differences between outcomes for both, (3) the important factors that influence these outcomes, and (4) successful vs. unsuccessful vaginal birth after cesarean. For women with a previous cesarean delivery, a successful trial of labor offers several distinct, consistently reproducible advantages compared with elective repeat cesarean delivery, including fewer hysterectomies, fewer thromboembolic events, lower blood transfusion rates, and shorter hospital stay. However, when trial of labor after cesarean fails, emergency cesarean is associated with increased uterine rupture, hysterectomy, operative injury, blood transfusion, endometritis, and longer hospital stay. Care of women with a history of previous cesarean delivery involves a confluence of interactions between medical and nonmedical factors; however, the most important determinants of the short-term outcomes among these women are likely individualized counseling, accurate clinical diagnoses, and careful management during a trial of labor. We recommend a randomized controlled trial among women undergoing a TOLAC and a longitudinal cohort study among women with previous cesarean to evaluate adverse outcomes, with focused attention on both mother and the infant.

### FIGO good practice recommendations for vaginal birth after cesarean section [^364ebb14]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

7 REQUIREMENTS FOR VBAC

These include antenatal assessment and counseling, infrastructure and setting, and intrapartum management.

7.1 Antenatal assessment and counseling

Review of the operative notes from the previous CS is important so that clinicians are aware of the indication for the CS, location, type, and method of closure of the uterine incision.The obstetric history and antenatal records of the patient should also be reviewed to exclude any contraindications to VBAC and vaginal birth. The patient should be thoroughly counseled on the risks and benefits of VBAC versus planned repeat CS. The chance of a successful VBAC and the risk of uterine rupture should be evaluated before deciding whether to attempt VBAC.Several prediction models for VBAC success exist but many lack external validation and are at high risk of bias, hindering generalizability and applicability.

### The CORONIS trial. international study of caesarean section surgical techniques: a randomised fractional, factorial trial [^08b4ab3e]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2007). Low credibility.

Trial eligibility

Women ARE eligible for trial entry if:

• They are undergoing delivery by lower segment Caesarean section through a transverse abdominal incision, irrespective of fever in labour, gestational age or whether they have a multiple pregnancy.

Women are NOT eligible if :

• There is a clear indication for a particular surgical technique or material to be used that prevents any of the allocated interventions being used,

e.g. for a woman with a previous vertical abdominal incision it maybe considered inappropriate to do a transverse abdominal incision for this caesarean section. However, if a transverse incision is going to be performed the woman is eligible.

• They have had more than one previous caesarean section.

• They have already been recruited into the trial during a previous pregnancy.

### Validation of the grobman model for successful vaginal birth after cesarean section in Jordanian women [^f928f037]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the general consensus released by the WHO in 1985, which stated that the cesarean section rate should not exceed 15% for any region, the rate of cesarean section continued to rise steadily worldwide. This exceedingly escalating rate of cesarean section has created a group of women with an obstetric history of a previous cesarean section who will face a complex discussion concerning the mode of delivery after their first cesarean section scar.

In Jordan, the situation is complicated for two reasons. First, evidence suggests that the cesarean section rate reached 30 percent for all deliveries in 2012. Second, the average lifetime births for a woman in Jordan is about 3.7. Thus, a good percentage of women will be placed in this situation where they must decide the mode of delivery after a previous cesarean section scar.After one lower segment cesarean section, women can choose to deliver by cesarean section electively (known as Elective Repeat Caesarean Section, ERCS), or they may try to deliver vaginally (Known as Trial of Labour After Caesarean Section, TOLAC). If they have opted vaginal birth trial, they may end up with either a successful vaginal birth (Known as Successful TOLAC or Vaginal Birth After Caesarean Section, VBAC), or they may end up with an unsuccessful TOLAC (known as Emergency Caesarean Section, ECS).

### The DiAMOND trial protocol: a randomised controlled trial of two decision aids for mode of delivery among women with a previous caesarean section [ ISRCTN84367722 ] [^5cb490cb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004). Low credibility.

BACKGROUND: Caesarean section (CS) has become an increasingly common method of delivery worldwide, rising in the UK from 9% of deliveries in 1980 to over 21% 2001. This increase, and the question of whether CS should be available to women on request, has been the subject of considerable debate, and national reports and guidelines have specifically highlighted the importance of patient choice in the decision making process. For women who have already experienced CS, the UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence recommends that the decision should consider maternal preferences and priorities in addition to general discussion of the overall risks and benefits of CS. Decision aids for many different medical treatment and screening decisions have been developed and evaluated, but there is relatively little evidence for the use of decision aids for choice of mode of delivery among women with a previous CS. The aim of the study is to evaluate two interventions to assist decision making about mode of delivery among pregnant women with one previous CS. METHODS/DESIGN: Women with one previous CS are recruited to the trial during their booking visit at approximately 12-20 weeks' gestation in participating maternity units in Bristol, Weston and Dundee. Using central randomisation, women are allocated to one of three arms: information programme and website; decision analysis; usual care. Both interventions are computer-based, and are designed to provide women with detailed information about the potential outcomes for both mother and baby of planned vaginal delivery, planned CS and emergency CS. The decision analysis intervention additionally provides a recommended 'preferred option' based on maximised expected utility. There are two primary outcomes (decisional conflict and actual mode of delivery), and five secondary outcomes (anxiety, knowledge, perceptions of shared decision making; satisfaction with decision making process, proportion of women attempting vaginal delivery). Primary follow up for the questionnaire measures is at 36-37 weeks' gestation, and a total of 660 women will be recruited to the study. The primary intention-to-treat analyses will comprise three pair-wise comparisons between decision analysis, information and usual care groups, for each of the two primary outcomes. A qualitative study will investigate women's experiences of the decision making in more depth, and an economic evaluation from the perspective of the NHS will be conducted. DISCUSSION: Provision of information to women facing this decision appears variable. The DiAMOND study aims to inform best practice in this area by evaluating the effectiveness of two interventions designed to aid decision making.

### Is gestational age at term a risk factor for ongoing pregnancies in nulliparous women: a prospective cohort study [^fb80755c]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The results of American observational studies and 1 large, randomized trial show that elective induction of labor among nulliparous women can reduce cesarean delivery rates and suggest that gestational age at delivery may be a risk factor for cesarean delivery in pregnancies managed expectantly. However, data on the risk of cesarean delivery at term in ongoing pregnancies are sparse, especially in high-income countries, and further information is needed to explore the external validity of these previous studies.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate the risk of cesarean delivery for each gestational week of ongoing pregnancy in nulliparous women with a singleton fetus in the cephalic presentation at term in a French population.

Study Design

This retrospective study was conducted in a perinatal network of 10 maternity units from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2017, and included all nulliparous women with a singleton fetus in the cephalic presentation who gave birth at term (≥37 0/7 weeks of gestation). From the start of term (37 completed weeks) and at the start of each subsequent week of completed gestation (each week + 0 days), ongoing pregnancy was defined as that of a woman who was still pregnant and who gave birth at any time after that date. For each week of gestation for these ongoing pregnancies, the cesarean delivery rate was defined as the number of cesarean deliveries performed in each ongoing pregnancy group divided by the number of women in this group. Separate models for each week of gestation, adjusted by maternal characteristics and hospital status, were used to compare the cesarean delivery risk between ongoing pregnancies and those delivered the preceding week. The same methods were applied to subgroups defined according to the mode of labor onset. Odds ratios were calculated after adjusting for maternal age and educational level, presence of severe preeclampsia, and maternity unit status.

Results

The study included 11,308 nulliparous women, 2544 (22.5%) of whom had a cesarean delivery. These rates remained stable for ongoing pregnancies at 37 0/7, 38 0/7, and 39 0/7 weeks of gestation; the rates were 22.5% (95% confidence interval, 21.7-23.2), 22.6% (95% confidence interval, 21.8-23.3); and 22.7% (95% confidence interval, 21.9-23.6), respectively. The risk of cesarean delivery started to increase in ongoing pregnancies at 40 0/7 weeks of gestation (24.3%; 95% confidence interval, 23.1-25.4) and especially at 41 0/7 weeks of gestation (30.7%; 95% confidence interval, 28.9-32.5). Similar trends were also shown for all modes of labor onset and in every maternity unit. In univariate and multivariate analyses, ongoing pregnancy at or beyond 40 0/7 weeks of gestation was associated with a higher risk of cesarean delivery than pregnancy delivered the previous week: 24.3% of ongoing pregnancies at 40 0/7 weeks of gestation vs 19.9% of deliveries between 39 0/7 weeks of gestation and 39 6/7 weeks of gestation. The odds ratios were 1.28 (95% confidence interval, 1.15-1.44) or 30.4% of ongoing pregnancies at 41 0/7 weeks of gestation vs 1.73 (95% confidence interval, 1.51-1.96) or 19.6% of deliveries between 40 0/7 weeks of gestation and 40 6/7 weeks of gestation.

Conclusion

Cesarean delivery rates increased starting at 40 0/7 weeks of gestation in ongoing pregnancies regardless of the mode of labor onset.

### Application of a specific clinical pathway can affect the choice of trial of labor in patients with a history of cesarean delivery [^be006566]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The Slovak Republic is one of the countries in the European Union with the fastest increase in the frequency of cesarean deliveries in recent decades. In 1998, 13.43% of women in the Slovak Republic gave birth by cesarean delivery (CD) and by 2019 this increased to 29.6%. Currently, repeat CD accounts for approximately 25% of CDs overall, despite the established safety of vaginal birth after cesarean delivery (VBAC) in most cases. Thus, the mode of birth in women with previous history of CD is highly dependent on workplace practices. There is consensus amongst several professional bodies (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [ACOG]) that planned VBAC is a clinically safe choice for the majority of women with a single previous lower segment caesarean delivery. It is associated with fewer complications, lower risk of placenta previa and/or accreta in future pregnancies and pelvic adhesions compared to a planned cesarean delivery. Hence, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that a trial of labor after cesarean delivery (TOLAC) should be offered to all patients with a singleton pregnancy and a low transverse uterine incision.

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of adopting a complex set of measures aimed at the mode of delivery in this group. These measures involved the adoption of a new clinical pathway for the management of births in patients with a previous cesarean.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 205: vaginal birth after cesarean delivery [^7af97dd1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) candidate selection—most women with one previous low-transverse cesarean incision are eligible: “most women with one previous cesarean delivery with a low-transverse incision are candidates for and should be counseled about and offered TOLAC.” Those “at high risk of uterine rupture (eg, those with a previous classical or T-incision, prior uterine rupture, or extensive transfundal uterine surgery) and those in whom vaginal delivery is otherwise contraindicated (eg, those with placenta previa) are not generally candidates for planned TOLAC.” Prediction tools may aid counseling but are not outcome-proven: “Although such a calculator may provide more specific information about the chance of VBAC… no prediction model for VBAC has been shown to result in improved patient outcomes.” Maternal morbidity versus elective repeat cesarean delivery depends on predicted vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) probability: women “with at least a 60–70% likelihood of achieving a VBAC who attempt TOLAC experience the same or less maternal morbidity,” whereas those “who have a lower than 60% probability… are more likely to experience morbidity.” Neonatal risk patterns support using predicted success but do not create an absolute cutoff: composite neonatal morbidity was similar when VBAC probability was “70% or greater,” yet “a predicted success rate of less than 70% is not a contraindication to TOLAC,” and “The decision to attempt TOLAC is a preference-sensitive decision, and eliciting patient values and preferences is a key element of counseling.”

### Multifetal gestations: twin, triplet, and higher-order multifetal pregnancies: ACOG practice bulletin, number 231 [^61eed25a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Twin delivery planning—timing and mode: Women with uncomplicated monochorionic–monoamniotic twin gestations can undergo delivery at 32 0/7–34 0/7 weeks of gestation, and women with monoamniotic twin gestations should be delivered by cesarean birth to avoid an umbilical cord complication of the non-presenting twin at the time of the initial twin’s delivery; in diamniotic twin pregnancies at 32 0/7 weeks of gestation or later with a presenting fetus that is vertex, regardless of the presentation of the second twin, vaginal delivery is a reasonable option and should be considered provided that an obstetrician with experience in managing a nonvertex presenting second twin is available; the administration of neuraxial analgesia in women with multifetal gestations facilitates operative vaginal delivery, external or internal cephalic version, and total breech extraction.

### Evaluating professional society guidelines on vaginal birth after cesarean [^7a70f280]. Seminars in Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

The objective was to compare national guidelines regarding vaginal birth after cesarean. Along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists practice bulletin, guidelines from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada were reviewed and compared. Although the 3 organizations agree on most of the risk factors for uterine rupture and failed vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC), there were some variances in the recommendations to women with 2 previous cesareans and those who required oxytocin augmentation. A disagreement was also present in regard to the availability and requirement of resources to allow a trial of labor after a previous cesarean. Although concerns could be raised about how the literature is synthesized, the 3 organizations recognized the potential biases in published reports and the lack of randomized trials.

### Effects of fetal presentation on mode of delivery in 26 143 twin pregnancies: a nationwide, population-based observational study of 31-year real-world data [^985c06ce]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Only the study by Goossens et al. is comparable with our study with regards to sample size.In contrast to our study, which included all deliveries from GA 22 weeks, previous studies covered a narrower spectrum of GAs, such as only deliveries from GA 26, 32, or 35 weeks onwards.,Excluding deliveries that occur at lower GA is likely to reduce the generalizability of the results in clinical settings.,

In our study, the data were stratified by parity, whereas many previous studies have not distinguished between fetal twin presentations with regard to parity.Our results indicate that the planned delivery mode was not affected by parity, but parous women were more likely than nulliparous women to have a successful vaginal delivery (72.9% and 56.5%, respectively). Approximately one out of six women in our study had a planned CS regardless of parity, which is lower than the proportions of planned CS rates in previous studies.,,

In our study, the prevalence of combined delivery (first twin vaginal and second twin CS) was 3.3%, whereas Goossens et al. reported 4.4%and Aviram et al. 5.4%.This suggests that the Norwegian delivery‐mode recommendations do not lead to a higher rate of combined twin deliveries.

Our results show that the planned delivery mode was strongly affected by the fetal presentation, with twins in cephalic/cephalic presentation being most likely to be born vaginally and the vaginal delivery rate being lowest for twins in non‐cephalic/non‐cephalic presentation (Table 1). The partially adjusted logistic regression models showed that maternal demographics (age, country of birth) had no or a minor effect, and pregnancy complications and previous CS had no effect on the association between twin presentations and planned CS or intrapartum CS (Tables 3 and 4, model 2). Approximately 10% of twin pregnancies with cephalic presentation of the first or both twins and 30%–40% of twin pregnancies with non‐cephalic presentation of the first or both twins were planned as CS (Table 2). The latter finding is in line with many previous studies in which a non‐cephalic first twin was an indication for a planned CS.More than half of the twins with non‐cephalic presentation of the first or both twins in the Dutch study were planned as CS, and vaginal delivery was successful in 30%–40% of those planned as vaginal delivery.

Timing of delivery at age 40 years or older—We recommend proceeding with delivery in well-dated pregnancies at 39 0/7–39 6/7 weeks of gestation for individuals with anticipated delivery at age 40 years or older due to increasing rates of neonatal morbidity and stillbirth beyond this gestational age. (GRADE 1B. Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.)

### Pregnancy at age 35 years or older: ACOG obstetric care consensus no. 11 [^8de66640]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine grading system—GRADE recommendations are used in Obstetric Care Consensus documents, with recommendations classified as either strong (1) or weak (2) and evidence quality as high (A), moderate (B), or low (C), yielding six categories: 1A, 1B, 1C, 2A, 2B, and 2C. Best Practice is defined as a recommendation in which either there is enormous amount of indirect evidence that clearly justifies a strong recommendation, direct evidence would be challenging and inefficient use of time and resources, to bring together and carefully summarize or a recommendation to the contrary would be unethical. Suggested language for strong recommendations includes We recommend.

### Predictors of successful trial of labor after cesarean section (TOLAC) in women with one prior transverse cesarean section at tertiary hospitals in northwest Ethiopia: a multicenter study [^50e7131f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Predicting the likelihood of successful TOLAC has been clinically important to reduce TOLAC complications. The predictive factors for a successful TOLAC include vaginal delivery before CS, spontaneous onset of labor, history of vaginal birth after CS, favorable cervix (higher Bishop score), fetal station, a non-recurrent indication of previous CS, maternal age less than 40 years, inter-delivery intervals ≥ 18 months, residence, rupture of membrane, fetal weight less than 4 kilograms, gestational age, and singleton pregnancy.

Despite TOLAC being practiced in Ethiopia, little is known regarding the success rate and contributing factors of the trial of labor after cesarean section. In Ethiopia, there is limited evidence, particularly in the study area. Therefore, in light of the benefits of the success rate of TOLAC, and scarcity of research, the purpose of this study was to determine the success rate and factors associated with TOLAC in mothers who had one lower transverse previous CS.

### Effects of fetal presentation on mode of delivery in 26 143 twin pregnancies: a nationwide, population-based observational study of 31-year real-world data [^8f1afa45]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Twin delivery is perceived as a challenge in modern obstetrics, and high cesarean section (CS) rates of 40%–99% are reported for many European countries and the United States.However, there is no universal international consensus on the optimal mode of delivery for twins.

As there is a trend in many countries towards delivery by CS in the majority of singleton breech deliveries, a first or second twin in breech presentation may also be perceived as an indication for planned CS. The Norwegian National Obstetric Guidelines recommend vaginal delivery in singleton breech presentation from gestational age (GA) 34 + 0 weeks, and individual counseling before GA 34 + 0 weeks. These recommendations are also valid for twin pregnancies with the first twin in breech presentation.Obstetric practice in Norway is characterized by low overall CS rates of <17%, as well as stable CS rates in singleton breech pregnancies and in multifetal pregnancies over the past two decades.At the same time, fetal and neonatal mortality rates are low.

Previous research into twin pregnancies has mostly focused on management during pregnancy, and few previous studies have assessed the role of the twins' presentations on planned and actual delivery modes.,Most of these studies have been single‐center studies and/or conducted as randomized controlled trial settings, and excluded lower GAs. The aim of the present study was to describe the rate of combinations of twin fetal presentations at delivery and to identify their associations with the mode of delivery as well as fetal and maternal birth outcomes.
