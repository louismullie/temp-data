## Question

What are the GI manifestations of Ehlers danlos syndrome?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the gastrointestinal manifestations of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overall epidemiology and the functional-versus-structural spectrum of GI disease in EDS. Then, I should differentiate the clinical risks by major subtypes, especially hypermobile EDS (hEDS/HSD) versus vascular EDS (vEDS). Next, I will review structural endoscopic findings and dysmotility data, followed by the roles of POTS and mast-cell activation, pediatric patterns, and other subtypes. After that, I need to outline a diagnostic strategy and a management framework. Finally, I should synthesize key differentiators and red flags that guide urgency and procedural risk management.

> Let me first confirm the breadth of GI involvement across EDS before drilling down by subtype. I need to verify that GI symptoms and diagnoses are substantially over-represented in EDS cohorts, and the signal appears strong: hospitalized EDS cases have GI conditions in 44% vs 18% of controls with an adjusted OR of 3.57, and specialized clinic cohorts report GI manifestations in 56% with predominance in hEDS and female patients, which frames both the prevalence and demographic skew I should keep in mind [^115S1eVq] [^111b8YEQ]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should emphasize the bimodal pattern that emerges — functional disorders predominate in hEDS/HSD while structural catastrophes characterize vEDS — because that informs both diagnostics and procedural risk early in the reasoning [^113dCzsV].

> Now, focusing on hypermobile EDS and hypermobility spectrum disorders, I should double-check the magnitude of functional GI burden. Nearly all subjects with hEDS/HSD fulfill criteria for one or more Rome IV disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI), 98% vs 47% of matched controls, with bowel disorders dominating, which supports a high pretest probability for IBS-spectrum and related phenotypes in these patients [^114RB5Y4]. Let me verify symptom profiles from tertiary data: abdominal pain, nausea, constipation, and heartburn are prominently reported, while population data also show increased postprandial fullness and early satiety, highlighting an upper GI symptom cluster often mediated by autonomic factors in hEDS [^111b8YEQ] [^113PpHzi]. I should confirm the DGBI overlap insight as well; machine learning data in hEDS/HSD suggest high co-occurrence of IBS and functional dyspepsia, with overlap linked to lower quality of life and dysautonomia, reinforcing the need to screen for POTS in refractory cases [^1134gmNH].

> Turning to vascular EDS, I need to ensure I foreground the structural risk profile and procedural hazards. Intestinal perforation occurs in about 22% of vEDS patients with a colon predilection, and although arterial rupture dominates mortality, median survival is shortened to about 48 years, demanding a conservative approach to invasive GI procedures [^114RB3oo] [^113dyfii]. Let me verify endoscopy risk: the endoscopy-related perforation rate is markedly elevated in vEDS around 9.4% versus less than 1% in classical/hypermobile types, which justifies a bias toward noninvasive screening strategies whenever feasible in vEDS [^116QKLt4].

> Next, I will examine structural and mucosal findings commonly identified in hEDS/HSD during investigation. Wait, I should confirm endoscopic yield: in a tertiary cohort, EGD in hEDS often shows gastritis, hiatal hernia, and reflux esophagitis, consistent with symptom reports and potential connective tissue laxity effects at the EGJ [^111b8YEQ]. I need to check eosinophilic esophagitis and celiac signal in younger cohorts; pediatric and young adult hEDS/JHS data show EoE in 21% and celiac disease in 4%, with dysphagia strongly predicting EoE, aligning with broader EoE associations reported with heritable connective tissue disorders [^115Ds8SB] [^115dGt1T].

> I will now examine dysmotility and pelvic floor dysfunction, given their high clinical yield for mechanism-directed care. Abnormal gastric emptying is observed in about 22% with both delayed and rapid phenotypes represented, and colonic transit abnormalities approach 28%, while anorectal testing frequently demonstrates rectal evacuation disorder and hyposensitivity in hEDS cohorts, reinforcing the value of objective motility and anorectal evaluations in selected patients with refractory symptoms [^111b8YEQ]. Hold on, I should verify that guidance aligns with this burden: the AGA update recommends targeted testing for functional defecation disorders using anorectal manometry, balloon expulsion, or defecography in hEDS/HSD with symptoms such as incomplete evacuation, given the high prevalence of pelvic floor dysfunction in this population [^115LdQRq].

> But wait, what if autonomic dysfunction is a key driver of symptom amplification across organ domains in hEDS/HSD? I need to check the POTS signal: about 37.5% of HSD/hEDS subjects report a POTS diagnosis, with POTS-positive individuals meeting Rome IV criteria across multiple GI regions more frequently and reporting higher symptom frequency, which persists after adjustment for age and chronic conditions [^112TjF91]. Let me reconsider mechanistic mediation; in a non-patient population, the association between hEDS and postprandial symptoms was dependent on autonomic factors but independent of pain and psychopathology, supporting an evaluation pathway that screens for orthostatic intolerance in refractory upper and lower GI symptom clusters [^113PpHzi]. I should confirm practice guidance here; AGA advises selective autonomic testing when orthostatic intolerance coexists with refractory GI symptoms after lifestyle measures, not universal testing for all hEDS/HSD with GI complaints [^111F7ziK].

> Next, I should review mast cell activation as a comorbid amplifier, while being careful to avoid over-testing. MCAS is increasingly reported in hEDS and commonly coexists with POTS and dysautonomia in tertiary dysmotility settings, so I need to ensure a focused approach to testing and treatment rather than blanket screening [^111fMXEd]. I should confirm the diagnostic threshold: AGA recommends serum tryptase at baseline and 1–4 hours post-flare, with activation defined by a 20% plus 2 ng/mL increase from baseline, and testing should be reserved for episodic multisystem presentations suggestive of a generalized mast-cell disorder rather than routine evaluation in all hEDS/HSD patients with GI symptoms [^111BuoTF] [^1166FkDC]. Hold on, I should verify the initial management guidance; H1/H2 antagonists and mast cell stabilizers can be considered while avoiding individual triggers, and confirmed or strongly suspected MCAS warrants allergy referral or input from mast-cell disease centers for advanced evaluation and care [^1148FWhx] [^113peu6y].

> I need to check pediatric-specific patterns because the diagnostic yield and priorities can differ in younger patients. In children and young adults with hEDS/JHS, constipation is very common, dysphagia tracks strongly with EoE, and dyspepsia or gastroparesis is frequent; importantly, upper endoscopy and gastric emptying studies offer high diagnostic yield, and motility studies are abnormal in about a third of those tested, supporting a lower threshold for targeted testing when symptoms are persistent or severe [^115Ds8SB]. Let me verify the screening frame; pediatric cohorts underscore high DGBI burden within a hypermobility continuum and support Beighton-based screening when GI phenotypes are prominent, though diagnosis remains clinical under 2017 criteria for hEDS/HSD [^114RB5Y4].

> Before I lock the subtype focus, I should confirm whether non-vascular subtypes carry GI tissue fragility as well. Classical-like EDS due to tenascin-X deficiency shows a predisposition to visceral rupture, including bowel and esophageal perforations, arguing for vigilance beyond vEDS when tissue fragility phenotypes are present [^115pEi1f]. I need to check systemic reviews and case series; vascular complications, while rare, are documented in several nonvascular subtypes including classical EDS with reports of arterial dissections and hemorrhage, reinforcing individualized risk stratification when planning invasive procedures or pursuing aggressive endoscopic interventions [^116RSsHx] [^111FZF1P]. Let me remember that tenascin-X deficiency cases also include recurrent GI perforation, suggesting that genotype-phenotype information — when available — can further refine procedural risk [^116CruFi].

> Now, I will determine a pragmatic diagnostic approach that respects both prevalence and risk. For For Wait, I'm getting duplicated text. Let me check the source documents again for the unique content and consolidate without redundancy; I should confirm I prioritize screening for hypermobility in DGBI using the Beighton score and 2017 criteria, apply selective autonomic and mast-cell evaluations, test earlier for celiac disease, and avoid low-yield testing such as routine SIBO breath tests in hEDS/HSD with functional symptom profiles [^111P2Hbu] [^113xCqDk] [^113SLtb3] [^116P9WeC] [^115Gp5LA]. Hold on, I should verify the guardrails: AGA advises against universal POTS or MCAS testing, favoring orthostatic vitals and tryptase-based testing only when clinical features suggest autonomic or mast-cell activation; for outlet-type constipation or incomplete evacuation, anorectal manometry and balloon expulsion are recommended due to the high prevalence of pelvic floor dysfunction; the overall evaluation for DGBI should mirror the general population with positive symptom-based strategies and limited noninvasive testing [^111F7ziK] [^1157w1HD] [^115LdQRq] [^111bs4T6].

> Next, I should articulate a management strategy that integrates GI symptom control with systemic contributors. I need to ensure a multidisciplinary foundation given the multisystem nature of hEDS/HSD, incorporating early physical and occupational therapy, cognitive-behavioral strategies, and orthotics when indicated, while aligning chronic GI symptom management with standard DGBI and motility care in the absence of overt POTS or MCAS drivers [^114bNyif] [^1162LRzY]. Let me verify diet guidance; evidence-informed dietary trials include small-particle or gastroparesis diets and selective elimination approaches such as low-FODMAP, gluten- or dairy-free, and low-histamine diets, delivered with nutrition support to avoid unintended restriction and malnutrition, particularly in youth and those with disordered eating risk [^114erPQH]. I should confirm dysautonomia care; for POTS, emphasize fluids, salt, graded exercise, compression, and consider pharmacotherapy for volume expansion, rate control, or vasoconstriction in nonresponders within a coordinated cardiology-neurology framework [^115gJnkM].

> I should double-check medication utilization patterns and procedural safety to inform risk-benefit decisions. EDS cohorts bear a high GI medication burden, with substantially higher prescription claims across acid suppression, antiemetics, IBS agents, and visceral analgesics than matched controls, especially among women and adults, which argues for periodic deprescribing reviews and mechanism-aligned therapy rather than polypharmacy escalation [^111yEfJn]. Let me consider procedural nuances; colonoscopy appears safe and not associated with higher pain scores in HSD, whereas endoscopy-related perforation risk is distinctly elevated in vEDS, so procedural decisions should be subtype specific, with a bias toward noninvasive alternatives in vEDS and careful counseling and technique in others [^116GLBnX] [^116QKLt4]. But wait, I should also acknowledge emerging therapeutics; given the autonomic underpinnings in overlap IBS/FD with dysautonomia, pyridostigmine is a plausible target for motility and POTS symptoms, although this remains an investigational direction requiring rigorous trials before routine adoption [^115g2w7v].

> Finally, I need to synthesize key differentiators and red flags to guide clinical urgency and testing scope. For hEDS/HSD, functional GI disorders, dysmotility, and pelvic floor dysfunction predominate, often amplified by POTS and sometimes MCAS; for vEDS, the signature is catastrophic structural complications including spontaneous intestinal perforation, arterial rupture, and a high endoscopic perforation risk such that invasive procedures require stringent justification and specialized precautions [^114RB3oo] [^116QKLt4] [^113dyfii]. I should confirm actionable red flags: sudden, severe abdominal pain in vEDS warrants urgent evaluation for perforation; refractory IBS/FD phenotypes in general GI practice should prompt hypermobility screening and targeted autonomic assessment rather than exhaustive low-yield testing, aligning with AGA's positive-diagnosis, limited-testing approach to DGBI with selective adjunct evaluations for POTS and MCAS when clinically indicated [^111P2Hbu] [^111F7ziK].

Gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations are common in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), particularly the hypermobile and vascular subtypes [^113dCzsV], and include **functional GI disorders** (IBS, functional dyspepsia, GERD) [^112cZecb], **motility disorders** (gastroparesis, chronic constipation, dysphagia) [^111b8YEQ], and **structural complications** (hernias, diverticulosis, rectal prolapse) [^114RB5Y4]. Vascular EDS carries a **high risk of life-threatening GI events** [^111LgqCq], such as spontaneous colonic perforation [^114RB3oo] and mesenteric ischemia [^113dyfii]. Management is **multidisciplinary** [^114bNyif] and symptom-targeted [^1162LRzY], with **cautious use of endoscopy** due to tissue fragility [^116QKLt4].

---

## Functional gastrointestinal disorders

Functional GI disorders are **highly prevalent** [^111q6Ynv] in EDS, particularly in hypermobile EDS (hEDS) and in hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSD). These include:

- **Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)**: Commonly reported, with symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits [^112cZecb] [^112TjF91].

- **Functional dyspepsia**: Characterized by upper abdominal discomfort, early satiety, and postprandial fullness [^112cZecb] [^1134gmNH].

- **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**: Frequent heartburn and reflux symptoms are reported [^111b8YEQ] [^113PpHzi].

---

## Motility disorders

Patients with EDS frequently experience **motility disorders** [^111fMXEd], including:

- **Gastroparesis**: Delayed gastric emptying, leading to nausea, vomiting, and early satiety [^111b8YEQ] [^115Ds8SB].

- **Chronic constipation**: Often associated with pelvic floor dysfunction and rectal hyposensitivity [^111b8YEQ] [^115LdQRq].

- **Dysphagia**: Difficulty swallowing due to esophageal dysmotility [^111b8YEQ] [^115Ds8SB].

---

## Structural gastrointestinal complications

Structural GI complications are common in EDS, particularly in the **vascular and classical subtypes** [^113dCzsV]. Hernias (hiatal, inguinal, and umbilical) are frequently reported due to connective tissue fragility [^111b8YEQ]. There is an increased prevalence of colonic diverticula (diverticulosis), particularly in vascular EDS. Rectal prolapse is associated with pelvic floor dysfunction and connective tissue weakness [^114RB5Y4] [^111q6Ynv].

---

## Severe gastrointestinal complications in vascular EDS

Vascular EDS (vEDS) is associated with **life-threatening GI complications** [^113xMwSD], including:

- **Spontaneous colonic perforation**: Particularly involving the sigmoid colon, often requiring surgical intervention [^114RB3oo] [^111LgqCq].

- **Mesenteric ischemia**: Due to arterial fragility and rupture, leading to bowel infarction [^113dyfii] [^116RCVEC].

- **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: From arterial rupture or aneurysm formation [^113dyfii] [^114zKDLn].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnostic evaluation of GI manifestations in EDS includes a thorough clinical assessment with a detailed history and physical examination [^111bs4T6], including the Beighton score for joint hypermobility [^113xCqDk] [^111P2Hbu]. Imaging studies such as MRI, CT, and ultrasound are used to evaluate structural abnormalities and vascular complications [^111LgqCq]. Endoscopy is performed **cautiously** due to increased risk of perforation, particularly in vascular EDS [^116QKLt4] [^116GLBnX].

---

## Management strategies

Management of GI manifestations in EDS involves a **multidisciplinary approach** and symptom-targeted therapy, such as dietary modifications, pharmacological treatments, and physical therapy [^114bNyif] [^114erPQH]. Surgical intervention is reserved for severe complications, including colonic perforation or severe hernias [^114RB3oo]. Care should involve gastroenterologists, geneticists, surgeons, and dietitians [^114bNyif] [^115gJnkM].

---

Gastrointestinal manifestations in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are diverse, encompassing functional disorders, motility issues, and structural complications. Vascular EDS carries a **high risk of severe GI complications**, warranting careful diagnostic evaluation and **multidisciplinary management** [^113xMwSD].

### Clinical and genetic features of vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^113dyfii]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a rare autosomal dominant inherited disorder of connective tissue resulting from mutation of the COL3A1 gene encoding type III collagen. Affected individuals are prone to serious vascular, intestinal, and obstetrical complications. Complications are rare during infancy but occur in up to 25% of affected persons before the age of 20 and 80% before the age of 40. The median survival is 48 years. Arterial rupture accounts for most deaths, while intestinal perforation, usually involving the colon, is less fatal. Pregnancy poses a high risk for women with EDS. As with many rare orphan diseases, delayed and/or improper diagnosis can lead to inadequate or inappropriate treatment and management.

Diagnosis is based on clinical findings, including specific facial features, thin translucent skin, and a propensity to bleeding and rupture of vessels and/or viscera. Diagnosis can be confirmed either by biochemical assays showing qualitative or quantitative abnormalities in type III collagen secretion or by molecular biology studies demonstrating mutation of the COL3A1 gene. Varied molecular mechanisms have been observed with different mutations in each family. No correlation has been established between genotype and phenotype. Diagnosis should be suspected in any young person presenting with arterial or visceral rupture, carotid dissection, or colonic perforation. There are currently no specific treatments for EDS.

### Ehlers Danlos syndrome and gastrointestinal manifestations: a 20-year experience at Mayo Clinic [^111b8YEQ]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2015). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations are found in Ehlers Danlos syndrome (EDS) hypermobility subtype (HM). We aimed to assess associations between EDS HM and other EDS subtypes with GI manifestations.

- **Methods**: We reviewed medical records of EDS patients evaluated at Mayo Clinic's Medical Genetics Clinic from 1994 to 2013. Information regarding EDS subtypes, GI manifestations, and treatments was extracted.

- **Key Results**: We identified 687 patients; 378 (56%) had associated GI manifestations (female 86.8%, diagnosis mean age 29.6 years). Of the patients identified, 58.9% (43/73) had EDS classic, 57.5% (271/471) EDS HM, and 47.3% (27/57) EDS vascular subtypes. Additionally, 86 patients had EDS that could not be classified within any of these three subtypes. The most common GI symptoms were abdominal pain (56.1%), nausea (42.3%), constipation (38.6%), heartburn (37.6%), and irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms (27.5%). Many GI symptoms were more common in EDS HM than in the other subtypes combined. Among 37.8% of the 378 patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, the most common abnormalities were gastritis, hiatal hernia, and reflux esophagitis. Abnormal gastric emptying was observed in 22.3% (17/76): 11.8% delayed and 10.5% accelerated. Colonic transit was abnormal in 28.3% (13/46): 19.6% delayed and 8.7% accelerated. A rectal evacuation disorder was confirmed in 18 out of 30 patients who underwent anorectal manometry. Angiography showed aneurysms in abdominal vessels in the EDS vascular type. Proton pump inhibitors (38%) and drugs for constipation (23%) were the most commonly used medications.

### High prevalence of gastrointestinal disorders in a large cohort of patients with joint hypermobility [^114RB5Y4]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

Hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (hEDS) and joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS) are characterized by generalized joint hypermobility and musculoskeletal symptoms, as well as skin and soft tissue involvement. The diagnosis is largely based on clinical criteria. There is no genetic test or biological marker to confirm the diagnosis. Generalized joint hypermobility is screened using a 9-point Beighton score, which considers the flexibility of the spine/hips, paired knees and elbows, fifth metacarpophalangeal joint, thumb, and wrists. A score of 5 or greater for adults and 6 or greater for prepubertal children and adolescents is suggestive of hypermobility. Definitive diagnosis requires fulfilling criteria, which include Beighton scores and other features such as joint pain, dislocations, and soft tissue lesions, as well as overlap features of connective tissue disorders. The 2017 International consensus statement states that hEDS and JHS share similar features and are considered part of a continuum of hypermobility spectrum disorders. We have used the term hEDS/JHS to describe our cohort.

The gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in hEDS/JHS patients can have functional and organic manifestations. Adult patients with JHS have significantly increased GI symptoms such as dyspepsia, gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), as well as conditions such as abdominal hernia, diaphragmatic hernia, and rectal prolapse. We describe the GI symptoms and related evaluation in a large cohort of children and young adults.

### Safety of endoscopy in heritable connective tissue disorders [^116QKLt4]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Little is known about the gastrointestinal manifestations or safety of endoscopy among patients with heritable connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS).

- **Methods**: We conducted an electronic cross-sectional survey nested within preexisting registries of patients with heritable connective tissue disorders and examined self-reported rates of endoscopic complications.

- **Results**: The rate of endoscopy-related perforation was 9.4% (95% confidence interval 2.0%-25.0%) among individuals with vascular EDS, less than 1% in classical and hypermobility-type EDS, and zero in Marfan syndrome (P < 0.001). Spontaneous intestinal perforation was also significantly higher in the vascular EDS group.

- **Discussion**: Clinicians should consider noninvasive screening methods for patients with vascular EDS.

### Rome IV functional gastrointestinal disorders and health impairment in subjects with hypermobility spectrum disorders or hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^112cZecb]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Individuals with hypermobility spectrum disorder or hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (HSD/hEDS) are increasingly encountered by gastroenterologists and pose complex clinical challenges. Uncontrolled studies have found functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) to be common in patients with HSD/hEDS. Some patients have somatic symptoms (medically unexplained symptoms) that might affect FGIDs. This study performed a case-control analysis to determine the prevalence of and factors associated with Rome IV FGIDs in subjects with HSD/hEDS compared with age- and sex-matched population-based controls.

An online general health survey was completed by 603 individuals with HSD/hEDS in October 2018 (cases) and 603 matched individuals from the population of the United Kingdom (controls) in 2015. The mean participant age was 39 years, and 96% were women. The survey included questions about Rome IV FGIDs, non-GI and non-musculoskeletal somatic symptoms (maximum number, 10), quality of life, medical history, and healthcare use. The prevalence of FGIDs was compared between cases and controls. Subsequent logistic regression models, adjusting for the number of somatic symptoms, were used to determine the associations for FGIDs in HSD/hEDS compared with controls.

Nearly all subjects (98%) with HSD/hEDS fulfilled symptom-based criteria for one or more Rome IV FGIDs, compared with 47% of controls (P < .0001). The gastrointestinal regions most commonly affected by FGIDs in individuals with HSD/hEDS and control subjects were the bowel (90% vs. 40% of controls).

### Natural history and surgical management of colonic perforations in vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: A retrospective review [^114RB3oo]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). Low credibility.

Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a rare and severe genetic condition leading to spontaneous, potentially life-threatening arterial and digestive complications. Colonic ruptures are a common feature of the disease, but clear recommendations on their management are lacking.

This study aimed to identify surgery-related morbidity and 30-day postoperative mortality after colonic perforation. It was a retrospective review conducted on a large cohort of patients with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome followed in a tertiary referral center. Between 2000 and 2016, the French National Reference Centre for Rare Vascular Diseases (HEGP, AP-HP, Paris, France) followed 148 patients with molecularly proven vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcomes measured were surgery-related morbidity and 30-day postoperative mortality.

Of 133 patients with molecularly proven vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, 30 (22%) had a history of colonic perforation, and 15 (50%) were males. These subjects were diagnosed with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome at a younger age than patients with a history of GI events without colonic perforation (p = 0.0007). There were 46 colonic perforations, with a median of 1.0 event per patient (interquartile range, 1.0–2.0). Reperforations occurred in 14 (47%) patients, mostly males. Surgical management consisted of Hartmann procedures or subtotal abdominal colectomies, with a nonnegligible rate of reperforation following partial colonic resection (11 patients, 41%).

### Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and hypermobility spectrum disorders [^114bNyif]. American Family Physician (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, specifically with respect to general principles, AAFP 2021 guidelines recommend offering early multidisciplinary treatment. This includes physical, occupational, and cognitive behavior therapy in patients with EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders. Consider offering orthotics and community and specialty support to optimize outcomes in patients with joint hypermobility symptoms.

### AGA clinical practice update on GI manifestations and autonomic or immune dysfunction in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Expert review [^111F7ziK]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, more specifically with respect to evaluation for gastrointestinal symptoms, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend considering testing for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome through postural vital signs. Patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders and refractory gastrointestinal symptoms who report orthostatic intolerance should be referred for autonomic testing, after excluding medication side effects and attempting appropriate lifestyle or behavioral modifications. It is advised not to obtain this testing in all patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders who report gastrointestinal symptoms alone.

### AGA clinical practice update on GI manifestations and autonomic or immune dysfunction in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Expert review [^111BuoTF]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, specifically in the evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend considering diagnostic testing with serum tryptase levels. These should be collected at baseline and 1–4 hours following symptom flares if mast cell activation syndrome is suspected. An increase of 20% above the baseline plus 2 ng/mL is necessary to demonstrate evidence of mast cell activation.

### AGA clinical practice update on GI manifestations and autonomic or immune dysfunction in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Expert review [^115LdQRq]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, more specifically with respect to evaluation for gastrointestinal symptoms, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining diagnostic testing for functional defecation disorders. This testing should include anorectal manometry, balloon expulsion test, or defecography in patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders and lower gastrointestinal symptoms, such as incomplete evacuation. This recommendation is based on the high prevalence of pelvic floor dysfunction, especially rectal hyposensitivity, in this population.

### Vascular phenotypes in nonvascular subtypes of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: a systematic review [^116RSsHx]. Genetics in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Within the spectrum of the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS), vascular complications are usually associated with the vascular subtype of EDS. Vascular complications are also observed in other EDS subtypes, but the reports are anecdotal and the information is dispersed. To better document the nature of vascular complications among "nonvascular" EDS subtypes, we performed a systematic review.

- **Methods**: We queried three databases for English-language studies from inception until May 2017, documenting both phenotypes and genotypes of patients with nonvascular EDS subtypes. The outcome included the number and nature of vascular complications.

- **Results**: A total of 112 papers were included, and data were collected from 467 patients, of whom 77 presented with a vascular phenotype. Severe complications included mainly hematomas (53%), frequently reported in musculocontractural and classical-like EDS; intracranial hemorrhages (18%), with a high risk in dermatosparaxis EDS; and arterial dissections (16%), frequently reported in kyphoscoliotic and classical EDS. Other, more minor, vascular complications were reported in cardiac-valvular, arthrochalasia, spondylodysplastic, and periodontal EDS.

- **Conclusion**: Potentially life-threatening vascular complications are a rare but important finding in several nonvascular EDS subtypes, highlighting a need for more systematic documentation. This review will help familiarize clinicians with the spectrum of vascular complications in EDS and guide follow-up and management.

### Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in a young woman with anorexia nervosa and complex somatic symptoms [^111B7FwR]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of clinically heterogeneous connective tissue disorders characterized by joint hypermobility, hyperextensibility of the skin, and a general connective tissue fragility that can induce symptoms from multiple organ systems. We present a case of comorbid anorexia nervosa and EDS in a 23-year-old woman with a multitude of somatic symptoms that were initially attributed to the eating disorder but were likely caused by the underlying EDS. Various EDS symptoms, such as gastrointestinal complaints, smell and taste abnormalities, and altered somatosensory awareness, may resemble or mask an underlying eating disorder, and vice versa. Due to the large clinical heterogeneity, correctly identifying symptoms of EDS presents a challenge for clinicians, who should be aware of this group of underdiagnosed and potentially serious syndromes. The Beighton Hypermobility Score is an easily applicable screening instrument for assessing potential EDS in patients with joint hypermobility.

### Gastrointestinal medication burden among persons with the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes [^111yEfJn]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2021). Low credibility.

The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDSs) are a group of heritable disorders of connective tissue associated with an increased prevalence of both structural and functional gastrointestinal (GI) conditions.

- **Methods**: We used 10 years (2005–2014) of administrative claims data comprised of 4,294 people with clinician-diagnosed EDS, aged 5–62 years, and compared their frequency of GI drug prescription claims to their age-, sex-, state of residence-, and earliest claim date-matched controls. We categorized the GI medications into the following groups: acid suppressants, anti-emetics, irritable bowel syndrome drugs, and visceral hypersensitivity (VHS) medications.

- **Key results**: Compared to controls, a significantly higher proportion of persons with EDS had prescription claims for at least one GI drug group, as well as for drugs in each of the four GI drug groups included in our study. By age group, 25.7% of children and 45.1% of adults with EDS had prescription claims for at least one GI drug group compared with only 7.4% and 21.0% of controls, respectively (p < 0.0001). By gender, 44.0% of women and 25.3% of men with EDS had prescription claims for at least one class of GI drugs compared with 19.2% and 9.6% of controls, respectively (p < 0.0001).

- **Conclusions and key inferences**: Predominant medication burden occurs among women with EDS, beginning peri-pubertally for anti-emetics and VHS drugs. High GI medication burden underscores previous evidence that GI dysmotility is common among persons with EDS.

### AGA clinical practice update on GI manifestations and autonomic or immune dysfunction in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Expert review [^1148FWhx]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, particularly with respect to the management of gastrointestinal symptoms, the AGA 2025 guidelines recommend considering the treatment of suspected mast cell activation syndrome with histamine receptor antagonists and/or mast cell stabilizers. It is advised to avoid triggers such as certain foods, alcohol, strong smells, temperature changes, mechanical stimuli (friction), emotional distress (pollen, mold), or specific medications (opioids, NSAIDs, iodinated contrast).

### Arterial complications in classical Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: A case series [^111FZF1P]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2020). Low credibility.

The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of connective tissue disorders with several recognized types. Patients with a type of EDS have connective tissue abnormalities resulting in a varying degree of joint hypermobility, skin and vascular fragility, and generalized tissue friability. Classical EDS (cEDS) typically occurs as a result of dominant pathogenic variants in COL5A1 or COL5A2. The cardinal features of cEDS are hyperextensible skin, atrophic scarring, and joint hypermobility. Arterial complications are more characteristically a feature of vascular EDS, although individual cases of arterial events in cEDS have been reported.

- **Methods**: A cohort of 154 patients with a clinical diagnosis of cEDS from the UK was analyzed.

- **Results**: Seven patients (4.5%) with a diagnosis of cEDS (four pathogenic, one likely pathogenic, and two variants of uncertain significance in COL5A1) who had experienced arterial complications were identified. Arterial complications mostly involved medium-sized vessels and also included two abdominal aortic aneurysms. No unique clinical features were identified in this group of patients.

- **Conclusion**: There is a possible increased risk of arterial complications in patients with cEDS, although not well-defined. Clinicians need to be aware of this possibility when presented with a patient with an arterial complication and features of cEDS. Long-term management in families with cEDS and a vascular complication should be individually tailored to the patient's history and their family's history of vascular events.

### A machine learning approach to stratify patients with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome/hypermobility spectrum disorders according to disorders of gut brain interaction, comorbidities and quality of life [^1134gmNH]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). High credibility.

Our findings that IBS and FD present as the two most common DGBI in hEDS/HSD corroborate with published literature, which shows a prevalence of 23%–48% of IBS in hEDS/HSD, and inversely, a 41.9% prevalence of hEDS/HSD in IBS. There is also a 28%–68% prevalence of FD in hEDS/HSD, and inversely, a 55% prevalence of hEDS/HSD in FD.

Additionally, similar to our study where we demonstrate an overlap of 67.6% between IBS and FD in hEDS/HSD (Cluster 0), previous studies have also shown a 68% overlap between IBS and FD in patients attending tertiary care GI clinics. Patients with overlap IBS/FD experience poorer quality of life and more severe clinical manifestations of the disease compared to either IBS or FD alone. Within our hEDS/HSD cohort, patients with overlapping hEDS/HSD + FFD + IBS present with a more severe clinical phenotype, with a poorer quality of life, increased somatization, dysautonomia, PoTS, and an increased psychological burden compared to hEDS/HSD + IBS and hEDS/HSD alone. This is a unique finding as existing research on hEDS/HSD has primarily categorized patient groups into hEDS/HSD + DGBI in a general sense, without further differentiating the impact of specific overlapping DGBIs on the clinical presentation.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and more specifically with respect to evaluation for gastrointestinal symptoms, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining a diagnostic evaluation for gastrointestinal symptoms consistent with disorders of gut-brain interaction in patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders and comorbid postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and/or mast cell activation syndrome. Follow a similar approach to the evaluation of disorders of gut-brain interaction as in the general population, including the use of a positive symptom-based diagnostic strategy and limited noninvasive testing.

### Low prevalence of positive hydrogen breath tests in patients with functional gastrointestinal conditions and hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^115Gp5LA]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). High credibility.

Using hydrogen breath testing (HBT) to diagnose small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) remains controversial in patients with functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and is unknown in those with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS). We assessed the prevalence of positive HBTs in these groups, evaluated the predictive value of GI symptoms, and examined the potential role of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on test results.

- **Methods**: Sequential patients referred for HBT to a tertiary unit were classified into the following groups: GI maldigestion/malabsorption, GI sensorimotor disorders, hEDS, and functional GI disorders. All underwent standardized HBT, and the yield was assessed against symptoms and PPI use.

- **Key results**: A total of 1062 HBTs were performed over 3 years (70% female, mean age 48 ± 16 years). Overall, 7.5% (80/1062) of patients had a positive HBT. The prevalence of positive HBT was highest in patients with GI maldigestion/malabsorption (17.9%; DOR 16.16, p < 0.001) and GI sensorimotor disorders (15.9%; DOR 8.84, p < 0.001), compared to functional GI disorders (1.6%; DOR 1.0) [p < 0.0001]. None of the hEDS patients tested positive for HBT. A positive HBT was independently associated with increased age (DOR 1.03; p < 0.001) and symptoms of diarrhea (DOR 3.95; p < 0.0001). Patients on PPIs tended towards a positive HBT more than patients off PPIs (16.1% vs. 6.9%; DOR 2.47; p < 0.0001).

- **Conclusions & inferences**: Less than 2% of patients with functional GI disorders, and none of the patients with hEDS had a positive HBT. Pre-test probability was higher in patients with GI structural disorders.

### Self-reported demographics of 154 hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients [^115gzXCs]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Low credibility.

Demographic data for patients with Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hEDS) have not been well established. hEDS patients often present with a constellation of symptoms; it is important to update clinical criteria for diagnosis and provide a framework for common co-morbidities. The primary objective of this study was to identify the prevalence of co-morbidities in hEDS patients to allow clinicians to better identify patients and their most common symptoms. The goal is to use this information to augment diagnostic and clinical demographic data to more accurately represent hEDS patients.

This retrospective chart review utilized patient intake forms from 154 patients diagnosed with Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome in a clinic. Patient intake forms included responses to questions about the presence of various previous conditions. Our study revealed numerous co-morbidities with increased prevalence that differed from the diagnostic criteria, including Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, Mast Cell Activation Syndrome, anxiety, depression, Temporomandibular Joint Syndrome, headaches, and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease. These findings will help inform clinicians of prevalent co-morbidities among hEDS patients and encourage further evaluation for screening and diagnosis.

Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome patients presented with a wide range of co-morbidities not listed in the clinical criteria. Future studies are warranted across diverse and larger patient populations and beyond self-reported data.

### Treating pain related to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with medical cannabis [^111dmGvz]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

We present the case of an 18-year-old woman who suffered from complications of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Her pain was poorly controlled despite being on a myriad of analgesic medications at the time. On initiating cannabinoid-based treatment, her pain was drastically reduced, immediately enhancing the patient's quality of life. As the patient continued to self-administer, she was able to eliminate her opioid requirement.

Considering the recent legalization, we underline the need for physicians to be educated regarding the use of cannabinoids, specifically for chronic pain stemming from hypermobile EDS. Furthermore, we review the various impediments preventing ease of access to this potentially beneficial treatment.

### Underlying Ehlers-Danlos syndrome discovered during neuro-ophthalmic evaluation of concussion patients: a case series [^111RJb9h]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Low credibility.

The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDSs) are a group of heritable disorders that cause connective tissue defects. Signs of EDSs include hypermobile joints, loose skin, and fragile tissues due to defective connective tissue synthesis. Thirteen types of EDS have been identified with significant phenotypic heterogeneity. The overall prevalence of EDSs is between 1 in 2500 to 1 in 5000, and the classic and hypermobile EDS variants are the most common phenotype. It is likely that the milder forms may be underdiagnosed due to their phenotypic heterogeneity.

When hypermobile EDS is suspected, a detailed history should be obtained to assess hypermobility, easy bruising or bleeding, poor wound healing, gastrointestinal issues, repeated or voluntary joint dislocations, and history of hernia or muscle injury in the setting of minor trauma so that the clinical diagnosis can be made. However, studies and anecdotal observations have suggested that subclinical EDS can also be unmasked by a physical trauma event due to the tissue fragility associated with EDS.

Neurological and spinal manifestations of EDS that can become manifest in these patients can include cervicogenic headache, migraine, cerebrospinal fluid hyper- or hypotension, Chiari malformation, and atlantoaxial/craniocervical instability. At present, there are no published reports focusing on the neuro-ophthalmic symptoms that might occur in EDS patients after mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). In the following case series, we report neuro-ophthalmic manifestations that developed in patients with underlying EDS or joint hypermobility.

### Vascular phenotypes in nonvascular subtypes of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: A systematic review [^115eKobo]. Genetics in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is an umbrella term for a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous connective tissue disorders. Over the past two decades, the Villefranche Nosology has been the standard for classifying EDS. It recognized six subtypes, most of which were caused by defects in the primary structure of collagen or collagen-modifying enzymes. Recent discoveries have, however, expanded the pathogenic spectrum to include EDS variants caused by defects in both noncollagenous extracellular matrix proteins and intracellular processes. This has led to an EDS reclassification, a task that was recently accomplished by an international EDS consortium.

Skin hyperextensibility and joint hypermobility are the clinical hallmarks of EDS. More variable signs of soft connective tissue fragility are helpful in discriminating between the different types. Historically, arterial aneurysm and dissection have been synonymous with the vascular type of EDS (vEDS). This type of EDS is characterized by the presence of thin, translucent skin that bruises very easily, and joint hypermobility, which is often confined to the small joints. The clinical picture is dominated by remarkable vascular fragility that leads to spontaneous rupture of blood vessel walls, often without preceding vascular dilatation or aneurysm formation. Other life-threatening complications include rupture of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, gravid uterus, or other internal organs, such as the liver or spleen. The calculated median survival for vEDS patients is 48 years.

### Effects of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients on the workflow and professional satisfaction of genetic counselors [^115CC7oL]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2024). Low credibility.

The experience of genetic counselors working with patients who have hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) often leads to emotional fatigue. One genetic counselor expressed feeling drained after such appointments, stating, "It's a lot to kind of be that empathetic provider and not take that home with you".

Another counselor described an ongoing feeling of being used as a therapist, leading to helplessness, burnout, and emotional detachment. "I started feeling pretty helpless on what I could offer and what I could do for them, and then that led to me kind of feeling just burnt out and then not really emotionally invested anymore. I started no longer caring when you hear the same story again and again".

Counselors also faced guilt over unmet patient expectations: "I always just feel bad or feel guilty going into the session thinking I'm not going to be able to give this person the tests that they want or the direction that they want or the specific treatment that they want. It's kind of difficult".

- **Neutral perspectives**: One participant expressed neutrality towards hEDS referrals, stating, "I don't feel like I gained anything and I don't feel like anything is taken away, but it is not necessarily something that excites me" (participant 7).

- **Systemic challenges**: Several participants felt discouraged by the healthcare system's dismissal of hEDS patients' needs. "I struggle with the fact that many clinics have completely shut the door to patients, including us, in terms of access to healthcare, equity, and making people feel like they have a partner in their healthcare" (participant 12).

### The management of adult patients with severe chronic small intestinal dysmotility [^111fMXEd]. Gut (2020). Low credibility.

Hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS) with its gastrointestinal associations is difficult to classify as most patients with EDS do not have a dysmotility of the small bowel, merely visceral hypersensitivity. Its symptoms may mimic dysmotility (neuropathy), and the presence of EDS can contribute to dysmotility, especially if postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) or other associated factors such as opiates are present.

According to the 2017 classification, patients previously diagnosed with joint hypermobility syndrome and Ehlers–Danlos syndrome hypermobility type were reclassified as hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (hEDS) if they met the strict criteria, or hypermobile spectrum disorders (HSD) if they had many but not all of the characteristics of hEDS. Patients with hEDS and HSD represent a third of patients referred to a tertiary neurogastroenterology clinic, and these patients tend to be young, female, with a poorer quality of life.

- **Associated gut disorders**: hEDS/HSD is associated with a range of gut disorders such as acid reflux, abdominal pain (especially typical is pain after eating or when any food arrives in the gut even from an enteral feed), and constipation.

- **Autonomic dysregulation**: There is often autonomic dysregulation, particularly PoTS, chronic urinary retention due to a failure of the urethral sphincter to relax (Fowler's syndrome), and hypoglycemia.

- **Mast cell activation disorder**: Mast cell activation disorder is being increasingly reported, most commonly in those having PoTS.

An increasing number of patients with joint hypermobility are being referred for related symptoms.

### A narrative review of the literature on illness uncertainty in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Implications for research and clinical practice [^117B6u1v]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). High credibility.

Themes were determined utilizing the data charting method outlined by Arksey and O'Malley, wherein data is synthesized and interpreted by sorting material according to key issues and themes. They encourage a narrative review utilizing a descriptive-analytical approach, characterized by applying a common analytic framework to all works reviewed to allow for the collection of standardized information in each study. To this end, data was collected from each reviewed manuscript on the broad domains of (1) sources or causes of illness uncertainty (IU) and (2) adverse impacts of IU. As pervasive themes within these broader domains became apparent, they were categorized further within these domains, and findings within said themes were summarized across studies. Based on these findings, relevance for clinical intervention and further research are discussed.

### Twenty-three-year-old patient with chronic pain and fainting spells — a clinical vignette [^112JwwMV]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2024). Low credibility.

Care for and clinical presentation of patients with connective tissue disorders, specifically hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, are poorly understood. Diagnosis can often take years, and comprehensive care can be difficult to coordinate for these patients. This vignette aims to show the clinical characteristics of a young female with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos, as well as the evaluation of her diagnostic presentation and subsequent treatment. The demographic data of this population are yet to be established, and as it can vary widely between individuals, it is important to recognize symptoms that distinguish this disorder from others with similar presentations. Education of physicians on this syndrome will allow earlier recognition of symptoms and lead to better outcomes for these patients overall.

### Col3a1 haploinsufficiency results in a variety of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV with delayed onset of complications and longer life expectancy [^116RCVEC]. Genetics in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

To characterize the clinical outcome of heterozygosity for COL3A1 null mutations in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV, the vascular type, we conducted a study.

- **Methods**: We identified mutations that produced premature termination codons and resulted in nonsense-mediated messenger RNA decay in 19 families. We reviewed the clinical and family histories and medical complications in 54 individuals from these families with COL3A1 null mutations.

- **Results**: Compared with individuals with missense or exon-skipping mutations, we found that life span was extended, the age of first complication was delayed by almost 15 years, and major complications were limited to vascular events. The families were ascertained following a complication in a single individual, but only 28% of relatives, some of whom had reached their seventies or eighties without incidents, had a complication, and only 30% showed minor clinical features of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV. Null mutations have reduced penetrance compared with missense and splicing mutations, and the phenotype seems to be limited almost entirely to vascular events.

### The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes [^113xMwSD]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2020). Low credibility.

The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a heterogeneous group of hereditary disorders of connective tissue. Common features include joint hypermobility, soft and hyperextensible skin, abnormal wound healing, and easy bruising. Fourteen different types of EDS are recognized, with the molecular cause known for 13 types. These types are caused by variants in 20 different genes, the majority of which encode the fibrillar collagen types I, III, and V; modifying or processing enzymes for those proteins; and enzymes that can modify glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans.

For the hypermobile type of EDS, the molecular underpinnings remain unknown. As connective tissue is ubiquitously distributed throughout the body, manifestations of the different types of EDS are present in virtually every organ system, to varying degrees. This can make these disorders particularly challenging to diagnose and manage.

Management consists of a care team responsible for the surveillance of major and organ-specific complications, such as arterial aneurysm and dissection, and integrated physical medicine and rehabilitation. No specific medical or genetic therapies are available for any type of EDS.

### Gastrointestinal disorders in joint hypermobility syndrome/Ehlers-Danlos syndrome hypermobility type: A review for the gastroenterologist [^111q6Ynv]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2017). Low credibility.

Joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS)/Ehlers-Danlos syndrome hypermobility type (EDS-HT) is the most common hereditary non-inflammatory disorder of connective tissue, characterized by a wide range of symptoms, mainly joint hyperextensibility and musculoskeletal symptoms. A majority of patients also experience gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Furthermore, JHS/EDS-HT has specifically been shown to be highly prevalent in patients with functional GI disorders, such as functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome.

The aim of this review was to examine the nature of GI symptoms and their underlying pathophysiology in JHS/EDS-HT. In addition, we consider the clinical implications of the diagnosis and treatment of JHS/EDS-HT for practicing clinicians in gastroenterology. Observations summarized in this review may furthermore represent the first step toward the identification of a new pathophysiological basis for a substantial subgroup of patients with functional GI disorders.

Patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) can have clinically heterogeneous manifestations. Red flags, such as vascular phenomena of haemothorax and hematomas, predict future risk of catastrophic vascular events.

Traditional risk factors, including smoking, hypertension, and family history, increase the cumulative risk of vascular phenomena in patients with EDS. Patient and family education on the early recognition of vascular and haemorrhagic complications is warranted for prompt medical management. Counseling for the avoidance of high-risk activities and contact sports is also recommended.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a rare connective tissue disorder that affects collagen metabolism, leading to skin hyperextensibility and joint hypermobility. Patients may also experience complications involving the cardiovascular system, such as aneurysms and mitral valve prolapse, as well as the gastrointestinal system, including hernias and gastrointestinal diverticulosis, and ocular defects. A proper history and examination are crucial for the early recognition of EDS signs and symptoms, as these patients may present with only delayed wound healing and abnormal scarring.

### Rare vascular complications in classical Ehlers-Danlos syndromes [^1165wceY]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of connective tissue disorders associated with abnormalities in the skin, ligaments, blood vessels, and organs. Skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, and widened atrophic scars are characteristic of classical EDS. Although vascular complications are rare in classical EDS, they can be life-threatening. This necessitates vigilance for vascular associations in non-vascular forms, such as classical EDS, due to the syndrome's heterogeneity. Reports of vascular complications in classical EDS are often limited to hematomas as the most frequent manifestation.

This case report discusses an elderly patient with genetically confirmed classical EDS who suffered from a series of pulmonary and vascular complications, including spontaneous haemopneumothorax, aortic dissection, and eventual mesenteric hemorrhage, which resulted in his death. Identifying clinical red flags is crucial to predict future catastrophic vascular events and guide appropriate counseling and management strategies for individuals with classical EDS.

Data extraction and aggregation were performed by a single investigator (S.D.). Uncertainties were resolved through discussion with the principal investigator (F.M.). The following data, if available, were extracted from the included references:

- **Study characteristics**: authors and year of publication.
- **Patient attributes**: patient and family identifiers, age at time of referral or vascular complication, and relevant comorbidities.
- **Vascular features**: type and location of vascular complication, recurrence, management, and cause of death.
- **Mutation**: relevant genetic mutations identified.

If a patient or family was described more than once, the most informative reference was used for data collection. The spectrum of vascular complications was further categorized into:

- **Hematomas**
- **Intracranial hemorrhages**
- **Arterial dissections**
- **Arterial aneurysms**
- **GI bleedings**
- **Perioperative hemorrhages**
- **Sporadic vascular complications**

Data collection on hematomas included only those that occurred spontaneously, from minor trauma, or were described as severe (e.g. "large", "massive", "repeated", "profuse"). Easy bruising was not included in this study because it is often described in a nondescriptive manner and overreported by both patients and caregivers. Including easy bruising would lead to an overrepresentation of vascular complications in nonvascular EDS. The primary outcome of these data-processing procedures was the derivation of the total number of nonvascular EDS-related complications.

### AGA clinical practice update on GI manifestations and autonomic or immune dysfunction in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Expert review [^1166FkDC]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, more specifically with respect to the evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms, the AGA 2025 guidelines recommend considering testing for mast cell disorders, including mast cell activation syndrome, in patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders and disorders of gut-brain interaction who present with episodic symptoms suggesting a generalized mast cell disorder involving two or more physiological systems. These tests should not be used for the routine evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms in all patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders without clinical or laboratory evidence of a primary or secondary mast cell disorder.

### A machine learning approach to stratify patients with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome/hypermobility spectrum disorders according to disorders of gut brain interaction, comorbidities and quality of life [^115g2w7v]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

There are existing reports of autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction in functional foregut disorders, including functional dyspepsia, chronic unexplained nausea and vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and IBS. Plausibly, our hEDS/HSD + FFD + IBS cluster is identifying a group of individuals who have autonomic dysfunction as the underlying pathophysiology. Therefore, treatment of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) and dysautonomia could have therapeutic potential for FFD and IBS, which should be explored in future studies. A potential therapeutic target for this overlapping cohort is pyridostigmine, which warrants investigation.

Pyridostigmine, a cholinesterase antagonist, has been reported to increase gastrointestinal motility, resulting in improvement in symptoms of chronic constipation, as well as increasing gastric contractions in autoimmune gastrointestinal dysmotility. Administration of pyridostigmine has also been associated with a reduction in orthostatic tachycardia symptoms; consequently, this could be explored in those with overlap hEDS/HSD + FFD + IBS and associated ANS dysfunction. This hypothesis should be rigorously tested in future clinical trials.

Evaluation of psychopathology in our study demonstrated that only those with FFD and IBS overlap had an increase in anxiety symptoms compared to hEDS/HSD alone. It is interesting that this group also experienced PoTS/autonomic symptoms. As described above, patients with PoTS can have increased sympathetic activity and parasympathetic withdrawal — a pattern of autonomic dysfunction also associated with anxiety disorders. Thus, it is feasible that anxiety in patients with these conditions is linked to autonomic dysfunction.

### Vascular phenotypes in nonvascular subtypes of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: A systematic review [^112mKR4A]. Genetics in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Vascular complications, including arterial aneurysms, ruptures, subcutaneous hematomas, gum bleeding, and prolonged perioperative and menstrual bleeding, have been described in nonvascular subtypes of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Most reports are anecdotal, and the occurrence of such complications in different EDS subtypes is not well documented. Due to the vast clinical and genetic heterogeneity of EDS, it may be difficult for clinicians to predict whether vascular complications should be considered and how patients should be monitored.

We reviewed the medical literature on EDS systematically to better document vascular complications in patients with a nonvascular EDS diagnosis confirmed via molecular testing. This review aims to familiarize clinicians with the spectrum of vascular complications in nonvascular EDS subtypes and guide follow-up management.

### High prevalence of gastrointestinal disorders in a large cohort of patients with joint hypermobility [^115Ds8SB]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

The gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations in children with hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome/joint hypermobility syndrome (hEDS/JHS) are not well described. We investigated the prevalence of GI disorders in children and young adults with hEDS/JHS through a single-center retrospective review. Demographic data, clinical history, symptoms, and diagnostic studies were reviewed. Of 435 patients with hEDS/JHS, 66% were females (age 5–28 years). We noted a high prevalence of constipation (61%), dysphagia (32%), dyspepsia and/or gastroparesis (25%), eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) (21%), and celiac disease (4%) in our cohort. Upper endoscopy and gastric emptying scans had the highest yield to detect abnormalities. Motility studies were abnormal in 31% of the 80 patients who underwent them. Dysphagia symptoms are significantly associated with EoE; 33% of dysphagia patients had EoE, compared to 16% of non-dysphagia patients (p < 0.001). Screening hEDS/JHS patients for GI issues should be routine, with further investigations and referrals guided by identified symptoms.

### AGA clinical practice update on GI manifestations and autonomic or immune dysfunction in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Expert review [^116P9WeC]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, especially concerning the evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms, the AGA 2025 guidelines recommend considering testing for celiac disease earlier in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders who report a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms, not just those with diarrhea. There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine testing for disaccharidase deficiencies or other diet-mediated mechanisms as causes of gastrointestinal symptoms in hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders.

### Colonoscopy is safe and not associated with higher pain scores in patients with hypermobility spectrum disorder: Results from an exploratory prospective study [^116GLBnX]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a non-inflammatory heritable connective tissue disorder resulting from defects in collagen structure, synthesis, or processing. Its manifestations frequently involve the cutaneous and musculoskeletal systems, such as skin laxity and joint hypermobility (JHM). The combined prevalence of all types of EDS appears to be at least 1 in 5000 individuals worldwide, but good quality epidemiological data are lacking. The hypermobility type (hEDS) is the most common (80–90%); type 4 (vascular EDS) accounts for 3–6% of all EDS and is considered the most serious because it is associated with vascular rupture.

A key defining feature of EDS is JHM, which refers to the characteristic of being able to move joints, actively and/or passively, beyond normal limits. JHM can vary in intensity as well as in location, ranging from localized hyperflexibility (i.e. involving fewer than five joints) to generalized JHM (G-JHM), in which at least five different joints are affected.

### Effects of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients on the workflow and professional satisfaction of genetic counselors [^1119TEZu]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2024). Low credibility.

- **Demographics**: We interviewed 15 individuals, all of whom were genetic counselors involved in the care of patients suspected to have hEDS. Most participants were currently involved in the care of this patient population, while fewer had experience with this population in the past but were no longer seeing these patients. The majority identified as female (n = 14, 93%) and white (n = 12, 80%). A plurality of participants had been practicing as genetic counselors for between one and five years (n = 7, 47%) and worked in multiple specialties of genetics (n = 8, 53%). Interviews averaged 30 minutes in length; the maximum length was 42 minutes and the minimum was 18 minutes. A total of 27 codes were identified based on the iterative review of participants' conversations, and four larger themes emerged across all interviews.

- **EDS referrals to genetics**
- **Prevalence of referrals**: In general, participants reported noticing an increase in referrals for EDS. When asked to estimate the number of patients being referred for this indication, the frequency varied notably. One genetic counselor reported that approximately half of her referrals are for EDS concerns, recounting that she saw "almost 200 patients with suspected EDS in 2021" (participant 5). Most participants reported that they saw referrals for EDS, particularly the hypermobile type (hEDS), on a weekly basis.

### Subjective health complaints and illness perception amongst adults with joint hypermobility syndrome/Ehlers-Danlos syndrome-hypermobility type - a cross-sectional study [^116RWLCM]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2019). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence and severity of subjective health complaints and to describe illness perception in a population with Joint Hypermobility Syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome-Hypermobile Type.

- **Method**: This study employed a postal survey that included a questionnaire battery on demographic data, subjective health complaint inventory, and illness perception. A total of 110 individuals diagnosed with either Joint Hypermobility Syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome-Hypermobile Type from two specialized hospitals in Norway were offered participation. Additionally, 140 gender- and age-matched healthy controls, representing the general population, were selected from Statistics Norway and sent the questionnaire for reference.

- **Results**: The overall response rate was 30.4% (n = 76), with 44.5% (n = 49) of respondents having Joint Hypermobility Syndrome/Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome-Hypermobile Type and 19.3% (n = 27) being controls. Subjective health complaints were significantly higher in the group with Joint Hypermobility Syndrome/Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome-Hypermobile Type than in the controls (32.06 vs. 11.08, p < 0.001). Further analysis using the brief illness perception questionnaire indicated that adults with these conditions had a low understanding of their illness and symptoms (understanding mean: 3.93, SD: 2.88) and reported moderate personal and treatment control over their illness.

- **Conclusion**: Adults with Joint Hypermobility Syndrome/Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome-Hypermobile Type reported a higher frequency and severity of subjective health complaints than the matched controls from the general adult population.

### AGA clinical practice update on GI manifestations and autonomic or immune dysfunction in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Expert review [^1162LRzY]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, specifically concerning the gastrointestinal symptoms, the AGA 2025 guidelines recommend aligning the management of chronic gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders. This applies to patients who do not exhibit symptoms consistent with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome or mast cell activation syndrome. The recommended approach aligns with existing management strategies for disorders of gut-brain interaction and gastrointestinal motility disorders in the general population.

Integrated multidisciplinary care involving multiple specialties, such as cardiology, rheumatology, dietetics, and psychology, should be included where appropriate.

### Effects of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients on the workflow and professional satisfaction of genetic counselors [^111LG4nk]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2024). Low credibility.

- **Setting expectations and psychosocial support**: In addition to education, participants reported specific strategies and skills they used with EDS patients. Common techniques included contracting — establishing the patient's understanding and goals for the appointment — setting expectations, and redirecting conversations with their patients. Most participants expressed that they use their psychosocial skills more with this patient population. To ensure the patient's expectations and needs are met, many participants stated that they prioritize contracting with every patient they see for hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS).

	- One participant noted, "I do a good amount of contracting at the beginning of sessions to just say, 'This is who I am, this is what I can do, this is what we typically see, I'm going to assess your risk for one of these connective tissue disorders, and if what I imagine is true, and that the risk is low, we can still do testing'. I do a lot of that because I don't like disappointing people".

	- Another participant emphasized the importance of contracting, as patients arrive with differing goals. "If someone just wants medical information and good referrals of the whole system, we can give them that. And if someone is just really looking for social support, I can do that" (participant 12).

	- Almost all participants discussed psychosocial counseling as their predominant role for hEDS patients. They provided support for their patients by listening, validating, and empathizing with their stories. Many stated that this part of their role is what differentiates them from other healthcare professionals who provide care for this patient population.

### The association between Ehlers-Danlos syndrome-hypermobility type and gastrointestinal symptoms in university students: A cross-sectional study [^113PpHzi]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2017). Low credibility.

Patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome-hypermobility type (EDS-HT) have an increased prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, particularly reflux and dyspepsia. EDS-HT is associated with dysautonomia, psychopathology, and chronic pain, which can contribute to GI symptoms. The association between GI symptoms and EDS-HT in a 'non-patient' population, as well as the effect of the aforementioned factors, has never been studied.

- **Methods**: In a cross-sectional study, a hypermobility questionnaire was used to screen university students; further clinical examination established the diagnosis of EDS-HT. Validated questionnaires assessed GI, somatic, pain, and autonomic symptoms, as well as psychopathology and quality of life (QOL). These factors were compared between students with and without EDS-HT, and logistic regression analysis examined the associations between EDS-HT, GI symptoms, and other variables.

- **Key results**: Of 1998 students screened, 162 were included: 74 EDS-HT (21.0 years, 53% female) vs. 88 Non-EDS-HT (21.5 years, 65% female). Compared to non-EDS-HT students, EDS-HT students were more likely to have multiple GI symptoms (41.9% vs. 27.3%, P = 0.05), particularly postprandial fullness (34.4% vs. 15.9%, P = 0.01) and early satiety (32% vs. 17%, P = 0.03). They also experienced greater autonomic symptoms. The association between EDS-HT and postprandial symptoms was dependent on autonomic factors but independent of pain and psychopathology. Pain-related QOL scores were reduced in the EDS-HT group (80 vs. 90, P = 0.03).

- **Conclusions and inferences**: The previously described findings indicate significant associations between EDS-HT and various GI symptoms mediated by autonomic factors. Further research is necessary to understand the underlying mechanisms.

### Functional gastrointestinal disorders are increased in joint hypermobility-related disorders with concomitant postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^112TjF91]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2020). High credibility.

Individuals with hypermobility spectrum disorders/hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (HSD/hEDS) frequently fulfill criteria for Rome IV functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is also commonly reported in HSD/hEDS and may impact on co-morbidity with and severity of FGIDs, although this remains to be studied. We determined the impact of concomitant POTS and HSD/hEDS on their association with Rome IV FGIDs.

- **Methods**: With the help of the charity organization Ehlers-Danlos Support UK, an online cross-sectional health survey was completed by individuals with HSD/hEDS. The survey enquired for (a) self-reported doctor diagnosis of POTS, chronic fatigue syndrome, and fibromyalgia, (b) the presence and symptom frequency of Rome IV FGIDs, and (c) anxiety and depression scores.

- **Key results**: Of 616 subjects with HSD/hEDS, 37.5% reported a doctor diagnosis of POTS. POTS-positive individuals were significantly younger than POTS-negative subjects (37 vs 40 years, P = 0.002), more likely to report chronic fatigue syndrome (44% vs 31%, P < 0.0001), and showed a trend toward increased prevalence of fibromyalgia (44% vs 37%, P = 0.06) and higher depression score (P = 0.07). POTS-positive subjects were also more likely to fulfill criteria for Rome IV FGIDs across various organ domains and experienced both upper and lower gastrointestinal symptoms significantly more frequently. The increased associations for FGIDs and GI symptom frequency remained unchanged in HSD/hEDS subjects with POTS following adjustments for age and chronic conditions.

### Classical-like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: A clinical description of 20 newly identified individuals with evidence of tissue fragility [^115pEi1f]. Genetics in Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Currently, 31 patients with classical-like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (clEDS) due to tenascin-X deficiency have been reported in the literature. We report on the clinical and molecular characteristics of 20 additional patients with clEDS to expand knowledge and to enable improved management of this rare genetic disorder.

- **Methods**: Patients diagnosed with clEDS by the national EDS service in the UK (n = 21) and abroad (n = 1) were asked for consent for publication of their clinical and molecular data.

- **Results**: Of 22 patients, 20 consented. All patients had typical features of clEDS: joint hypermobility, easy bruising, and skin hyperextensibility without atrophic scars. Importantly, 3 out of 20 patients experienced gastrointestinal complications consisting of small or large bowel ruptures, and one esophageal rupture. Other notable observations included two separate occurrences of spontaneous compartment syndrome, suspicion of nonaccidental injury due to significant bruising, and significant clinical variability regarding the debilitating effect of joint dislocations.

- **Conclusions**: We propose a predisposition to tissue fragility, particularly of the gastrointestinal tract, in patients with clEDS. As such, clinical and molecular confirmation of this diagnosis is essential. It is recommended to follow up these patients closely to understand the natural history and to develop better recommendations for management.

### Prevalence of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, autonomic and allergic manifestations in hospitalized patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: a case-control study [^115S1eVq]. Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Previous observations suggest an association between Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) and gastrointestinal (GI), cardiovascular, immune, and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. We sought to determine whether a hospital diagnosis of EDS is associated with a higher prevalence of these manifestations compared to hospitalized patients without EDS. We also evaluated hospital outcomes.

A total of 6,021 cases and matched controls were acquired from the 2016 National Inpatient Sample. In total, 2,007 EDS patients were identified via ICD-10 code. After bivariate analyses, multivariate logistic regression models were used to adjust for potential confounders.

GI conditions were found in 44% of EDS patients compared to 18% of controls [odds ratio (OR) = 3.57, 95% CI: 3.17, 4.02, P < 0.0001], with irritable bowel syndrome, gastroparesis, and coeliac disease strongly associated with EDS. Autonomic dysfunction, including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), neurocardiogenic syncope, and orthostatic hypotension was found in 20% of EDS patients versus 6% of controls (OR = 4.45, 95% CI: 3.71, 5.32, P < 0.0001). EDS patients were more likely to have food allergies (OR = 3.88, 95% CI: 2.65, 5.66, P < 0.0001) and cardiovascular complications such as mitral valve disorders, aortic aneurysm, and dysrhythmias (OR = 6.16, 95% CI: 4.60, 8.23, P < 0.0001). These conditions remained highly associated with EDS after considering confounders. EDS patients were 76% more likely to have longer than average hospitalizations (OR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.54, 2.02, P < 0.0001).

### The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes [^113dCzsV]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Ehlers-Danlos syndrome:

- **Definition**: EDS is a group of inherited connective tissue disorders characterized by hyperextensible skin, hypermobile joints, and tissue fragility.

- **Pathophysiology**: EDS results from defects in collagen synthesis or structure, leading to weakened connective tissues. Mutations in genes such as COL5A1, COL5A2, COL3A1, COL1A1, and COL1A2 are implicated in different subtypes, affecting the primary structure and later processing of type I, III, and V collagens.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of EDS is believed to be underestimated, ranging from 1 in 5,000 to 1 in 400,000, depending on the subtype.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for EDS include a family history of the disorder, as it may be inherited in some cases depending on the subtype. It may also be associated with other genetic disorders or rheumatological diseases.

- **Disease course**: The syndrome is classified into several subtypes based on clinical presentation and genetic mutations, with the most common being the hypermobile, classical, and vascular types. Common features include joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, easy bruising, and Marfanoid habitus. The vascular type is particularly severe, with risks of arterial rupture, organ rupture, and early mortality. Other complications can include chronic pain, joint dislocations, and early-onset osteoarthritis. Associated systemic findings include anxiety disorders, fatigue, orthostatic intolerance, functional gastrointestinal disorders, and pelvic and bladder dysfunction.

### Fulminant myocardial bleeding: Another clinical course of vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^114Lb9Hj]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

- **Learning points**: This is the first reported case of catastrophic clinical manifestations due to myocardial bleeding without coronary artery disease in a patient with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS). Skin elasticity may be the key for diagnosis, which can be identified during physical examination. Invasive examination should be performed with more consideration in the management of vEDS. This is a remarkable case in which vEDS is diagnosed in a patient with normal parents without gene mutation.
