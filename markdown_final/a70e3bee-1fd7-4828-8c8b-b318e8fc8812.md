## Question

Can fatty liver be linked to elevated LFTs

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether fatty liver (NAFLD/MASLD) can be linked to elevated liver function tests, and how to interpret and act on that link. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definitions and the disease spectrum. Then, I should verify how commonly LFTs are abnormal in fatty liver. Next, I will examine typical enzyme patterns and their limitations. After that, I should confirm what guidelines say about using LFTs for diagnosis and risk stratification. Then, I will consider when to image and when to use noninvasive fibrosis tools. Finally, I will outline practical management and follow-up steps and summarize the key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the disease framework so I don't jump to conclusions. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), now also termed metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), spans simple steatosis (fat without inflammation or fibrosis) to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which includes steatosis plus inflammation and may progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis; the diagnosis requires evidence of steatosis and exclusion of significant alcohol use and other etiologies, and patients are often asymptomatic.

> Now, I should verify the epidemiology and whether abnormal LFTs are expected. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of LFT abnormality prevalence. NAFLD/MASLD is common (about 25–30% of adults), but a substantial proportion have normal LFTs; studies and guidelines consistently note that roughly 70–80% of patients with NAFLD have ALT within the "normal" range, meaning normal LFTs do not exclude disease and abnormal LFTs are not universal in fatty liver [^116bPbMD] [^1128Ly2q] [^1149o1M4].

> I will now examine the typical enzyme pattern so I don't misattribute it. Classically, ALT exceeds AST in NAFLD, often mildly elevated, with bilirubin and albumin normal. As fibrosis advances, AST tends to rise relative to ALT and the AST:ALT ratio may approach or exceed 1, whereas an AST:ALT ratio > 1.5–2 is more suggestive of alcoholic liver disease. Importantly, severe transaminase elevations (> 3–5× ULN) should prompt reconsideration of alternate etiologies or superimposed injury, so I need to ensure the pattern fits before labeling it as NAFLD/MASLD [^116mi66H] [^1169AewF] [^112yo3Df].

> Hold on, I should verify how reliable LFTs are for detecting significant disease. AASLD and related guidance emphasize that aminotransferases can be normal even in patients with NASH and advanced fibrosis, and many labs use "too high" ALT upper limits of normal. As a practical rule, ALT above about 30 U/L in men and 19–25 U/L in women should be considered abnormal and may indicate chronic liver injury in the NAFLD/MASLD context, so I must not anchor on "normal" LFTs to exclude disease [^113nLMvo] [^116sVVD1] [^116GN7V6].

> Next, I should review how LFTs fit into diagnostic and risk-stratification algorithms so I don't overinterpret them. I need to check that current guidance does not recommend LFTs alone to diagnose or stage NAFLD; instead, after excluding other causes (alcohol, viral hepatitis, medications, hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency), clinicians should use noninvasive fibrosis tools such as FIB-4 and transient elastography/MRE to risk-stratify, because LFTs are neither sensitive nor specific for fibrosis stage and normal LFTs miss many with clinically significant fibrosis [^112TeHbB] [^113ghBaE] [^114oVp84].

> Let me think about imaging because I need to ensure appropriate confirmation. Initially, I was going to say ultrasound is first-line for everyone with suspected steatosis, but wait, I should verify the latest guidance; while ultrasound is commonly available and may show steatosis, AASLD notes low sensitivity and recommends CAP (on elastography) or MRI-PDFF/MRS for steatosis assessment when available, with ultrasound still reasonable in resource-limited settings or when imaging is incidentally available; biopsy is reserved for diagnostic uncertainty, atypical features, or persistent unexplained transaminase elevations despite workup [^116GN7V6] [^1113cBeP] [^114V6RrY].

> I should double-check pediatric nuances so I don't overgeneralize from adults. In children, proposed "normal" ALT cutoffs are lower (approximately ≤ 25 U/L for boys and ≤ 22 U/L for girls), and persistent ALT elevation should trigger evaluation. Even modestly elevated ALT in youth with obesity or metabolic risk warrants assessment and, if persistent, referral, because ALT sensitivity is limited and many children with steatosis have normal enzymes [^112UbcFu] [^114prLhm] [^112KJXaG].

> Next, I should review the practical evaluation steps to avoid missing other diseases. The workup should include a careful history (alcohol, medications, supplements, metabolic risk), exam for insulin resistance, and targeted labs to exclude other etiologies. When fatty liver is suspected, calculate FIB-4 to triage risk, and if FIB-4 is indeterminate or high, proceed to elastography or ELF and consider hepatology referral for biopsy when results are discordant or when diagnosis remains uncertain. Importantly, normal LFTs should not defer appropriate risk assessment in high-risk patients [^113ghBaE] [^111LwEQf] [^113z2Ems].

> Let me consider management and follow-up so I can close the loop. Regardless of current LFT values, the cornerstone is lifestyle therapy targeting weight loss (about 3–5% improves steatosis, 7–10% improves NASH and fibrosis), exercise, and cardiometabolic risk control; vitamin E or pioglitazone may be considered in selected adults with biopsy-proven NASH and no contraindications, while monitoring LFTs and noninvasive fibrosis markers over time; if cirrhosis is suspected, initiate cirrhosis-specific care including HCC and variceal screening [^116HUNgv] [^111wQU4N] [^115uMjg5].

> In summary, I need to ensure I state this clearly and precisely. Yes, fatty liver disease can be linked to elevated LFTs, but the association is variable. Many patients with NAFLD/MASLD have normal LFTs, and even mild elevations are nonspecific and poorly predictive of fibrosis, so LFTs are useful for case finding but insufficient for diagnosis or staging. The safest, guideline-concordant approach is to exclude other causes, assess metabolic risk, and deploy noninvasive fibrosis assessment to identify patients at risk of progressive disease, recognizing that normal LFTs do not rule out clinically significant liver injury [^116bPbMD] [^113nLMvo] [^116HUNgv].

---

Fatty liver disease (NAFLD/MASLD) is the **most common cause of mildly elevated LFTs** in adults, with ALT and AST typically 1–2× the upper limit of normal and ALT > AST [^116mi66H] [^116HUNgv]. However, up to 80% of patients have normal LFTs, so normal results **do not exclude disease** [^116HUNgv] [^116bPbMD]. Persistent ALT > 30 U/L in men or > 19 U/L in women warrants evaluation for NAFLD/MASLD and other causes; LFTs alone cannot distinguish simple steatosis from NASH or fibrosis, so use noninvasive fibrosis scores (FIB-4, NFS) and elastography to risk-stratify and guide management [^113nLMvo] [^116HUNgv] [^114oVp84].

---

## Liver function tests in fatty liver disease

LFTs commonly show **mild ALT/AST elevations** in NAFLD/MASLD, typically 1–2× ULN, with ALT > AST and rare values > 300 U/L [^116mi66H]. Up to 80% of patients, however, have normal LFTs, so normal results **do not exclude disease** [^116HUNgv] [^116bPbMD].

---

## Clinical significance of elevated LFTs in fatty liver disease

Persistent ALT elevation signals ongoing hepatocyte injury and a higher risk of NASH and fibrosis, whereas normal LFTs can accompany advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, so **normal LFTs do not exclude significant disease** [^113nLMvo] [^111Kcogb]. ALT correlates poorly with histologic severity; thus, **ALT alone cannot stage disease** [^116bPbMD].

---

## Differentiating fatty liver disease from other causes of elevated LFTs

The differential includes alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, and metabolic disorders; ALT/AST patterns and the **AST:ALT ratio** help distinguish these entities:

| **Condition** | **Typical alt/ast pattern** | **Ast:alt ratio** |
|-|-|-|
| NAFLD/MASLD | Mild elevation (1–2× ULN); ALT > AST | < 1 |
| Alcoholic liver disease | AST > ALT | > 1.5 |
| Viral hepatitis | Variable; often > 2× ULN | Variable |
| Autoimmune hepatitis | Variable; often > 2× ULN | Variable |
| Drug-induced liver injury | Variable | Variable |

---

An AST:ALT ratio > 1.5 suggests alcoholic liver disease; in NAFLD/MASLD the ratio is typically **< 1** [^111ipmZU] [^113gb4M7].

---

## Non-invasive tests for assessing liver injury in fatty liver disease

Because LFTs are nonspecific, **noninvasive fibrosis assessment** is recommended:

- **FIB-4 and NFS**: First-line blood-based scores to stratify fibrosis risk [^113z2Ems] [^113ghBaE].
- **Transient elastography (FibroScan)**: Assesses fibrosis and steatosis noninvasively [^113z2Ems] [^1113cBeP].
- **MRI-PDFF**: Quantifies hepatic fat and detects steatosis accurately [^116GN7V6] [^1113cBeP].

---

## Clinical guidelines for monitoring and managing elevated LFTs in fatty liver disease

Guidelines recommend a **stepwise approach**:

- **Confirm persistence**: Repeat LFTs after 3–6 months to confirm chronicity [^notfound].
- **Exclude other causes**: Screen for alcohol, viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson disease, and drug-induced liver injury [^117MpALN].
- **Risk stratification**: Use FIB-4/NFS and elastography to assess fibrosis risk [^114oVp84] [^1125vBTC].
- **Lifestyle interventions**: Weight loss, dietary modification, and exercise are first-line therapy [^116HUNgv] [^113VC52i].
- **Pharmacotherapy**: Consider vitamin E or pioglitazone for biopsy-proven NASH; GLP-1 agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors may be considered in selected patients [^116HUNgv] [^112nTVy8].

---

## Prognostic implications of elevated LFTs in fatty liver disease

Persistent ALT elevation is associated with higher risks of NASH, fibrosis progression, and cardiovascular mortality; however, normal LFTs can occur in advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, so **risk stratification should not rely on LFTs alone** [^111Kcogb] [^116GN7V6] [^116bPbMD].

---

Fatty liver disease is the **most common cause of mildly elevated LFTs**, but normal LFTs are common and do not exclude disease. Persistent ALT elevation signals higher risk of NASH and fibrosis, so use noninvasive fibrosis scores and elastography to guide management and surveillance [^116HUNgv] [^114oVp84].

Context —

Fatty liver disease is now one of the most commonly encountered entities in the practice of liver pathology. Distinguishing simple steatosis from steatohepatitis is critical because the latter requires follow-up because of long-term risks that include cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. An organized approach for evaluating liver biopsies with steatosis is recommended to capture all of the relevant features: (1) degree of steatosis, (2) presence or absence of ballooning degeneration, (3) lobular inflammation, and (4) fibrosis. Herein, we provide a stepwise approach that readers can use to evaluate liver biopsies with steatosis, including examples, pitfalls, differential diagnostic considerations, and suggested diagnostic phrasing.

Objective —

To provide a stepwise approach for the evaluation of liver biopsies showing significant steatosis (involving ≥ 5% of liver parenchyma).

Data Sources —

Biopsies demonstrating fatty liver disease encountered in our daily practice were examined as well as recent literature.

Conclusions —

Effective evaluation of liver biopsies with steatosis requires careful histologic examination and correlation with clinical history, particularly regarding medications, nutrition status, and alcohol use. Examples of uniform reporting, including appropriate use of the nonalcoholic steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network Activity Score, are provided.

Introduction — Definition, diagnosis and clinical staging of NAFLD

Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the liver disease epidemic of the 21st century, since prevalence rates range between 23% and 32% depending on the geographical region with numbers predicted to rise further globally. The term NAFLD itself summarizes a broad disease spectrum: non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), which is characterized by simple steatosis but absent inflammation or hepatocyte ballooning, represents the mildest manifestation. Non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), however, is characterized by not only steatosis of the liver but also inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning, and is a more severe presentation of the disease spectrum which may lead to advanced fibrosis or even cirrhosis. In approximately 5% of patients with NAFLD complications of cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma may occur during long‐term follow‐up. Of note, however, most patients with non‐advanced NAFLD (i.e. Fibrosis Stage 0–2) primarily show extrahepatic events during follow‐up and the predominant cause of death in these patients derives from cardiovascular disease rather than from liver‐related events. Apart from the importance of distinguishing between a diagnosis of NAFL or NASH and grading of disease activity, presence and stage of fibrosis need to be determined in every patient since it has been shown that prognosis is mostly influenced by the grade of fibrosis rather than presence/absence of NASH.

Suspicion of NAFLD should be raised in patients presenting with either elevated liver enzymes (i.e. liver transaminases and/or gamma‐glutamyltransferase) or those who show hepatic steatosis on abdominal ultrasound. Most importantly before diagnosing NAFLD the most common other etiologies of chronic liver disease (i.e. hepatitis, autoimmune, hereditary or cholestatic) and especially relevant alcohol consumption (≥ 30 g/day in men, ≥ 20 g/day in women) should be excluded. Typically, patients presenting with one‐ or more components of the metabolic syndrome are at high risk for developing NAFLD and hepatic steatosis on imaging and/or elevated liver enzymes should raise the suspicion for NAFLD.

A wide spectrum of non‐invasive diagnostic methods have been developed and clinically tested over the last years, the most important‐ and tested ones being vibration‐controlled transient elastography (VCTE) and non‐invasive fibrosis tests (i.e. NAFLD Fibrosis Score or FIB‐4 Score). However, non‐invasive diagnostic algorithms and risk stratification for NAFLD are out of the scope of this article but have been reviewed elsewhere.

Presence of lifestyle risk factors associated with the development of NAFLD: obesity/type 2 diabetes

Commonly, the question about non-alcoholic fatty liver arises in response to the incidental observation of abnormal liver blood tests or an echobright liver on an ultrasound scan (USS). Case finding or screening to identify patients with NAFLD remains controversial, with conflicting advice from Americanand Europeanguidelines. Indeed recent NICE guidance does not advocate this at present, although the advent of new diagnostics and treatments allied with cost-effectiveness analyses may affect this in the future.

Research Recommendation 1: Further evidence is required to establish the cost-effectiveness of case finding for NAFLD in high-risk groups before it can be recommended. (level 5, grade D)

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117MpALN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT has been associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33IU/l for males, 19 to 25IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C, assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be undertaken. Total bilirubin elevation can occur in either cholestatic or hepatocellular diseases. Elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### Are simple noninvasive scoring systems for fibrosis reliable in patients with NAFLD and normal ALT levels? [^115yovUs]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common and many affected individuals have normal-range alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. There is a need for a robust screening tool to triage individuals with advanced fibrosis for specialist care.

Aim

The aim of this study was to assess the performance of noninvasive fibrosis tests in patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and normal levels of ALT.

Methods

Patients presenting at a fatty liver clinic between 1999 and 2009 were included in the study. Liver biopsies were assessed using the Kleiner score. The aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/ALT ratio, BARD, FIB-4 and NAFLD fibrosis scores were calculated.

Results

A total of 305 patients were included [70 with normal ALT levels (women: ALT ≤ 30 IU/l, men: ALT ≤ 45 IU/l) and 235 with elevated levels]. In total, 24% of patients with normal ALT levels and 17% of those with elevated ALT levels had advanced fibrosis (Kleiner stage 3–4). The FIB-4 performed best in identifying advanced fibrosis in patients with normal ALT (area under receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.86, 82% sensitivity, 77% specificity and 92% negative predictive value). The sensitivity of the AST/ALT ratio and BARD and NAFLD fibrosis scores for advanced fibrosis was good in patients with normal ALT levels (94, 94 and 82%, respectively), but the specificity was low (44, 26 and 51%, respectively). The FIB-4 yielded best results in patients with elevated ALT levels. Using the FIB-4, 61% of patients with normal ALT levels and 63% of those with elevated ALT levels could avoid liver biopsy to exclude advanced fibrosis. In contrast, AST/ALT ratio and BARD and NAFLD scores would have led to a high proportion of patients with mild disease having to undergo a biopsy.

Conclusion

The FIB-4 yielded good results in patients with normal or elevated ALT levels, reliably excluding advanced fibrosis and reducing the need for liver biopsy.

Evaluation of persistently elevated ALT in children — For children with persistently elevated ALT, perform a comprehensive evaluation to identify the underlying cause. Refer to Table 1 for detailed guidance on necessary tests, including viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), and cardiometabolic disorders. Review all current and recent medications that may cause liver injury or contribute to hepatic steatosis. In adolescents aged 12 years and older, screen for substance use, including alcohol and recreational drugs, which can elevate ALT or contribute to steatosis, using validated questionnaires for youth. Consider inborn errors of metabolism if there are atypical signs or symptoms, such as early onset (particularly before 3 y of age), rapidly progressive or acute disease, absence of overweight/obesity, or additional involvement of other organ systems, particularly neurological signs or symptoms.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: diagnosis and management [^115Q7x8g]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is characterized by excessive fat accumulation in the liver (hepatic steatosis). Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is characterized by steatosis, liver cell injury, and inflammation. The mechanism of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is unknown but involves the development of insulin resistance, steatosis, inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with physical inactivity, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Screening is not recommended in the general population. The diagnosis is usually made after an incidental discovery of unexplained elevation of liver enzyme levels or when steatosis is noted on imaging (e.g., ultrasonography). Patients are often asymptomatic and the physical examination is often unremarkable. No single laboratory test is diagnostic, but tests of liver function, tests for metabolic syndrome, and tests to exclude other causes of abnormal liver enzyme levels are routinely performed. Imaging studies, such as ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, can assess hepatic fat, measure liver and spleen size, and exclude other diseases. Liver biopsy remains the criterion standard for the diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Noninvasive tests are available and may reduce the need for liver biopsy. A healthy diet, weight loss, and exercise are first-line therapeutic measures to reduce insulin resistance. There is insufficient evidence to support bariatric surgery, metformin, thiazolidinediones, bile acids, or antioxidant supplements for the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The long-term prognosis is not associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, cancer, or liver disease.

The model of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is part of the broad spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases, which also includes steatosis. The distinction between fatty liver and steatohepatitis only can be made by examination of liver histology, which allows the assessment of inflammatory infiltrate, cellular degeneration, and necrosis and fibrosis, and cannot be made on the basis of clinical or laboratory parameters. Despite the weak correlation between liver function tests and the severity of liver disease, epidemiological studies have shown that transaminases, and, in particular, elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), even if in the normal range, predict new-onset type 2 diabetes independent of classic risk factors, metabolic syndrome, and C-reactive protein. The authors postulated that elevated intrahepatic fat (IHF) content played a central role in liver damage and glucose intolerance. Fatty liver is the most common hepatic disorder characterized by triglyceride accumulation within hepatocytes. Although simple fatty liver is thought to be a benign condition, it is characterized by multiple metabolic abnormalities in organs and tissues that are responsive to insulin. Impaired insulin-mediated inhibition of hepatic glucose production, reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, and decreased inhibition of lipolysis by insulin has been documented in patients with fatty liver disease. Whether the accumulation of fat in the liver is the primary event leading to hepatic and subsequently peripheral (muscle and adipose tissue) insulin resistance is not clear because of the lack of longitudinal data. In support of primacy of the liver, treatment of type 2 diabetic patients with a hypocaloric very-low-fat diet resulted in an 81% reduction in IHF content in association with reductions in both basal and insulin-suppressed hepatic glucose production and a decrease in FPG concentration. However, there was no significant improvement in insulin-stimulated peripheral glucose disposal. Also, in insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients, the IHF content was closely correlated with the insulin dose and the sensitivity of endogenous (hepatic) glucose production to insulin and best explained the interindividual variation in insulin requirements. Moreover, when the relationship between peripheral glucose metabolism and fatty liver were explored in healthy nondiabetic humans, the correlation between the IHF content and peripheral insulin resistance was much stronger than the correlation with intramyocellular lipid content, visceral fat content, or subcutaneous fat content. Stefan et al. recently reported that in the model of the metabolically fit, but obese individuals, preserved insulin sensitivity was more strongly associated with lower IHF content than with other parameters of body adiposity, including intramyocellular lipid content, concluding that ectopic fat in the liver may be more important than visceral fat in the determination of such a beneficial phenotype in obesity. Similar conclusions were also reported in individuals with overt type 2 diabetes. In the same line of evidence, we observed that in obese adolescents with fatty liver, there was a greater severity of whole-body insulin resistance compared with that of BMI-matched insulin-resistant obese adolescents with normal IHF content.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: common questions and answers on diagnosis and management [^116HUNgv]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common form of liver disease in the United States, affecting up to 30% of adults. There are two forms of NAFLD: nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), defined as 5% or greater hepatic steatosis without hepatocellular injury or fibrosis, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), defined as 5% or greater hepatic steatosis plus hepatocellular injury and inflammation, with or without fibrosis. Individuals with obesity are at highest risk of NAFLD. Other established risk factors include metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although NAFLD is common and typically asymptomatic, screening is not currently recommended, even in high-risk patients. NAFLD should be suspected in patients with elevated liver enzymes or hepatic steatosis on abdominal imaging that are found incidentally. Once other causes, such as excessive alcohol use and hepatotoxic medications, are excluded in these patients, risk scores or elastography tests can be used to identify those who are likely to have fibrosis that will progress to cirrhosis. Liver biopsy should be considered for patients at increased risk of fibrosis and when other liver disorders cannot be excluded with noninvasive tests. Weight loss through diet and exercise is the primary treatment for NAFLD. Other treatments, such as bariatric surgery, vitamin E supplements, and pharmacologic therapy with thiazolidinediones or glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues, have shown potential benefit; however, data are limited, and these therapies are not considered routine treatments. NAFL typically follows an indolent course, whereas patients with NASH are at higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease, cancer, and end-stage liver disease.

### Implication of normal liver enzymes in liver disease [^115UN9Jy]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic liver disease is usually asymptomatic until its late stages and also significant hepatic necroinflammation and fibrosis may be present in persistently normal ALT levels HBV, HCV carriers or similarly, in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Given the large number of persons in the general population which may harbor a clinically significant liver disease behind the screen of normal alanine aminotransferase, more attention should be devoted to future research for alternative noninvasive markers of liver damage.

Transaminase interpretation — limitations and thresholds are noted: Serum AST levels are often used clinically but can be normal in patients with diabetes, NASH, and advanced hepatic fibrosis; although AST levels are neither sensitive nor specific for identifying NAFLD/NASH with advanced fibrosis, intermittently or chronically (≥ 6–12 mo) elevated ALT or AST above a threshold of 30 U/L may suggest the presence of chronic liver injury, with these thresholds exceeding many laboratory upper reference ranges.

### Management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a 60-year-old man with probable nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: weight reduction, liver biopsy, or both? [^111wQU4N]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common hepatic disorders in the United States, but uncertainty remains as to the optimal way to manage it. Using the case of Mr T, a 60-year-old man with obesity, diabetes mellitus, and increased serum transaminase levels, an evidence-based approach to diagnosis and treatment is discussed. Diagnosis of NAFLD is based on patient clinical profile and risk factors for metabolic syndrome, the exclusion of other liver diseases, radiologic imaging and sometimes biopsy. At this point in Mr T's disease, the most important step is differentiation between simple steatosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Simple steatosis has a benign natural history, but NASH is progressive and may lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. An evidence-based approach to treatment is limited by lack of large randomized trials, particularly of combinations of therapies, but weight loss, exercise, and medical therapies targeted at the mechanism of liver injury in NASH are recommended. Improved noninvasive diagnostic tests, a clearer understanding of the natural history of NAFLD, and large, well-designed clinical trials are needed.

### Prevalence, demographic characteristics and clinical profile of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease among adult patients attending tertiary hospitals in dodoma, tanzania. a cross-sectional study [^115vQPmS]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

The varying prevalence of MAFLD across different populations is influenced by a complex interplay of environmental, socioeconomic, and genetic factors. Geographic factors, such as climate and disease burden, may further contribute to these disparities".

"The clinical profile of MAFLD patients in this study revealed a spectrum of fibrosis stages, ranging from mild to advanced. Among patients diagnosed with MAFLD, 23% presented with mild fibrosis, 7% with moderate fibrosis, and 15% with advanced fibrosis. These findings align with previous observational studies by Sangro et al. and Sumida et al. which reported significant fibrosis among MAFLD patients using the fibrosis-4 score (FIB-4), his suggests that a substantial proportion of individuals with MAFLD have advanced liver disease, potentially leading to severe complications.

Elevated liver enzymes, specifically alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), are commonly used as indicators of liver injury. Our study demonstrated a significant association between elevated liver enzyme levels and metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). This observation is consistent with findings from Wen et al. who also reported significantly elevated AST and ALT levels in the MAFLD group compared to controls. Similarly, another study found that MAFLD patients exhibited higher ALT and AST levels than their non-MAFLD counterparts, further supporting this positive association. The link between MAFLD and elevated liver enzymes underscores the importance of routine liver function tests for the early detection and ongoing monitoring of this disease.

Furthermore, a study involving 73,566 individuals in Beijing reported a strong association between dyslipidemia and MAFLD. Notably, lean/normal-weight MAFLD patients in that cohort had a higher prevalence of hypertension and diabetes, along with a greater degree of hepatic steatosis and deranged liver function enzyme parameters.

While some prior research has indicated a higher prevalence of MAFLD in specific age groups and genders, our analysis did not reveal significant differences based on these demographic factors. This may be attributable to the relatively heterogeneous population and sample size of our study. However, other demographic characteristics exhibited significant associations with MAFLD. Specifically, individuals with higher BMI, a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, a self-reported history of alcohol consumption, a history of smoking, and a lack of regular exercise were significantly more likely to have MAFLD.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^114ZWqSb]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a common condition associated with metabolic syndrome. It is the most common cause of elevated liver enzymes in U.S. adults, and is diagnosed after ruling out other causes of steatosis (fatty infiltration of liver), particularly infectious hepatitis and alcohol abuse. Liver biopsy may be considered if greater diagnostic and prognostic certainty is desired, particularly in patients with diabetes, patients who are morbidly obese, and in patients with an aspartate transaminase to alanine transaminase ratio greater than one, because these patients are at risk of having more advanced disease. Weight loss is the primary treatment for obese patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Medications used to treat insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and obesity have been shown to improve transaminase levels, steatosis, and histologic findings. However, no treatments have been shown to affect patient-oriented outcomes.

In persons with type 1 diabetes (T1D), clinicians may consider FIB-4 screening only if risk factors are present — obesity, features of metabolic syndrome (MetS), elevated plasma aminotransferase levels (> 30 U/L), or hepatic steatosis on imaging — graded C with Intermediate/Weak Strength of Evidence and BEL 2, downgraded for heterogeneity and moderate to high bias. Clinicians should further risk stratify persons with T2D or T1D with cardiometabolic risk factors and/or elevated aminotransferases (> 30 U/L) using the FIB-4, elastography, and/or ELF test (Grade B; High/Intermediate Strength of Evidence; BEL 2).

Liver blood tests

Liver blood tests, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), are frequently tested as part of routine clinical investigation in primary care. Whilst unexplained persistently abnormal liver blood tests should always be investigated, normal liver blood tests do not exclude NAFLD or significant fibrosis. In a study of 223 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD, ALT more than two times the upper limit of normal (> 70 IU/L) had a sensitivity of just 50% and specificity of 61% for NASH, and sensitivity 40% and specificity 58% for advanced fibrosis. Moreover, the serum ALT level typically falls as liver fibrosis progresses and patients with cirrhosis frequently have a normal range ALT level. Therefore, do not rely on abnormal liver blood tests to prompt consideration of liver disease. However, persistently unexplained abnormal liver blood tests should always be investigated. (Recommendation 3, Table 1)

Patients with abnormal liver blood tests should be evaluated in line with national recommendations, with a focussed history eliciting risk factors for chronic liver disease including unhealthy alcohol consumption, the presence of metabolic risk factors and a detailed drug history. Automated systems, such as intelligent liver function tests (iLFT), can streamline the investigation of abnormal liver blood tests giving a full panel of results, suggested diagnosis and advice for further management. This approach increases the diagnosis of liver disease and is highly cost effective.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has a rapidly rising prevalence worldwide and is the most common cause of liver disease in developed countries. In this article, we discuss the spectrum of disease of NAFLD with a focus on the earlier spectrum of the disease that is commonly encountered by non-specialists, as well as the hepatic and extra-hepatic associations of the disease. We discuss in detail the two common presentations of NAFLD, incidentally detected hepatic steatosis and asymptomatic raised liver enzymes, and provide an algorithm for management and continued to follow up for these patients. Considerations for the management of cardiovascular comorbidities in these patients are also discussed. Finally, we cover the topic of screening for NAFLD in high-risk populations.

### Diagnosis of fatty liver disease: is biopsy necessary? [^115ccwNS]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is increasingly being recognized as an important and common condition, affecting approximately 20% of the general population. Although liver biopsy is currently the gold standard for diagnosis, there is a need for less invasive methods. Imaging by ultrasound, computerized tomography and magnetic resonance are all able to demonstrate fat. In this paper, these three imaging techniques are critically assessed. Ultrasound, although probably not the most reliable imaging method, has many advantages and, when positive, gives a high degree of certainty of the diagnosis depending on the prevalence of fatty liver in the population being studied. Unlike liver biopsy, none of these techniques is able to differentiate simple steatosis from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

### Hypertension and fatty liver: guilty by association? [^114pJhio]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Essential hypertension is associated with the metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance and the development of fatty liver. Fatty liver disease is a spectrum of liver diseases ranging from simple hepatic steatosis through steato-hepatitis to cirrhosis and hepatoma. The purpose of this review is to discuss the evidence for an association between essential hypertension and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and to consider the diagnosis and management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. We conclude that it is important to consider the diagnosis of fatty liver disease in hypertensive patients, to measure the liver function tests at diagnosis and not to ignore minor elevations of serum aminotransferases. Hypertensive patients with raised liver enzymes should be referred for further assessment, particularly if risk factors for progressive liver disease, such as obesity and diabetes, are present.

Introduction

While the number of deaths from other common conditions is falling in the UK, those due to liver disease have been increasing dramatically, with a 400% increase in the standardised mortality rate over the period 1970–2010. Notably, for those patients younger than 65, the rise in standardised mortality rate for liver disease is > 500%, such that it now constitutes the fifth biggest cause of premature mortalitywith 64 000 years of working life lost every year. For morbidity, in England and Wales, 57 682 hospital admissions and 10 948 deaths were due to liver disease in 20 12. This rising burden of liver disease is mainly a reflection of the three the most common causes: alcohol-related liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and viral hepatitis, although autoimmune liver disease is also a significant contributor. The burden of liver disease in children differs from that in adults, as although non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is seen in all ages, reflecting the rise in childhood obesity, disease associated with injecting drug use and alcohol are rarely encountered. However, viral hepatitis is seen as a consequence of perinatal transmission, and its chronicity contributes to the disease burden seen in adults. Other causes of liver disease, such as biliary atresia or metabolic disorders, present almost exclusively in infancy or childhood, but progressive liver disease continues to evolve throughout childhood and into adulthood. There are concerted efforts to deal with this rising tide of liver disease such as the Lancet Commission on Liver Disease, the Alcohol Health Alliance and the Obesity Health Alliance.

Liver disease develops silently; there may be no signs or symptoms until the complications of liver failure or portal hypertension develop. At this late, often pre-terminal stage, the tests of liver function — bilirubin, albumin, international normalised ratio (INR) and platelet count — may be abnormal. In necro-inflammatory hepatitic diseases liver enzymes are frequently elevated, whereas in apoptotic diseases including fatty liver disease (alcohol and non-alcohol related), liver enzymes may be normal or elevated, but the degree of abnormality is not related to the stage of progression from simple fatty liver, through progressive fibrosis to cirrhosis. Since the current liver blood tests were developed in the 1950s, they have been the mainstay of liver disease identification, with the result that many patients with liver disease are not identified until they have developed significant liver fibrosis.

### Metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease increases risk of severe COVID-19 [^1173nrN5]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Liver involvement is common in COVID-19. Elevated aspartate and alanine amino transaminase (AST/ALT) and borderline increase in serum bilirubin and serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are the commonest findings. Patients with associated co morbid conditions like obesity, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, malignancy, hypertension and old age are prone to develop severe disease. Limited data is available in patients with COVID-19 and metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). The aim of this review is to analyse the effect of MAFLD on severity of COVID-19.

Methods

We systematically searched the PubMed database till May 20, 2020 and retrieved all the articles published on COVID-19 and fatty liver/MAFLD/NAFLD.

Results

Limited studies done had shown four to six fold high risk of severe COVID-19 in patients with MAFLD. Patients with MAFLD and associated obesity, severe fibrosis and age < 60 yrs are more prone to develop severe COVID-19.

Conclusion

MAFLD is associated with 4–6 fold increase in severity of COVID-19 compared to non MAFLD patients. Physician and hepatologist should follow these patients cautiously and preventive measures to be taken strictly in these high risk patients.

Diagnosis and staging of NAFLD/NASH

Clinical features and blood tests

A diagnosis of NAFLD requires that there is evidence of hepatic steatosis on imaging or histology, and other causes of liver disease or steatosis have been excluded.NAFLD is usually asymptomatic, so diagnosis usually follows the incidental finding of abnormal liver enzymes or steatosis on imaging. If abnormal LFTs are present, this is usually mildly raised transaminases (ALT > aspartate transaminase (AST)) and/or gamma-glutamyltransferase. However, ∼80% of patients have normal-range ALT levels (males < 40 IU/L and females < 31 IU/L), and even if elevated, the ALT typically falls (and AST may rise) as fibrosis progresses to cirrhosis. ALT values do not correlate with histological findings and are unhelpful in both the diagnosis of NAFLD and determining disease severity. Clinicians overly rely on abnormal liver enzymes to identify patients with NAFLD, so patients with significant liver disease can be overlooked, potentially missing opportunities for intervention. It has been repeatedly shown that 70–80% of subjects with central obesity and 50–80% of patients with type 2 diabetes have evidence of NAFLD on imaging. Therefore, a new approach is needed to use metabolic risk factors to identify subjects with NAFLD/NASH rather than relying on liver enzyme abnormalities.

In patients with abnormal LFTs, alternative causes of liver disease (or cofactors) should be excluded, including alcohol excess, drug-induced liver injury, viral hepatitis, autoimmune liver disease, haemochromatosis, coeliac disease and Wilson's disease (in patients < 45 years old). Autoantibodies are also frequently detected at a low titre in subjects with NAFLD (antinuclear antibody (ANA) ≥ 1:160 and/or antismooth muscle antibody (ASMA) ≥ 1:40) and are usually associated with normal IgG levels and do not generally indicate autoimmune hepatitis. Raised ferritin levels are common in NAFLD and usually reflect underlying inflammatory activity or insulin resistance. A transferrin saturation < 45% rules out haemochromatosis. If there is uncertainty about the diagnosis of NAFLD, then a liver biopsy should be considered.

Introduction

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an increasingly common chronic liver disease characterised by significant lipid deposition in the hepatocytes of the liver parenchyma and persistent abnormalities in liver enzymes. The spectrum of NAFLD is a continuum ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and finally cirrhosis.NAFLD is recognised as the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, which includes obesity, dyslipidaemia, hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Obesity, in particular, is often associated with NAFLD, as the degree of steatosis was found to be correlated with body mass index (BMI).

The World Gastroenterology Organisation recommends a hierarchical resource-sensitive approach to the diagnosis of NAFLD. Even though liver biopsy remains the gold standard, it is impractical as a diagnostic tool because it is invasive and expensive. Thus, non-invasive and more affordable tools, based on a biological approach (such as serum biomarkers and liver enzymes), have been proposed for the diagnosis and staging of NAFLD. Indeed, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) have been shown to be useful surrogate measures of NAFLD.

As a result of increasing rates of obesity worldwide, NAFLD is currently the most common cause of abnormal results of liver function tests. The usual observed biochemical pattern in hepatic steatosis due to NAFLD is of increased levels of transaminases, with ALT levels exceeding those of AST. However, with the progression of hepatic steatosis to NASH and associated hepatic fibrosis, AST levels increase with a resultant rise in the AST to ALT ratio.GGT levels may also be modestly increased. At the same time, however, it has been shown that liver enzyme levels do not correlate with the histological severity of NAFLD. Of note, up to 80% of patients with NAFLD have no liver enzyme abnormalities, implying that normal transaminase levels do not exclude steatosis. Nevertheless, ALT, AST, the AST/ALT ratio and GGT are included in different multibiomarker panels aimed to optimise the diagnostic accuracy of NAFLD. The AST to ALT ratio, in particular, can provide important diagnostic clues. The normal AST to ALT ratio is approximately 0.8, and it is usually < 1.0 in NAFLD, although it may be > 1.0 with the development of cirrhosis.

Regarding specific circumstances for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, more specifically with respect to lean patients (noninvasive assessment of fibrosis), AGA 2022 guidelines recommend to consider using serum indices (NAFLD fibrosis score and Fibrosis-4 score) and imaging techniques (transient elastography and magnetic resonance elastography) as alternatives to liver biopsy for fibrosis staging and patient follow-up. Consider obtaining these tests at the time of diagnosis and repeat at intervals of 6 months to 2 years, depending on the fibrosis stage and the patient's response to intervention.

Response to abnormal liver blood tests: outcomes and pathways￼

As indicated in figure 1 the presence of unexplained clinical jaundice or suspicion of possible hepatic or biliary malignancy should lead to an immediate referral. In all other adults with incidentally raised liver enzymes it is important to take a careful history and perform a targeted clinical examination to look for the cause. Liver enzymes can occasionally be raised owing to intercurrent illness, although when liver blood tests were repeated, 84% of tests remained abnormal on retesting after 1 month, and even at 2 years 75% remained abnormal. Thus, in a patient with abnormal liver blood tests it is not recommended to simply repeat the same panel of tests but to determine the cause unless there is a high index of clinical suspicion that it is a transient finding. In children, there should be a low threshold for referral to a paediatrician for further investigation, as the most common causes of liver dysfunction in adults are less common in children, and there is a wider differential diagnosis.

Figure 1
Response to abnormal liver blood tests. This figure details the initial response to abnormal liver blood tests. Boxes in yellow indicate the initial evaluation of the clinical presentation. Patients with marked derangement of liver blood tests, synthetic failure and/or suspicious clinical symptoms/signs should be considered for urgent referral to secondary care (red box). For the remainder, a clinical history alongside evaluation of the pattern of liver blood test derangement will determine choice of pathway and is shown in the grey boxes. A grey box indicates all the tests that should be requested at that stage rather than a hierarchy within it. The presence of metabolic syndrome criteria should be sought to support a diagnosis of NAFLD. For children, the text should be consulted for modification of recommendation. Areas of diagnostic uncertainty are indicated in orange boxes and the decision for repeat testing or referral to secondary care will be influenced by the magnitude of enzyme elevation and clinical context.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a practical approach to diagnosis and staging [^113wNBjj]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

NAFLD is a very common condition affecting approximately 30% of the population and can cause significant liver disease in a proportion of patients. Accurate diagnosis and staging is important in determining the appropriate long-term management for patients with NAFLD.

Key points

Alanine transaminase (ALT) levels are a poor predictor of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
Ultrasound is the first-line imaging test for patients with suspected steatosis (good accuracy if > 30% of hepatocytes are steatotic).
Liver fat decreases as fibrosis increases.
Risk of NAFLD/NASH directly related to presence and severity of the metabolic syndrome.
Simple steatosis carries benign prognosis.
NASH carries poor prognosis with increased liver-related and cardiovascular mortality.
Aims: to identify individuals at risk of NAFLD to risk stratify patients with NAFLD to focus care on patients with NASH.

Aminotransferase levels may be misleading, as "Aminotransferase levels are frequently normal in patients with advanced liver disease due to NASH and should not be used in isolation to exclude the presence of NASH with clinically significant fibrosis". Family members merit counseling and assessment, as "First-degree relatives of patients with NASH cirrhosis should be counseled regarding their increased individual risk and offered screening for advanced hepatic fibrosis". Patients with "at-risk" disease are highlighted: "Patients with 'at-risk' NASH (NASH with at least stage 2 fibrosis) are at increased risk of developing cirrhosis and liver-related complications".

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. A decalogue from the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver (AISF) expert committee [^116vXkW3]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2010). Low credibility.

We report the evidence-based Italian Association for the Study of Liver guidelines for the appropriate diagnosis and management of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in clinical practice and its related research agenda. The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease varies according to age, gender and ethnicity. In the general population, the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is about 25% and the incidence is of two new cases/100 people/year. 2–3% of individuals in the general population will suffer from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Uncomplicated steatosis will usually follow a benign course. Individuals with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, however, have a reduced life expectancy, mainly owing to vascular diseases and liver-related causes. Moreover, steatosis has deleterious effects on the natural history of HCV infection. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is usually diagnosed in asymptomatic patients prompted by the occasional discovery of increased liver enzymes and/or of ultrasonographic steatosis. Medical history, complete physical examination, etiologic screening of liver injury, liver biochemistry tests, serum lipids and insulin sensitivity tests should be performed in every patient. Occult alcohol abuse should be ruled out. Ultrasonography is the first-line imaging technique. Liver biopsy, the gold standard in diagnosis and prognosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, is an invasive procedure and its results will not influence treatment in most cases but will provide prognostic information. Assessment of fibrosis by composite scores, specific laboratory parameters and transient elastography might reduce the number of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease patients requiring liver biopsy. Dieting and physical training reinforced by behavioural therapy are associated with improved nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Diabetes and the metabolic syndrome should be ruled out at timed intervals in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients should undergo periodic evaluation of cardiovascular risk and of advancement of their liver disease; those with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-cirrhosis should be evaluated for early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Alcohol-associated steatosis — presentation, testing, and management: Patients with alcohol-associated steatosis are usually asymptomatic, and a palpably enlarged liver may be found in the absence of jaundice or stigmata of advanced liver disease. Among the common liver enzymes, elevations of aspartate aminotransferase and GGT are the best indicators of recent excessive alcohol consumption. Hepatic steatosis is readily identified on sonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver, and MRI is more accurate for quantifying fat than other radiologic techniques, with the added advantage that MRI can assess fat over the entire volume of the liver. Liver biopsy is rarely needed for the diagnosis of alcohol-associated steatosis, and treatment entails abstinence.

2.2 Acute fatty liver disease of pregnancy (Figure 3)

FIGURE 3
Summary of acute fatty liver of pregnancy.

Acute fatty liver disease of pregnancy is a rare, pregnancy‐specific cause of acute liver failure. It is estimated to occur in 1:10 000 pregnancies. The condition typically presents in the third trimester as a maternal and fetal emergency requiring prompt recognition and management.

AFLP is caused by toxic infiltration of the hepatocytes by small fat droplets (also called microvesicular fat). On average, pregnant women present at 35–36 weeks of pregnancy with non‐specific symptoms including nausea, vomiting, reduced appetite, fatigue, abdominal pain, and distension. The signs include those associated with hepatic failure (elevated liver transaminases, hyperbilirubinemia, hypoglycemia, coagulopathy, jaundice, encephalopathy, polyuria, polydipsia, acidosis and, in some cases, renal dysfunction, and pancreatitis). AFLP may also present in the early postpartum period.

Risk factors for AFLP include low body mass index, multiple gestation, younger and older maternal age, gestational hypertension with proteinuria (pre‐eclampsia), fetal growth restriction, and carrying a male fetus. AFLP is likely to have a multifactorial etiology. In some cases the pathogenesis is thought to be related to fatty acid oxidation disorders, leading to microvesicular fat deposition in maternal hepatocytes and subsequent hepatic dysfunction.

Diagnosis

AFLP is diagnosed with a combination of clinical features, laboratory testing and diagnostic imaging. Assessment should include maternal blood testing for bilirubin, uric acid, liver transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] or aspartate aminotransferase [AST]), glucose, uric acid, hemoglobin, leukocytes, platelets, ammonia, creatinine, prothrombin (PT), and partial thromboplastin times (PTT).

Maternal, fetal, and neonatal adverse outcomes associated with AFLP are listed in Table 3. The risk of maternal death is associated with higher levels of creatinine, lactate, PT, PTT, and encephalopathy.

Maternal and fetal adverse outcomes with acute fatty liver of pregnancy.

A useful tool for establishing the diagnosis is the Swansea Criteria(Table 4) that has a high positive predictive value for AFLP. Liver biopsy is rarely required to aid diagnosis.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease review: diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes [^116eLyie]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of abnormal serum aminotransferase levels in both developed and developing countries. Patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a subset of NAFLD, are at risk for progressive liver disease and in need of effective treatment options. A practical approach may be pursued by identifying patients with NAFLD with the highest likelihood for histologic evidence of NASH. Despite decades of clinical trials, no single treatment can be recommended to all patients with NASH. Importantly, there is no evidence that pioglitazone or vitamin E improves fibrosis. Bariatric surgeries may improve hepatic histology in morbidly obese patients with NASH, although randomized clinical trials are lacking. Currently, NASH is the second leading etiology of liver disease among adults awaiting liver transplantation in the United States. The primary and secondary prevention of NAFLD may require aggressive strategies for managing obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113z2Ems]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Recommendations list

Recommendation 1: Initial investigation for potential liver disease should include bilirubin, albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), together with a full blood count if not already performed within the previous 12 months. (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 1: Further evidence is required to establish the cost-effectiveness of case finding for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in high-risk groups before it can be recommended. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history and current medical condition. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 4: Patients with abnormal liver blood tests should be considered for investigation with a liver aetiology screen irrespective of level and duration of abnormality. Abnormal refers to an analyte which is outside the laboratory reference range (level 2b, grade B)
Recommendation 5: In adults a standard liver aetiology screen should include abdominal ultrasound scan (USS), hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody (with follow-on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if positive), anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, serum immunoglobulins, simultaneous serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 6: In children, ferritin and transferrin saturation may not be indicated, but autoantibody panel should include anti-liver kidney microsomal antibody and coeliac antibodies. Alpha-1-antitrypsin level and caeruloplasmin (age > 3 years) should be included, and abnormalities discussed with an appropriate inherited metabolic disease specialist. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 7: Adults with NAFLD should undergo risk stratification to determine the extent of their liver fibrosis (figures 1 and 2). First-line testing should use either fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) or NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS) – see table 3 (level 2b, grade B). Calculation facilities for FIB-4 and NFS should be incorporated in all primary care computer systems. (level 5, grade D) Second-line testing requires a quantitative assessment of fibrosis with tests such as serum enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) measurements or Fibroscan/acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography. (level 2b, grade B) We recommend that hepatologists at a local level champion this idea and discuss it with commissioners of health to deal with the burden of liver disease in their area.
Recommendation 8: Consider referral to alcohol services for all adults with alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) with evidence of alcohol dependency as defined by an AUDIT score of > 19. (level 3b, grade C)
Recommendation 9: Harmful drinkers should undergo risk stratification with clinical assessment and Fibroscan/ARFI elastography. Adults should be referred to secondary care if there is evidence of advanced liver disease (features of cirrhosis or portal hypertension on imaging or from blood tests) and/or Fibroscan reading is > 16 kPa (if available). (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 2: Further evidence is required to establish the most cost-effective approach to identify patients with ARLD and NAFLD at risk of having advanced liver fibrosis.
Recommendation 10: Adults with abnormal liver blood tests, even with a negative extended liver aetiology screen and no risk factors for NAFLD, should be referred/discussed to a gastroenterologist with an interest in liver disease/hepatologist for further evaluation (figure 1). (level 4, grade C)

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^116mi66H]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) presentation with abnormal liver chemistries highlights when to suspect the condition and typical enzyme patterns. NAFLD is a highly prevalent condition associated with the metabolic syndrome and should be strongly considered in individuals with mild elevations of AST/ALT levels. Unlike alcoholic liver disease, there is no unique pattern of elevation for ALT and AST levels; in general, ALT is higher than AST levels, and levels are rarely above 300 IU/l.

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels: causes and evaluation [^112yo3Df]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Mild, asymptomatic elevations (less than five times the upper limit of normal) of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels are common in primary care. It is estimated that approximately 10% of the U.S. population has elevated transaminase levels. An approach based on the prevalence of diseases that cause asymptomatic transaminase elevations can help clinicians efficiently identify common and serious liver disease. The most common causes of elevated transaminase levels are nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease. Uncommon causes include drug-induced liver injury, hepatitis B and C, and hereditary hemochromatosis. Rare causes include alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, and Wilson disease. Extrahepatic sources, such as thyroid disorders, celiac sprue, hemolysis, and muscle disorders, are also associated with mildly elevated transaminase levels. The initial evaluation should include an assessment for metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance (i.e., waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting lipid level, and fasting glucose or A1C level); a complete blood count with platelets; measurement of serum albumin, iron, total iron-binding capacity, and ferritin; and hepatitis C antibody and hepatitis B surface antigen testing. The nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score and the alcoholic liver disease/nonalcoholic fatty liver disease index can be helpful in the evaluation of mildly elevated transaminase levels. If testing for common causes is consistent with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and is otherwise unremarkable, a trial of lifestyle modification is appropriate. If the elevation persists, hepatic ultrasonography and further testing for uncommon causes should be considered.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^113VC52i]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease. Most cases are diagnosed incidentally in the primary care or hospital setting on the basis of elevated liver enzyme levels or hepatic steatosis on imaging. NAFLD encompasses a wide spectrum: The vast majority of patients have nonprogressive nonalcoholic fatty liver, and a few of those develop progressive liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis, a condition termed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Persons with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis have increased liver-related mortality. In the absence of regulatory agency-approved drugs, lifestyle modification and weight loss remain the cornerstones of NAFLD therapy.

There is no specific biomarker for the diagnosis of ALD, diagnosis requires excluding other liver diseases in a patient with heavy alcohol use. For early alcoholic liver disease, Liver function tests and ultrasound examination should be performed among patients with harmful alcohol use and/or AUD.

Liver tests are commonly performed in primary care and may signal the presence of acute or chronic liver disease. Abnormal results are defined by standardized rather than individual laboratory thresholds and must be interpreted in the context of a patient's history and examination. The pattern and severity of liver injury may provide clues about the cause of disease and should guide diagnostic evaluation with serologic testing and liver imaging. A systematic, stepwise approach to the evaluation and management of abnormal liver test results is recommended to optimize high-value care.

### The role of noninvasive biomarkers in diagnosis and risk stratification in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^112MQWNc]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronically elevated liver enzymes. Diagnosis and risk stratification of NAFLD remains clinically challenge as patients with NAFLD are either asymptomatic or have nonspecific presenting complaints and may have normal liver enzymes. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the clinically aggressive variant of NAFLD, is also difficult to differentiate noninvasively, and a liver biopsy is required to definitively diagnose NASH. Thus, the definitive diagnosis and risk stratification of NAFLD is embedded in histological assessment of the liver. Several clinical aides been investigated in an attempt to risk stratify and identify patients noninvasively as doing a liver biopsy in all patients with NAFLD are not feasible. Since these biomarkers are unable to differentiate NASH from non‐NASH, they have leveraged biochemical changes within the liver as patients progress to varying degree of hepatic fibrosis to identify patients with moderate fibrosis (fibrosis stage 2 or greater) and advanced fibrosis (fibrosis stage 3 or greater) to help guide the need for additional and more definitive workup. These clinical aides span from by‐products of apoptosis to statistical modelling of clinically available data to identify 'at‐risk' patients with NAFLD. The current review will focus the diagnostic performance of these noninvasive serum‐based biomarkers in NAFLD.

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels in the asymptomatic patient [^114h9YzH]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Mild elevations in liver chemistry tests such as alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase can reveal serious underlying conditions or have transient and benign etiologies. Potential causes of liver transaminase elevations include viral hepatitis, alcohol use, medication use, steatosis or steatohepatitis, and cirrhosis. The history should be thorough, with special attention given to the use of medications, vitamins, herbs, drugs, and alcohol; family history; and any history of blood-product transfusions. Other common health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and thyroid disease, can cause or augment liver transaminase elevations. The recent American Gastroenterological Association guideline regarding the evaluation and management of abnormal liver chemistry tests proposes a practical, algorithmic approach when the history and physical examination do not reveal the cause. In addition to liver chemistries, an initial serologic evaluation includes a prothrombin time; albumin; complete blood count with platelets; hepatitis A, B, and C serologies; and iron studies. Depending on the etiology, management strategies may include cessation of alcohol use, attention to medications, control of diabetes, and modification of lifestyle factors such as obesity. If elevations persist after an appropriate period of observation, further testing may include ultrasonography and other serum studies. In some cases, biopsy may be indicated.

Introduction

The liver biopsy is a paramount procedure in internal medicine and gastroenterology, aiming to identify a broad spectrum of etiologies ranging from abnormal values of liver function tests to structural changes or injuries at the hepatocellular level. – Clinical evaluation entails a range from asymptomatic individuals to acute liver failure prompting liver transplantation. In the most recent definition of acute hepatitis, the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease categorizes an acute increase of liver biochemical values within six months of onset in a patient apparently not showing a pre-existing liver disease, while if the threshold of 6 months is over, the definition of chronic hepatitis is in place. In alcoholic liver disease, the liver may show changes stretching from simple fatty change to cirrhosis. The most common manifestation of alcoholic liver disease, which is also the earliest, is macrovesicular fatty change, which may develop within approximately six days of alcohol consumption, and following alcohol abstinence, this change may persist up to 6 weeks. – It has been observed that alcohol and drug use has increased during the pandemic and school closures. This data may be relevant for the next epidemiological data of juvenile MAFLD (metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease)/NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease).

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease represents a spectrum of liver diseases which occurs in the absence of alcohol consumption in amounts considered injurious to the liver. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease includes both non-alcoholic fatty liver and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. We present an integrated approach that utilizes both clinical and laboratory studies to diagnose and manage a patient with suspected non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. The goals of treatment include (1) correction of the underlying risk factors, (2) avoidance of factors that promote progression of liver disease, and (3) specific treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) diagnosis — blood tests and enzyme patterns are described as follows: Hepatosteatosis typically results in elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) with normal bilirubin. Increase in ALT is sometimes described as more specific for NAFLD, and an AST:ALT ratio of > 1.5 may be more consistent with alcoholic liver disease; AST > ALT is associated with more advanced hepatic fibrosis. The AST-to-platelet ratio is also sometimes used to evaluate NAFLD. Notably, some reports suggest that 25% of NAFLD patients and 19% of NASH patients have normal AST blood levels.

### Metabolic syndrome and transaminases: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1144MQ2J]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) encompasses several cardiovascular risk factors, including insulin resistance, atherogenic dyslipidaemia, central obesity and hypertension. It is a multifactorial non-communicable disease that significantly contributes to morbidity and mortality and is considered a public health burden worldwide.

In addition to increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), MetS and its risk factors, including obesity and diabetes mellitus (DM), are associated with liver disease. Liver function is essential for glucose and fatty acid metabolism. Hepatic glucose homeostasis influences insulin sensitivity, while peripheral insulin resistance and lipolysis contribute to fat accumulation in the liver (hepatic steatosis).

In this regard, MetS has a direct relationship with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), both being predictors of the development of fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinogenesis.

NAFLD affects approximately 25% of the world's population and is a leading cause of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver transplantation. This disorder, characterised by lipid deposition in hepatocytes, encompasses a group of liver diseases that resemble alcoholic liver disease, ranging from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. These liver diseases have become the leading causes of liver-related morbidity and mortality and a risk factor for DM, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, MetS and CVD.

In this context, early liver impairment detection would help prevent or diagnose other metabolic disorders. According to recent studies, liver function tests, including serum alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), can be valuable parameters in the assessment of metabolic status, especially in the investigation of cardio-metabolic disorders. Specifically, several authors have explored the associations between liver enzymes, MetS, and CVD in different populations. In this regard, elevated ALT levels have been shown to help predict CVD in prospective studies, and MetS and its components. Although GGT is considered an indicator of the degree of liver disease and alcohol consumption, several studies have shown that the level of this enzyme is also associated with diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular mortality independently of liver damage or alcohol consumption. One of the advantages of these parameters is that they are commonly measured in liver function tests and are well-known markers of liver damage.

Therefore, this possible relationship between serum liver enzymes and MetS has recently attracted much attention. Therefore, the main objective of the systematic review and meta-analysis is to provide the best degree of evidence on the association between liver enzymes (ALT, AST, GGT) and MetS, determining the effect size of these biomarkers.

Step 2 — conduct standard history and blood tests to obtain key measures states, "We recommend that all at-risk patients identified in Step 1 be screened for alcohol use and have liver tests (or comprehensive metabolic panel, if done as part of routine care) and a complete blood count as part of the initial screening process". It further notes, "The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that all adults 18 years and older be screened for alcohol use disorders, using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise, or single-question screening tool". Results from standard laboratory tests "can allow clinicians to calculate simple fibrosis scores such as Fibrosis-4 [FIB-4] or NAFLD Fibrosis Score" and can "identify patients with elevated aminotransferases", who "should be evaluated for presence of other chronic liver and biliary diseases, including chronic hepatitis C virus infection, chronic hepatitis B virus infection, alcohol-related liver disease, and mass lesions (via liver imaging)".

### The association of higher levels of within-normal-limits liver enzymes and the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome [^1112hUfL]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2010). Low credibility.

The notion that persistently elevated liver enzyme concentrations, even within the so-called "reference" range, is associated with cardiovascular risk factors and future disease has been previously demonstrated. In fact, it has been shown that several liver enzymes, in particular GGT, are associated with the appearance of cardiovascular events. This is also relevant to individuals with the MetS. Thus, the recognition that the prevalence of the MetS increases even in individuals whose liver enzymes are in the lower part of the 'normal' reference range, might have clinical significance in terms of early recognition of these dysmetabolic changes.

We recognize several limitations in the current analysis. First, our conclusions are of a descriptive nature and are based essentially only on associations between parameters. Based upon its cross sectional design, the present findings are inherently limited in the ability to eliminate causal relationships. Second, since some of the study population had several risk factors, we could not fully eliminate the possible effect of underlying diseases and medications used for these diseases on the present findings. Further prospective population-based studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms in order to answer these questions. Finally, serum GGT is a sensitive indicator of alcohol consumption and/or liver dysfunction such as fatty liver, and is also high in patients with liver disease: chronic viral hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, or drug-induced liver injury. These liver diseases are present in community-dwelling persons and are usually asymptomatic. Thus, these possible confounders could have affected results.

### How to identify the patient with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis who will progress to cirrhosis [^111kYJn9]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) figures prominently into the clinical hepatology landscape. NAFLD represents a disease spectrum comprising simple steatosis, steatosis with elevated liver enzymes, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the entity with clear potential for fibrosis progression. Risk factors associated with fibrosis progression in NASH include histologic findings of lobular inflammation and any fibrosis as well as clinical comorbidities that include type 2 diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Liver biopsy remains the gold standard in evaluating NASH; however, noninvasive methods are accumulating evidence for a growing role in identifying patients at increased risk to develop NASH, fibrosis, and potentially cirrhosis.

### Association of histologic disease activity with progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^111342tt]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

In patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease who are not undergoing specific therapeutic interventions, what factors are associated with progression and regression of hepatic fibrosis?

Findings

In this cohort study of 446 patients, high baseline nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score and changes in the score were associated with concordant changes in fibrosis. Weight gain, high baseline aspartate aminotransferase level, and increases in the aspartate aminotransferase level were associated with fibrosis progression.

Meaning

These data may support the use of therapeutics targeting disease activity in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and the use of short-term changes in the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score as an end point in such clinical trials; in clinical practice, weight gain and an increasing aspartate aminotransferase level should increase suspicion of increasing fibrosis.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a practical approach to diagnosis and staging [^115rYRE6]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

As a result of increasing rates of obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the most common cause of abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) in the UK.NAFLD is present when > 5% of hepatocytes are steatotic in patients who do not consume excessive alcohol consumption (< 20 g/day for women and < 30 g/day for men) and ranges in severity from simple steatosis (fat without significant hepatic inflammation or hepatocellular injury), to steatohepatitis (fat with hepatocellular injury and hepatic inflammation), through to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. Although the exact prevalence of NAFLD in the UK is not known, population studies from the USA and China using the most accurate imaging modality for liver fat, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, estimate that approximately 28–31% of the general population have steatosis and 8% have a raised alanine transaminase (ALT) due to NAFLD.NAFLD frequently coexists with other liver diseases such as hepatitis C, haemochromatosis and alcoholic liver disease and has been shown to cause more rapid disease progression. Fatty infiltration of the liver can also be secondary to treatment with steatogenic drugs such as tamoxifen, amiodarone and steroids.

### Diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in children and adolescents: position paper of the ESPGHAN hepatology committee [^115cJzx8]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in children and adolescents in the United States, and most probably also in the rest of the industrialized world. As the prevalence of NAFLD in childhood increases with the worldwide obesity epidemic, there is an urgent need for diagnostic standards that can be commonly used by pediatricians and hepatologists. To this end, we performed a PubMed search of the adult and pediatric literature on NAFLD diagnosis through May 2011 using Topics and/or relevant Authors as search words. According to the present literature, NAFLD is suspected based on the association of fatty liver combined with risk factors (mainly obesity), after the exclusion of other causes of liver disease. The reference but imperfect standard for confirming NAFLD is liver histology. The following surrogate markers are presently used to estimate degree of steatosis and liver fibrosis and risk of progression to end-stage liver disease: imaging by ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging, liver function tests, and serum markers of liver fibrosis.NAFLD should be suspected in all of the overweight or obese children and adolescents older than 3 years with increased waist circumference especially if there is a NAFLD history in relatives. The typical presentation, however, is in children ages 10 years and older. The first diagnostic step in these children should be abdominal ultrasound and liver function tests, followed by exclusion of other liver diseases. Overweight/obese children with normal ultrasonographic imaging and normal liver function tests should still be monitored due to the poor sensitivity of these tests at a single assessment. Indications for liver biopsy include the following: to rule out other treatable diseases, in cases of clinically suspected advanced liver disease, before pharmacological/surgical treatment, and as part of a structured intervention protocol or clinical research trial.

### Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^11193En6]. Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a condition characterized by hepatomegaly, elevated serum aminotransferase levels, and a histologic picture similar to alcoholic hepatitis in the absence of alcohol abuse. Most patients with NASH are obese women, and many have diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, or hypertriglyceridemia. NASH has also been associated with a number of metabolic conditions, surgical procedures, and drug treatments. Most patients are asymptomatic. The most common sign of NASH is hepatomegaly. Stigmata of chronic liver disease are rare. Laboratory abnormalities include a 2–4-fold elevation of serum aminotransferase levels; other liver function test results are usually normal. Histologically, there is moderate to severe macrovesicular steatosis and lobular hepatitis with necrosis or ballooning degeneration and/or fibrosis. The pathogenesis of NASH is poorly understood, but lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress are the leading culprits. The natural history of NASH is unknown, but NASH seems to be a stable disease in most patients. Treatment of NASH is unproven, but weight reduction is recommended in obese patients. Small pilot studies of several drugs have shown promise, but large randomized clinical trials are awaited. Orthotopic liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for end-stage liver disease secondary to NASH.

### AGA clinical practice update: diagnosis and management of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in lean individuals: expert Review [^111Rtjcv]. Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Description

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is well recognized as a leading etiology for chronic liver disease, affecting > 25% of the US and global populations. Up to 1 in 4 individuals with NAFLD have nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to complications of liver cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although NAFLD is observed predominantly in persons with obesity and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus, an estimated 7%-20% of individuals with NAFLD have lean body habitus. Limited guidance is available to clinicians on appropriate clinical evaluation in lean individuals with NAFLD, such as for inherited/genetic disorders, lipodystrophy, drug-induced NAFLD, and inflammatory disorders. Emerging data now provide more robust evidence to define the epidemiology, natural history, prognosis, and mortality of lean individuals with NAFLD. Multiple studies have found that NAFLD among lean individuals is associated with increased cardiovascular, liver, and all-cause mortality relative to those without NAFLD. This American Gastroenterological Association Clinical Practice Update provides Best Practice Advice to assist clinicians in evidence-based approaches to the diagnosis, staging, and management of NAFLD in lean individuals.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership and underwent internal peer review by the Clinical Practice Updates Committee and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Lean NAFLD should be diagnosed in individuals with NAFLD and body mass index < 25 kg/m² (non-Asian race) or body mass index < 23 kg/m² (Asian race). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Lean individuals with NAFLD should be evaluated routinely for comorbid conditions, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Lean individuals with NAFLD should be risk stratified for hepatic fibrosis to identify those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Lean individuals in the general population should not undergo routine screening for NAFLD; however, screening should be considered for individuals older than 40 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: NAFLD should be considered in lean individuals with metabolic diseases (such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension), elevated liver biochemical tests, or incidentally noted hepatic steatosis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Clinicians should query patients routinely regarding alcohol consumption patterns in all patients with lean NAFLD. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: In patients with lean NAFLD, other causes of liver disease should be ruled out, including other causes of fatty liver, such as HIV, lipodystrophy, lysosomal acid lipase deficiency, familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, and medication-induced hepatic steatosis (methotrexate, amiodarone, tamoxifen, and steroids). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Current evidence is inadequate to support routine testing for genetic variants in patients with lean NAFLD. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Liver biopsy, as the reference standard, should be considered if there is uncertainty regarding contributing causes of liver injury and/or the stage of liver fibrosis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Serum indices (NAFLD fibrosis score and Fibrosis-4 score) and imaging techniques (transient elastography and magnetic resonance elastography) may be used as alternatives to liver biopsy for fibrosis staging and patient follow-up. These tests can be performed at the time of diagnosis and repeated at intervals of 6 months to 2 years, depending on fibrosis stage and the patient's response to intervention. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: If noninvasive tests (eg, Fibrosis-4 and NAFLD fibrosis score) are indeterminate, a second noninvasive test (eg, transient elastography or magnetic resonance elastography) should be performed to confirm the stage and prognosis of NAFLD. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: In lean patients with NAFLD, lifestyle intervention, including exercise, diet modification, and avoidance of fructose- and sugar-sweetened drinks, to target a modest weight loss of 3%-5% is suggested. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: Administration of vitamin E may be considered in lean persons with biopsy-confirmed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, but without type 2 diabetes mellitus or cirrhosis. Oral pioglitazone 30 mg daily may be considered in lean persons with biopsy-confirmed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis without cirrhosis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 14: The therapeutic role of glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in the management of lean NAFLD is not fully defined and requires further investigation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 15: Hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance with abdominal ultrasound with or without serum α-fetoprotein twice per year is suggested in patients with lean NAFLD and clinical markers compatible with liver cirrhosis.

Mortality from chronic liver disease (CLD) in the UK has increased by over 400% since 1970, driven by alcohol, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and hepatitis C virus, the natural histories of which can all be improved by early intervention. Patients often present with advanced disease, which would be preventable if diagnosed earlier and lifestyle change opportunities offered. Liver function tests (LFTs) are very commonly measured. Approximately 20% are abnormal, yet the majority are not investigated according to guidelines. However, investigating all abnormal LFTs to identify early liver disease would overwhelm services. Recently, several diagnostic pathways have been implemented across the country; some focus on abnormal LFTs and some on stratifying at-risk populations. This review will collate the evidence on the size of the problem and the challenges it poses. We will discuss the limitations and restrictions within systems that limit the responses available, review the current pathways being evaluated and piloted in the UK, and explore the arguments for and against LFT-based approaches and 'case-finding strategies' in the community diagnosis of liver disease. Furthermore, the role of fibrosis assessment methods (including scoring systems such as Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index, the enhanced liver fibrosis test and elastography) within these pathways will also be discussed. In conclusion, this review aims to establish some principles which, if adopted, are likely to improve the diagnosis of advanced liver disease, and identify the areas of contention for further research, in order to establish the most effective community detection models of liver disease.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease — alanine aminotransferase (ALT) thresholds and interpretation: ALT upper limits cited are "30 U/L for men and 19 U/L for women", and the American College of Gastroenterology considers "a true normal ALT level to range from 29 to 33 U/L for males and 19 to 25 U/L for females". Despite normal aminotransferases, "persons with NAFLD and normal aminotransferase levels can still have significant steatohepatitis and develop advanced fibrosis or cryptogenic cirrhosis", although "the presence of high aminotransferase levels does increase the prevalence of adverse outcomes".

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^111E9Cjn]. Pediatrics in Review (2015). Low credibility.

On the basis of strong research and consensus, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease in children and is soon to be the most common indication for liver transplantation in adults. Although the disease begins as simple steatosis, some patients may progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis, making early identification and treatment critical.• The diagnosis of NAFLD can be challenging because patients are typically asymptomatic, with no major clinical symptoms of liver disease. Overweight and obese children are at the highest risk for disease. (1)(2)• On the basis of moderate research and consensus, serum ALT is usually mildly elevated but is an imperfect test with a low sensitivity for detecting NAFLD at commonly used thresholds.(10) Liver biopsy is still considered the gold standard for diagnosis but is too invasive for population-level screening and is often used selectively. Novel, noninvasive diagnostic modalities and serum biomarkers are currently being studied but warrant further validation, especially in children.• On the basis of moderate research and consensus, assessing serum liver tests in any overweight or obese child is reasonable. Liver disease should be suspected if the serum ALT is ≥ 22 U/L(0.37 mkat/L) in girls and ≥ 25 U/L (0.42 mkat/L) in boys. (10)Subspecialist referral should be considered for those with a normal BMI, persistent ALT elevation longer than 6 months, specific symptoms of advanced liver disease such as splenomegaly, or concerning laboratory findings on selected screening tests.• On the basis of strong research evidence, weight loss is the most efficacious treatment for NAFLD.• On the basis of some research and consensus, initiation of vitamin E therapy (400 IU BID) may be started, although its use probably should be restricted to those children with biopsy-proven disease. (12)• On the basis of some research and consensus, novel elastography-based imaging modalities are being studied in children and several drugs show promise in treating NAFLD.

### Non-invasive assessment of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease [^1128Ly2q]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects an estimated 25% of the global population and is increasingly contributing to end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. It encompasses a spectrum of liver conditions characterized by excessive accumulation of fat in the liver and is diagnosed following exclusion of significant alcohol intake and other causes of chronic liver disease. In the majority of cases, it is due to overnutrition and is closely associated with metabolic risk factors. Despite being the most common cause of chronic liver disease, its name tells us what it is not instead of what it is and its definition is not in line with the reality that more than one cause of chronic liver disease can be present in an individual patient. Because of these fundamental issues, the term metabolic dysfunction–associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) has been proposed, which is defined as hepatic steatosis in the presence of overweight or obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus or greater than two metabolic risk abnormalities. The new name and its definition bring better clarity to what the disease is and has been shown to have better clinical utility. However, the new term has not been universally adopted due to concern about impact on disease awareness, previous research work based on the term NAFLD and on-going clinical trials for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In this review on non-invasive assessment of MAFLD, studies that were included were based on the term NAFLD unless stated otherwise. We believe that studies on non-invasive tests for NAFLD would show similar results when the MAFLD definition were to be applied because majority of patients who fulfilled the criteria for NAFLD would fulfill the criteria for MAFLD. This is especially so for studies on non-invasive tests for NAFLD where liver biopsy was used as the reference standard as these studies would usually include NAFLD patients with more severe liver disease who are more likely to also fulfill the criteria for MAFLD. However, this can only be proven when the data from these studies are re-analyzed using the MAFLD definition, an exercise that can and should be carried out when global consensus on the new term has been reached. In addition, MAFLD patients with other causes of chronic liver disease, which would not have been considered in previous studies on non-invasive tests for NAFLD, represent a distinct and heterogeneous group and should be looked at separately. With this background, we will address the non-invasive tests for MAFLD, focusing on blood-based biomarkers and scores and two of the most widely studied imaging biomarkers, namely vibration-controlled transient elastography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), for the assessment of steatosis, NASH, and fibrosis as well as for prognostication and monitoring of treatment response.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117VSnab]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Extent of abnormality

It is assumed that the magnitude of derangement of a liver blood test panel correlates with prognosis, and for this reason threshold values above the upper limit of the reference interval are commonly used when directing the need for further investigation. However, this assumption is not supported by the literature, and prognosis is more clearly determined by diagnosis and context within which the tests are requested. To illustrate this consider two patients; a patient with an acute hepatitis A infection can have ALT values > 1000 U/L, whereas a patient with hepatitis C can have an ALT within the normal reference interval, yet 10 years later the patient with hepatitis A is likely to be alive and well irrespective of how they are managed, whereas the patient with hepatitis C if not investigated and diagnosed is at substantial risk of progressing to end-stage liver disease. Indeed, the the most common causes of abnormal liver blood tests leading to chronic liver disease — namely non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease and hepatitis C, are frequently associated with only mild or moderate liver blood test abnormalities. Therefore, despite the increasing use of liver blood tests, patients continue to present with undiagnosed end-stage liver disease, which might have been preventable by earlier diagnosis.

Moreover, the current upper limit of normal for many of the liver enzymes (for example ALT) may be too high, which is probably a consequence of patients with occult NAFLD being included in the generation of normal serum ALT ranges. This is perhaps best appreciated in patients with chronic hepatitis B, where treatment guidelines recommend an ALT of > 30 U/L as being significant in males and > 19 U/L significant for females. Further, indirect evidence for this comes from the recognition that in some patients with autoimmune hepatitis their fibrosis stage progresses despite apparent control of their inflammatory process via perceived normal aminotransferase levels. This is compounded by the knowledge that many patients with significant liver fibrosis may have liver enzymes in the normal reference range and normal synthetic function, increasing the difficulty of their early identification. Thus, the clinical assessment of such individuals is critical in determining what the question is (do they have fibrosis?), which tests should be ordered and how should they be interpreted.

Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)

Imaging-detected unsuspected hepatic steatosis — when patients with unsuspected hepatic steatosis detected on imaging have symptoms or signs attributable to liver disease or have abnormal liver biochemistries, they should be evaluated as though they have suspected NAFLD and worked-up accordingly (Strength – 1, Evidence - A); in patients with unsuspected hepatic steatosis detected on imaging who lack any liver-related symptoms or signs and have normal liver biochemistries, it is reasonable to assess for metabolic risk factors (e.g., obesity, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia) and alternate causes for hepatic steatosis such as significant alcohol consumption or medications (Strength – 1, Evidence - A); in patients with unsuspected hepatic steatosis detected on imaging who are asymptomatic and have normal liver biochemistries, a liver biopsy cannot be recommended (Strength – 1, Evidence - B).

The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Identification of people with NAFLD

Use of defined pathways for the investigation of suspected liver disease has been shown to increase the diagnosis of significant liver disease and reduce unnecessary referrals. Therefore, services should have an agreed local clinical pathway for the investigation of suspected liver disease that includes an assessment for liver fibrosis using available non-invasive liver fibrosis tests (Recommendation 1, Table 1). Key aspects to consider when developing pathways are described below.

NAFLD is considered the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome (defined as any three of the following: impaired fasting glucose or T2DM; hypertriglyceridemia; low HDL; increased waist circumference or high blood pressure). As well as NAFLD being highly prevalent in those with T2DM or the metabolic syndrome, the presence of these risk factors is associated with more progressive liver disease in NAFLD. Therefore, consider the possibility of liver fibrosis due to NAFLD in those with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) or the metabolic syndrome (Recommendation 2, Table 1).

Proactive assessment for the presence of liver fibrosis in patients at risk can permit earlier identification of significant liver disease –. The 'Scarred Liver Project', which offered community fibrosis testing to people with diabetes or obesity alongside those with hazardous alcohol consumption, identified 3688 patients at risk from a cohort of 25,018. Overall, 20% of at-risk individuals who attended a follow-up clinic had evidence of significant liver disease. Furthermore, a study including FIB-4 (discussed below) testing in annual diabetic reviews in primary care followed by transient elastography in those with an indeterminate or high FIB-4 found that 4.5% of the cohort had previously undiagnosed advanced liver disease, defined as imaging, endoscopic or biopsy evidence of cirrhosis, portal hypertension or HCC.

Evidence to support a case finding strategy amongst people with significant risk factors is currently limited and remains an area of divergence between current European and North American clinical guidelines. However, it is likely that a fibrosis risk-based approach in primary care may be more successful - and cost-effective - for the early identification of liver disease, than reliance on abnormal liver function or incidental finding of steatosis on imaging. However, it is also important to acknowledge that greater efforts to investigate and identify advanced liver disease in this group may result in a significant increase in primary and secondary care workload, and local service development considerations should be planned accordingly.

### The efficacy and safety of statins for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^115NZAix]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is an emerging liver disease in Western countries and the most frequent cause of incidental elevation of serum liver enzymes. Dyslipidaemia is frequently observed in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and treatment of dyslipidaemia plays a critical role in the overall management of these patients. Moreover, coronary artery disease remains the most common cause of death. Statins are effective lipid-lowering agents, associated with a lowering the risk of cardiovascular events in several interventional randomized clinical trials. However, statins are often underused in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and many physicians are concerned about the prescription of statins to patients with unexplained persistent elevation of liver enzymes or active liver disease. Based on currently available data, statin therapy, at low-to-moderate doses, seems to be safe and has low liver toxicity. Treatment of dyslipidaemia in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is recommended and may also improve liver function tests. In these patients, the risks of not taking statins could outweigh the risks of taking the drug. Conversely, the usefulness of statins for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is still a matter of debate and randomized clinical trials of adequate size and duration are required.

Pediatric obesity — nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) screening context and ALT thresholds: NAFLD is usually asymptomatic and requires screening, but presently no screening guidelines exist outside of recognizing those at risk by weight categorization (BMI ≥ 85% for age and sex); proposed normative alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations are ≤ 25 U/L for boys and ≤ 22U/L for girls, while even normal or mildly elevated ALT (≥ 26 to 50 U/L for boys and ≥ 23 to 44 U/L for girls) has been associated with significant histologic abnormalities; high ALT levels would suggest a more advanced stage, and despite underestimating injury, ALT elevation is still an easily available screen, with fatty liver likely present in most pediatric obesity whether enzymes are high or not.

Steatotic liver disease (MASLD) primary care FIB-4 triage — When the FIB-4 is < 1.3, patients can be followed in the primary care setting and reassessed periodically, with patients without prediabetes/T2DM and < 2 metabolic risk factors reassessed every 2–3 years, while more frequent FIB-4 monitoring (eg, every 1–2 y) should be considered for those with prediabetes/T2DM or ≥ 2 or more metabolic risk factors. In patients older than age 65, an FIB-4 cutoff of > 2.0 should be used, whereas FIB-4 has low accuracy in those under the age of 35 years; thus, secondary assessment should be considered in those < 35 years of age with increased metabolic risk or elevated liver chemistries. FIB-4 should not be used in acutely ill patients, and in patients with FIB-4 ≥ 1.3, a secondary assessment should be done (preferably VCTE or ELF initially).

### Clinical utility of liver function tests for resolution of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease after weight loss in the diabetes remission clinical trial [^113oiCQE]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Liver function tests have a wide variability in apparently healthy people under many metabolic and environmental influences but remain fairly constant within any individual. They rise when there is any injury to liver tissue, and intrahepatic fat is such a causative factor in part via local, low‐grade inflammation. Fatty liver is a key element in the aetiology of type 2 diabetes, but difficult to assess in primary care. Neither ALT nor GGT have high reliability individually as point estimates to confirm or exclude the presence of MASLD, but in type 2 diabetes cohorts, 57% have at least one and 27% have two or more abnormal LFT tests. Elevated GGT is well recognised to be associated with type 2 diabetes, as well as being sensitive to excess alcohol intake, and a predictor of fibrosis/cirrhosis. Compared with type 1 diabetes, people with type 2 diabetes exhibit a higher prevalence of elevated ALT (22.9 vs. 5.3%, p < 0.01) and GGT (23.7 vs. 10.5%, p < 0.01). This is consistent with observations from a four‐country study of detected MASLD in which the one which uses more imaging for MASLD diagnosis reports the highest prevalence of MASLD. However, the clinical importance of the present study lies in demonstration of the clinical utility of sequential decrease in simple liver enzymes to assess change in hepatic steatosis, reflecting the reverse of the sequential increase seen during overfeeding studies. These changes are reflected in the 5‐year follow‐up data from DiRECT. Full clinical assessment involves measurement of plasma triglyceride and HbA1c levels which, as noted above, decline in step with falling liver fat levels, further supporting a reduction in ectopic fat as we have previously argued.

Achieving a complete return to normal of liver fat content by many participants after weight loss underscores the relationship of MASLD with overnutrition in susceptible individuals, particularly those who exhibit prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. The clinical utility of tracking the return to normal using liver function tests or derived indices is relevant not only to monitoring liver health during remission of type 2 diabetes but also to the wider management of people with presumed or proven MASLD. The Hepatic Steatosis Index (HSI)is also imprecise for diagnosis of MASLD as a point estimate, but like plasma liver enzymes can be used for sequential demonstration of change after weight loss, especially when baseline levels are raised. However, it requires a calculation, is time consuming in clinical practice, and fails to offer superior predictive power over sequential plasma ALT levels.

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^116GN7V6]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

NAFLD — Assessment and management notes limitations of liver enzymes and preferred imaging for steatosis. Aminotransferase levels may be normal in advanced NASH and should not exclude disease with clinically significant fibrosis. Most laboratory "normal" ALT thresholds are high; as a general rule, ALT > 30 U/L should be considered abnormal. Standard ultrasound is not recommended to identify steatosis due to low sensitivity, whereas controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) may be used to identify steatosis and MRI–proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) can quantify steatosis.

Initial evaluation of a patient with NAFLD states that patients with NAFLD are most commonly referred with incidentally noted hepatic steatosis on imaging or elevated liver chemistries; normal laboratory reference ranges may exceed what is appropriate for NAFLD, in which a true normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ranges from 29 to 33 U/L in men and from 19 to 25 U/L in women; initial evaluation should include screening for metabolic comorbidities, assessment of alcohol intake, exclusion of other causes of liver disease, and physical examination to identify signs of insulin resistance and advanced liver disease; and when the clinical profile is atypical or accompanied by additional signs or symptoms suggesting additional/alternate etiologies, less common causes of steatosis or steatohepatitis should be excluded.

### Frequently abnormal serum gamma-glutamyl transferase activity is associated with future development of fatty liver: a retrospective cohort study [^1119xRRb]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by excessive hepatic fat accumulation as detected by imaging or histology after appropriate exclusion of other liver diseases such as alcoholic liver disease. Lifestyle changes have led to a dramatic increase in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome, and this has increased the incidence of NAFLD. Fatty liver changes are an important sign of NAFLD, which covers a spectrum of liver diseases ranging from benign simple steatosis/nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) to hepatic inflammation and fibrosis/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Complete annual medical check-ups (CMCs) in Japan are referred to as "ningen docks". The medical examinations include regulated health screening tests for physical, laboratory, and imaging findings to look for diseases, or for follow-up management (once or twice in a year). NAFLD can be detected easily because almost all CMCs include abdominal ultrasonography and liver function tests. CMCs data have shown that 9–30% of Japanese adults have ultrasonography diagnosed NAFLD.

Meanwhile, some individuals frequently present elevated plasma gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels without revealing fatty liver images on ultrasonography and other obvious liver enzyme disorders. GGT is a hepatic and biliary enzyme synthesized by hepatocytes as well as epithelial cells of intra-hepatic bile ducts. Elevated plasma GGT enzymatic activity is a significant predictor of the metabolic syndrome and is associated with oxidative stress, coronary stenosis, and chronic kidney disease. Moreover, elevated GGT levels are occasionally shown in fatty liver, and individuals with elevated plasma GGT are probably manifesting a sign of a liver disorder, but whether the sign increases the rate of development of fatty liver is unknown. We designed a study comparing the incident rates of fatty liver changes, and the risk factors for them, in individuals with frequently elevated GGT values and in those without them.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in children — prevalence and risk factors — show variable estimates by method, with school-based alanine aminotransferase (ALT) screening using > 40 U/L reporting 23% of 17- to 18-year-olds with elevated unexplained ALT; an autopsy series of 742 children aged 2 to 19 years estimated NAFLD prevalence at 9.6%; and a meta-analysis reporting pooled mean prevalence of 7.6% in general-population children and 34.2% in pediatric obesity-clinic studies. In a primary care–referred screening cohort of 347 children with elevated ALT, NAFLD was diagnosed in 55%, other liver diseases in 18% with autoimmune hepatitis most common, and advanced fibrosis present in 11% of referred NAFLD cases; using ALT at 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) had sensitivity 57% and specificity 71%. Additional risk insights include that ALT alone may underestimate injury, obstructive sleep apnea severity was associated with histological NAFLD severity related to fibrosis stage, and family members of affected children showed higher correlations of abnormally high MRI-estimated fat fraction compared with matched controls.

### A systematic review of the prevalence of mildly abnormal liver function tests and associated health outcomes [^114L1CMd]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Liver function tests (LFTs) are commonly performed to investigate asymptomatic individuals or those with nonspecific symptoms. Understanding the prevalence of mildly abnormal LFTs in the general population and the prevalence of liver disease following abnormal LFTs has important implications for the planning of care pathways and the provision of healthcare services. A systematic review of the literature on the prevalence of abnormal LFTs in the general population and their respective health outcomes was conducted. A total of 37 studies reporting data on the prevalence of abnormal LFTs (published between 2000 and 2014) were identified from online database searches or were manually selected from article bibliographies. The prevalence of mildly abnormal LFTs, with one or more abnormal constituents in the LFT, was high at 10–21.7%. The prevalence of severe liver disease within cohorts with abnormal LFTs is relatively low (< 5%), and a large proportion of abnormal LFTs remains unexplained. Among individuals with unexplained abnormal LFTs, risk factors include obesity and insulin resistance. Common aetiologies for abnormal LFTs were non-alcohol-related fatty liver disease (NAFLD), followed by alcohol use and viral infections. In addition, normal LFTs do not rule out liver disease. The prevalence of abnormal LFTs depends on the definition and population but is likely to be between 10 and 20% in the general population. Abnormal LFTs are associated with a range of health outcomes but are not necessarily strongly diagnostic of severe liver pathology. Important areas of future research include further studies on the prevalence and predictive ability of LFTs in large, population-representative samples.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a practical approach to diagnosis and staging [^114221NJ]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the commonest cause of abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) in the UK with approximately a third of the population being affected. The exact prevalence is not known, but population studies from the USA and China using magnetic resonance spectroscopy estimate that approximately 30% of the general population have steatosis. It is a spectrum of disease ranging from simple steatosis, to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), through to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. The majority have simple steatosis, but approximately 10–30% develop NASH and the development of NASH cirrhosis is associated with a poor long-term prognosis. Patients with NASH have increased liver-related and cardiovascular mortality. Many patients with NAFLD remain undiagnosed, and recognising those at risk is the first step. Clinicians overly rely on abnormal liver enzymes to identify patients with NAFLD, so patients with significant liver disease can be overlooked, potentially missing opportunities for intervention. Although liver biopsy is the gold standard method for diagnosing and staging NAFLD, the majority of patients can be effectively diagnosed non-invasively with tests that are routinely available in the clinic today. This review discusses a pragmatic approach to diagnosis and staging of NAFLD so that patients at the highest risk of liver-related complications can be identified.
