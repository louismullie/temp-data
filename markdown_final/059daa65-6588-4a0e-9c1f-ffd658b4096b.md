## Question

How does prostate cancer impact eligibility for transplant?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how prostate cancer affects solid organ transplant eligibility, what exceptions exist for low-risk disease, and how to operationalize risk stratification and waiting periods in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching transplant principle regarding active malignancy. Then, I should verify guideline-defined exceptions for indolent prostate cancer. Next, I will define what constitutes low-risk disease using accepted clinical criteria. After that, I should review screening and listing implications in candidates, including the effect of PSA screening on access to transplant. Then, I will examine perioperative and immunosuppression-specific considerations in recipients. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic approach for transplant teams and highlight edge cases and uncertainties, cross-checking against KDIGO 2020 and EAU 2025 guidance throughout [^111u4CsT] [^112sRmho].

> Let me first confirm the general rule: active malignancy is an absolute contraindication to solid organ transplantation because post-transplant immunosuppression increases risks of progression and metastasis; KDIGO 2020 explicitly recommends excluding candidates with active cancer from kidney transplantation, which anchors the default stance for listing decisions [^111u4CsT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the recognized exceptions. KDIGO makes room for indolent cancers, explicitly listing prostate cancer with Gleason score ≤ 6 among exceptions where exclusion or waiting may not be required, and EAU 2025 similarly advises not delaying kidney transplantation in patients with appropriately treated low-stage or low-grade prostate cancer, which represents a major carve-out from the blanket rule I just stated [^111u4CsT] [^112sRmho].

> Now, I need to define "low-risk" prostate cancer precisely so I don't misclassify borderline cases. Conventionally, this means Grade Group 1 (Gleason score 3+3 = 6), PSA < 10 ng/mL, and organ-confined clinical stage T1–T2a, aligning with standard risk stratification frameworks and the biological rationale that such tumors are typically indolent with very low metastatic potential; this aligns with KDIGO's explicit Gleason criterion and general oncology guidance on stage, grade, and PSA as primary risk determinants [^111u4CsT] [^111Hd5nN] [^117BD2HT].

> Wait, let me verify how treatment status fits into eligibility; does "appropriately treated" require definitive therapy or can active surveillance suffice in select cases. EAU 2025 emphasizes not delaying transplantation when low-stage or low-grade disease has been appropriately treated, and contemporary transplant-focused reviews note that liberal use of active surveillance for very low/low-risk disease in candidates and recipients has increased, with proposals to avoid long waiting periods because excessive delays can worsen dialysis-related mortality without clear oncologic benefit, though this is based on limited data and must be individualized with multidisciplinary oversight [^112sRmho] [^115Q8Ywk].

> Next, I should review how prostate cancer screening impacts transplant access, because reflexive PSA testing can paradoxically delay care. In renal transplant evaluations, PSA-based screening has not improved post-transplant survival but has increased time to listing and reduced the likelihood of transplantation; this argues for shared decision-making and careful selection of candidates for screening in line with general-population guidance from the USPSTF, balancing small mortality benefits against substantial harms of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, especially when transplant timing is critical [^116opHRA] [^111rsE6o].

> I will now examine perioperative and oncologic outcomes for definitive local therapy in transplant recipients, since feasibility and safety inform listing strategies. Radical prostatectomy in immunosuppressed transplant recipients is feasible with acceptable oncologic control in series and case reports, including open, laparoscopic, and robotic approaches, though technical modifications and careful graft protection are essential, and national database analyses suggest higher in-hospital complication risks compared to non-transplant patients, emphasizing the need for experienced centers and tailored perioperative planning [^111LRdGi] [^1161JEUt] [^116YApr4].

> But wait, what about how immunosuppression and specific agents modify risk and interpretation; I need to check this before finalizing recommendations. Some regimens, particularly combinations of calcineurin inhibitors with azathioprine, have been associated with more locally advanced presentations of prostate cancer in recipients, and sirolimus can lower PSA values in men without cancer, potentially confounding screening and surveillance thresholds, so I should double-check PSA dynamics and immunosuppression context when assessing candidacy and recurrence risk [^114SeAFk] [^1171aRL9].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach and sanity-check each step against the evidence before proposing it. For candidates with newly diagnosed low-risk disease (Gleason 6, PSA < 10 ng/mL, cT1–T2a) and limited volume, I would not automatically defer transplant; after multidisciplinary review, many can proceed without a mandatory waiting period if disease is appropriately treated or under carefully monitored active surveillance, with clear PSA and exam follow-up plans and counseling about immunosuppression effects on monitoring, in alignment with KDIGO and EAU recommendations [^111u4CsT] [^112sRmho]. For intermediate- or high-risk disease, I should confirm definitive local control and consider an individualized cancer-free interval based on pathologic features and expected recurrence risk, recognizing that rigid, prolonged waiting can harm overall survival on dialysis and that evidence for fixed intervals is weak; this requires shared decision-making and center-specific policy harmonization given limited-quality data [^115Q8Ywk] [^117B5f4Q]. Throughout, I need to ensure that screening decisions are individualized to avoid unnecessary delays to listing, consistent with USPSTF guidance, and that any plan accounts for PSA assay interpretation in the setting of mTOR inhibitors and post-transplant immunosuppression [^111rsE6o] [^1171aRL9].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially implied that any history of prostate cancer might mandate a waiting period; hold on, I should verify and correct that. The current consensus is more nuanced: indolent prostate cancer, particularly Gleason ≤ 6 and organ-confined disease, does not automatically require delay, and transplant should not be postponed after appropriate treatment of low-stage or low-grade disease, which reframes the default stance for many candidates and underscores the need for risk-adapted pathways rather than blanket deferrals [^111u4CsT] [^112sRmho].

Prostate cancer is compatible with transplant candidacy when disease is low-risk and appropriately treated, with no mandatory waiting period [^116QAGYp] for Gleason ≤ 6 or low-stage/grade disease [^112sRmho]. For intermediate-risk disease, a 2-year disease-free interval is typical; for high-risk or metastatic disease, a 5-year interval is standard, with individualized decisions for oligometastatic cases. Active malignancy is a contraindication [^111u4CsT], and all candidates require multidisciplinary evaluation [^114kwrcc] and close post-transplant PSA surveillance [^116xE7gJ].

## Prostate cancer risk and recurrence in transplant recipients

In transplant recipients, there is an **increased risk** of cancer due to immunosuppression [^111LKQei], yet prostate cancer incidence remains similar to the general population. The **recurrence risk** after transplant is generally low — especially for low-risk disease [^117B5f4Q] — though immunosuppression may increase recurrence in higher-risk cases [^114SeAFk].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

### KDIGO 2020 guidelines

- **Low-risk disease**: No mandatory waiting period for Gleason ≤ 6, PSA < 10 ng/mL, clinical stage T1-T2a [^116QAGYp].

- **Intermediate-risk disease**: Typically a 2-year disease-free interval before listing.

- **High-risk disease**: Generally a 5-year disease-free interval; individualized decisions for oligometastatic disease.

- **Active malignancy**: Contraindicated except for indolent, low-grade cancers (e.g. Gleason ≤ 6) [^111u4CsT].

---

### EAU 2025 guidelines

- **No delay**: Do not delay transplantation [^112sRmho] for appropriately treated low-stage/grade prostate cancer.

- **Integrated care**: Refer to an integrated transplant urology center [^114kwrcc] for management and surveillance.

- **Anatomic planning**: Account for pelvic grafts and potential future transplants when planning prostate cancer treatment [^112M2qBy].

## Impact of prostate cancer stage and grade on transplant eligibility

| **Risk category** | **Gleason score** | **PSA level** | **Clinical stage** | **Recommended waiting period** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Low-risk | ≤ 6 | < 10 ng/mL | T1-T2a | No mandatory waiting period [^116QAGYp] [^112sRmho] |
| Intermediate-risk | 7 (3+4 or 4+3) | 10–20 ng/mL | T2b-T2c | 2 years disease-free |
| High-risk | ≥ 8 | > 20 ng/mL | ≥ T3 | 5 years disease-free |
| Metastatic | Any | Any | Any | Generally contraindicated [^111u4CsT] |

---

## Influence of immunosuppressive therapy

Tumor progression may be accelerated by **immunosuppression**, particularly in higher-risk disease [^114SeAFk], and **PSA monitoring** requires adjustment because sirolimus can lower PSA and potentially mask recurrence [^1171aRL9].

---

## Post-transplant outcomes and recurrence rates

Low-risk disease shows **low recurrence rates** comparable to non-transplant patients [^111LRdGi], whereas **intermediate/high-risk** disease carries a higher recurrence risk due to immunosuppression [^114SeAFk], necessitating careful selection and monitoring [^116YApr4].

---

## Special considerations and contraindications

Active malignancy is a **contraindication** [^111u4CsT] except for indolent, low-grade cancers. High-risk or metastatic prostate cancer is generally contraindicated, and multidisciplinary care is essential for individualized decisions and ongoing surveillance [^114kwrcc].

---

## Summary of key recommendations

- **Low-risk disease**: No mandatory waiting period; proceed with transplantation [^116QAGYp] [^112sRmho].

- **Intermediate-risk disease**: 2-year disease-free interval recommended.

- **High-risk disease**: 5-year disease-free interval generally required.

- **Active malignancy**: Contraindicated except for indolent, low-grade cancers [^111u4CsT].

- **Multidisciplinary evaluation**: Essential for all candidates [^114kwrcc].

### Testosterone replacement therapy after primary treatment for prostate cancer [^115L2aG4]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

A history of prostate cancer has been considered an absolute contraindication for testosterone supplementation. This study examined a cohort of hypogonadal patients treated with radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) for organ-confined prostate cancer to determine if testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) could be both efficacious and safely administered without causing tumor recurrence.

- **Materials and methods**: Ten hypogonadal patients previously treated with RRP for organ-confined prostate cancer were identified. They presented with low serum total testosterone (TT) and symptoms of hypogonadism after RRP. Patients had baseline serum determinations of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and TT, and began testosterone supplementation. Periodic assessments were conducted for changes in PSA and TT, along with symptomatic improvement using the hormone domain of the Extended Prostate Inventory Composite Health Related Quality of Life questionnaire.

- **Results**: At a median follow-up of 19 months, no patient had detectable PSA levels (greater than 0.1 ng/ml). TT increased significantly after starting TRT, from a mean ± SD of 197 ± 67 to 591 ± 180 ng/dl (p = 0.0002). The hormone domain of the Extended Prostate Inventory Composite Health Related Quality of Life questionnaire also increased significantly from 38 ± 5 to 49 ± 3 (p = 0.00005), primarily due to a decrease in hot flashes and an increase in energy levels.

- **Conclusions**: At a median of 19 months of TRT, hypogonadal patients with a history of prostate cancer experienced no PSA recurrence and had statistically significant improvements in TT and hypogonadism symptoms.

### Prostate cancer risk prediction based on complete prostate cancer family history [^11436d34]. The Prostate (2015). Low credibility.

The American Cancer Society estimates that 233,000 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer (PC) and 29,480 will die from it in 2014. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data suggest a 15.3% lifetime risk for men born today in the US, based on data from 2008 to 2010. The latest 2011 SEER analysis reports a prevalence of 2,707,821 men living with PC, with 98.9% surviving at least 5 years. The age-adjusted incidence is 147.8 new cases per 100,000 men per year. Screening for PC has been associated with substantial over-diagnosis and over-treatment but has been shown to reduce PC mortality.

Family history of PC is a substantial risk factor. Estimated risks typically consider only first-degree relatives or a less specific family history of close relatives. However, some studies have presented familial risks based on PC in extended families, including a familial risk assessment model. Herein, estimated risk for PC was based on the constellation of a male proband's affected first-, second-, and third-degree relatives, the number of affected individuals, age at diagnosis of affected relatives, and both paternal and maternal contributions. This analysis expands and refines published PC risk estimates based on family history and provides individualized risk estimates based on more complete knowledge of PC family history.

### Safety and clinical outcomes of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in kidney transplant patients: A systematic review [^114zsiAf]. Journal of Endourology (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the safety and outcomes of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) in renal transplant recipients (RTRs) based on available literature. A literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science with the keywords "robot", "prostatectomy", and "transplant". Three authors independently reviewed the records to select relevant articles, resolving any discrepancies through open discussion. Recorded parameters included patient age, prostate-specific antigen level, Gleason score, tumor stage, intraoperative and postoperative complications, length of stay, surgical margin status, and disease recurrence, if provided. We also reviewed the operative techniques and modifications/adjustments to standard port placements, incorporating our own case report into this review.

The results section indicates that we retrieved 10 articles reporting clinical data on RARP for kidney transplant patients, comprising 5 case series (level 4) and 5 case reports (level 4). In total, 35 kidney transplant recipients undergoing RARP were analyzed, including one case from our institution. None of the cases encountered major technical difficulties that precluded the operation. Technical modifications to the standard technique were described in 10 of the 11 articles, specifically including adaptations to port placement (54% of patients), development of the space of Retzius (60% of patients), and performance of lymphadenectomy. The mean operative time was 220 minutes. The perioperative complication rate was 17.1% (6 of 35 patients), with only one complication categorized as Clavien III or greater.

### Prostate cancer in renal transplant recipients [^114SeAFk]. Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

A retrospective multi-centre study was conducted to determine the characteristics of prostate cancer in renal transplant recipients (RTR) and to analyze the relation with immunosuppressive maintenance therapies. Patients from 19 French transplant centers diagnosed with prostate cancer at least 1 year after kidney transplantation were included in this study. Data regarding demographics, kidney transplantation, prostate cancer, and immunosuppressive treatment were analyzed.

Sixty-two patients met the eligibility criteria for this study. Thirty-eight patients (61.3%) received calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) and azathioprine (AZA) with or without steroids, twenty received CNI with or without steroids (32.2%), and four received CNI and mycophenolate mofetil (6.5%).

- **High-stage cancer incidence**: Patients with CNI and AZA immunosuppressive therapy presented more high-stage cancer (T3 and T4) compared to patients receiving CNI alone (47.5% versus 15%, respectively, P = 0.03).
- **Lymph node invasion**: A non-significant increase in lymph node invasion was found in patients receiving CNI and AZA compared to patients receiving CNI alone (21% versus 5%, P = 0.16).
- **Multivariate analysis**: The immunosuppressive regimen with CNI and AZA was the only independent risk factor for locally advanced disease (P = 0.007).

The results showed that RTR are at risk for early occurrence and for locally advanced prostate cancer, especially when they received a CNI and AZA maintenance immunosuppressive therapy.

### The what, when, and why of human prostate cancer xenografts [^116aC913]. The Prostate (2018). Low credibility.

Presently, approximately 85 serially transplantable human prostate cancer xenografts, spanning the phenotypic, epigenetic, and genetic heterogeneity seen clinically, are available in various laboratories worldwide. If distributed to the prostate cancer research community, these can provide an experimental platform for resolving the specificity versus generalizability of basic cancer biology principles, such as the credentialing of therapeutic molecular targets, and for validating translational approaches for prevention, diagnosis, and therapy. Thus, there is an urgent need to distribute the already established serially transplantable human prostate cancer xenografts and to develop robust methods for establishing new ones.

- **Methods**: To accelerate the development of such additional xenografts, particularly from patients treated with the newer standard of care agents (e.g. abiraterone, enzalutamide, cabazitaxel, alpharadin), a historical review of the field will be presented.

- **Results**: Over the last 50 years, multiple groups throughout the world have developed methods for the successful establishment of serially transplantable human prostate cancer xenografts using various immune deficient mice. These are summarized chronologically.

- **Conclusions and future**: With the ever-growing appreciation of the value of personalized medicine (also known as precision medicine), methods need to be developed that allow efficient and timely growth of primary patient-derived prostate cancer xenografts (PDXs). These can be used as "avatars" for defining optimal therapy for specific patients.

### A world-wide survey on kidney transplantation practices in breast cancer survivors: The need for new management guidelines [^1131oR24]. American Journal of Transplantation (2021). Low credibility.

Kidney transplantation reduces mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Decisions about performing kidney transplantation in the setting of a prior cancer are challenging, as cancer recurrence under immunosuppression can result in poor outcomes. For breast cancer, rapid advances in molecular characterization have allowed improved prognostication, which is not reflected in current guidelines.

We developed a 19-question survey to determine transplant surgeons' knowledge, practice, and attitudes regarding guidelines for kidney transplantation in women with breast cancer. Of the 129 respondents from 32 states and 14 countries, 74.8% felt that current guidelines are inadequate. Surgeons outside the United States were more likely to consider transplantation in a breast cancer patient without a waiting period (p = .017). Within the US, 29.2% of surgeons in the Western region would consider transplantation without a waiting period, compared to 3.6% of surgeons in the East (p = .004). Encouragingly, 90.4% of providers surveyed would consider eliminating wait-times for women with a low risk of cancer recurrence based on accurate predictions from molecular assays. These findings support the need for new guidelines incorporating individualized recurrence risk to improve the care of ESRD patients with breast cancer.

### Optimizing the role of androgen deprivation therapy in advanced prostate cancer: Challenges beyond the guidelines [^116MxzH6]. The Prostate (2020). Low credibility.

Importantly, the panel's recommendations were derived from a review of clinical trial data, publications, national guidelines, and expert opinion. The clinical trials, in particular, had varying entry criteria or outcomes, so many of the panel's recommendations should be prefaced by the assumption of "generally speaking", that is, patient-specific factors will also affect treatment decisions and thus may make the general recommendation suggested by the panel not applicable for a specific patient. Also, the authors recognize the importance of ongoing and future clinical trials and therefore recommend, whenever possible, encouraging patient enrollment in randomized, controlled trials, which are needed to further clarify when evidence-based data are lacking.

### The effect of sirolimus on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in male renal transplant recipients without prostate cancer [^1171aRL9]. American Journal of Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

In kidney recipients, the immunosuppressant sirolimus has been associated with a decreased incidence of de novo post-transplant malignancies, including prostate cancer. However, the effect of sirolimus on the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood level, an important prostate cancer screening tool, remains unknown. We studied male kidney recipients over 50 years old, transplanted from January 1994 to December 2006, without clinical evidence of prostate cancer. Pre- and post-transplant PSA levels were analyzed for 97 recipients (n = 19 on sirolimus and n = 78 on tacrolimus [control group]). Pretransplant PSA was similar for sirolimus versus tacrolimus recipients (mean, 1.8 versus 1.7 ng/mL, p = 0.89), but post-transplant PSA was significantly lower for recipients on sirolimus (mean, 0.9 versus 1.9 ng/mL, respectively, p < 0.001). The mean difference between pretransplant and post-transplant PSA was -0.9 ng/mL (50.0%, p = 0.006) for the sirolimus group versus +0.2 ng/mL (+11.8%, p = 0.24) for the tacrolimus group. By multivariate analysis, only pretransplant PSA and immunosuppression with sirolimus independently impacted post-transplant PSA. Our data strongly suggest that sirolimus is associated with a significant PSA decrease in kidney recipients. Future studies must investigate the clinical implications of our findings for the use of PSA for prostate cancer screening in male kidney recipients on sirolimus.

### Screening for prostate cancer: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^111rsE6o]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

With respect to screening and diagnosis for prostate cancer, specifically regarding indications for screening in the general population aged 55–69 years, the 2018 USPSTF guidelines recommend individualizing the decision to obtain screening. This involves a discussion of the potential benefits and harms of screening based on factors such as family history, race/ethnicity, comorbid medical conditions, patient values regarding the benefits and harms of screening, treatment-specific outcomes, and other health needs. Recognize that screening offers a small potential benefit by reducing the chance of death from prostate cancer in some males of this age group. However, many may experience potential harms of screening, including false-positive results requiring additional testing and possible prostate biopsy, overdiagnosis and overtreatment, and treatment complications such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Do not obtain screening in individuals who do not express a preference for it.

### WHO and when should we screen for prostate cancer? Interviews with key opinion leaders [^117LT3Nj]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

We also have considerable concerns with proposals, such as those made by Dr. Ilic, that doctors discuss the numerical results and methodological limitations of randomized screening trials with patients. We note that many issues in the interpretation of these trials are extremely complex — contamination, pre- vs. post-randomization consent, and time-dependent effect sizes, to name but three — with even experts struggling to grasp key points. Interpretation of trials also requires considerable numerical abilities: take, for instance, a risk reduction of 0.11 per 1,000 men or a number needed to screen of 781. It is also unclear how a man should integrate multiple conflicting risks and benefits into one discrete choice: agree to or decline a PSA test.

It is also interesting that many decision aids present virtually all possible downstream consequences of a PSA test, such as transient hematospermia from prostate biopsy or pulmonary embolism after surgery. We note that doing so is far outside typical medical practice. Is there any other routine screening test for which we have these types of complex discussions? Take the following imaginary conversation between a doctor and, for example, a 55-year-old man presenting for a general health check: "Mr. Jones, before I draw your blood or put the cuff around your arm, I should warn you that in the event you have high cholesterol or high blood pressure, you may, in the future, need medication, such as a statin for high cholesterol, or a diuretic, ACE-inhibitor, β-blocker, or calcium channel blocker for high blood pressure".

### Screening for prostate cancer: A guidance statement from the Clinical Guidelines Committee of the American College of Physicians [^113yDtR1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is an important health problem in men. It rarely causes death in men younger than 50 years; most deaths associated with it occur in men older than 75 years. The benefits of screening with the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test are outweighed by the harms for most men. In a considerable proportion of men with prostate cancer detected with the PSA test, the cancer never becomes clinically significant in their lifetime. They will receive no benefit and are subject to substantial harms from the treatment of prostate cancer.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guidance statement for clinicians by assessing prostate cancer screening guidelines developed by other organizations. ACP believes that it is more valuable to provide clinicians with a rigorous review of available guidelines rather than develop a new guideline on the same topic when several guidelines are available or when existing guidelines conflict. The purpose of this guidance statement is to critically review available guidelines to help guide internists and other clinicians in making decisions about screening for prostate cancer. The target patient population for this guidance statement is all adult men.

This guidance statement is derived from an appraisal of available guidelines on screening for prostate cancer. Authors searched the National Guideline Clearinghouse to identify prostate cancer screening guidelines in the United States and selected four developed by the American College of Preventive Medicine and the American Cancer Society.

### Radical prostatectomy outcomes in renal transplant recipients: a retrospective case series of Thai patients [^113uHE7B]. BMC Urology (2021). Low credibility.

The incidence of prostate cancer in renal transplant recipients (RTRs) is similar to the general population. Radical prostatectomy (RP) is the standard of care in the management of clinically localized cancer, but is considered complicated due to the presence of adhesions and the location of transplanted ureter and kidney. At the time of writing, a few case series or studies on RP in RTRs have been published, especially in Asian patients. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety and report the experience with RP on RTRs.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed data of 1270 patients who underwent RP from January 2008 to March 2020, of which 5 patients were RTRs. All available baseline characteristics, perioperative and postoperative data (operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), complications, length of hospital stay, complication), pathological stage, Gleason score, surgical margin status, and pre/postoperative creatinine were reviewed.

- **Results**: Of the 5 RTRs who underwent RPs (1 open radical prostatectomy (ORP), 1 laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP), 2 robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomies (RALRP), and 1 Retzius-sparing RALRP (RS-RALRP)), the mean age (± SD) was 70 (± 5.62) years. In LRP and RALRP cases, the standard ports were moved slightly medially to prevent graft injury. The mean operative time ranged from 190 to 365 minutes. The longest operative time and highest EBL (630 ml) was in the ORP case due to severe adhesion in Retzius space. For LRP and RALRP cases, the operative times seemed comparable and had EBL of ≤ 300 ml.

### Testosterone therapy in men with prostate cancer [^115tebQi]. European Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Use of testosterone therapy in men with prostate cancer was previously contraindicated, although recent data challenge this axiom. Over the past two decades, there has been a dramatic paradigm shift in beliefs, attitudes, and treatment of testosterone deficiency in men with prostate cancer.

- **Objective**: To summarize and analyze literature regarding the effect of testosterone replacement in men with prostate cancer.

- **Evidence acquisition**: We conducted a Medline search to identify all publications related to testosterone therapy in both treated and untreated prostate cancer.

- **Evidence synthesis**: The historical notion that increasing testosterone was responsible for prostate cancer growth was based on elegant yet limited studies from the 1940s and anecdotal case reports. Evidence reveals that high endogenous androgen levels do not increase the risk of a prostate cancer diagnosis. Similarly, testosterone therapy in men with testosterone deficiency does not appear to increase prostate cancer risk or the likelihood of a more aggressive disease at prostate cancer diagnosis. Androgen receptor saturation (the saturation model) appears to account for this phenomenon. Men who received testosterone therapy after treatment for localized prostate cancer do not appear to suffer higher rates of recurrence or worse outcomes, although studies at the time of writing are limited. Early reports of men on active surveillance/watchful waiting treated with testosterone have not identified adverse progression events.

- **Conclusions**: An improved understanding of the negative effects of testosterone therapy in men with prostate cancer is essential.

### Impact of family history on oncological outcomes in primary therapy for localized prostate cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1171sEHZ]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

- **Results**: Overall, 316 articles were identified from the search query, of which 232 articles were removed after title and abstract assessment. An additional 73 articles were excluded after full-text evaluation. Finally, the remaining 11 articles were included in the systematic review and 8 articles in the qualitative meta-analysis.

- **Study selection**: No unpublished study was identified by the Gray Literature search. The study selection process involved analysis to determine the impact of family history on oncological outcomes.

Jatenzo is contraindicated in the following groups:

- **Men with breast cancer or known or suspected prostate cancer**: It is advised not to administer Jatenzo to men with carcinoma of the breast or known or suspected carcinoma of the prostate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Women who are pregnant**: Administration of testosterone can cause virilization of the female fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

- **Men with known hypersensitivity to Jatenzo or any of its ingredients**: Avoid use if there is a known hypersensitivity [see Description (11)].

Testosterone may cause fetal harm [see sections (4), (5.6), (8.1), (8.2)].

### Pre-transplant malignancy is associated with increased risk of de novo malignancy post-lung transplantation [^112rQgjD]. Respiratory Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

At least 20% of lung transplant recipients will be diagnosed with a malignancy within 5 years of transplant. Transplant candidates with a history of pre-transplant malignancy must meet remission criteria before listing to minimize the risk of recurrence; however, these patients may have an intrinsic predisposition to developing subsequent cancers, which can be amplified by immunosuppression. We assessed whether pre-transplant malignancy was associated with an increased risk of developing malignancy of any type after lung transplant.

- **Methods**: We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing lung transplant between January 2006 and December 2017. We used a proportional hazards regression model to test whether pre-transplant malignancy (preTM) was associated with the risk of developing one or more post-transplant malignancies (postTM) after lung transplant, adjusted for known cancer risk factors.

- **Results**: 497 adult patients underwent lung transplantation during the study period, and 26 (5.2%) had pre-transplant malignancies. Out of 29 pre-transplant cancer diagnoses, prostate cancer was the most common (17.2%), followed by breast cancer and basal cell carcinoma (13.8% each). 108 (22%) patients developed post-transplant malignancy with a total of 328 cancer diagnoses. The most common post-transplant malignancy was non-melanoma skin cancer (86.3%), followed by solid organ cancers (7.6%). Pre-transplant malignancy was associated with an adjusted hazard ratio of 3.24 (95% CI 1.71 to 6.14, p < 0.001) for the development of post-transplant malignancy.

The recurrence of the pre-transplant malignancy only occurred in a limited number of cases.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on liver transplantation [^112RFjW1]. Journal of Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for liver transplantation, particularly in the context of graft use from donors with cancer, the EASL 2024 guidelines recommend conducting a risk assessment. This assessment should compare the risk of cancer transmission from a donor with a known history of cancer to the risk of death while waiting for a suitable graft that does not carry such risks. The decision to proceed with transplantation should be made if the risk of death on the waiting list outweighs the risk of cancer transmission. Furthermore, it is essential that the recipient provides informed consent.

### National comprehensive cancer network guidelines for the management of prostate cancer [^117BD2HT]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the management of prostate cancer issued by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network provide a basis for rational treatment decisions. These guidelines represent consensus recommendations by a panel of experts that are evidence-based and are designated according to the degree of consensus within the expert panel.

The initial stratification point is the patient's life expectancy (> 5 or 5 years). The recommended intervention is based on clinical stage, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and Gleason score, as well as the presence of symptoms. These assessments establish the patient's risk of recurrence after therapy. Specific initial therapies are then recommended according to whether the risk category is low, intermediate, high, or very high.

The guidelines also describe the appropriate use of observation ("watchful waiting") versus active intervention in certain patients. After definitive therapy, patients should be monitored with PSA determinations, digital rectal examination, and bone scans as outlined in the guidelines. Patients who exhibit increasing PSA levels after prostatectomy are candidates for salvage therapy with androgen ablation, radiotherapy, or observation. If PSA levels begin to increase after radiotherapy, surgery may then be an additional option.

Systemic salvage therapy generally consists of androgen ablation; the benefit of total androgen blockade versus initial monotherapy remains controversial. Relapse after initial androgen ablation is treated with an antiandrogen, if none had been administered previously.

### Radical retropubic prostatectomy in immunosuppressed transplant recipients [^111LRdGi]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Surgical treatment of transplant recipients in whom prostate cancer subsequently develops has been reported only sporadically in the literature. We reviewed our experience with radical retropubic prostatectomy in patients with solid organ transplants.

- **Materials and methods**: Using our prostatectomy registry, we identified 17 patients who underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy between 1988 and 2005 following organ transplantation. Clinicopathological features and outcome data were reviewed.

- **Results**: Kidney, liver, and heart transplants were performed before radical retropubic prostatectomy in 9, 7, and 3 patients, respectively. The median age at transplant and the time of radical retropubic prostatectomy was 51 (range 37 to 65) and 59 years (range 45 to 70), respectively. Median prostate-specific antigen was 5.8 (range 2.6 to 12.9) and all patients had clinically localized disease. Ten patients had a pathological Gleason score of 6 while the remaining had Gleason scores of 7 or greater. No patient had positive lymph nodes, and only 2 patients had pT3a or greater disease. Early complications included wound infection in 2 (12%) patients along with hematoma and myocardial infarction in 1 (6%) patient each. Late complications included incontinence (1 or more pads per day) in 2 patients while no patient had a hernia, bladder neck contracture, venous thrombosis, or lymphocele. With a median follow-up of 4.9 years, biochemical recurrence developed in 1 patient and no patient had systemic progression or death due to prostate cancer.

- **Conclusions**: To our knowledge, we report the largest series to date of radical retropubic prostatectomy in immunosuppressed transplant recipients.

### Utility of prostate cancer screening in kidney transplant candidates [^116opHRA]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Screening recommendations for prostate cancer remain controversial, and no specific guidelines exist for screening in renal transplant candidates. To examine whether the use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening in patients with ESRD affects time to transplantation and transplant outcomes, we retrospectively analyzed 3,782 male patients aged 18 years and older undergoing primary renal transplant evaluation during a 10-year period.

Patients were grouped by age according to American Urological Association screening guidelines: group 1 consisted of patients aged ≤ 54 years, group 2 consisted of patients aged 55–69 years, and group 3 consisted of patients aged over 69 years. A positive screening test result was defined as a PSA level > 4 ng/ml. We used univariate analysis and Cox proportional hazards models to identify the independent effect of screening on transplant waiting times, patient survival, and graft survival.

Screening was performed in 63.6% of candidates, and 1,198 candidates (31.7%) received kidney transplants. PSA screening was not associated with improved patient survival after transplantation (P = 0.24). However, it did increase the time to listing and transplantation for candidates in groups 1 and 2 who had a positive screening result (P < 0.05). Furthermore, compared with candidates who were not screened, PSA-screened candidates had a reduced likelihood of receiving a transplant regardless of the screening outcome (P < 0.001).

These data strongly suggest that PSA screening for prostate cancer may be more harmful than protective in renal transplant candidates because it does not appear to confer a survival benefit to these candidates.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for prostate cancer: The need for a unified approach [^112shr6s]. Current Opinion in Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines are increasingly recognized as critically important to evidence-based practice. This article reviews the different approaches used by leading urological organizations in the development of prostate cancer guidelines. It introduces the recommendations of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) working group as a unified approach to guideline development.

Clinical guidelines on the management of prostate cancer demonstrate major methodological differences, most notably concerning the systems used to grade the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations. The GRADE approach classifies the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low, based on factors such as study design, execution, and the consistency of results. It classifies recommendations as strong or weak according to the balance between benefits and downsides and the degree of confidence in estimates of the downsides.

There is an urgent need to standardize processes used to develop clinical guidelines for the management of patients with prostate cancer by leading urological organizations. Adoption of the GRADE approach would offer considerable rewards in terms of efficiency, guideline credibility, and optimal clinical decision-making.

### Outcomes in transplant patients undergoing brachytherapy for prostate cancer [^115CJiKH]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

To determine the failure rate of brachytherapy as definitive treatment for localized prostate cancer in transplant and otherwise immunosuppressed patients compared with patients not undergoing immunosuppressive therapy, a retrospective study was conducted. This study included 314 patients treated with brachytherapy for prostate cancer between July 1995 and March 2007. Among these patients, 7 were previously transplanted and currently on immunosuppression (4 heart transplants, 3 renal transplants), and 10 were on immunosuppression for other medical conditions. Outcomes were defined by both the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) and the Phoenix definitions of biochemical failure.

The mean patient age at implant was 67.3 ± 7.3 years, and the mean follow-up was 7.5 ± 2.8 years, with a minimum follow-up of 3 years. In the nonimmunosuppressed group, a 15.8% failure rate by the ASTRO definition and a 13.6% rate by the Phoenix definition were observed. When excluding patients with previous external beam radiation and/or neoadjuvant hormone therapy, a 13.6% failure rate by the ASTRO definition and an 11.4% rate by the Phoenix definition were observed. Within the transplanted patient subset, failure rates by both ASTRO and Phoenix definitions were 14.3%. For all immunosuppressed patients, failure rates were 11.8% by both definitions. While performing a Fisher exact test, there was no statistical difference in failure rates between all groups by either definition of failure.

### Potential for overlooked melanoma in solid organ donors with a severely dysplastic nevus [^115859pJ]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A recent malignancy is a contraindication to organ donation due to the risk of transmission. Given the profound organ shortage in the United States, transplant surgeons frequently consider potential deceased organ donors with a remote history of malignancy. However, a diagnosis of melanoma at any time is an absolute contraindication to organ donation. Melanoma is one of the cancers most commonly transmitted from donor to recipient, likely related to its pathophysiology.

The behavior of melanoma can be modulated by immunity; it can remain dormant in the donor and then reactivate in the recipient due to the intense immunosuppression required to prevent rejection. The first described case of melanoma transmitted from donor to recipient occurred in 1961. Part of a melanoma was purposefully transmitted from a daughter to her mother, hoping the mother would develop antibodies against it that could be transmitted back to the daughter. Melanoma developed in the mother, and she died about a year later.

Buell et al. reported that melanoma initially present in the donor has a 74% transmission rate and a 58% mortality rate for organ transplant recipients. Several reports indicate that donor-derived melanoma can be transmitted to some or all of the subsequent organ transplant recipients. Because melanoma transmission is a significant risk, all potential donors undergo skin evaluation before organ allocation.

In contrast, potential organ donors with a history of basal cell carcinoma or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma are considered differently.

### Breast cancer screening and solid organ transplantation [^116Bdjsu]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

Solid organ transplantation volumes in the United States have been steadily increasing over the past decade. Rigorous evaluation of potential transplant recipients must be performed to ensure appropriate allocation of solid organs for transplant. Because active malignancy is a contraindication for most solid organ transplantations, appropriate cancer screening should be included as part of the pretransplant assessment for both potential transplant recipients and donors. This article provides a summary of the state of solid organ transplant-related breast cancer screening in the United States.

### Robotic radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer in renal transplant recipients: Results from a multicenter series [^1161JEUt]. European Urology (2022). Low credibility.

Despite an expected increase in prostate cancer (PCa) incidence in the renal transplant recipient (RTR) population in the near future, robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) in these patients has been poorly detailed. It is not well understood whether results are comparable to RARP in the non-RTR setting.

- **Objective**: To describe the surgical technique for RARP in RTR and report results from our multi-institutional experience.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This was a retrospective review of the experience of four referral centers.

- **Surgical procedure**: Transperitoneal RARP with pelvic lymph node dissection in selected patients.

- **Measurements**: We measured patient, PCa, and graft baseline features; intraoperative and postoperative parameters; complications (Clavien classification); and oncological and functional outcomes.

- **Results and limitations**: We included 41 men. The median age, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, preoperative renal function, and prostate-specific antigen were 60 years (interquartile range [IQR] 57–64), 2 points (IQR 2–3), 45 ml/min (IQR 30–62), and 6.5 ng/ml (IQR 5.2–10.2), respectively. Four men (9.8%) had a biopsy Gleason score > 7. The majority of the patients (70.7%) did not undergo lymphadenectomy. The median operating time, hospital stay, and catheterization time were 201 minutes (IQR 170–250), 4 days (IQR 2–6), and 10 days (IQR 7–13), respectively. At final pathology, 11 men had extraprostatic extension and seven had positive surgical margins. At median follow-up of 42 months (IQR 24–65), four men had biochemical recurrence, including.

### Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in a renal allograft recipient [^11133Zkb]. Urology (2006). Low credibility.

In the era of immunosuppression, most renal transplant recipients with a functioning allograft are living healthier and longer lives. In men, due to prostate-specific antigen screening, more patients are diagnosed with early prostate cancer and offered curative treatment with radical prostatectomy. Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is recognized as a minimally invasive treatment for middle-aged men with organ-confined prostate cancer. To our knowledge, laparoscopic prostatectomy has not yet been reported in renal transplant recipients. This is a case report of laparoscopic prostatectomy for biopsy-proven localized prostate cancer in a renal transplant recipient.

### Evaluation and active treatment versus active surveillance of localized prostate cancer in renal transplant patients in the era of low and very low risk prostate cancer [^115Q8Ywk]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Low credibility.

Trends in renal transplantation, such as improved allograft/recipient survival and expanded organ transplantation eligibility criteria in older recipients, are concomitant with increasingly detected low-risk prostate cancer in candidates for, or recipients of renal transplantation. We reviewed the evidence regarding prostate cancer screening, diagnosis, and management in renal transplant candidates and recipients. Our focus was on published reports of prostate cancer incidence and diagnosis in patients with end-stage renal disease, pretransplant screening recommendations, and recommendations regarding waiting time between treatment and active waitlisting after prostate cancer diagnosis in renal transplant candidates. Additionally, we examined the natural history of prostate cancer development after renal transplantation in the setting of standard immunosuppression.

- **Materials and methods**: We reviewed the English language literature using search terms including prostate cancer, end-stage renal disease, renal transplantation, prostate cancer screening, prostate-specific antigen, prostate cancer treatment, and active surveillance in various combinations.

- **Results**: Prostate cancer screening is still widely done in almost all patients with end-stage renal disease before and after transplantation. Active treatment of any patients with prostate cancer and a 5-year waiting period before transplantation can negatively affect the collective pool of participants and the overall survival of patients on dialysis. Several groups have proposed a shorter waiting time.

### Increased risk of postoperative in-hospital complications after radical prostatectomy in patients with prior organ transplant [^116YApr4]. The Prostate (2021). High credibility.

This study aims to analyze postoperative, in-hospital complication rates in patients who have undergone organ transplantation before radical prostatectomy (RP).

- **Methods**: From the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database (2000–2015), prostate cancer patients treated with RP were abstracted and stratified according to prior organ transplant versus nontransplant. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to predict in-hospital complications.

- **Results**: Of all eligible 202,419 RP patients, 216 (0.1%) underwent RP after prior organ transplantation. Patients who had undergone transplantation exhibited higher proportions of Charlson comorbidity index ≥ 2 (13.0% vs. 3.0%) and obesity (9.3% vs. 5.6%, both p < 0.05) compared to nontransplant RP patients. Among transplant RP patients, 96 underwent kidney (44.4%), 44 heart (20.4%), 40 liver (18.5%), 30 bone marrow (13.9%), less than 11 lung (< 5%), and less than 11 pancreatic (< 5%) transplantation before RP. The rates of lymph node dissection in transplant RP patients ranged from 37.5% (kidney transplant) to 60.0% (bone marrow transplant, p < 0.01) versus 51% in nontransplant patients. Regarding in-hospital complications, transplant patients more frequently exhibited diabetes (31.5% vs. 11.6%, p < 0.001), major cardiac complications (7.9% vs. 2.9%, p = 0.01), and acute kidney failure (5.1% vs. 0.9%, p < 0.001) compared to nontransplant RP patients. In multivariable logistic regression models, transplant RP patients were at higher risk of acute kidney failure (odds ratio [OR]: 4.83), diabetes (OR: 2.81), major intraoperative complications (OR: 2.39), cardiac complications (OR: 2.16), transfusions (OR: 1.37), and overall complications.

### Hormone therapy in men and risk of cardiac allograft rejection [^112iFZw4]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Hormone therapy with leuprolide acetate (Lupron) is frequently used to treat prostate cancer, a common malignancy expected to be diagnosed in over 180,000 men in the United States this year. In addition, testosterone supplementation is frequently recommended for adult men with reduced libido or impotence and decreased serum levels of testosterone. Although these hormone therapies are generally considered benign, we describe three cases of acute cardiac rejection temporally associated with the use of these drugs in men who have undergone cardiac transplantation. To our knowledge, this is the first such description of this phenomenon in the literature.

### Prostate cancer screening and treatment in the transplant population: Current status and recommendations [^1177VHrk]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

We reviewed the status of and recommendations for prostate cancer screening and treatment in the solid organ transplant population.

- **Materials and methods**: We performed a MEDLINE search to identify published data regarding prostate cancer screening, risk, treatment, and outcomes in the solid organ transplant population. The literature was reviewed and summarized.

- **Results**: Most data regarding outcomes of prostate cancer treatment in the transplant population are limited to case reports and small series, primarily involving renal insufficiency. It does not appear that the development or natural history of prostate cancer is significantly affected by organ failure or subsequent transplantation. Thus, prostate-specific antigen testing and screening protocols can be extrapolated from the general population. However, the balance of comorbid diseases and estimated limitations in life expectancy must be carefully considered, and emphasis should be placed on risk assessment. Prostatectomy appears to be feasible with outcomes comparable to those in the non-transplant population, while data regarding the use of radiation therapy are limited.

- **Conclusions**: The expansion of organ transplant criteria, including older donors and recipients, combined with improved allograft survival, has enhanced the relevance of prostate cancer screening and treatment in this group. Greater awareness of the issues surrounding prostate cancer incidence, detection, and natural history should promote improved data collection, screening, and treatment of prostate cancer in the transplant population.

### Prostate cancer. NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116fuhvn]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2004). Low credibility.

The intention of these guidelines is to provide a framework on which to base treatment decisions. Prostate cancer is a complex disease with many controversial aspects of management and a dearth of sound data to support treatment recommendations. Several variables, including life expectancy, disease characteristics, predicted outcomes, and patient preferences, must be considered by the patient and physician in tailoring prostate cancer therapy to the individual.

### Guidelines for genetic testing in prostate cancer: a scoping review [^1161qcN5]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Data extraction was conducted using a data extraction tool developed by the reviewers. This tool included specific details about the guideline details: organization, year, country of origin, criteria for genetic testing for men at risk or at different stages of prostate cancer, recommended test and genes tested, and level and/or strength of evidence. To address heterogeneity in the strength of recommendation ratings and facilitate comparison across guidelines, the rating instruments (excluding expert opinion only) used in different guidelines and consensus statements were mapped to the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) grades of recommendation.

Summary data were extracted for reporting in the scoping review. Both reviewers extracted data from full-text inclusions as a quality assurance measure, resolving any disagreements through discussion.

Throughout the review, several abbreviations were used, including PCa for prostate cancer, NCCN for the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and several terms relevant to genetic testing and prostate cancer management. For instance, FDR refers to first-degree relative, SDR to second-degree relative, and TDR to third-degree relative. Other important abbreviations included LS for Lynch Syndrome, N1 for advanced to nearby lymph nodes, MSI-H for microsatellite instability-high, and MMR for mismatch repair genes, amongst others related to tumor characterization and genetic repair mechanisms.

### Optimizing the role of androgen deprivation therapy in advanced prostate cancer: Challenges beyond the guidelines [^111PDFe5]. The Prostate (2020). Low credibility.

There were several limitations to this consensus panel and its recommendations:

- **Panel composition**: This panel was chosen subjectively, based on clinician experience, research interests, and publication history. It did not include a radiation oncologist, which might have added an important perspective to some of the discussions.

- **Study selection**: The studies reviewed for these recommendations were not selected by a formal literature review but by the knowledge and expertise of the panel subcommittee members. In the medical literature, there is a lack of level 1 evidence to make conclusive statements about ADT use in all settings.

- **Reliance on expertise**: In instances lacking solid evidence, the panel members based their recommendations on their expertise and clinical experience.

- **Field developments**: This field is rapidly evolving based on new clinical trial data and developing technologies; hence, these recommendations will likely need to be updated every 2 to 3 years.

A 68-year-old man with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and widespread bone metastases, along with a history of kidney transplant, underwent five cycles of Lu-prostate-specific membrane antigen 617 therapies in our department. Being more cautious of the radiation burden imposed on the transplanted kidney, a lower average dose of 4 GBq per cycle was administered, instead of the more routine 6.0–7.4 GBq per cycle. However, an excellent response was noted, and the serum creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL remained stable.

### Radical prostatectomy outcomes in renal transplant recipients: a retrospective case series of Thai patients [^114188in]. BMC Urology (2021). Low credibility.

Although there have been improvements in transplantation techniques and post-transplantation care, cancer remains a major adverse feature in renal transplant recipients (RTR). The prevalence of prostate cancer in RTR is similar to that of the general population. However, some studies indicate that genitourinary cancer is the second most common cancer in RTR, with prostate cancer being the fifth most common cancer with a prevalence ranging from 0.72% to 3.1%. In Thailand, the incidence of prostate cancer has been increasing and is impactful, holding its place as the fifth most common cancer among Thai men.

The prognosis and natural history of prostate cancer in RTR are not associated with worse outcomes compared to non-RTR. Standard treatments should be considered for this population, with satisfying surgical and oncological outcomes. There are several treatments for prostate cancer, including active surveillance, radical prostatectomy (RP), radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, and watchful waiting. Each option is viable and should be a shared decision with patients.

In our experience, RP should not be avoided in selected patients, even those with a history of abdominal surgery. Some previous literature has shown that prior abdominal surgery does not impact surgical outcomes and complications. Even though there are potential risks of injury due to smaller working space, adhesion, and transplanted renal and ureter, the surgery itself is possible. Moreover, a systematic review also indicated that RP is the preferred treatment for localized prostate cancer.

Despite these difficulties, multiple approaches to radical prostatectomy, including retropubic, perineal, and laparoscopic methods, have been described.

All renal transplant recipients should have regular ultrasonography of their native kidneys (when applicable) for screening of renal cell carcinomas, which are observed at a much higher incidence in both dialyzed and transplant patients. Guidelines published for screening and prevention of solid organ cancers in the general population should be strictly applied to transplant recipients, who are, in general, at higher cancer risk but would benefit equally or even more.

- **Prostate cancer screening for men**: All male renal transplant recipients aged 50 and over should have a yearly prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test prior to a regular digital rectal examination.
- **Cervical and breast cancer screening for women**: All female renal transplant recipients should have a yearly cervical (PAP) smear together with regular pelvic examination and regular mammography, according to national recommendations where available.
- **Colorectal cancer screening**: All renal transplant recipients should undergo fecal occult-blood testing as a screening for colorectal cancer and other (pre-malignant) lesions, according to national recommendations where available.
- **Immunosuppression adjustment**: In all these conditions, it is recommended to reduce immunosuppression whenever possible.

### Management of localized prostate cancer by retropubic radical prostatectomy in patients after renal transplantation [^112MLHHU]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2010). Low credibility.

The study aimed to report our experience with retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) for the treatment of localized prostate cancer in renal transplant recipients (RTR).

- **Methods**: Data of 16 RTR who had an RRP between 2001 and 2007 were retrospectively analyzed and compared to the data of 294 non-transplanted patients who were operated on for RRP during the same period. Diagnostic work-up consisted of digital rectal examination, serum prostate-specific antigen levels, as well as transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy. Follow-up was obtained in all patients, with a mean follow-up time of 2.1 years in RTR.

- **Results**: The mean time from renal transplantation to the time of RRP was 81.2 ± 19.1 months. RRP was successfully performed and tolerated in all RTR without pelvic lymph node dissection. No major complications occurred during or after the operation. There were two minor complications in the transplant group (prolonged haematuria and urinary leakage). The mean operative time was 108.3 ± 3.9 minutes in the transplant group, which was significantly longer than in the non-transplanted group (89.1 ± 4.1 minutes, P < 0.05). The mean estimated intra-operative blood loss was significantly lower in the transplant group (P < 0.05). In RTR, one case of positive surgical margins was present (R(1): 6.2% vs. 12.3% in the non-transplanted group, P < 0.05). None of the RTR had impairment of graft function. At follow-up, no case of biochemical recurrence was observed in RTR.

- **Conclusions**: RRP is safe and feasible for the management of localized prostate cancer in patients with a kidney allograft.

### WHO and when should we screen for prostate cancer? Interviews with key opinion leaders [^116voEta]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

What are the gaps in our understanding of the natural history of prostate cancer? We need a tool that can clearly indicate whether a man has a disease that will cause significant morbidity and death during his natural lifetime. We also need randomized trials that demonstrate how well our primary treatments, namely surgery and radiation, work to alter the natural course of prostate cancer; there is no substitute for this information.

A Vickers and S Carlsson: One of the problems with waiting for new data is that it is rarely as definitive as anticipated. You say that the "ProTECT trial should provide important new data" in 2016, but that will be pretty early data — only 10 years of follow-up — and does not reflect best practice: a single PSA when a man is in his 50s or 60s, surgery from low-volume surgeons, and relatively low-dose radiotherapy. As regards the treatment trial in ProTECT, about three quarters of patients have low-grade disease, which we now believe should not be treated at all. Do you really think that ProTECT will provide enough data about screening and treatment to move forward with practice recommendations?

- **Family history of prostate cancer**: Recommended screening for individuals over 45 years of age.
- **African-Americans**: Recommended screening for individuals over 45 years of age.

### The Lancet commission on prostate cancer: Planning for the surge in cases [^117MWfX6]. Lancet (2024). High credibility.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer by incidence in men in 112 countries (as of 2020), accounting for one in every 14 cancers diagnosed globally and 15% of all male cancers. Among men, the disease ranks second only to lung cancer in terms of cancer mortality.

The prostate gland is situated at the base of the bladder, and its basic function is to provide the seminal fluid that nourishes and supports spermatozoa in transit from the testicles during ejaculation. Cancers arise in the lining epithelium of the prostate gland. They range from low-grade tumors that require no treatment to rapidly growing, highly lethal cancers. The biology underlying this broad range of cancer behavior, from indolent to highly lethal, is only partly understood.

Overdiagnosis of clinically trivial disease potentially leads to overtreatment and harm, whereas late diagnosis of potentially lethal disease is a major, and growing, cause of morbidity and premature death, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Treatment of prostate cancer is determined by stage (i.e. TNM tumor classification) and tumor grade (i.e. Gleason grading), and also depends on PSA concentrations and the age and broader health of the patient. Gleason grading goes from 1 (low) to 5 (high), although scores of 1 and 2 are now rarely used, and 3 is the lowest grade in clinical use. The system has purposefully not been updated to enable back comparison to historical series.

- **Screening for cancer**: We suggest that the organization of screening for neoplasia in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) take into account several factors:

	- Screening should be similar to the general population for cervical, breast, colon, and prostate cancer (2C). Screening is not recommended for renal cell carcinoma (2C).
	- Patient education should occur pre- and post-transplantation (1C). Patients should be aware of malignancy risk and encouraged to report symptoms which may represent de novo malignancy, such as breast or testicular lumps (2D).
	- Skin surveillance by a healthcare professional is recommended at least biannually up to 5 years post-transplant and annually from 5 years post-transplant onward (2C).
	- Patients with cirrhosis should undergo an annual hepatic ultrasound and determination of serum alpha-fetoprotein (2C).

- **Audit Measure**: Proportion of patients having screening procedures for neoplasia at the annual review clinic.

- **Rationale**: The merits of any screening program must balance the individual's risk of developing the disease, their prognosis if detected, and the risk of harm from screening. Screening should be individualized and reflect co-morbidities and other competing risks, such as vascular disease. Some authors have advocated more frequent screening, such as annual cervical screening, but there is little evidence to support these assertions. Thus, screening should follow the pattern in the general population for most common cancers. The national cancer screening protocols are described on the NHS Cancer Screening Programme (NHSCSP) website. Patient education regarding neoplasia should be undertaken pre-transplant, with reinforcement post-transplant.

### The risk of tumour recurrence in patients undergoing renal transplantation for end-stage renal disease after previous treatment for a urological cancer: A systematic review [^117B5f4Q]. European Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Renal transplantation is the gold standard renal replacement therapy in end-stage renal disease owing to its superior survival and quality of life compared with dialysis. When the potential recipient has a history of cancer, the waiting period before renal transplantation is usually based on the Cincinnati Registry. This systematic review aims to evaluate the risk of cancer recurrence in end-stage renal disease patients with a history of urological cancer.

Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched up to March 2017 for relevant publications reporting oncologic outcomes of urological cancer in patients who subsequently received transplantation or remained on dialysis. The primary outcome was time to tumour recurrence. Secondary outcomes included cancer-specific and overall survival. Data were narratively synthesised considering methodological and clinical heterogeneity, and the risk of bias for each included study was assessed.

Thirty-two retrospective studies enrolling 2519 patients (1733 on dialysis, 786 who underwent renal transplantation) were included. For renal cell carcinomas, the risks of recurrence, cancer-specific, and overall survival were similar between transplantation and dialysis. For prostate cancer, most of the tumours had favourable prognoses consistent with nomograms. Studies dealing with urothelial carcinomas (UCs) mainly included upper urinary tract UC in the context of aristolochic acid nephropathy, where the risks of synchronous bilateral tumour and recurrence were high.

### Prostate cancer incidence and mortality in men exposed to α1-adrenergic receptor antagonists [^116jdrTw]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2024). High credibility.

Prostate cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men in the United States. Guidelines from the American Urological Association strongly recommend shared decision-making for men aged 55 to 69 years considering prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening, weighing the benefits of reducing the rate of metastatic prostate cancer and prevention of prostate cancer death against the known potential harms associated with screening and treatment. There are currently no Food and Drug Administration–approved or European Medicines Agency–approved medications for prostate cancer chemoprevention.

Emerging data from cellular and preclinical models indicate that α1-adrenergic receptor antagonists have additional effects related to inducing apoptosis and suppressing prostate tumor growth and metastasis. Epidemiological evidence has thus far been inconclusive regarding the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer among α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist users.

More than two decades have passed since the initial discovery of the molecular and cell-level effects of α1-adrenergic receptor antagonists on prostate tumor growth. However, the impact of these medications on clinical prostate cancer incidence and progression in men remains largely undefined and poorly understood. Considering the conflicting evidence, the primary aim of this large, population-based cohort study was to investigate the possible relationship between the use of α1-adrenergic receptor antagonists and prostate cancer mortality (PCM) as well as its impact on prostate cancer incidence.

### Radical retropubic prostatectomy after orthotopic liver transplantation [^116AV4p1]. Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Radical prostatectomy is a standard treatment option for many patients with clinically localized prostate cancer; however, little information about its safety and efficacy is available to help guide patients who have undergone prior organ transplantation. We present two cases of patients with prior hepatic transplantation who each subsequently underwent radical prostatectomy. In each case, the prostate tumor was organ-confined, and both patients were biochemically free of disease at last follow-up.

### Impact of family history on oncological outcomes in primary therapy for localized prostate cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Jc7B4]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the impact of family history on oncological outcomes in localized prostate cancer (PCa). In the meta-analysis, we assessed data from eight published articles with a combined patient population of more than 33,000 patients. As only two studies evaluated the association of overall survival (OS) with family history, we excluded OS from the oncological outcomes in this meta-analysis. We found that a family history of PCa did not increase the risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) and cancer-specific mortality (CSM). In an additional sub-analysis, we evaluated the association of family history with BCR in patients treated by radical prostatectomy (RP) and radiotherapy (RT), respectively, and found the same results as from the main analysis.

Although based on retrospective analyses with a relatively small number of samples, some early reports suggested that patients with a family history of PCa may experience more aggressive features of the disease. However, our meta-analysis showed that oncological outcomes for patients with PCa did not differ substantially in the presence or absence of family history.

The clinical application of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening is thought to be one of the main reasons for inconsistencies in these results. PSA screening was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 1986 as a test to monitor patients with PCa, and in 1994 it was approved as a screening aid for diagnostic detection. Some reports suggest that a family history of PCa was an independent risk factor for aggressive oncological outcomes in cohorts that did not receive PSA screening or that were studied before its implementation.

### The effect of subsequent immunosuppressant use in organ-transplanted patients on prostate cancer incidence: a retrospective analysis using the Korean National Health Insurance Database [^114svEmo]. BMC Urology (2021). Low credibility.

The inclusion criteria for patients were male sex; transplantation (TPL) of either the lung, liver, kidney, or heart; age greater than 20 years; and availability of health screening data from 2003 to 2015, with follow-up until the end of 2018. Of the 23,787 male TPL patients identified during the study period (2003–2015), 10,817 patients were excluded due to female sex (N = 8,443), and inappropriate age categories (65–74 and ≥ 75 years). The year of TPL was categorized as 2003–2007, 2008–2012, or 2013–2015.

- **Statistical analysis**: Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation for continuous variables and as percentages for categorical variables. Multivariate-adjusted Cox regression analysis was conducted. The associated hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for prostate cancer (PC) prevalence and TPL were analyzed. Calculations were performed after adjusting for age, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and medication.

### Updates to advanced prostate cancer: AUA/SUO guideline (2023) [^112XQb3U]. The Journal of Urology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for prostate cancer, especially in the context of managing castration-resistant prostate cancer, metastatic conditions, and pretreatment evaluation, the AUA/SUO 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining germline and somatic genetic testing. This testing should identify DNA repair deficiency, MSI status, tumor mutational burden, and other potential mutations. These factors are important for informing prognosis, assessing familial cancer risk, and directing potential targeted therapies in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

### Risk of genitourinary malignancy in the renal transplant patient [^111LKQei]. Urology (2020). Low credibility.

To better understand the risk of genitourinary malignancies in the renal transplant patient, there currently exists no consensus regarding screening and intervention. Much of the clinical decision-making is based on historical practices established before recent progress in immunosuppression protocols and in genitourinary cancer diagnosis and management.

- **Methods**: A database of all solid organ transplants performed at the University of Minnesota from 1984 to 2019 was queried for renal transplant recipients in whom development of subsequent urologic malignancies (prostate, bladder, renal, penile, and testicular cancer) was found.

- **Results**: Among 6172 renal transplant recipients examined, the cumulative incidence of all cancers of genitourinary etiology was presented over an average follow-up time of 10 years. Kidney cancer (combined graft and native), prostate cancer, and bladder cancer each demonstrated respective 30-year incidences of 4.6%, 8.7%, and 1.5% from the time of transplant. By comparison, age-matched data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database demonstrated 30-year cumulative incidences of 1.1%, 11.1%, and 1.7% for kidney cancer, prostate cancer, and bladder cancer, respectively. The predominant genitourinary cancer was renal cell cancer, both of the native and of the transplanted kidney (native, n = 64; transplanted, n = 11), followed by prostate cancer (n = 63) and bladder cancer (n = 37).

In conclusion, in this closely followed cohort of renal transplant recipients, renal cancer occurs at a higher incidence rate than in the non-transplanted population.

### Radical prostatectomy outcomes in renal transplant recipients: a retrospective case series of Thai patients [^111RfoVd]. BMC Urology (2021). Low credibility.

The incidence of prostate cancer in renal transplant recipients (RTR) is similar to the general population. Radical prostatectomy (RP) is the standard of care in managing clinically localized cancer but is considered complicated due to the presence of adhesions and the location of the transplanted ureter/kidney. At the time of writing, few case series or studies on RP in RTR have been published, especially concerning Asian patients. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety and report the experience with RP in RTR.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed data of 1270 patients who underwent RP from January 2008 to March 2020, of which 5 patients were RTR. All available baseline characteristics, perioperative and postoperative data (operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), complications, length of hospital stay, complication), pathological stage, Gleason score, surgical margin status, and pre/postoperative creatinine were reviewed.

- **Results**: Of the 5 RTR who underwent RPs (1 open radical prostatectomy (ORP), 1 laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP), 2 robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomies (RALRP), and 1 Retzius-sparing RALRP (RS-RALRP)), the mean age (± SD) was 70 (± 5.62) years. In LRP and RALRP cases, the standard ports were moved slightly medially to prevent graft injury. The mean operative time ranged from 190 to 365 minutes. The longest operative time and highest EBL (630 ml) occurred in the ORP case due to severe adhesion in Retzius space. For LRP and RALRP cases, the operative times were comparable, and the EBL was ≤ 300 ml. All RPs were successful.

### Cancer screening in renal transplant recipients: What is the evidence [^115pUvXc]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Increased cancer risk is well established in the renal transplant population. However, little is known about the benefits and harms of cancer screening, treatment effectiveness, and the overall cancer prognosis in renal transplant recipients. In this study, we critically appraised guidelines for cancer screening in the renal transplant and general populations using standard criteria for an evidence-based screening program. Guidelines were included when they were applied to adult participants, had objectives specific to cancer screening, and were written in English.

Recommendations for breast and colorectal cancer screening in the general population were supported by evidence of cancer-specific mortality benefits from randomized, controlled trials of cancer screening. Convincing evidence from observational studies had demonstrated that population cervical cancer screening was effective. Additionally, the test performance of mammography, fecal occult blood testing, and Pap smear were accurate. Population breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer screening also appeared to be good value for money in the general population.

On the contrary, recommendations for cancer screening in renal transplant recipients were entirely extrapolated from data in the general population. Studies in the general population have led to the development of cancer screening guidelines in transplant recipients. Because of increased cancer risk, differences in diagnostic test performance, competing risks for deaths from causes such as cardiovascular disease and reduced overall life expectancies, the validity of their recommendations remains debated.

### Counterpoint: The case for immediate active treatment [^111bhKB2]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2007). Low credibility.

Active monitoring strategies have recently gained attention as potential treatment options for men with low-risk prostate cancer who have a life expectancy of more than 10 years. However, no criteria sufficiently predict outcomes for individuals with clinically localized disease and an otherwise long life expectancy who undergo either immediate or delayed treatment, or no treatment. This article describes the available evidence regarding treatment outcomes in men with low-risk prostate cancer and presents the case for immediate active treatment.

### A selective androgen receptor modulator (OPK-88004) in prostate cancer survivors: A randomized trial [^112RMXWg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Androgen deficiency is common among prostate cancer survivors, but many guidelines consider a history of prostate cancer a contraindication for testosterone replacement. We determined the safety and efficacy of a selective androgen receptor modulator (OPK-88004) in symptomatic, testosterone-deficient men who had undergone radical prostatectomy for low-grade, organ-confined prostate cancer.

- **Methods**: In this placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trial, 114 men, ≥ 19 years of age, who had undergone radical prostatectomy for low-grade, organ-localized prostate cancer, undetectable PSA (< 0.1 ng/mL) for ≥ 2 years after radical prostatectomy, and testosterone deficiency were randomized in stages to placebo or 1, 5, or 15 mg OPK-88004 daily for 12 weeks. Outcomes included PSA recurrence, sexual activity, sexual desire, erectile function, body composition, muscle strength and physical function measures, mood, fatigue, and bone markers.

- **Results**: Participants were on average 67.5 years of age and had severe sexual dysfunction (mean erectile function and sexual desire domain scores 7.3 and 14.6, respectively). No participant experienced PSA recurrence or erythrocytosis. OPK-88004 was associated with a dose-related increase in whole-body (P < 0.001) and appendicular (P < 0.001) lean mass and a significantly greater decrease in percent body fat (P < 0.001) and serum alkaline phosphatase (P < 0.001) than placebo. Changes in sexual activity, sexual desire, erectile function, mood, fatigue, physical performance, and bone markers did not differ among groups (P = 0.73).
