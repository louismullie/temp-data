## Question

atorvastatin initiation dose

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about selecting an appropriate atorvastatin initiation dose. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching guideline framework and how statin intensity is defined. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled starting doses and titration cadence. Next, I will stratify by clinical scenario, including primary prevention, secondary prevention, familial hypercholesterolemia, and special populations. After that, I need to check drug–drug interactions and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision algorithm and confirm expected LDL-C reductions and safety considerations, making sure I correct any missteps along the way if I overgeneralize or miss a nuance.

> Let me first confirm the guideline foundation and intensity definitions so I don't anchor on outdated targets. The 2018 ACC/AHA guideline categorizes statin therapy by expected LDL-C lowering: high-intensity achieves ≥ 50% reduction, moderate-intensity 30–49%, and low-intensity < 30%, with atorvastatin 40–80 mg representing high-intensity and 10–20 mg representing moderate-intensity, which frames dose selection by risk and percent-reduction goals rather than numeric LDL-C targets [^111nMPzC] [^111cfQ99]. I should also remember that the USPSTF supports moderate-intensity statins for primary prevention in appropriately selected adults, reinforcing a risk-based, intensity-driven approach rather than treat-to-target thresholds in primary care settings [^114t4u26] [^117D5jmp].

> Wait, let me verify the FDA-labeled starting doses and titration guidance before I apply them clinically. The FDA labeling recommends starting atorvastatin at 10–20 mg once daily, with consideration of 40 mg once daily if a large LDL-C reduction is needed, and advises reassessing lipids 2–4 weeks after initiation or titration to individualize therapy, which aligns with the intensity framework and supports iterative dose optimization [^117NWeVN] [^114A3NAt] [^111PKpFT]. I should double-check that the 40 mg starting point is reserved for patients who truly require more than a 45% LDL-C reduction, not used routinely, to avoid unnecessary exposure to higher doses [^117NWeVN].

> Now, for primary prevention in adults aged 40–75 years, I need to ensure I match intensity to risk and baseline LDL-C. For those with diabetes or with a 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%, moderate-intensity atorvastatin 10–20 mg is appropriate, with the choice within that range informed by baseline LDL-C and the desired percent reduction; for example, 20 mg may be preferred when a larger reduction is anticipated or when baseline LDL-C is higher, consistent with guideline intensity categories and USPSTF recommendations [^111nMPzC] [^114t4u26]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overextending to adults ≥ 76 years; the USPSTF cites insufficient evidence for routine initiation in that group, so decisions should be individualized and cautious in older adults without established ASCVD [^117D5jmp].

> For secondary prevention or clinical ASCVD, I initially thought "start high-intensity atorvastatin 40–80 mg in all cases", but wait, let me verify the exact guidance. The 2018 ACC/AHA guideline recommends high-intensity statins such as atorvastatin 40–80 mg for adults ≤ 75 years with clinical ASCVD, whereas for adults > 75 years the recommendation is to use moderate- or high-intensity based on clinical judgment, comorbidities, and patient preferences, so I should not overgeneralize to 40–80 mg in everyone over 75 [^111nMPzC] [^111cfQ99]. I should also confirm that in very high-risk ASCVD, many European and contemporary pathways endorse even more aggressive LDL-C goals and early intensification, which can justify starting at 80 mg when rapid, substantial reduction is prioritized, but I need to balance this with tolerability and monitoring plans [^117T55DC] [^111U8ELZ].

> Let me consider familial hypercholesterolemia because the starting dose differs by phenotype. For adults with heterozygous FH, starting at 10–20 mg daily is reasonable, with titration to achieve large LDL-C reductions often required. For homozygous FH, the labeled range is 10–80 mg daily, but atorvastatin is used as adjunctive therapy alongside apheresis or other lipid-lowering treatments, so I should confirm that the dose is escalated within that range based on response and tolerability rather than starting at the maximum [^111FmwFo] [^113xE3wf]. I need to ensure I communicate that HoFH management is multimodal and that atorvastatin alone is insufficient in most cases [^113xE3wf].

> Next, I should review special populations and drug–drug interactions so I don't miss safety constraints. In chronic kidney disease, atorvastatin does not require dose adjustment, which makes it a practical choice across eGFR strata, though I should still individualize intensity based on cardiovascular risk and tolerability [^112r3vWF] [^114ovRZS]. But wait, what if the patient is on interacting agents? With strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as clarithromycin or itraconazole, I should limit atorvastatin to 20 mg daily; with protease inhibitor regimens like ritonavir-boosted therapies, I should generally not exceed 20 mg, and with nelfinavir, not more than 40 mg, to mitigate myopathy risk, so I need to check the medication list carefully before finalizing the dose [^111PKpFT] [^114A3NAt]. If the patient is on gemfibrozil, I should reduce atorvastatin to 10 mg and consider switching to a fibrate with lower interaction risk or using an alternative statin strategy, reassessing tolerability before any up-titration [^1112jSm4].

> I will now examine pediatric considerations briefly to ensure completeness. For children and adolescents with HeFH, the labeled starting dose is 10 mg once daily with a typical range of 10–20 mg, and for HoFH the range is 10–80 mg daily, recognizing that HoFH requires comprehensive specialty care and that monitoring of growth and development, as well as liver enzymes, is essential during therapy [^111PKpFT] [^114dhW4n]. Hold on, I should verify that initiation is generally from age 10 for most statins in the U.S., with some regional exceptions, and that shared decision-making with caregivers is critical given long-term safety considerations in pediatrics [^111PWMPQ].

> Next, I should review monitoring and titration so I don't miss the window to optimize therapy. Lipid panels should be checked 2–4 weeks after initiation or dose change, with dose adjustments based on percent LDL-C reduction and intensity goals. If the response is suboptimal, I can increase the dose or consider switching to a more potent statin or adding a nonstatin such as ezetimibe, especially in very high-risk patients who fail to achieve ≥ 50% reduction or absolute thresholds despite maximally tolerated statin therapy [^117NWeVN] [^111nMPzC]. I need to ensure I counsel on adherence because real-world LDL-C reductions are often smaller than expected, which can undermine goal attainment and outcomes if not addressed proactively [^115HukXf].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and double-check it aligns with the evidence. Start with 10–20 mg atorvastatin for most adults, choose 20 mg when baseline LDL-C is higher or a larger reduction is desired within moderate-intensity, and consider 40 mg only when a reduction greater than 45% is needed and the patient has no significant interaction risks; in clinical ASCVD and suitable adults ≤ 75 years, favor high-intensity 40–80 mg when tolerated, while in adults > 75 years individualize to moderate or high intensity based on comorbidity and preferences; in primary prevention with diabetes or elevated risk, aim for moderate-intensity 10–20 mg; in HeFH start at 10–20 mg and titrate aggressively; in HoFH use 10–80 mg as part of combination therapy; always reassess lipids in 2–4 weeks and adjust accordingly [^117NWeVN] [^111nMPzC] [^114t4u26].

> I should confirm the expected LDL-C reductions to set realistic expectations. Moderate-intensity atorvastatin 10–20 mg typically lowers LDL-C by about 30–49%, whereas high-intensity 40–80 mg lowers LDL-C by about 50% or more on average, acknowledging that individual responses vary and that doubling the dose yields roughly an additional 6% absolute LDL-C reduction, which is why careful titration and combination strategies can be more efficient than simply pushing to 80 mg in all patients [^111nMPzC] [^1147BC3S] [^112k2swe]. Hold on, I should verify that potency comparisons with rosuvastatin show greater LDL-C lowering per milligram, which can inform switching decisions when atorvastatin is not tolerated or insufficient at higher doses [^112k2swe].

> Finally, I need to ensure safety and tolerability are addressed up front. I should screen for hepatic disease, prior statin intolerance, and concomitant medications that increase myopathy risk. Counsel on muscle symptoms and when to seek care. And consider lower starting doses or alternative statins in patients with prior statin-associated muscle symptoms, using strategies such as intermittent dosing or switching to agents with different metabolic pathways if needed, while maintaining the overarching goal of achieving at least moderate-intensity LDL-C reduction whenever possible [^1147BC3S] [^115U79Cs]. If I catch myself drifting toward a one-size-fits-all 40 mg start, I should pause and re-anchor to the risk-based intensity model and the patient's baseline LDL-C, interactions, and preferences to avoid overtreatment and enhance adherence [^111nMPzC] [^117NWeVN].

The standard starting dose of atorvastatin is **10–20 mg once daily** for most adults, with **40 mg once daily** reserved for patients who need a > 45% LDL-C reduction [^117NWeVN] [^111PKpFT]. Dose should be individualized based on baseline LDL-C, cardiovascular risk, and tolerability, and **lipids should be checked 2–4 weeks** after initiation or titration to guide adjustments [^117NWeVN] [^114A3NAt]. In very high-risk patients (e.g. recent ACS), **high-intensity therapy (40–80 mg)** may be indicated if tolerated [^111nMPzC] [^117T55DC].

---

## Standard starting dose

- **General adult population**: 10–20 mg once daily [^117NWeVN] [^111PKpFT].
- **Patients requiring > 45% LDL-C reduction**: start at 40 mg once daily [^117NWeVN] [^111PKpFT].
- **Dosage range**: 10–80 mg once daily, individualized to response and tolerability [^117NWeVN] [^11754hxY].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended starting dose** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| General adult population | 10–20 mg once daily | Standard initial dose with favorable efficacy-tolerability balance [^117NWeVN] [^111PKpFT] |
| Patients requiring > 45% LDL-C reduction | 40 mg once daily | Greater LDL-C lowering needed [^117NWeVN] [^114A3NAt] |
| Very high-risk patients (e.g. recent ACS) | 40–80 mg once daily (high-intensity) | Aggressive LDL-C lowering for event reduction [^111nMPzC] [^116VoaXt] |
| Primary prevention (moderate risk) | 10–20 mg once daily (moderate-intensity) | Balanced risk-benefit [^117D5jmp] [^114t4u26] |
| Secondary prevention | 40–80 mg once daily (high-intensity) | Event reduction with intensive therapy [^111nMPzC] [^111M73T9] |

---

## Factors influencing dose selection

- **Baseline LDL-C level**: higher baseline may warrant higher starting dose [^117NWeVN] [^111PKpFT].
- **Cardiovascular risk**: higher risk supports high-intensity therapy [^1134xVyk] [^113bqLVU].
- **Patient characteristics**: age, comorbidities, and tolerability guide dose [^117NWeVN] [^111PKpFT].
- **Drug interactions**: CYP3A4 inhibitors may require dose adjustment [^111PKpFT] [^114A3NAt].

---

## Monitoring and dose adjustment

Check a **lipid panel 2–4 weeks** after initiation or dose change, then adjust to the target LDL-C reduction or < 100 mg/dL if a target is not specified [^117NWeVN] [^114A3NAt]. Titrate at ≥ 4-week intervals based on response and tolerability [^117NWeVN] [^114A3NAt].

---

## Special populations

- **Elderly patients**: start low and titrate cautiously due to higher adverse effect risk.
- **Patients with renal impairment**: no dose adjustment needed [^112r3vWF] [^117NWeVN].
- **Patients with hepatic impairment**: use caution; consider lower doses [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dose selection

- **TNT trial**: atorvastatin 80 mg reduced events more than 10 mg in high-risk patients [^116VoaXt].
- **PROVE-IT TIMI 22**: intensive therapy (atorvastatin 80 mg) reduced events after ACS [^116VoaXt].
- **IDEAL**: high-dose atorvastatin reduced events vs simvastatin 20–40 mg [^11743r7B].

---

## Safety considerations

Muscle symptoms are dose-related; monitor for **myopathy and rhabdomyolysis**, especially at higher doses [^111cfQ99] [^115U79Cs]. Monitor **liver enzymes**, particularly with higher doses or hepatic disease [^114dhW4n] [^115EAQgm]. Atorvastatin is metabolized by **CYP3A4**; review interacting drugs and adjust as needed [^111PKpFT] [^111PWMPQ].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Standard starting dose**: 10–20 mg once daily for most adults [^117NWeVN] [^111PKpFT].
- **High-intensity therapy**: 40–80 mg once daily for very high-risk patients if tolerated [^111nMPzC] [^113bqLVU].
- **Individualization**: base dose on LDL-C, risk, and tolerability [^117NWeVN] [^1134xVyk].
- **Monitoring**: recheck lipids in 2–4 weeks and titrate every ≥ 4 weeks [^117NWeVN] [^114A3NAt].

---

The standard starting dose of atorvastatin is **10–20 mg once daily**, with 40 mg reserved for those needing > 45% LDL-C reduction; dose should be individualized and adjusted based on response and tolerability [^117NWeVN] [^111PKpFT].

### Statins for all? [^116p6how]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines for cholesterol management proposed by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) recommended statin therapy for most men in their 60s and most women in their 70s. If these guidelines are followed in the United States, most adults will eventually take statins. A companion article in this journal goes a step further by proposing statin initiation for mostly everyone about 10 years earlier. Treatment in ACC/AHA guidelines does not depend on cholesterol levels, for either statin initiation or treatment goals. Selection of patients for statin therapy depends instead on multifactorial risk assessment derived from prospective studies in subgroups of the US population. Because of expansion of statin therapy, the issue of the reliability of risk assessment has come to the fore. Some evidence suggests that the ACC/AHA risk algorithm overestimates risk in many persons; if so, this would lead to statin therapy beyond what was intended. Some investigators favor assessment of risk based on presence or absence of categorical risk factors or higher risk conditions. Others propose selection of individuals for statin therapy grounded in measurement of atherosclerosis burden. Finally, an alternate approach to cholesterol management is to establish cholesterol goals for secondary and primary prevention. Cholesterol levels, and not global risk assessment, here define the intensity of therapy. The use of cholesterol goals allows more flexibility in treatment by taking advantage of lifestyle therapies and various drugs and their doses to attain defined goals.

### Investigating the prevalence, predictors, and prognosis of suboptimal statin use early after a non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome [^112jQmeA]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2016). Low credibility.

Previous secondary prevention cohorts have reported elevated risk estimates for statin nonadherence or discontinuation/persistence of 1.01–5.26 for MACE and 1.25–5.00 for mortality, with the majority reporting statistically significant results. Our study results of increased adjusted risks of time to MACE or ACM associated with both suboptimal statin use and the statin nonadherence/discontinuation subgroup in particular are in keeping with these findings. This emphazises the generalizability of these clinically relevant findings across secondary prevention populations, settings, and study designs.

In this study of NSTE-ACS patients, the statin dose reduction/switching statin subgroup was not significantly associated with increased risks of time to MACE or ACM. One other prospective study has investigated statin dose reduction/switching after ACS, but included both NSTE-ACS and ST-elevation ACS patients and reported a significantly increased risk for adverse clinical outcomes (HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.7–5.1). Our smaller number of dose reduction/switching cases (n = 61) may have accounted for this subgroup only showing a nonsignificant trend for increased risk. Two other observational studies have investigated the influence of switching from atorvastatin to simvastatin, on cardiovascular events, using mixed primary/secondary prevention populations identified using electronic healthcare databases. The UK-based study found a modestly increased cardiovascular event risk (HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.02–1.64), whereas the US-based study found no association. However, in both these studies, most patients were on atorvastatin ≤ 20 mg/day, and it has been noted that the proportion of switches from atorvastatin to a lower rather than equivalently potent simvastatin regimen increases as the initial atorvastatin dose increases. This is particularly relevant in post-ACS patients, as practically all switches from atorvastatin 80 mg/day are to another statin of lower equivalent potency. Overall, persistent adherence to high-potency statin therapy after an ACS appears optimal; however, if necessary, reducing the dose or switching statin appears preferable to statin nonadherence or complete discontinuation.

### Achieving and maintaining national cholesterol education program low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals with five statins [^114XRce4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

Most patients fail to achieve and maintain low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goals established by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP). The Atorvastatin Comparative Cholesterol Efficacy and Safety Study (ACCESS) was a randomized study comparing the efficacy and safety of five statins and their ability reduce LDL cholesterol to the NCEP target level.

Subjects and Methods

Of 7542 patients screened, 3916 hypercholesterolemic patients were randomly assigned to treatment with a statin, beginning with the lowest recommended dose (atorvastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin, 10 mg; fluvastatin and lovastatin, 20 mg). If the NCEP target was not achieved, the dose was titrated up to the recommended maximum (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, and lovastatin, 80 mg; pravastatin and simvastatin, 40 mg). The total duration of treatment was 54 weeks.

Results

Atorvastatin achieved the greatest mean reduction in LDL cholesterol: 36% ± 11% at 6 weeks (initial dose) and 42% ± 13% at 54 weeks. More patients receiving atorvastatin at its initial dose (53%, 997 of 1888) achieved their NCEP target levels than patients receiving simvastatin (38%, 174 of 462), lovastatin (28%, 134 of 472), pravastatin (15%, 71 of 461), or fluvastatin (15%, 69 of 474) at the initial dose. Atorvastatin-treated patients were more likely to maintain their target levels from week 6 to week 54. The percent reduction in LDL cholesterol achieved at the initial dose correlated strongly with the proportion of patients who maintained their goals at 54 weeks (r = -0.84).

Conclusion

For patients treated with statins, providing a greater margin between the NCEP target level and the achieved LDL cholesterol level enhances the likelihood of maintaining NCEP goal levels.

### Systematic review of clinical guidelines for lipid lowering in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease events [^111U8ELZ]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary of recommendations

Recommendations for the use of statin medication, cholesterol targets and the frequency of monitoring are presented in table 3.

Table 3
Summary of recommendations

Treatment recommendations

All of the guidelines presented recommendations for the treatment of the secondary prevention population, with all recommending statins as the primary therapy. Only UK/Scottish guidelines suggested the specific drug and dose, namely, atorvastatin 80 mg, with many instead recommending the maximally tolerated high-intensity doses in general, with lower doses considered when contraindications were present, or they were poorly tolerated by the patients. Few caveats were stated regarding the prescription of statins. For example, all stroke guidelines recommended statins only when the cause of the stroke was likely to be atherosclerotic, with the South African Stroke Society additionally only recommending them in the case of total cholesterol > 3.5 mmol/L, and the Australia Stroke Society only considering them appropriate when the patient's life expectancy was considered reasonable. For the secondary prevention population as a whole, the European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society (ESCEAS) tailored their recommendations for patients whose baseline LDL was < 1.4 mmol/L at baseline, respectively, with therapy considered rather than offered to these patients. Finally, the 2018 American Consensus (ACD) guidelines stated that the benefit–risk ratio should be considered when offering medication to patients over the age of 75 years.

### Individualized dose-response to statins associated with cardiovascular disease outcomes [^1148mRtj]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

ASCVD survival analysis

For all 3 drugs, our time-to-event survival analyses highlight the potential for dose-response traits to independently predict ASCVD events and/or death following statin initiation. In this way, our models validate known risk factors and extend the knowledge encompassing our understanding of ASCVD risk predictors to include potency and efficacy. An increase in E max was observed to be associated with increased risk of an ASCVD event or death. The observed effect of E max is likely driven in part by baseline LDL-C levels, which have previously been demonstrated to be associated with cardiovascular mortality. Our findings of increased risk with higher E max may reflect that those who had a higher E max had increased lipid reserve from which to lower LDL-C levels. This claim is further supported by the observation that increases in E 0, an estimate of LDL-C prior to statin therapy, were also associated with increased event risk in our analyses. Therefore, baseline LDL-C levels remain an important factor to consider consistent with established guidelines, with new information added by E max. Importantly, we also observed that ED 50 is independently associated with reduced risk of an ASCVD event. This key statin parameter is well understood to influence outcome at the population level, but it is rarely used clinically to guide drug selection and dosing at the individual level. Our data suggest that ED 50 should be considered as a factor in prescribing at the individual level.

Interestingly in our clinical practice-based data, ED 50 was inversely associated (HR < 1.00) with our primary outcome, defined as an ASCVD event or death from any cause. Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier analysis for each statin with ED 50 stratified into the top 50% vs bottom 50% revealed that P = 0.05 for atorvastatin (n = 518). Because individual patients who experience lower potency (higher ED 50) with statins typically require treatment with a higher dose to achieve the desired reduction in LDL-C, the lower ASCVD event rate seen in these patients may reflect beneficial off-target effects of the higher doses. More work is needed to characterize this potency effect in larger aggregate data sets across multiple institutions for different statins and to understand the underlying biology ("on-target" or "off-target" effect).

### High-dose atorvastatin is superior to moderate-dose simvastatin in preventing peripheral arterial disease [^11743r7B]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To study whether high-dose versus usual-dose statin treatment reduces the incidence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and what is the effect of high-dose statin treatment on cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcome in patients with PAD.

Methods and Results

In the Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering trial, 8888 post-myocardial infarction patients were randomised to high-dose or usual-dose statin therapy (atorvastatin 80mg/day vs simvastatin 20–40mg/day). We investigated the effect of high-dose versus usual-dose statins on the pre-specified outcome PAD incidence, and additionally performed a posthoc analysis of the efficacy of high-dose statins in reducing CVD risk among patients with PAD. During a median follow-up of 4.8years, 94 patients (2.2%) receiving atorvastatin and 135 patients (3.2%) receiving simvastatin developed PAD (HR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.91; p = 0.007). The risk of major coronary events was almost twofold higher in patients with PAD at baseline, but was no longer significant after adjusting for the adverse cardiovascular risk profile. In PAD patients, major coronary events occurred in fewer patients in the atorvastatin group (14.4%) than in the simvastatin group (20.1%), but the difference did not reach statistical significance. (HR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.11; p = 0.13). Atorvastatin treatment significantly reduced overall cardiovascular (p = 0.046) and coronary events (p = 0.004), and coronary revascularisation (p = 0.007) in these patients.

Conclusions

High-dose statin therapy with atorvastatin significantly reduced the incidence of PAD compared with usual-dose statin therapy with simvastatin. Patients with a history of PAD at baseline were at higher risk of future coronary events and this risk was reduced by high-dose atorvastatin treatment.

### Statins do not meet expectations for lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels when used in clinical practice [^115HukXf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Statins have become a mainstay in the treatment of hyperlipidemia, based on their potency and favorable side-effect profile. Drug choice is presumed to be guided by the estimated degree of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering required in a particular patient and the projected efficacy of any drug-dose combination, as contained in the package inserts for each medication. We investigated whether these expectations were met in a clinical practice.

Methods

Data were analyzed for 367 hyperlipidemic patients in a preventive cardiology practice who were not taking statins at entry, who were given a standard statin dose at their first visit, and who had at least one follow-up visit on the same drug/dose. Expected LDL cholesterol reductions were calculated for each patient based on guidelines in the package inserts for each drug.

Results

The mean (± SD) observed LDL cholesterol reduction of 26% ± 20% was significantly less than expected (34% ± 7%, P < 0.001). The ratio of observed to expected reduction was not different for the three statins used (atorvastatin, 0.79 ± 0.48; simvastatin, 0.88 ± 0.61; pravastatin, 0.75 ± 0.69; P = 0.39).

Conclusions

The use of statins in a clinical practice led to observed reductions in LDL cholesterol level that were significantly less than those projected by package insert guidelines. We believe this gap reflects the reduced patient compliance frequently observed in clinical practice settings, rather than any inherent difference in statin responsiveness of a practice versus a trial population. Physicians should be aware of this disparity when using statins in the clinical setting.

### Treat-to-target versus high-intensity statin treatment in patients with or without diabetes mellitus: a pre-specified analysis from the LODESTAR trial [^113uavdn]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Procedures

Patients received rosuvastatin 10 mg or atorvastatin 20 mg for moderate-intensity statin therapy, and rosuvastatin 20 mg or atorvastatin 40 mg for high-intensity statin therapy. In the treat-to-target group, the target LDL-C level was set at below 70 mg/dL, which was the lowest LDL-C level recommended for our population in the latest guidelines at the time of trial design (August 2015), and statin intensity was titrated to achieve this goal, as described previously. In short, for patients who were assigned to the treat-to-target group, statin-naïve patients initially received moderate-intensity statin therapy. For those already on statin therapy, the patients received a dose of study drugs (rosuvastatin or atorvastatin) based on their baseline LDL-C levels; drug dose was maintained at the same intensity for those with an LDL-C level < 70 mg/dL but increased for those with an LDL-C level ≥ 70 mg/dL. During follow-up, up-titration for those with an LDL-C level ≥ 70 md/dL, maintenance of the same intensity without titration for those with an LDL-C level ≥ 50 mg/dL and < 70 mg/dL, or down-titration for those with an LDL-C level < 50 mg/dL was performed. For patients assigned to the high-intensity statin group, high-intensity statin therapy was initiated and maintained regardless of their LDL-C levels at randomisation and follow-up. Adding non-statin agents such as ezetimibe was not strongly recommended to maintain the focus on statin therapy and to avoid introducing confounding effects by imbalances in the use of these non-statin agents. For other medical treatments, guideline-directed medical therapy was strongly recommended and modification of risk factors including blood pressure or glucose control, weight reduction, exercise, dietary changes, and smoking cessation was encouraged.

Follow-up visits to assess general health status, use of drugs, and the occurrence of study outcomes or adverse events were performed at 6 weeks and 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. Serial follow-up of patients' lipid profiles (total cholesterol, LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels), aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase, and creatinine levels was performed at 6 weeks and 12, 24, and 36 months. Serial follow-up of plasma glucose and haemoglobin A1c levels was performed at 12, 24, and 36 months.

### Amlodipine and atorvastatin [^1171ct9E]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adjust dosage according to blood pressure goals. In general, wait 7 to 14 days between titration steps. Titration may proceed more rapidly, however, if clinically warranted, provided the patient is assessed frequently.

Angina The recommended dosage of amlodipine for chronic stable or vasospastic angina is 5 to 10 mg, with the lower dose suggested in the elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Most patients will require 10 mg for adequate effect.

Coronary Artery Disease The recommended dosage range of amlodipine for patients with CAD is 5 to 10 mg once daily. In clinical studies, the majority of patients required 10 mg [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

Pediatrics The effective antihypertensive oral dose of amlodipine in pediatric patients ages 6 years to 17 years is 2.5 mg to 5 mg once daily. Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Atorvastatin

Assess LDL-C when clinically appropriate, as early as 4 weeks after initiating atorvastatin, and adjust the dosage if necessary.

Recommended Dosage in Adult Patients

The recommended starting dosage of atorvastatin is 10 mg or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDL-C (more than 45%) may be started at 40 mg once daily.

### Comparison of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin for lipid lowering in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: results from the URANUS study [^111tBkhY]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2005). Low credibility.

New European guidelines published in 2003 recommend a more stringent target (LDL-C < 2.5 mmol/L) than that used when the present study was planned. Further analysis of the 4-week (fixed-dose) LDL-C data indicated that rosuvastatin 10 mg treated significantly more patients to the new 2003 European goal of < 2.5 mmol/L than atorvastatin 10 mg. As expected, the absolute percentages of patients achieving the more stringent 2003 goal were lower than the absolute percentages achieving the 1998 goal at 4 weeks, but the greater efficacy of rosuvastatin 10 mg compared with atorvastatin 10 mg remained the same. As more clinical trial evidence becomes available regarding the positive effects of intensive lipid lowering among patients with diabetes, it is likely that even more stringent LDL-C goals will be recommended. Indeed, National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III recommendations were recently reviewed and a target of LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) was suggested as a therapeutic option for individuals considered to be at very high risk including those with both type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease.

The availability of an agent that enables a large number of patients to achieve LDL-C goal at the starting dose is important given that many patients receiving lipid-lowering therapy fail to existing attain lipid targets due to a lack of dose titration and the use of less effective agents. A recent observational study, designed to reflect dyslipidaemia treatment in the clinical setting, evaluated the number of hyperlipidaemic patients with coronary heart disease or diabetes who achieved LDL-C goal with their initial statin dose and whether patients were dose titrated. Less than half (48%) achieved LDL-C < 2.6 mmol/L with their initial dose and, of those who did not achieve goal, only 45% had their dose titrated. Dose titration increases costs and the need for follow-up, which, while necessary, can be time-consuming and inconvenient. The ability of rosuvastatin to enable greater proportions of patients to achieve LDL-C goal, with reduced requirement for dose titration is highly advantageous.

### Optimal statin type and dosage for vascular patients [^1137e5Su]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Statins are an essential component of the management of patients suffering from vascular diseases. As there is neither any consensus nor any guidelines regarding this issue, we aimed to define the optimal statin type and dosage for these patients. MEDLINE was searched for studies comparing different statin types and dosages for vascular patients. In the absence of adverse effects, rosuvastatin or atorvastatin ≥ 20 mg/d is the optimal statin type and dosage for vascular patients. The management of statin-induced adverse events and the options for statin-intolerant patients are also discussed. Routine statin treatment is associated with several beneficial effects in vascular patients whether managed conservatively or undergoing open vascular surgery/endovascular interventions. If possible, statins should not be discontinued before open or endovascular procedures and treatment should be resumed as soon as possible. Future studies should evaluate the effects of an increased statin loading dose prior to vascular procedures.

### Combination therapy with statins: who benefits? [^116KNohX]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Many lipid-lowering drugs improve cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. However, when therapies have been studied in addition to statins, it has been challenging to show an additional clinical benefit in terms of CV event reduction, although overall safety seems acceptable. This debate has been complicated by recent guidelines that emphasize treatment with high-potency statin monotherapy. Combination therapy allows more patients to successfully reach their ideal lipid targets. Further testing of novel therapies may introduce an era of potent low-density lipoprotein decrease without dependence on statins, but until then, they remain the mainstay of therapy.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Table 3. High-, moderate-, and low-intensity statin therapy — statin therapy is divided into three categories, with high-intensity, moderate-intensity, and low-intensity therapies typically lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by ≥ 50%, 30%–49%, and < 30%, respectively. Representative high-intensity doses include Atorvastatin (40 mg†) 80 mg and Rosuvastatin 20 mg (40 mg). Moderate-intensity options include Atorvastatin 10 mg (20 mg), Rosuvastatin (5 mg) 10 mg, Simvastatin 20–40 mg§, Pravastatin 40 mg (80 mg), Lovastatin 40 mg (80 mg), Fluvastatin XL 80 mg, Fluvastatin 40 mg BID, and Pitavastatin 1–4 mg; a low-intensity example is Fluvastatin 20–40 mg. Boldface type indicates statins and doses evaluated in randomized controlled trials that demonstrated a reduction in major cardiovascular events. Although simvastatin 80 mg was evaluated, initiation of simvastatin 80 mg or titration to 80 mg is not recommended by the FDA because of the increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. Percent reductions are estimates from large populations and individual responses vary in clinical practice.

### Statins research unfinished saga: desirability versus feasibility [^1173sUNy]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2005). Low credibility.

Head-to-head comparisons

Following the pioneering initial studies, more recent head-to-head comparative parallel-group trials unveiled additional features of this type of drugs. In 2001, the Reversal of Atherosclerosis with Aggressive Lipid Lowering (REVERSAL) trial demonstrated that atorvastatin 80 mg/day partially reversed carotid intima-media thickness in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, as compared with simvastatin 40 mg/day.

Furthermore, the Atorvastatin versus Simvastatin on Atherosclerosis Progression (ASAP) trial study showed that high-dose atorvastatin delayed progression of coronary atherosclerosis, as assessed by intravascular ultrasound, while 40 mg/day pravastatin did not. These trials demonstrated that aggressive statin therapy is more effective in terms of atherosclerosis progression. Importantly, statins have also demonstrated to reduce endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, noxious cytokines concentration and blood thrombogenicity, which all seem to be co-responsible for plaque thrombosis.

In the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy (PROVE-IT) trial 4162 patients who had suffered an acute coronary syndrome in the preceding 10 days were randomized to receive pravastatin 40 mg/day vs atorvastatin 80 mg/day in addition to gatifloxacin vs placebo. The data of the lipid-lowering therapy showed mean low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels of 95 mg/dl in the pravastatin group, in compliance with present guidelines of clinical practice, and 62 mg/dl in the atorvastatin group. After a follow-up of 2 years, the intensive lipid-lowering group showed a significant reduction in the incidence of the combined end-point of death, MI, unstable angina requiring hospitalization, revascularization and stroke. The PROVE-IT findings were strengthened by the Aggressive Lipid-Lowering Initiation Abates New Cardiac Events (ALLIANCE) study, which confirmed the hypothesis of further benefits with aggressive cholesterol-lowering. In this trial, 2442 patients with coronary artery disease were randomized to achieve LDL levels < 80 mg/dl, receiving atorvastatin titrated at doses ≤ 80 mg/day, or standard therapy with the statins and doses chosen by the treating physicians. Intensive lipid-lowering therapy demonstrated a significant reduction in the primary end-point of combined incidence of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization and unstable angina requiring hospitalization.

### Individualized dose-response to statins associated with cardiovascular disease outcomes [^1139NHXA]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Current standards of care rely on clinical risk factors to inform choice of statin intensity, and our findings regarding the impact of dose-response traits on ASCVD outcomes suggest that approaches to statin therapy could be further refined by incorporating ED 50 and E max into automated clinical decision support if/when these traits are more readily available. Deidentified EHRs provide a rich repository of real-world, practice-based clinical data that can be utilized for applications of pharmacogenetic research, including investigations of dose-response that are not feasible in the clinical trial setting. Furthermore, data from routine care may better reflect the actualities of day-to-day clinical medicine because practice-based data contain the full width and breadth of demographic factors and relevant clinical comorbidities, while randomized trials apply numerous exclusions and control for as many elements as possible in order to resolve their specific desired endpoint.

Individualized statin dose-response

In this study, we demonstrate that dose-response traits describing the relationship between statin use — specifically atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin — and LDL-C changes can be obtained following data extraction of statin exposure events and LDL-C measurements from longitudinal clinical data. As anticipated, the order of potency was simvastatin < atorvastatin < rosuvastatin. Although estimated measures of efficacy represented by E max were similar across statin types, there was much more variability in the distribution of efficacy for simvastatin compared to atorvastatin or rosuvastatin, which aligns with prior studies finding that some patients are unable to reduce LDL-C to the desired target despite dose escalation and close follow-up. From our results, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin exhibit the most consistent lipid-lowering effect, and this finding supports the use of these statin agents as high-intensity statins for primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD.

### An eight-week trial investigating the efficacy and tolerability of atorvastatin for children and adolescents with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [^114DgoT8]. Pediatric Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Over the 8-week study period, LDL-C/HDL-C ratios decreased across both cohorts (data on file). In both cohorts at study end, treatment with atorvastatin also had produced substantial reductions in the mean plasma levels of VLDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C, and Apo B, as well as modest reductions in Apo A-I. The VLDL-C reductions appeared to be greater in the TS ≥ 2 cohort than in the TS 1 cohort (−52.84% vs. −37.63%).

Table 2 also shows that patients who did not achieve the recommended treatment goal at week 4 (those whose dose was doubled for the remainder of the study) were at a much higher baseline LDL-C level regardless of Tanner stage cohort. The reductions in mean plasma levels of LDL-C, TC, and TG tended to be greater in the subjects whose atorvastatin dose was doubled at week 4 than in the subjects who continued to receive their original dose.

More variable results were collected for the other lipid parameters regarding atorvastatin dose level and cohort. For the TS ≥ 2 subjects, the reductions in VLDL-C and Apo B were similar in the two dose groups. However, for the TS 1 subjects, the decrease in mean plasma VLDL-C (−50.3% vs. −12.3%) and Apo B (−39.6% vs. −27.4%) levels were greater among those whose dose had been doubled after the week 4 visit than among those who continued to receive their initial dose. For both cohorts, the decrease in Apo A-1 was somewhat larger among those whose dose had been doubled after the week 4 visit than among those who continued to receive their initial dose (−3.4% vs. −1.2% for TS 1; −4.8% vs. −2.6% for TS ≥ 2). The HDL-C levels were slightly improved in the patients who continued to receive their starting dose but slightly decreased for those whose dosage was doubled.

### Twelve-week, multicenter, randomized, open-label comparison of the effects of rosuvastatin 10 mg / D and atorvastatin 10 mg / D in high-risk adults: a DISCOVERY study [^113watpK]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines for the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) advocate reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol (TC) levels as the primary goals. However, approximately 50% to 60% of patients fail to reach recommended cholesterol goals.

Objectives

The primary objective of this Direct Statin Comparison of LDL-C Values: An Evaluation of Rosuvastatin Therapy Compared with Atorvastatin (DISCOVERY) trial was to compare the efficacy of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors rosuvastatin calcium and atorvastatin calcium in achieving the 1998 Second Joint Task Force (JTF) of European and Other Societies on Coronary Prevention target for LDL-C. Secondary objectives included comparing the efficacy of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin in achieving the 1998 JTF-recommended goal for TC and modifying other lipid levels, and to compare the tolerability of the 2 statins.

Methods

This 12-week, randomized, open-label, 2-arm, parallel-group trial was conducted at 210 centers in Finland, Iceland, and Ireland. Patients aged ≥ 18 years with a high risk for CHD and primary hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C > 3.5 mmol/L [> 135 mg/dL]) were randomized (2:1) to receive rosuvastatin 10 mg or atorvastatin 10 mg PO OD for 12 weeks. Before randomization, statin-naive patients underwent 6 weeks of dietary counseling, whereas patients receiving treatment with a starting dose of another lipid-lowering therapy but with an LDL-C level > 3.1 mmol/L (> 120 mg/dL) were switched to study drug immediately after they were determined eligible for the study Patients were assessed for fasting lipid levels at weeks 0 and 12, and the proportions of patients attaining 1998 and 2003 JTF lipid goals (1998: LDL-C, < 3.0 mmol/L [< 116 mg/dL]; TC, < 5.0 mmol/L [< 193 mg/dL]; 2003: LDL-C, < 2.5 mmol/L [< 97 mg/dL]; TC, < 4.5 mmol/L [< 174 mg/dL]) were calculated. Tolerability was monitored for the 12-week study and for an additional 36-week optional extension period.

Results

One thousand twenty-four patients were randomized to treatment (568 men, 456 women; mean age, 60.7 years). Patient demographic characteristics were similar between the 2 treatment groups. The efficacy analysis consisted of 911 patients (504 men, 407 women; mean age, 60.7 years; mean body weight, 82.4 kg); 627 received rosuvastatin and 284 received atorvastatin. Compared with atorvastatin, rosuvastatin was associated with significantly greater reductions in LDL-C and TC (both, P < 0.05), and with a significantly greater increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (P < (105). A greater proportion of patients in the rosuvastatin group compared with the atorvastatin group reached the 1998 goals for LDL-C (83.4% vs 683%; P < 0.001) and TC (76.4% vs 59.5%; P < 0.001). Also, compared with the atorvastatin group, greater proportions of patients in the rosuvastatin group achieved the 2003 JTF goals for LDL-C and TC (both, P < 0.001). Both agents were well tolerated: serious drug-related events were observed in ≤ 3.0% of patients in each group, and no clinically significant differences were found between the 2 treatment groups.

Conclusions

In this study of selected patients at high risk for CHD and with primary hypercholesterolemia, rosuvastatin 10 mg/d for 12 weeks was associated with significantly greater reductions in LDL-C and TC levels compared with atorvastatin 10 mg/d. Furthermore, significantly more patients receiving rosuvastatin achieved the 1998 and 2003 JTF-recommended lipid targets compared with those receiving atorvastatin. Both agents were well tolerated.

### A 52-week, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, double-dummy study to assess the efficacy of atorvastatin and simvastatin in reaching low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride targets: the Treat-to-target (3T) study [^116dovck]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines for the prevention of coronary heart disease call for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction as the primary target of treatment and reduction of triglycerides (TG) as an additional target.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of atorvastatin and simvastatin to reduce LDL-C and TG concentrations and to meet 3 target lipid levels: LDL-C ≤ 2.6 mmol/L; TG ≤ 1.5 mmol/L; and both LDL-C ≤ 2.6 mmol/L and TG ≤ 1.5 mmol/L.

Methods

The Treat-to-Target (3T) Study was a 52-week, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group study. Using the double-blind, double-dummy technique, adult patients aged 35 to 75 years with cardiovascular disease and dyslipidemia, defined as LDL-C concentration ≥ 4.0 mmol/L (≥ 155 mg/dL), were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive once-daily oral treatment with 20 mg atorvastatin or 20 mg simvastatin. Fasting (12-hour) blood samples for the estimation of lipid levels and clinical laboratory values were collected after 4, 8, 12, 26, and 52 weeks. The dose was doubled after 12 weeks if the target National Cholesterol Education Program level of LDL-C (≤ 2.6 mmol/L [100 mg/dL]) was not reached at 8 weeks.

Results

The intent-to-treat analysis included 552 patients (418 men, 134 women) randomized to receive atorvastatin and 535 (404 men, 131 women) randomized to receive simvastatin. The number of patients enrolled in the study allowed the evaluation fo the drugs' effects on TG. Patient demogrpahic characteristics were similar for the 2 treatment groups, and there were no differences in baseline lipid values. Compared with simvastatin, atorvastatin produced significantly greater reductions in LDL-C (8 weeks: -46% vs -40%, P < 0.001; 52 weeks: -49% vs -44%, P < 0.001) and in TG (8 weeks: -23% vs -14%, P < 0.001; 52 weeks: -24% vs -16%, P < 0.001). Compared with simvastatin-treated patients, a significantly greater number of atorvastatin-treated patients reached the LDL-C target after 8 weeks (45% vs 24%; P < 0.001). Fewer atorvastatin patients needed to have their dose doubled; nevertheless more atorvastatin patients reached the LDL-C target after 52 weeks (61% vs 41%; P < 0.001). Both statins were well tolerated. Muscular symptoms occurred in 12 patients (2.2%) in the atorvastatin group and in 13 patients (2.4%) in the simvastatin group.

Conclusions

Atorvastatin 20 or 40 mg/d for up to 1 year of treatment was significantly more effective than simvastatin 20 or 40 mg/d in reducing LDL-C and TG levels and at achieving recommended lipid targets in this selected patient population with cardiovascular disease and dyslipidemia. Both statis were well tolerated.

4.3 European perspectives

In patients after ACS, the guideline recommends starting high‐intensity statin or the maximum tolerated dose as early as possible, and regardless of initial LDL‐C values, to reach the goals for the very high‐risk group of ≥ 50% reduction from baseline and a goal of < 55 mg/dL (class I, level A). 16 Lipid levels should be evaluated 4 to 6 weeks after ACS to determine whether a reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline and an LDL‐C goal < 55 mg/dL have been achieved. If the goal of < 55 mg/dL is not achieved with the maximum tolerated dose of statin, combination with ezetimibe is recommended (class I, level B). 8 If the goal < 55 mg/dL is still not achieved on a maximum tolerated dose of a statin and ezetimibe after 4 to 6 weeks, a combination with a PCSK9 inhibitor is recommended (class I, level A). 9, 15 For patients who present with an ACS and whose LDL‐C levels are not at goal, despite already taking a maximally tolerated statin dose and ezetimibe, the addition of a PCSK9 inhibitor early after the event (including prior to discharge) should be considered (class II, level C). 2, 17

### Effect of individualizing starting doses of a statin according to baseline LDL-cholesterol levels on achieving cholesterol targets: the achieve cholesterol targets fast with atorvastatin stratified titration (ACTFAST) study [^115UtQ6Q]. Atherosclerosis (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

To investigate whether selecting the starting dose of atorvastatin according to baseline and target (< 2.6 mmol/L) LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) values would allow high-risk subjects to achieve target LDL-C concentration within 12 weeks, with the initial dose or a single uptitration.

Methods and Results

Twelve-week, prospective, open-label trial that enrolled 2117 high-risk subjects (statin-free [SF] or statin-treated [ST]). Subjects with LDL-C > 2.6 mmol/L (100mg/dL) but ≤ 5.7 mmol/L (220 mg/dL) were assigned a starting dose of atorvastatin (10, 20, 40 or 80 mg/day) based on LDL-C and status of statin use at baseline, with a single uptitration at 6 weeks, if required. There was no washout for ST subjects. At study end, 80% of SF (82%, 82%, 83% and 72% with 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg, respectively) and 59% of ST (60%, 61% and 51% with 20, 40 and 80 mg, respectively) subjects reached LDL-C target. In the ST group, an additional 21–41% reduction in LDL-C was observed over the statin used at baseline. Atorvastatin was well tolerated.

Conclusion

This study confirms that individualizing the starting dose of atorvastatin according to baseline and target LDL-C values (i.e. the required LDL-C reduction), allows a large majority of high-risk subjects to achieve target safely, within 12 weeks, with the initial dose or with a single titration.

### Clinical benefit of fixed-dose combination of amlodipine and potent atorvastatin in patients with concomitant hypertension and hypercholesterolemia [^112yMKfB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia frequently coexist in the general population up to 30.7%, and the combination of these 2 risk factors has adverse effects and markedly increases the risk of CVD. Concomitant treatment of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia in patients with both disorders is recommended by contemporary guidelines, especially for those with a high risk of CVD. Fixed‐dose combinations (FDCs) are widely used in the treatment of chronic diseases to simplify regimens, improve drug adherence, and reduce medical costs. Previously, randomized trials of patients with concomitant hypertension and hypercholesterolemia have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of single‐pill amlodipine/atorvastatin FDCs. Compared with the free‐equivalent combination (FEC) of 5 mg of amlodipine and 10 mg of atorvastatin per day, the FDC of the same regimen significantly reduced the composite of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), including all‐cause death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and coronary revascularization, based on propensity score matching of patients with concomitant hypertension and hypercholesterolemia in our previous population‐based study. Meanwhile, current clinical guidelines recommend moderate‐intensity statins, such as 20 mg of atorvastatin daily, as the initial dosage in patients with hypercholesterolemia, and another multi‐institutional cohort study we conducted demonstrated that LDL‐C levels were significantly reduced by an FDC of 5 mg of amlodipine and 20 mg of atorvastatin daily (high dose), compared with either an FDC or FEC of 5 mg of amlodipine and 10 mg of atorvastatin daily (low dose), with a similar BP reduction effect. The inferior efficacy and clinical outcomes of the FEC with 5 mg of amlodipine and 10 mg of atorvastatin have already been described in our previous studies, and this group of patients was not included in the current study.

The present study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of a high‐ and low‐dose amlodipine/atorvastatin FDC and their FEC counterparts in patients with concurrent hypertension and hypercholesterolemia in a population‐based nationwide cohort.

Primary Hyperlipidemia in Adults

Atorvastatin reduces total-C, LDL-C, apo B, and TG, and increases HDL-C in patients with hyperlipidemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia. Therapeutic response is seen within 2 weeks, and maximum response is usually achieved within 4 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy.

In two multicenter, placebo-controlled, dose-response trials in patients with hyperlipidemia, atorvastatin given as a single dose over 6 weeks, significantly reduced total-C, LDL-C, apo B, and TG. (Pooled results are provided in Table 8.)

In three multicenter, double-blind trials in patients with hyperlipidemia, atorvastatin was compared to other statins. After randomization, patients were treated for 16 weeks with either atorvastatin 10 mg per day or a fixed dose of the comparative agent (Table 9).

Table 9 does not contain data comparing the effects of atorvastatin 10 mg and higher doses of lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin. The drugs compared in the trials summarized in the table are not necessarily interchangeable.

Hypertriglyceridemia in Adults

The response to atorvastatin in 64 patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia treated across several clinical trials is shown in the table below (Table 10). For the atorvastatin-treated patients, median (min, max) baseline TG level was 565 (267–1502).

### Intensive statin therapy compared with moderate dosing for prevention of cardiovascular events: a meta-analysis of > 40 000 patients [^111M73T9]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Aims

Statin therapy is associated with important benefits for patients at risk of, and with, established cardiovascular disease. There is widespread interest in whether intensive dosing of statins yields larger treatment effects. We aimed to determine if intensive dosing is clinically important using a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs).

Methods

We conducted comprehensive searches of electronic databases from inception to December 2010. We included any RCT evaluating a larger dose with a clinically common dose. Two reviewers independently extracted data, in duplicate. We performed random-effects meta-analysis and a trial sequential analysis.

Results

We identified 10 RCTs enrolling a total of 41 778 participants. Trials followed patients for a mean of 2.5 years. We did not find statistically significant effects on all-cause mortality [relative risk (RR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.83–1.03, P = 0.14, I(2) = 38%] or cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths (RR 0.89, 95% CI, 0.78–1.01, P = 0.07, I(2) = 34%). When we pooled the composite endpoint of coronary heart disease (CHD) death plus non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), we found a significant protective effect of intensive statin dosing (RR 0.90, 95% CI, 0.84–0.96, P ≤ 0.0001, I(2) = 0%). We also found a significant effect on non-fatal MIs (RR 0.82, 95% CI, 0.76–0.89, P ≤ 0.0001, I(2) = 0%) and a significant reduction in the composite of fatal and non-fatal strokes (excluding transient ischaemic attacks) reported in 10 RCTs (RR 0.86, 95% CI, 0.77–0.96, P = 0.006, I(2) = 0%). A subgroup analysis of three trials examining acute coronary syndrome patients found significant effects on all-cause (RR 0.75, 95% CI, 0.61–0.91, P = 0.005, I(2) = 0%) and CVD mortality (RR 0.74, 95% CI, 0.59–0.94, P = 0.013, I(2) = 0%) with intensive dosing. Applying an analysis of optimal information size on the primary analysis, we found that the evidence for CHD death plus non-fatal MIs is conclusive. The evidence for CVD deaths alone is not yet conclusive.

Conclusions

Available evidence suggests that intensive statin therapy reduces the risk of non-fatal events and may have a role in reducing mortality.

### Treating to new targets (TNT) study: does lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels below currently recommended guidelines yield incremental clinical benefit? [^1139zGou]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

The Treating to New Targets (TNT) trial is a parallel-group study that has randomized 10,003 patients from 14 countries to double-blind treatment with either atorvastatin 10 or 80 mg. During the double-blind period, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels are expected to reach approximate mean values of 100 mg/dl (2.6 mmol/L) for the low-dose atorvastatin group and 75 mg/dl (1.9 mmol/L) for the high-dose group. Randomized patients are expected to be followed for an average of 5 years. The primary end point is the time to occurrence of a major cardiovascular event, defined as coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or stroke. The large patient numbers in the TNT study and long follow-up should ensure that there is adequate power to definitively determine if reducing LDL cholesterol levels to approximately 75 mg/dl (1.9 mmol/L) can provide additional clinical benefit.

### 2013 ACC / AHA guideline recommends fixed-dose strategies instead of targeted goals to lower blood cholesterol [^113wVuy7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Task Force on Practice Guidelines recently issued the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults. This new guideline endorses a paradigm shift in strategies for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events by lowering blood cholesterol. Whereas previous guidelines focused on therapy to decrease low-density lipoprotein and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to specific target levels, the new guideline instead proposes implementation of cholesterol-lowering treatment using evidenced-based intensity of statin therapy without such targets. The guideline also provides a new risk estimator for primary prevention decisions, including stroke outcomes and data on African Americans, which will significantly increase the number of patients recommended for outcome-related benefits of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The first section of this paper reviews the process by which the task force developed the new evidence-based guideline, the major findings and recommendations, and their implications. The second section primarily focuses on the question of how much low-density lipoprotein cholesterol should be lowered and on additional considerations in risk assessment.

### Lipid-lowering efficacy of atorvastatin [^112k2swe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

This represents the first update of this review, which was published in 2012. Atorvastatin is one of the most widely prescribed drugs and the most widely prescribed statin in the world. It is therefore important to know the dose-related magnitude of effect of atorvastatin on blood lipids.

Objectives

Primary objective To quantify the effects of various doses of atorvastatin on serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and triglycerides in individuals with and without evidence of cardiovascular disease. The primary focus of this review was determination of the mean per cent change from baseline of LDL-cholesterol. Secondary objectives
- To quantify the variability of effects of various doses of atorvastatin.• To quantify withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs) in placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 11, 2013), MEDLINE (1966 to December Week 2 2013), EMBASE (1980 to December Week 2 2013), Web of Science (1899 to December Week 2 2013) and BIOSIS Previews (1969 to December Week 2 2013). We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled and uncontrolled before-and-after trials evaluating the dose response of different fixed doses of atorvastatin on blood lipids over a duration of three to 12 weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed eligibility criteria for studies to be included and extracted data. We collected information on withdrawals due to adverse effects from placebo-controlled trials.

Main Results

In this update, we found an additional 42 trials and added them to the original 254 studies. The update consists of 296 trials that evaluated dose-related efficacy of atorvastatin in 38,817 participants. Included are 242 before-and-after trials and 54 placebo-controlled RCTs. Log dose-response data from both trial designs revealed linear dose-related effects on blood total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. The Summary of findings table 1 documents the effect of atorvastatin on LDL-cholesterol over the dose range of 10 to 80 mg/d, which is the range for which this systematic review acquired the greatest quantity of data. Over this range, blood LDL-cholesterol is decreased by 37.1% to 51.7% (Summary of findings table 1). The slope of dose-related effects on cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol was similar for atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, but rosuvastatin is about three-fold more potent. Subgroup analyses suggested that the atorvastatin effect was greater in females than in males and was greater in non-familial than in familial hypercholesterolaemia. Risk of bias for the outcome of withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs) was high, but the mostly unclear risk of bias was judged unlikely to affect lipid measurements. Withdrawals due to adverse effects were not statistically significantly different between atorvastatin and placebo groups in these short-term trials (risk ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.68 to 1.40).

Authors' Conclusions

This update resulted in no change to the main conclusions of the review but significantly increases the strength of the evidence. Studies show that atorvastatin decreases blood total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol in a linear dose-related manner over the commonly prescribed dose range. New findings include that atorvastatin is more than three-fold less potent than rosuvastatin, and that the cholesterol-lowering effects of atorvastatin are greater in females than in males and greater in non-familial than in familial hypercholesterolaemia. This review update does not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with atorvastatin because included trials were of short duration and adverse effects were not reported in 37% of placebo-controlled trials.

### Effects of high-dose atorvastatin in patients ≥ 65 years of age with acute coronary syndrome (from the myocardial ischemia reduction with aggressive cholesterol lowering [MIRACL] study) [^115iidny]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

After acute coronary syndromes (ACSs), older patients are particularly susceptible to early complications, including death and recurrent ACS. Lipid management guidelines do not differentiate elderly from younger patients, and lack of evidence for statin benefits in older patients has led to underutilization of statins in the elderly. The MIRACL study randomized 3,086 patients to 16 weeks of 80 mg/day of atorvastatin or placebo 24 to 96 hours after ACS and demonstrated significant decreases in the combined primary end point (nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, recurrent symptomatic myocardial ischemia). This post hoc analysis compared benefits of 80 mg of atorvastatin in older (≥ 65 years) versus younger (< 65 years) patients. Event rates were approximately two- to threefold higher in older than in younger patients. Treatment-by-age heterogeneity testing indicated no difference in treatment effect by age for any of the primary or secondary end points, and relative risk decreases in the primary end point with atorvastatin versus placebo were similar in younger and older patients (22% vs 14%, respectively). The safety profile of atorvastatin was similar between the 2 age groups. In conclusion, these results and a greater immediate cardiovascular risk in older patients argue for early, intensive atorvastatin therapy as routine practice after ACS.

### Comparison of the efficacy and safety of atorvastatin initiated at different starting doses in patients with dyslipidemia [^111eLGWn]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The NASDAC study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of atorvastatin at starting doses of 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg.

Methods

After an 8-week placebo washout period, 919 patients who were candidates for lipid-lowering therapy according to the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines were randomized to 1 of 4 atorvastatin treatment groups: 10 mg (n = 229), 20 mg (n = 228), 40 mg (n = 231), and 80 mg (n = 231).

Results

Atorvastatin reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels dose dependently across the 10- to 80-mg-dose range (35.7%-52.2%). Each of the 20-, 40-, and 80-mg doses provided significantly greater decreases in LDL-C than all lower doses (P < .01). All doses also reduced total cholesterol, the LDL-C/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, apolipoprotein B, and triglycerides from baseline. An increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was observed in all dose groups. Most participants, regardless of their level of coronary heart disease risk, attained their National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III LDL-C goal by the end of the study. Patients in all risk groups were more likely to achieve the NCEP LDL-C goal at higher starting doses. Atorvastatin was well tolerated at all dose levels.

Conclusions

Atorvastatin initiated at doses of 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg is effective and safe for the treatment of patients with dyslipidemia. Depending on the percentage reduction needed to achieve an LDL-C goal, patients with or at risk of coronary heart disease may benefit from starting therapy at a higher dose of atorvastatin.

### American diabetes association indications for statins in diabetes: is there evidence? [^115pQySq]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Table 1
ADA evidence grading system for clinical practice recommendations

These guidelines are based on numerous trials showing a benefit for statin therapy both as primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Trials like the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), proved beyond doubt that patients with type 2 diabetes and other risk factors for CVD should be treated with a statin, apparently disregarding their initial LDL cholesterol level. However, most of these trials did not set a goal LDL cholesterol level for treatment but examined the effect of a predetermined statin dose on the outcome. Extrapolated from these trials and from epidemiologic data, a goal LDL of 100 mg% seems adequate for the majority of patients. Yet because of the problematic interpretation of clinical trial data that was not inherent in its basic structure, alternative treatment goals have arisen, including a reduction of LDL by 40% (in patients where LDL reduction could not reach the 100 mg% goal) or a reduction below 70 mg% (in very-high-risk patients — those with prior cardiovascular disease or acute coronary syndromes).

Some questions are raised from these guidelines. First, the overall efficacy of statin use for primary prevention raises the question who should not get a statin, i.e. what is the evidence for their use as primary prevention in diabetic individuals. Should a statin be given on an LDL-based treat-to-target goal (as stated in the guidelines, reduce the LDL below 100 mg%), existence of other vascular risk factors, age, or regardless of the measured cholesterol at predetermined doses (similar to current use of aspirin).

The second question is what is the evidence for the target LDL in secondary prevention in high-risk diabetic individuals — how aggressive should we be, and should we limit ourselves to an LDL-targeted therapy versus a comprehensive high-dose statin strategy. Again there is the question of the target LDL versus the "evidence-based" fixed dose?

Amlodipine and Atorvastatin Tablets

Dosage of amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance for each individual component in the treatment of hypertension/angina and hyperlipidemia. Select doses of amlodipine and atorvastatin independently.

Amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets may be substituted for its individually titrated components. Patients may be given the equivalent dose of amlodipine and atorvastatin or a dose of amlodipine and atorvastatin with increased amounts of amlodipine, atorvastatin, or both for additional antianginal effects, blood pressure lowering, or lipid-lowering effect.

Amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets may be used to provide additional therapy for patients already on one of its components. Amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets may be used to initiate treatment in patients with hyperlipidemia and either hypertension or angina.

Important Dosage Information

Take amlod ipine and atorvastatin tablets orally once daily at any time of the day, with or without food.

Amlodipine

The usual initial antihypertensive oral dosage of amlodipine is 5 mg once daily, and the maximum dose is 10 mg once daily.

Pediatric (age > 6 years), small adult, fragile, or elderly patients, or patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily and this dose may be used when adding amlodipine to other antihypertensive therapy.

### ATORVASTATIN 20mg tab… [^114A3NAt]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

The recommended starting dose of atorvastatin calcium tablets is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDL-C may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of atorvastatin calcium tablets is 10 to 80 mg once daily. Atorvastatin calcium tablets can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. The starting dose and maintenance doses of atorvastatin calcium tablets should be individualized according to patient characteristics such as goal of therapy and response. After initiation and/or upon titration of atorvastatin calcium tablets, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly. The recommended starting dose of atorvastatin calcium tablets is 10 mg/day; the usual dose range is 10 to 20 mg orally once daily. Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy. Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more. The dosage of atorvastatin calcium tablets in patients with HoFH is 10 to 80 mg daily. Atorvastatin calcium tablets should be used as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. Atorvastatin calcium tablets may be used with bile acid resins. The combination of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and fibrates should generally be used with caution. In patients with HIV taking lopinavir plus ritonavir, use the lowest dose necessary of atorvastatin calcium tablets.

In patients taking clarithromycin, itraconazole, elbasvir plus grazoprevir, or in patients with HIV taking a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir or letermovir therapy with atorvastatin calcium tablets should be limited to 20 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of atorvastatin calcium tablets is used. Concomitant intake of large quantities, more than 1. 2 liters daily, of grapefruit juice is not recommended in patients taking atorvastatin calcium.

Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Statins are first‐line therapy for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. 1 Several international guidelines recommend high‐risk and very high‐risk patients achieve low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels < 100 mg/dL and < 70 mg/dL, respectively. 2, 3, 4 However, many patients fail to reach expected or recommended LDL‐C levels on statin therapy. For example, a 2012 cross‐sectional survey reported that approximately two‐thirds of high‐risk patients on statin monotherapy for > 90 days did not achieve LDL‐C levels < 100 mg/dL, and only an estimated quarter of these high‐risk patients had LDL‐C levels < 70 mg/dL. 5 Surveys from other countries show similar results. 6, 7, 8, 9 A European study found that of dyslipidemic patients receiving lipid‐lowering drugs, fewer than half achieved LDL‐C levels < 100 mg/dL. 6 In addition, studies have shown that approximately 80% of patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH) do not achieve LDL‐C levels < 100 mg/dL from a statin. 10, 11

In clinical practice, patients are typically started on a statin of moderate intensity, where the daily dose is expected to lower LDL‐C levels by approximately 30% to < 50%. 12, 13 However, the recent 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults recommended high‐intensity statin therapy that lowers LDL‐C by ≥ 50% for higher‐risk patients, such as those with clinical ASCVD, diabetes mellitus (with an estimated 10‐year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%), and for LDL‐C ≥ 190 mg/dL. 1

If patients fail to reach target LDL‐C levels or achieve the expected therapeutic response on their initial statin therapy, the treating clinician currently has the options of increasing the statin dose or switching to a more effective LDL‐C–lowering statin; and for those unable to tolerate high‐intensity statins, nonstatin therapy may be added to further lower LDL‐C (most commonly ezetimibe). 1 Given the degree to which hypercholesterolemia remains poorly controlled, even with statin therapy, high–CV‐risk patients may benefit from more intensive cholesterol‐lowering therapy options. 1, 5, 14

SECONDARY PREVENTION: HOW LOW SHOULD WE GO?

In patients with overt CVD, the guidelines state an optional goal LDL of 70 mg%. This recommendation is based on several recently published trials that examined the effect of aggressive LDL lowering therapy (i.e. high dose statin therapy) in high risk populations of patients (Table 3). In the PROVE-IT TIMI 22 trial, 4,162 patients 10 days after an acute coronary syndrome (acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI], non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI], or high-risk unstable angina) were randomized to standard 40 mg pravastatin treatment or high dose/aggressive 80 mg atorvastatin treatment. Patients were followed for 18 to 36 months and achieved an average LDL cholesterol level of 62 mg% in the atorvastatin group and 95 mg% in the pravastatin group. In the aggressive therapy group versus the control group, a significant 16% reduction in the primary end point (a composite of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring re-hospitalization, revascularization and stroke) was noted. 18% of the ∼1,600 patients in each treatment arm suffered from diabetes and showed similar risk reduction to that of the general cohort. A post hoc analysis of the PROVE-IT TIMI 22 trial data revealed a reduction not only in LDL cholesterol but also in CRP levels. This reduction in CRP was significantly associated with a reduction in cardiovascular events irrespective of the associated LDL reduction.

Another important trial was the Treating to New Targets (TNT) study. In one arm of this study, a total of 1,501 patients with diabetes, stable coronary heart disease, and LDL levels < 130 mg% were randomized to receive low-dose (10 mg) or high-dose (80 mg) atorvastatin and followed for 4.9 years. At the end of the study, LDL levels in the low-dose group were 98 versus 77 mg% in the high-dose group. This was associated with a significant 25% reduction in the rate of major cardiovascular events (defined as death from coronary heart disease, nonfatal non–procedure-related myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or fatal or nonfatal stroke) in the high-dose versus the low-dose group.

### Efficacy and safety of alirocumab as add-on therapy in high-cardiovascular-risk patients with hypercholesterolemia not adequately controlled with atorvastatin (20 or 40 mg) or rosuvastatin (10 or 20 mg): design and rationale of the ODYSSEY OPTIONS studies [^112cqCSZ]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Evidence from meta‐analyses and well‐controlled randomized trials of statin therapy show that reducing LDL‐C is associated with a significant reduction in risk of CV events and mortality. 1, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 Despite the availability of statins and other LLTs, many patients with hypercholesterolemia and high CV risk are not achieving LDL‐C levels < 100 mg/dL or < 70 mg/dL. 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11

In clinical practice, patients tend to be initiated on low‐ to moderate‐intensity statin therapy (a daily dose that provides an approximate < 30% to 30% to 50% LDL‐C reduction, respectively), with up‐titration or switching to a higher‐intensity statin regimen (a daily dose that provides an approximate ≥ 50% LDL‐C reduction) as necessary for individuals not achieving LDL‐C targets or the expected therapeutic response from the initial dose of statin. 12, 13

2.1 Hyperlipidemia and Mixed Dyslipidemia

The recommended starting dose of atorvastatin calcium tablets are 10 mg or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDL-C (more than 45%) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of atorvastatin calcium tablets are 10 mg to 80 mg once daily. Atorvastatin calcium tablets can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. The starting dose and maintenance doses of atorvastatin calcium tablets should be individualized according to patient characteristics such as goal of therapy and response. After initiation and/or upon titration of atorvastatin calcium tablets, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly.

2.2 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (10 Years to 17 Years of Age)

The recommended starting dose of atorvastatin calcium tablets are 10 mg/day; the usual dose range is 10 mg to 20 mg orally once daily [see Clinical Studies (14.6)]. Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy [see Indications and Usage (1.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12)]. Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more.

2.3 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia

The dosage of atorvastatin calcium tablets in patients with HoFH is 10 mg to 80 mg daily. Atorvastatin calcium tablets should be used as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (e.g. LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable.

2.4 Concomitant Lipid-Lowering Therapy

Atorvastatin calcium tablets may be used with bile acid resins. The combination of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and fibrates should generally be used with caution [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Interactions (7)].

2.5 Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment

Renal disease does not affect the plasma concentrations nor LDL-C reduction of atorvastatin calcium tablets; thus, dosage adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Effects of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin compared over 52 weeks of treatment in patients with hypercholesterolemia [^112GHh2m]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the demonstrated benefits of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction in reducing the risk of coronary heart disease, many patients receiving lipid-lowering therapy fail to achieve LDL-C goals. We compared the effects of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin in reducing LDL-C and achieving LDL-C goals in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia.

Methods and Results

In this 52-week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial (4522IL/0026), 412 patients with LDL-C 160 to < 250 mg/dL received a 5-mg dose of rosuvastatin (n = 138), a 10-mg dose of rosuvastatin (n = 134), or a 10-mg dose of atorvastatin (n = 140) for 12 weeks; during the following 40 weeks, dosages could be sequentially doubled up to 80 mg if National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel II (ATP-II) LDL-C goals were not achieved. At 12 weeks, 5- and 10-mg doses of rosuvastatin were associated with significantly greater LDL-C reductions than 10-mg doses of atorvastatin (46% and 50% vs 39%, both P < .001). At 12 weeks, both rosuvastatin dosages brought more patients to within ATP-II and European LDL-C goals than atorvastatin (86% and 89% vs 73% and 75%, and 86% vs 55%, respectively). At 52 weeks, compared with atorvastatin, both initial rosuvastatin treatment groups significantly reduced LDL-C (47% and 53% vs 44%, P < .05 and P < .001). Overall, more patients in the initial rosuvastatin 10-mg group achieved their ATP-II LDL-C goal than those in the initial atorvastatin 10-mg group (98% vs 87%), with 82% of patients treated with rosuvastatin achieving their goal at the 10-mg starting dosage without the need for titration, compared with 59% of patients treated with atorvastatin. Both treatments were well tolerated over 52 weeks.

Conclusion

Compared with atorvastatin, rosuvastatin produced greater reductions in LDL-C, which may offer advantages in LDL-C goal attainment over existing lipid-lowering therapies.

Adjust dosage according to blood pressure goals. In general, wait 7 to 14 days between titration steps. Titration may proceed more rapidly, however, if clinically warranted, provided the patient is assessed frequently.

Angina: The recommended dose of amlodipine for chronic stable or vasospastic angina is 5 to 10 mg, with the lower dose suggested in the elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Most patients will require 10 mg for adequate effect.

Coronary Artery Disease: The recommended dose range of amlodipine for patients with CAD is 5 to 10 mg once daily. In clinical studies, the majority of patients required 10 mg [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

Pediatrics: The effective antihypertensive oral dose of amlodipine in pediatric patients ages 6 to 17 years is 2.5 mg to 5 mg once daily. Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Atorvastatin (Hyperlipidemia)

Hyperlipidemia and Mixed Dyslipidemia: The recommended starting dose of atorvastatin is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDL-C (more than 45%) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of atorvastatin is 10 to 80 mg once daily. Atorvastatin can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. The starting dose and maintenance doses of atorvastatin should be individualized according to patient characteristics such as goal of therapy and response. After initiation and/or upon titration of atorvastatin, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly.

### Starting primary prevention earlier with statins [^113mhgJf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was based on a systematic review of randomized trials with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes and meta-analyses of these trials published through 2011. With evidence of an ASCVD risk reduction benefit greatly outweighing the potential for adverse effects, the guideline recommends statin therapy for primary prevention in those with ≥ 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk and consideration of statin therapy in those with 5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk. Subsequent meta-analyses of the statin trials support these recommendations and have additionally found a reduction in total mortality in lower-risk subjects. Additional evidence from imaging trials and epidemiologic studies suggests that initiation of statin therapy earlier in the course of ASCVD could have the potential to more effectively prevent age-related progression of atherosclerosis. Given the high levels of suboptimal risk factors in adults and the safety and availability of low-cost generic statins, a consideration of all the available evidence strongly supports earlier intervention for the primary prevention of ASCVD. In conclusion, earlier initiation of statin therapy has the potential to have a large long-term impact on the heavy burden of cardiovascular disease in the aging populations.

### Is lower and lower better and better? A re-evaluation of the evidence from the cholesterol treatment trialists' collaboration meta-analysis for low-density lipoprotein lowering [^112MM9yq]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2012). Low credibility.

Researchers from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) Collaboration have argued for maximal lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by the use of pharmacologic agents, with the strongest evidence coming from the five comparison statin studies in their second meta-analysis. The CTT meta-analysis has many strengths but also a number of limitations, which have not been discussed and which, given the clinical implications, require consideration. Among these are: (1) the impact and validity of including revascularizations within a composite primary end point; (2) the inclusion of the A-Z study, whose design does not allow for valid comparisons of two statin regimens; (3) the fact that baseline LDL-C levels in the comparison studies were not low enough to test whether statin therapy reduces risk significantly in groups with an initial low LDL-C; and, most important, (4) authors of the five studies compared doses at the extremes of statin regimens. However, the clinical choice is not between the lowest and the greatest dose of a statin statin regimens, for example, between 10 and 80 mg atorvastatin, but, more realistically, between intermediate and high dose, that is, between 40 and 80 mg atorvastatin. On the basis of the CTT meta-analysis, we calculate that any potential gain from increasing the dose from 40 to 80 mg atorvastatin would be very small, at best a further 2% further reduction in clinical events. The increase in dose, unfortunately, would likely be associated with increased side effects and decreased compliance. Accordingly, whether net benefit would be demonstrable cannot be assumed. It follows that definitive evidence supporting maximal lowering of LDL-C or maximal dose of statins is still lacking and guidelines, if they are to be evidence-based, should acknowledge this uncertainty.

### A meta-analysis of randomized head-to-head trials for effects of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin on apolipoprotein profiles [^1112cBkf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

To determine which statin will better improve the apolipoprotein (Apo) profiles (ApoA-I levels, ApoB levels, and ApoB/A-I ratios), we performed a meta-analysis of randomized head-to-head trials of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin therapy. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched through December 2012 using Web-based search engines (PubMed and OVID). The search terms included "apolipoprotein", "rosuvastatin", "atorvastatin", "randomized", "randomly", and "randomization". Of 42 potentially relevant studies initially screened, 25 reports of randomized trials enrolling 14,283 patients were included. A pooled analysis for the percentage of changes in ApoA-I demonstrated a benefit of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin in the comparison of all rosuvastatin/atorvastatin dose ratios (mean difference 2.97%, 3.39%, 5.77%, and 6.25%). For the percentage of changes in ApoB, a benefit was seen for rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin in the 1/1 (-6.06%) and 1/2 dose ratio (-1.80%). However, a benefit was seen for atorvastatin versus rosuvastatin in the 1/4 (2.38%) and 1/8 dose ratio (6.59%). The pooled analysis for the percentage of changes in the Apo B/A-I ratios demonstrated a benefit for rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin in the 1/1 (-7.22%) and 1/2 dose ratio (-3.51%), with no difference in the 1/4 dose ratio. In contrast, a benefit was seen for atorvastatin versus rosuvastatin in the 1/8 dose ratio (4.03%). In conclusion, rosuvastatin might increase Apo A-I levels at all dose ratios and decrease ApoB levels and ApoB/A-I ratios in the 1/1 and 1/2 dose ratio versus atorvastatin. Only higher dose atorvastatin appeared to be more effective for the reduction in ApoB levels (1/4 and 1/8 dose ratio) and Apo B/A-I ratios (1/8 dose ratio).

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^1154wzMH]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Initiation of drug therapy — statin intensity and targets: Unless contraindicated, first-line drug therapy for treatment of elevated atherogenic cholesterol levels is a moderate- or high-intensity statin, and a moderate-intensity statin will generally lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 30% to < 50% and a high-intensity statin by ≥ 50%, although individual patient responses should be expected to vary considerably. Some clinicians prefer to start with a high-intensity statin and reduce the dosage if the patient experiences intolerance, while others prefer to start with a moderate-intensity statin and titrate upward if additional lowering of atherogenic cholesterol is desired; if drug therapy is used, the panel consensus view was that at least a 30% reduction in atherogenic cholesterol should be targeted. Some patients have contraindications for, or intolerance to, statin therapy, and for such patients, nonstatin drug therapy may be considered.

### Timing of loading dose of atorvastatin in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention for acute coronary syndromes: insights from the SECURE-PCI randomized clinical trial [^111xdy5N]. JAMA Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Loading doses of atorvastatin did not show reduction on clinical outcomes in the overall population of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) enrolled in the Statins Evaluation in Coronary Procedures and Revascularization (SECURE-PCI) trial, but a potential benefit was identified in patients who subsequently underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Objectives

To determine whether periprocedural loading doses of atorvastatin are associated with decreased 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with ACS undergoing PCI according to type of ACS and timing of atorvastatin administration before PCI.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Secondary analysis of a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial conducted at 53 sites that enrolled 4191 patients with ACS intended to be treated with PCI between April 18, 2012, and October 06, 2017.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to 2 loading doses of 80 mg of atorvastatin or matching placebo before and 24 hours after a planned PCI. By protocol, all patients (regardless of treatment group) received 40 mg of atorvastatin for 30 days starting 24 hours after the second dose of study medication.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was MACE through 30 days, composed by all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and unplanned coronary revascularization. Cox regression models adjusting for key baseline characteristics were used to assess the association between atorvastatin and MACE in patients undergoing PCI.

Results

From the overall trial population, 2710 (64.7%) underwent PCI (650 women [24.0%]; mean [SD] age, 62 [11.3] years). Loading atorvastatin was associated with reduced MACE at 30 days by 28% in the PCI group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.72; 95% CI 0.54–0.97; p = 0.03). Loading dose of atorvastatin was administered less than 12 hours before PCI in 2548 patients (95.3%) (45.1% < 2 hours and 54.3% between 2 and 12 hours). There was no significant interaction between treatment effect and timing of study drug administration. The treatment effect of loading atorvastatin was more pronounced in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction than in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS (adjusted HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38–0.92; p = 0.02; HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.58–1.27; p = 0.43, respectively).

Conclusions and Relevance

In patients with ACS undergoing PCI, periprocedural loading doses of atorvastatin appeared to reduce the rate of MACE at 30 days, most clearly in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. This beneficial effect seemed to be preserved and consistent, irrespective of the timing of atorvastatin administration, including within 2 hours before PCI.

### Uptake of statin guidelines to prevent and treat cardiovascular disease [^116Xz77D]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In December 2013, cholesterol treatment guidelines changed the approach to statin therapy by recommending fixed doses of low-, medium-, or high-intensity statins based on cardiovascular risk. We sought to evaluate the guideline's adoption in a diverse group of practices.

Methods

Using a mixed-methods approach, we analyzed electronic health record data the year before and 2years following guideline publication in 45 practices across 8 states. We examined associations based on patient, clinician, and practice characteristics and interviewed 24 clinicians and practice leaders to inform findings.

Results

The proportion of patients adherent with all recommendations 2 years after the guideline only increased from 18.5% to 20.3% (P&lt;.01). There were clinically insignificant increases in statin use across risk strata (1.7% to 3.5%) and small increases in high-intensity statin use (2.6% to 4.6%). Only half of patients with cardiovascular disease (52.9%) were on any statin, not much different from patients at moderate (49.6% to 50.9%) or low (41.6% to 48.7%) risk. Multiple patient (risk, use of health care), clinician (age), and practice (type, rurality) factors were associated with statin use. Clinicians reported patient resistance to statins but liked having a risk calculator to guide discussions.

Conclusion

Despite general agreement with statin benefit, the guideline was poorly implemented. Marginal differences in statin use between the highest and lower risk strata of patients is concerning. Rather than intensifying statin potency and recommending more patients take statins, guidelines may want to focus on ensuring that those who will benefit most get treatment.

### Investigating the prevalence, predictors, and prognosis of suboptimal statin use early after a non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome [^1115aWoe]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality worldwide. In the United States and the United Kingdom, CVD accounts for the largest and second largest proportions of healthcare expenditure of any disease category, respectively. Although an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a sudden event, most of the morbidity and mortality accrues later, after hospital discharge. Statins are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A reductase inhibitors that reduce circulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. After an ACS, high-potency statin therapy, prescribed as atorvastatin 80 mg daily, is indicated because it has been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to be highly effective and superior to both placebo and moderate statin therapy for reducing cardiovascular events. However, the effectiveness of drugs in RCTs can be undermined in clinical practice by several factors including poor adherence, discontinuation, and switching prescriptions to a lower equivalent potency. Poor statin adherence has been reported in up to 50% of patients, statin discontinuation rates vary from 15%to 60% to 75%, and changing to lower potency statin therapy has been noted in ∼1%to 42%of patients.

It is important to understand the clinical consequences of deviating from recommended high-potency statin therapy in high-risk patients who have had at least one cardiovascular event. The adverse effects of statin nonadherence and discontinuation on cardiovascular clinical outcomes have been investigated previously, but relatively little is known about the impact of statin dose reductions and/or switching to a statin of lower equivalent potency in real-world secondary prevention. The collective extent to which statin discontinuation, dose reduction, switching and/or nonadherence occur early in secondary prevention is also underreported. Furthermore, few real-world statin adherence studies have focused exclusively on non-ST elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS) patients, which as a group are often older, have more comorbidities, are more likely to receive noninterventional medical management, and have a worse long-term prognosis than patients suffering an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI), and so may be more susceptible to insufficient statin therapy.

Therefore, the aims of this study were to investigate (i) the prevalence of, (ii) the risk factors for, and (iii) the clinical consequences associated with conversion from high potency to "suboptimal" statin use due to statin discontinuation, dose reduction, switching to an alternative statin of lower equivalent potency and/or statin nonadherence, early after an NSTE-ACS in a contemporary prospective cardiovascular cohort.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116iJYWW]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Statin therapy as primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in people with HIV — For those aged 40–75 years with 10-year ASCVD risk estimates of 5% to < 20%, the Panel recommends initiating at least moderate-intensity statin therapy (AI); recommended options are pitavastatin 4 mg once daily (AI), atorvastatin 20 mg once daily (AII), and rosuvastatin 10 mg once daily (AII). When 10-year ASCVD risk estimates are < 5%, the Panel favors initiating at least moderate-intensity statin therapy (CI), using the same options for moderate-intensity statin therapy as recommended for 10-year ASCVD risk estimates of 5% to < 20%. The absolute benefit from statin therapy is modest in this population; therefore, the decision to initiate a statin should take into account the presence or absence of HIV-related factors that can increase ASCVD risk. For people aged < 40 years, data are insufficient to recommend for or against statin therapy as primary prevention of ASCVD in people with HIV. Estimates are based on the ASCVD Risk Estimator from the American College of Cardiology (ACC).

### A dose-specific meta-analysis of lipid changes in randomized controlled trials of atorvastatin and simvastatin [^115FF7DV]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The available statins exhibit differences in the potency with which they alter serum lipid levels.

Objective

Meta-analyses were conducted to assess the relative potency of atorvastatin and simvastatin (the 2 most commonly prescribed statins) across all possible dose combinations in terms of changes in total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C).

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, National Health Service (NHS) Centre for Reviews and Dissemination database, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects were searched for randomized, head-to-head trials of atorvastatin and simvastatin in patients aged ≥ 18 years with elevated levels of serum TC and LDL-C. Reference lists of the identified articles, letters, and editorials also were reviewed. The manufacturers of atorvastatin and simvastatin products were contacted for relevant unpublished data. All studies were reviewed and rated for quality by 2 independent reviewers. The maximum quality score was 4 points; trials with a score of < 2 points were considered to be of poor quality and were excluded from analysis. Dose comparisons were abstracted in pairs from each trial. Meta-analyses were conducted on the fixed-dose pairs for each lipid parameter. Weighted mean differences in the change in TC, LDL-C, TG, and HDL-C were estimated using the Der Simonian and Laird random-effects model.

Results

Seventeen published trials and 1 unpublished study were included in the meta-analyses. Atorvastatin treatment was associated with significantly greater reductions in TC, LDL-C, and TG in the majority of dose comparisons with simvastatin. The potency of atorvastatin and simvastatin was comparable at dose ratios between 1:2 and 1:4. Higher doses of simvastatin were more effective in increasing HDL-C levels than atorvastatin, with no apparent dose-equivalence point. The HDL-C advantage of simvastatin was greatest when simvastatin 80 mg was compared with atorvastatin 80 mg (weighted mean difference, -4.35%; 95% CI, -5.64 to -3.08, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

In these meta-analyses, atorvastatin was 2 to 4 times as potent as simvastatin in reducing TC, LDL-C, and TG, indicating that the dose equivalence of atorvastatin and simvastatin lay between 1:2 and 1:4. In contrast, simvastatin was more effective than atorvastatin in increasing HDL-C, but without any indication of a point of dose equivalence.

### Comparison of the dose-response relationships of 2 lipid-lowering agents: a Bayesian meta-analysis [^116Ki1tG]. American Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Comparing the dose-response of a new drug to that of a previously studied drug can aid in understanding their relative potencies. Two dose-finding studies addressed the effect of a new drug, rosuvastatin, on its ability to decrease low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. One of these studies included 2 doses of atorvastatin, and substantial additional information is available in the literature about the effect of atorvastatin on LDL-C level lowering.

Methods

The 2 dose-finding studies of rosuvastatin considered otherwise healthy patients who had hypercholesterolemia. Comparable studies of atorvastatin were identified via a MEDLINE search in December 1999. Multiple reviewer consensus identified 15 of 41 studies on atorvastatin published since 1996 that met these selection criteria: reporting of LDL-C level change from baseline at least 6 weeks after treatment initiation, doses administered, and treatment group sizes. Eligible populations had clinical evidence of hypercholesterolemia. We excluded studies with patients who had severe illness or a previous history of transplantation. Data extraction of the mean, sample sizes, and SDs (or CIs) by dose was carried out independently by multiple reviewers. We combined the results from the various studies with Bayesian hierarchical modeling and analyzed them with Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques.

Results

Combining this study and literature results substantially increased the power to compare the dose-response relationships of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin. Rosuvastatin reduced LDL-C level by an estimated 10 to 17 percentage points more than atorvastatin when both were given at the same dose. Approximately one quarter of the dose of rosuvastatin achieved about the same magnitude of LDL-C level reduction as atorvastatin at dosages as high as 80 mg. This finding does not imply a 4-fold difference in efficacy overall and specifically does not describe the results at higher dosage levels.

Conclusions

Bayesian meta-analysis of results from related studies allows the comparison of the dose-response relationships of 2 drugs, better estimates of a particular dose-response relationship within an individual study, and the expression of relative benefits (of dose and drug) in terms of probabilities. Explicitly comparing a study's results with historical data using Bayesian meta-analysis allows clinicians to view the study in the larger context of medical research.

### To what extent do high-intensity statins reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in each of the four statin benefit groups identified by the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association guidelines? A VOYAGER meta-analysis [^1176kiRR]. Atherosclerosis (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The 2013 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines identify four patient groups who benefit from moderate- or high-intensity statin treatment; those with: 1) atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD); 2) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 190 mg/dl; 3) diabetes; or 4) a 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%. High-intensity statins, anticipated to reduce LDL-C by ≥ 50%, were identified as rosuvastatin 20–40 mg and atorvastatin 40–80 mg.

Methods and Results

Individual patient data (32,258) from the VOYAGER database of 37 studies were used to calculate least-squares mean (LSM) percentage change in LDL-C during 8496 patient exposures to rosuvastatin 20–40 mg, and atorvastatin 40–80 mg in the four patient benefit groups. LSM percentage reductions in LDL-C with rosuvastatin 20 and 40 mg were greater than with atorvastatin 40 mg, overall and in each statin benefit group, and with rosuvastatin 40 mg were greater than with atorvastatin 80 mg overall and in three of the four benefit groups (all p < 0.05). For example, in the ASCVD group, 40%, 59%, 57% and 71% of patients treated with atorvastatin 40 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, rosuvastatin 20 mg and rosuvastatin 40 mg, respectively, had a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C.

Conclusions

The choice and dose of statin have an impact both on the percentage LDL-C reduction and achievement of ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C, overall and within each of the four statin benefit groups outlined by the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines. This may be of importance for clinicians in their choice of treatment for individual patients.

### Familial hypercholesterolaemia in children and adolescents: gaining decades of life by optimizing detection and treatment [^111PWMPQ]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Pharmacotherapy for heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia

Statins are the cornerstone of FH management. Simvastatin, lovastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin and rosuvastatin are approved in the USA and Europe for use in children with FH. In the USA, these are approved from age 10 years, except for pravastatin which is approved from age 8 years. Prescribing information is broadly similar in Europe, although rosuvastatin is approved from the age of 6 years. Atorvastatin is approved from age 6 years in Australia. Treatment may be started earlier in severe cases. The short-term efficacy and safety of these statins, including during puberty, have been confirmed.

Treatment should be initiated at the lowest recommended dose and up-titrated according to the LDL-C lowering response and tolerability. Evidence for an absolute target for LDL-C in children with FH does not exist. Expert consensus recommends a target LDL-C level < 3.5 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) from age 10 years, or ideally 50% reduction from pre-treatment levels for children 8–10 years, particularly in those with high-risk conditions or other major risk factors. In patients with chronic kidney disease, a statin that is not excreted by the kidney, such as atorvastatin or simvastatin, should be used. Clinicians should be aware of the potential for drug-drug interactions with statins, notably, for drugs metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 with simvastatin and atorvastatin, and for drugs metabolised by CYP 2C9 with rosuvastatin and fluvastatin. Pravastatin, although a weak statin, does not interfere with CYP enzymes and is therefore a safe drug for initiating treatment in children.

Gemfibrozil with statins — Evaluate statin therapy prior to initiation of gemfibrozil 600 mg twice daily. If the current statin is lovastatin, pravastatin, or simvastatin, discontinue current statin and switch to atorvastatin 10 mg daily, pitavastatin 1 mg daily, or rosuvastatin at 5 mg daily; fluvastatin does not require dose adjustment. If the current statin is atorvastatin, pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, or fluvastatin, reduce statin dose to atorvastatin 10 mg daily, pitavastatin 1 mg daily, or rosuvastatin 5 mg daily, with no dose adjustment required for fluvastatin. If the patient is tolerating therapy after 2–3 months, if needed, titrate statin in 2–3 months to a maximum dose of atorvastatin 20 mg, rosuvastatin 10 mg, or pitavastatin 2 mg; if not tolerating, reduce statin dose or switch to fluvastatin.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^115U79Cs]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) — statin dosing strategies to optimize tolerability include using a lower dose, switching to a different statin or biotransformation pathway, intermittent dosing with longer half-life statins, evidence-based selection, naturally derived options, choosing the lowest milligram strength, and temporary washout. Consider using the lowest daily dose which will provide the majority of the statin's low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering capacity; for example, a patient with SAMS on atorvastatin 80 mg daily may tolerate atorvastatin 10 mg daily. Intermittent dosing is reserved for more severe cases where patients cannot tolerate even the lowest daily dose, and utilizing statins with longer half-lives and greater potency (atorvastatin or rosuvastatin) is recommended in this context, such as rosuvastatin 5 mg given three times per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) for a patient with SAMS on atorvastatin 10–80 mg daily. Some patients may be more accepting of statins shown to have reduced rates of SAMS in clinical trials (e.g., consider fluvastatin-XL or pravastatin instead of simvastatin), may prefer a naturally derived statin (e.g., lovastatin is FDA-approved whereas red yeast rice is not), or may accept a drug with a lower milligram strength (e.g., pitavastatin 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg versus 10 to 80 mg for other statins). Some patients may benefit from a washout period or drug holiday, for example a patient taking rosuvastatin 20 mg daily who takes a 1–2 week drug holiday in preparation for a strenuous physical event, and holding the statin for a few days to a few weeks before restarting may improve persistence rates. Although the table emphasizes dosing strategies, optimizing dietary and lifestyle interventions is recommended for all patients.

### 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol treatment guideline: paradigm shifts in managing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk [^1178PAur]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults represents a major shift from prior cholesterol management guidelines. The new guidelines include data from individual randomized trials as well as the most comprehensive meta-analyses, and introduce several major paradigm shifts, which include: aiming for ASCVD risk reduction as opposed to targeting LDL-C levels, advocating for the use of evidence-based doses of statins as first line therapy, and utilizing a new risk calculator and risk cut point to guide initiation of statin therapy. These major changes have created controversy and confusion among the medical community, with some clinicians hesitant to embrace the shift. We review the evidence that forms the basis for these major changes, compare them to other major lipid guidelines, and recommend an integrated approach to managing dyslipidemia to decrease atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk.

### Switching from high-efficacy lipid-lowering therapies to simvastatin and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal attainment in coronary heart disease / coronary heart disease-equivalent patients [^1127QnXV]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The availability of generic simvastatin in 2006 has prompted substantial changes in formulary recommendations for lipid-management agents.

Objective

To assess the impact of switches from high-efficacy lipid-lowering therapy to simvastatin on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and goal attainment in coronary heart disease (CHD) or CHD risk-equivalent patients in a managed care setting.

Methods

In this retrospective observational study, we estimated the least squares mean difference in the percent change from baseline LDL-C and the odds ratios for LDL-C goal attainment rates (< 100 mg/dL and < 70 mg/dL) at follow-up for each baseline high-efficacy lipid-lowering therapy with the analysis of covariance and logistic regressions, respectively.

Results

We identified 18,061 patients who, between September 1, 2004 and October 31, 2008, were either switched from or remained on their initial high-efficacy LDL-C lowering therapy: ezetimibe/simvastatin fixed-dose combination (E/S), rosuvastatin, or atorvastatin. The difference in percent change in LDL-C levels from baseline were 25.2 (95% confidence interval 21.2–29.2), 13.0 (6.0–20.0), and 3.1 (0.3–5.9) greater in switchers to simvastatin in the E/S, rosuvastatin, and atorvastatin comparisons, respectively, after adjusting for age, sex, and starting dose of the initial therapy. For switchers, the percent of patients at LDL-C < 100 mg/dL at follow-up decreased from 83.5% to 63.8% in the E/S, 67.7% to 52.7% in the rosuvastatin, and 65.1% to 60.2% in the atorvastatin cohorts. The percent of patients at LDL-C < 70 mg/dL at follow-up was lower for all switcher groups compared with nonswitchers.

Conclusions

Among CHD/CHD risk-equivalent patients, switching to simvastatin was associated with increases in LDL-C levels and lower LDL-C goal attainment rates. The public health impact of this phenomenon on population risk and CHD events remains to be determined.

### Prediction of clinical irrelevance of PK differences in atorvastatin using PK / PD models derived from literature-based meta-analyses [^115GPVvo]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Calculation of the sample size for CE trials. The original sample size of 406 patients was chosen to provide 95% power in order to establish that ezetimibe+atorvastatin combination and ezetimibe+atorvastatin coadministration are equivalent. The sample size calculation was based on equivalence margins of ± 4%, assumed true difference of 1.5%, SD of within-patient difference of 12.8%, and 85% evaluability rate using two one-sided tests, each at a 2.5% significance level. The assumption of the true difference of 1.5% was based on the effective dose of atorvastatin calculated using a dose proportionality assumption at the 10/20-mg dose for both AUC and C max. The dose was input into the model proposed by Mandema et al.which gave a prediction of ~1.5% difference. Based on the initial predicted distribution of difference based on the dose proportionality assumption, the sample size of 406 patients translates to an ~80% probability of success.

The updated sample size incorporated the predictions from the updated dose–response model that accounted for the greater-than-dose-proportional increase in exposure. The gain in precision from the more elaborate modeling exercise resulted in a distinct and more accurate predicted distribution of differences between FDC and coadministration of its components for both the 10/20- and the 10/40-mg doses. This higher precision led to a reduced sample size, an overall savings of 17% across the two CE studies, and a higher probability of success (90% for each study).

### Statin use in a "real-world" clinical setting: aggressive lipid lowering compared with usual care in the aggressive lipid-lowering initiation abates new cardiac events (ALLIANCE) trial [^116JFbRM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical trials that incorporate elements of "real-world" experience are of great value to practicing physicians. Using a trial design adapted to approximate clinical settings, the Aggressive Lipid-Lowering Initiation Abates New Cardiac Events (ALLIANCE) trial compared a focused treatment strategy using atorvastatin with usual medical care. Patients eligible for study participation were predefined based on diagnosis codes for coronary heart disease from US managed care database records; 66% of these patients were taking lipid-lowering medications at study entry. In contrast to standard clinical trials, ALLIANCE maintained a real-world environment by limiting the interactions of investigators with patients after dose titration of aggressive treatment to a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goal < 80 mg/dL (2.1 mmol/L) or maximum atorvastatin dose of 80 mg/day. After 51.5 months of follow-up, the study showed that aggressive treatment with atorvastatin was associated with significantly lower LDL cholesterol levels (147 mg/dL [3.8 mmol/L] to 95 mg/dL [2.5 mmol/L]) over usual care (146 mg/dL [3.8 mmol/L] to 111 mg/dL [2.9 mmol/L]). This greater reduction in LDL cholesterol was accompanied by improved outcomes in the composite primary end point of cardiovascular events (-17% with atorvastatin vs. usual care; P = 0.02) and particularly in the end point of nonfatal myocardial infarction (-47% with atorvastatin vs. usual care; P = 0.0002). No safety difference was noted between the 2 treatment groups. These results indicate that usual-care treatment was not equivalent to targeted statin therapy, even in a trial conducted to minimize potential bias owing to traditional patient selection and trial design methods.

Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

For high‐risk individuals who require greater LDL‐C lowering than that achieved with statin therapy alone, some guidelines recommend combination of statin therapy with ≥ 1 other LLT. Guidelines also recommend the use of other LLTs for individuals who are unable to tolerate a statin dose sufficient to reduce LDL‐C to target levels or who are unable to tolerate high‐intensity statin therapy or achieve the desired percent reduction in LDL‐C. 1, 12, 13

Despite these guidelines, however, studies conducted in real‐world settings suggest that the percentage of patients achieving recommended LDL‐C levels is not optimal and can be improved. 6, 7, 8, 28 For example, an observational study assessing treatment practice patterns in high–CV‐risk patients on statin monotherapy found that although greater LDL‐C reductions were seen in patients who received add‐on ezetimibe therapy or underwent a statin dose up‐titration, approximately 30% of these patients were not achieving LDL‐C levels < 70 mg/dL, 29 suggesting that currently available treatment options are not sufficient for some higher‐risk patients. Furthermore, recent evidence also suggests doubling the dose to that of a high‐intensity statin may provide minimal benefit from additional LDL‐C lowering. 30 For example, it was calculated that increasing the dose from 40 mg to 80 mg of atorvastatin may result in only an approximate 2% reduction in the risk of clinical events. 30 Overall, whereas statins have been shown to be efficacious in lowering LDL‐C, patients at high CV risk may benefit from additional, more intensive LLTs to help them achieve their LDL‐C goals.

### Should an LDL-cholesterol target-based approach Be readopted? [^113nWZ9b]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To review clinical trials driving the evolution of hyperlipidemic guidelines, discuss whether low-density lipoprotein (LDL) targets and adjunctive therapy on top of statins should be used, and summarize the pharmacist's role in helping achieve LDL goals.

Data Sources

MEDLINE search (1/1980–5/2017) using terms including LDL, lipid, and statin, with forward and backward citation tracking.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language studies and guidelines assessing LDL-lowering therapy were included.

Data Synthesis

In 2013, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) hyperlipidemic guideline stepped back from LDL goals opting for statin monotherapy with an intensity of dosing predicated on baseline risk. This was driven by abundant clinical trial evidence for the statins, with adjunctive therapy on top of statins failing to show substantial benefit. However, recent evidence suggests that returning to LDL goals is warranted and adjuvant ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitor therapy may further reduce cardiovascular events. This is reflected in some society guidelines but not from the AHA/ACC. Pharmacists are well positioned to help achieve LDL goals, as they have positively affected LDL goal attainment across a multitude of settings.

Conclusions

Statins are the mainstay of therapy but patients should have LDL targets, and if patients on maximally tolerated statin doses are not at goal, adjunctive therapy with ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors may improve outcomes. In the emerging LDL goal paradigm, the pharmacist has a critical role to play.

### Rationale and design of a randomised double-blind 2 × 2 factorial trial comparing the effect of a 3-month intensive statin and antiplatelet therapy for patients with acute mild ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA with intracranial or extracranial atherosclerosis (INSPIRES) [^115VHqZn]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Randomisation and treatment intervention

This trial has a 2×2 factorial design, with separate randomisations for antiplatelet therapy and statin therapy. Randomisation assignments are centrally generated using a block design. Subjects are given a random number that corresponds to a drug package that will be administered to the patient. Eligible individuals will be randomly divided in a 1:1:1:1 ratio into four sets as follows: (1) intensive antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel at a loading dose of 300 mg on day 1, then 75 mg daily for days 2–90, combined with aspirin at a dosage of 100–300 mg on day 1, then 100 mg daily for days 2–21) plus immediate intensive statin therapy (atorvastatin at a dose of 80 mg daily for days –21, then 40 mg daily for days 22–90); (2) intensive antiplatelet therapy plus delayed intensive statin therapy (atorvastatin placebo for days 1–3, followed by atorvastatin at a dose of 40 mg daily for days 4–90); (3) standard antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel placebo combined with aspirin at a dose of 100–300 mg on day 1, then 100 mg daily for days 2–90) plus immediate intensive statin therapy and (4) standard antiplatelet therapy plus delayed intensive statin therapy (online supplemental table S2). The flow chart of INSPIRES trial is shown in figure 1.

### Association of rosuvastatin use with risk of hematuria and proteinuria [^111J1Yt6]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite reports of hematuria and proteinuria with rosuvastatin use at the time of its approval by the US Food and Drug Association (FDA), little postmarketing surveillance exists to assess real-world risk. Current labeling suggests dose reduction (maximum daily dose of 10 mg) for patients with severe CKD.

Methods

Using deidentified electronic health record data, we analyzed 152,101 and 795,799 new users of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin, respectively, from 2011 to 2019. We estimated inverse probability of treatment-weighted hazard ratios (HRs) of hematuria, proteinuria, and kidney failure with replacement therapy (KFRT) associated with rosuvastatin. We reported the initial rosuvastatin dose across eGFR categories and evaluated for a dose effect on hematuria and proteinuria.

Results

Overall, we identified 2.9% of patients with hematuria and 1.0% with proteinuria during a median follow-up of 3.1 years. Compared with atorvastatin, rosuvastatin was associated with increased risk of hematuria (HR, 1.08; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.04 to 1.11), proteinuria (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.25), and KFRT (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.30). A substantial share (44%) of patients with eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 was prescribed high-dose rosuvastatin (20 or 40 mg daily). Risk was higher with higher rosuvastatin dose.

Conclusions

Compared with atorvastatin, rosuvastatin was associated with increased risk of hematuria, proteinuria, and KFRT. Among patients with eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, 44% were prescribed a rosuvastatin daily dose exceeding the FDA's recommended 10 mg daily dose. Our findings suggest the need for greater care in prescribing and monitoring rosuvastatin, particularly in patients who receive high doses or who have severe CKD.

Primary Hyperlipidemia in Adults

Atorvastatin reduces total-C, LDL-C, apo B, and TG, and increases HDL-C in patients with hyperlipidemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia. Therapeutic response is seen within 2 weeks, and maximum response is usually achieved within 4 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy.

In two multicenter, placebo-controlled, dose-response trials in patients with hyperlipidemia, atorvastatin given as a single dose over 6 weeks, significantly reduced total-C, LDL-C, apo B, and TG. (Pooled results are provided in Table 8.)

Table 8: Dose Response in Patients with Primary Hyperlipidemia (Adjusted Mean % Change From Baseline)

In three multicenter, double-blind trials in patients with hyperlipidemia, atorvastatin was compared to other statins. After randomization, patients were treated for 16 weeks with either atorvastatin 10 mg per day or a fixed dose of the comparative agent (Table 9).

### Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium [^111kTHvc]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium

Dosage of amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance for each individual component in the treatment of hypertension/angina and hyperlipidemia. Select doses of amlodipine and atorvastatin independently.

Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium may be substituted for its individually titrated components. Patients may be given the equivalent dose of amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium or a dose of amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium with increased amounts of amlodipine, atorvastatin, or both for additional antianginal effects, blood pressure lowering, or lipid-lowering effect.

Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium may be used to provide additional therapy for patients already on one of its components. Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium may be used to initiate treatment in patients with hyperlipidemia and either hypertension or angina.

Amlodipine

The usual initial antihypertensive oral dose of amlodipine is 5 mg once daily, and the maximum dose is 10 mg once daily.

Pediatric (age > 6 years), small adult, fragile, or elderly patients, or patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily and this dose may be used when adding amlodipine to other antihypertensive therapy.

### Is alternate daily dose of atorvastatin effective in treating patients with hyperlipidemia? The alternate day versus daily dosing of atorvastatin study (ADDAS) [^114GEadN]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the comparative efficacy of alternate-day dosing of atorvastatin compared with the standard once-daily dose based on mean low-density lipoprotein (LDL) reduction from baseline at 6 and 12 weeks of treatment.

Methods

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, 35 eligible patients who met the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel II (ATP II) guidelines for drug therapy, depending on their risk factors, were randomly assigned to receive 10 mg of atorvastatin as an initial dose every day or every other day. Patients were assessed at 6 and 12 weeks as to whether they met the LDL-C goal, and the dose was doubled if the goal was not reached.

Results

LDL-C decreased by 27% and 38%, in the every-other-day (n = 15) and every-day (n = 15) groups, respectively, at 6 weeks. At 12 weeks, the LDL-C was reduced by 35% and 38% in the every-other-day and every-day groups, respectively (P = .49). The mean dose was 18 mg (9 mg/d) in the alternate-day group (n = 14) and 12 mg/d in the every-day group (n = 12) at the end of the 12 weeks (P = .001).

Conclusions

Although higher doses of atorvastatin were used on alternate days, these results suggest that the alternate-day administration of atorvastatin can produce a reduction in LDL-C comparable to that of daily administration in patients with hypercholesterolemia, and yet provide some cost savings.

### Correlation of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol with apolipoprotein B: effect of 5 hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors on non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels [^1149kCjV]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Apolipoprotein B has been shown to be a better predictor of coronary heart disease than low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol may also be a better parameter for coronary heart disease risk assessment and as a target for therapy. Data from the Atorvastatin Comparative Cholesterol Efficacy and Safety Study (ACCESS) were used to assess the correlation between lipid and apolipoprotein B levels before and after lipid-lowering therapy and to examine the effects of 5 hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors on lipids and apolipoprotein B. The 54-week study randomized 3,916 hypercholesterolemic patients to atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, or simvastatin, initiated at recommended starting doses with titrations as needed at weeks 6, 12, and 18 to achieve National Cholesterol Education Program LDL targets. Compared with LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol correlated better with apolipoprotein B levels at baseline (r = 0.914, p < 0.0001) and at week 54 (r = 0.938, p < 0.0001), and the correlation was strong across all baseline triglyceride strata. At starting doses, atorvastatin (10 mg) lowered non-HDL cholesterol by 33.3% compared with 26.6% with simvastatin (10 mg), 24.1% with lovastatin (20 mg), 17.2% with fluvastatin (20 mg), and 17.0% with pravastatin (10 mg). Atorvastatin also provided greater reductions in non-HDL cholesterol after dose titration, and a greater percentage of patients taking atorvastatin achieved non-HDL cholesterol targets. Baseline triglyceride did not affect non-HDL cholesterol reductions with any of the 5 hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors. Fewer patients achieved non-HDL cholesterol targets than LDL cholesterol targets, particularly among high-risk patients, implying that if non-HDL cholesterol was used as a target for treatment, more patients would need to be treated more aggressively than National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines require.

### Statin therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^113puV6h]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Do statins reduce rates of cardiovascular events when used for primary prevention?

Bottom Line

When used for primary prevention, statins are associated with lower rates of all-cause mortality, major vascular events, and revascularizations compared with placebo. Statin therapy is not associated with increased rates of life-threatening adverse effects such as cancer.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^114dhW4n]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) initiation and titration in children and adolescents: Start with the lowest dose once daily, usually at bedtime, and note that atorvastatin and rosuvastatin can be taken in the morning or evening because of their long half-lives. Measure baseline CK, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Whenever potential myopathy symptoms present, stop medication and assess CK; determine relation to recent physical activity, and use the threshold for worrisome level of CK of 10 times above the upper limit of reported normal. After 4 weeks, measure fasting lipid profile (FLP), ALT, and AST; the threshold for worrisome levels of ALT or AST is ≥ 3 times the upper limit of reported normal; target levels for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL–C) are minimal < 130 mg/dL and ideal < 110 mg/dL. If target LDL–C levels are achieved and there are no potential myopathy symptoms or laboratory abnormalities, continue therapy and recheck FLP, ALT, and AST in 8 weeks and then 3 months. If laboratory abnormalities are noted or symptoms are reported, temporarily withhold the medication and repeat the blood work in 2 weeks, restarting when abnormalities resolve with close monitoring. If target LDL–C levels are not achieved, increase the dose by one increment (usually 10 mg) and repeat the blood work in 4 weeks; if still not achieved, dose may be further increased by one increment or another agent (bile acid sequestrant or cholesterol absorption inhibitor) may be added under the direction of a lipid specialist. Check for potential interaction whenever any new medication is initiated.

4.1 The Benefits of Low‐Intensity Statin Combination Therapy Over Moderate‐Intensity Statin Therapy

Lowering LDL‐C improves clinical outcomes and statins are recommended as the mainstay of lipid‐lowering therapy. Therefore, recent lipid guidelines recommend LDL‐C reduction based on cardiovascular risk. Clinical guidelines recommend moderate‐intensity statins for primary prevention in adults aged 40–75 years without diabetes and at a moderate cardiovascular risk, or in patients with diabetes and aged 40–75 years. Although the initial lowering of LDL‐C levels with statins is effective, further reductions require disproportionately larger dose increases. This is because statin‐induced reductions in serum cholesterol can lead to increased cholesterol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, which diminishes the efficacy of higher statin doses. Typically, doubling the statin dose from the minimum effective dose yields only an additional 6% reduction in serum LDL‐C concentration. In addition, side effects associated with statins include myopathy, new‐onset diabetes, and an increased risk of hepatotoxicity. The SEARCH trial compared the effects of 80 mg versus 20 mg of simvastatin in patients with a history of myocardial infarction. The trial demonstrated a higher risk of myopathy in high‐dose simvastatin (0.9%) compared to the low‐dose group (0.03%). Similarly, the JUPITER trial, which compared rosuvastatin 20 mg to placebo, reported a higher incidence of new‐onset diabetes in the rosuvastatin (3.0% vs. 2.4%). In another meta‐analysis comparing high‐intensity and moderate‐intensity statins, new‐onset DM occurred 12% more often in the high‐intensity statin group compared with the moderate‐intensity statin group. These findings highlight the dose‐dependent manner in which statin‐associated side effects, which are important because they reduce patient adherence, are associated with clinical outcomes. Our study found that combining a low‐intensity statin atorvastatin 5 mg with ezetimibe resulted in a 47.6% reduction in LDL‐C from baseline, a significantly greater reduction than that achieved with atorvastatin 10 mg monotherapy, which is classified as a moderate‐intensity statin. Moreover, in the A5E10 group, 100% of participants with low‐to‐moderate risk achieved their LDL‐C targets. Consistent with the results of previous studies, these findings suggest that adding ezetimibe to a low‐intensity statin can achieve greater LDL‐C reduction than a moderate‐intensity statin alone, potentially offering a more effective and better‐tolerated treatment option by reducing the side effects commonly associated with high‐intensity statin therapy.
