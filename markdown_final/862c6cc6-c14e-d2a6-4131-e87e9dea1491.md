## Question

8. Given 5 points, no three of which lie on the same line. How many segments need to be drawn to connect each pair of points?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many line segments are needed to connect every pair of points among 5 points, with no three collinear. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the combinatorial interpretation of "connect each pair". Then, I should verify the formula for combinations and apply it to 5 points. Next, I will consider whether the "no three collinear" condition affects the count. Finally, I will double-check the arithmetic and state the answer clearly.

> Let me first confirm the combinatorial framing: connecting each pair of points is equivalent to choosing 2 distinct points out of 5, and each such pair defines exactly one line segment, so the problem reduces to counting unordered pairs, i.e., "5 choose 2" [^fbb8a6d3].

> I need to check the combination formula. The number of ways to choose 2 items from n is given by C(n, 2) = n(n − 1)/2, so for n = 5 that is 5 × 4 / 2 = 10 segments, and I should confirm that this matches the intuitive enumeration of pairs like (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), which indeed totals 10 [^fbb8a6d3].

> Wait, let me verify the "no three collinear" caveat. The condition ensures that each pair uniquely defines a distinct line segment and prevents degeneracies where multiple pairs would lie on the same line, but it does not change the count of unordered pairs, so the combinatorial answer remains 10 segments regardless of collinearity constraints, even though collinearity would make some segments overlap geometrically [^fbb8a6d3].

> Hold on, I should double-check the arithmetic: 5 × 4 = 20, divided by 2 is 10, so the final count is 10 segments, and I can confidently conclude that 10 line segments are required to connect every pair of 5 non-collinear points [^fbb8a6d3].

---

The number of segments needed to connect each pair of 5 points, with no three collinear, is **10**. This is a combination problem: the number of ways to choose 2 points from 5 is C(5, 2) = 10. The "no three collinear" condition ensures each pair defines a unique segment, so **no additional segments are needed** beyond these 10.

---

## Combinatorial approach

The problem is equivalent to finding the number of ways to choose 2 points from 5, which is given by the combination formula:

[
C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}
]

For n = 5 and k = 2:

[
C(5, 2) = \\frac{5!}{2!(5–2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10
]

Thus, **10 segments** are needed to connect each pair of 5 points.

---

## Geometric interpretation

With no three points collinear, each pair of points defines a unique line segment. The total number of segments is the number of unique pairs, which is again **10**.

---

## Verification by enumeration

Label the points A, B, C, D, and E. The unique pairs are:

- AB, AC, AD, AE
- BC, BD, BE
- CD, CE
- DE

Counting these gives **10 segments**, confirming the result.

---

## Generalization

For n points with no three collinear, the number of segments is C(n, 2) = n(n − 1)/2. For n = 5, this is 5 × 4 / 2 = **10**.

---

The answer is **10 segments**.

### Maintaining and updating accurate internal representations of continuous variables with a handful of neurons [^0e945025]. Nature Neuroscience (2024). High credibility.

In contrast, nonoptimal networks can only maintain a discrete set of bump configurations in the absence of input; these configurations correspond to so-called fixed points of the dynamics. One subset of these configurations is stable; the bump will return to these stable fixed points following small perturbations (Fig. 2g, turquoise curves). The other subset is unstable; the bump will move away from these unstable fixed points if perturbed (Fig. 2g, orange curves). In these two configurations — stable and unstable — the bump is maintained by different numbers of active neurons (also called the 'support' of the fixed point,), and the corresponding active submatrices differ in size (Fig. 2h, top row). The smaller of these submatrices has a leading eigenvalue less than zero and governs network dynamics about the stable fixed point, whereas the larger of these submatrices has a leading eigenvalue greater than zero and governs dynamics about the unstable fixed point (Fig. 2h, middle row). In what follows, we use these active submatrices to dissect the dynamics of nonoptimal networks, and we show how the balance between stable and unstable dynamics shapes performance.

Variations in tuning degrade network performance

The previous results highlight a unique feature of threshold-linear networks: when a fixed subset of neurons is active, the corresponding dynamical system is linear, and the dynamics of the full network can be viewed as a set of linear subsystems that are stitched together at points where the active subset gains or loses an active neuron. In this way, a ring attractor that encodes a continuum of values on a circle can be constructed by stitching together multiple line attractors that each encode a continuum of values on a line segment. Because a line attractor can be constructed from a network with as few as two neurons, a minimal ring attractor could, in principle, be constructed using only three neurons. However, our choice of connectivity requires a minimum of four neurons to construct a ring attractor, in which each contiguous pair of neurons encodes a distinct line attractor (Fig. 3a). This requires a precise handoff between linear systems that share active neurons, such that the network dynamics move between line attractors by simultaneously activating and inactivating single neurons at the edges of the active subset.

### Two-phase analysis in consensus genetic mapping [^6364adec]. G3 (2012). Low credibility.

As a conflict region, we imply a set of segments of the maps for the mapping populations that include shared and unique markers and fit the conditions: (a) unique markers are flanked by or are adjacent to the shared markers and (b) at least for one pair of populations, two or more shared markers from the region appear in conflict order. The procedure of defining conflict region is illustrated in Figure 2. The analysis of several datasets may reveal a few conflict regions separated by regions of no conflict. In Figure 2, the process of delineating a conflict region is based on overlaps of pairwise conflicts. The conflict between markers a and b includes the first five sets; the conflict region is bordered by a single line. A second conflict, between b and d markers, starts at set 4 and extends until set 7. In defining the boundaries of the conflict region, we employ the following rules: (i) the size of the region depends on the conflict markers, where a conflict marker can coincide with the boundary only if it is simultaneously the end marker of the linkage group (in the example in Figure 2, conflict markers а and b coincide with the end in sets 1 and 2, respectively); (ii) in all other cases, boundary marker for the conflict region may be either a non-conflict shared marker or a unique marker; and (iii) depending on the width of the conflict region, we employ the exact or heuristic optimization algorithm.

Local algorithm of consensus analysis, in contrast to global analysis, applies only to the conflict region. With several regions, the conflicts are resolved successively in each such frame. A conflict region should include at least a pair of shared markers, the order of which in at least one set is opposite to the order in other sets. The conflict region of the entire set of mapping populations should include the considered pair of conflicting markers as well as all markers in between this pair, either shared or unique. In turn, the shared markers in the conflict region can also be in conflict with other markers. This conglomerate of pairwise conflicts makes up a conflict region that can also be extended by including neighbor markers from both sides that do not create any conflict (see Figure 2). This extension is needed because during the process of resolving the conflict(s) within the conflict region, the flanking markers are frozen. Note that if one of the ends of the conflict region coincides with the end of the linkage group, then only one of the ends (the internal one) remains frozen during the optimization.

### High-throughput analysis of dendrite and axonal arbors reveals transcriptomic correlates of neuroanatomy [^993c4160]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The neural network architecture consists of three arms, two arms have two convolutional layers with 4 and 8 7 × 3 filters followed by 4 × 1 max pooling, a fully connected layer and a dropout layer each. These arms process feature sets (i) and (ii) above by stacking the sets of 6 1D arrays along a second dimension. The third arm processes feature set (iii) and has two convolutional layers with 4 and 8 7 × 1 filters followed by 4 × 1 max pooling, a fully connected layer and a dropout layer. The outputs of these three arms are concatenated with the 'distance to soma feature'. Finally, the concatenated hidden feature map is processed by two fully connected layers to produce a single scalar softmax output indicating the inferred label type. The network model was trained using examples from the training dataset of the semantic segmentation model, and is used to relabel the neuron traces during postprocessing. Averaging predicted label type over the 9 longest paths improved relabeling accuracy for connected components longer than 2048 nodes.

Connecting disconnected segments

Due to a combination of staining artifacts and limitations of brightfield imaging, the initial reconstruction is often characterized by multiple disconnected subtrees. We introduced artificial breaks to manual traces to train a random forest classifier to predict whether nearby pairs of connected components should be merged. First, we find all pairs of segment (subtree) end points that are located within a certain distance. Next, for each pair of end points, we calculate the Euclidean distance and four collinearity values which measure the segments' orientation relative to each other. Specifically, for each end point, we calculate two vectors representing segment end orientation at two different spatial scales (i.e. the orientation of the branch terminating at that end point). The collinearity values are the dot products of each of these vectors with the vector between end points of the pair. Finally, for each end point in the pair we also calculate the above features for the closest four other end points. As a result, for every pair of end nodes we have a total of 45 features. Only segments of the same type, axon or dendrite, are considered for merging.

### Accelerating the inbreeding of multi-parental recombinant inbred lines generated by sibling matings [^5e8fa2e2]. G3 (2012). Low credibility.

Low-resolution sampling

In our MAI analysis, we assumed that one is able to accurately assign genomic regions to founders at single base-pair resolution. In reality, genotyping platforms have a limited resolution with which they can ascertain a founder's genomic sequence. This limited resolution creates two main obstacles to the use of MAI methods: the possibility that small recombination intervals might escape detection, and the imprecision with which the cross-over points of recombination can be detected. The impact of both of these limitations can, however, be modeled in a simulation.

We modeled this reduced resolution by sampling the JH state at 1-Mb intervals. We simulated the breeding using the MAI breeding strategy discussed earlier, but modified the WSM to consider the JH state only at sample points. Furthermore, we declared lines inbred on the basis of the 1-Mb sampling (when all sample points were SS). We then inspected each declared "inbred" mouse to see if, at a base-pair resolution, all intervals were truly fixed, and found them to be actually inbred only 38.3% of the time. On average we missed three nonfixed segments per line, and these segments were on average 327 ± 234 Kb. We also found that the lines were considered inbred approximately 2.5 generations earlier than MAI with complete observability. This finding implies that the inability to detect small recombinants might require additional inbreeding generations to attain the desired level of fixation.

### Morphology of travel routes and the organization of cities [^22ed6869]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Methods

Sampling routing pairs

For each of our 92 cities, a city center is defined by referencing the coordinates fromand the travel routes are sampled according to a choice of OD pairs relative to the center and measured in spherical coordinates (distance from center r, and angular separation relative to center θ). To avoid any sample bias, and to systematically investigate the dependence of route morphology on distance from the urban center, we only consider OD pairs at a fixed radius r.

Furthermore, at each r we section the circumference of the circle at intervals of 10° for a total of 36 points (with the minimal angular separation chosen to avoid effects of noise). We then vary the radius over the range 2, 5, 10, 20, and finally 30 km (roughly corresponding to a city boundary) and enumerate over all OD pairs by connecting the 36 points at a given radius r for a total oftotal OD pairs.

Finally, we query the OpenStreetMap API for the suggested travel routes connecting each of the pairs. In fact, for a better characterization of the functional features of the systems (e.g. road capacities) and the role of their hierarchical organizations, we obtained two different kinds of routes between all these pairs: the shortest, based on lengths of road segments, and the fastest that accounts for both the length and the travel time based on flow capacity of the roads (i.e. speed limits, number of lanes, etc.). A visual representation of our methodology in segmenting the city is shown in Fig. 2a and typical examples of the shortest and fastest route for a given city is shown in Fig. 2b. (For more details on our data samples, see Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.)

Calculation of inness

The inness I is calculated by summing over the areas of the number of polygons in the route by using the shoelace formula, thusHere n is the number of vertices of the polygon, m is the total number of polygons in the route, (x i, j, y i, j) corresponds to the coordinate of j 'th vertex of polygon i, and sgn(i) accounts for our adopted convention for inner and outer points.

### A convolutional neural network segments yeast microscopy images with high accuracy [^8e404665]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Segmentation steps

The CNN assigns to each pixel a score from 0 (border- or background-like) to 1 (cell-like). These continuous scores are turned into a segmented image by the following steps (Fig. 3):
Initial cell-versus-non-cell classification: A threshold of 0.5, arbitrary but intuitive, is used to distinguish putative cell pixels from the rest. This step already identified most cell bodies as distinct from one another in our images. However, some cells were connected by bridging putative cell pixels, which is why the following steps were needed.
Find a point inside each cell: For each putative cell pixel, the distance transform (the shortest Euclidean distance to a border/background pixel) is computed. Pixels at which the distance transform has a maximum within a radius of 5 pixels (≈0.5 μ m) identify putative interior points of cells. This step successfully identified one or more points in each cell in our images. (To detect very small buds, we lowered this threshold, see "Comparison to other methods and benchmarking".)
Assign a putative cell to each interior point: each peak of the distance transform is used as a seed for the watershed method, which assigns regions of pixels to each peak. These regions are the putative cells.
Remove erroneous cell boundaries: since the distance transform may yield more than one point inside each cell, e.g. for a dumb-bell shaped cell, a real cell may be erroneously subdivided into multiple regions by the watershed procedure. This is a well-recognized problem in image segmentation,– and could be circumvented, for example, by a fluorescent nuclear marker specifying a unique interior point. To avoid the requirement for an additional channel, we devised the following cell-cell boundary test: For all pairs of putative cells, we evaluate whether the pixels on the boundary are too cell-like; if the average CNN score for the top 3/4 of boundary pixels (bottom 1/4 is ignored because an erroneous boundaries will touch real boundaries at their two ends) is above 0.99, i.e. very cell-like, this boundary is likely erroneously subdividing a real cell. In that case, the two regions separated by the erroneous boundary are merged. This strategy fixed all cases of split cells that we encountered, which, for example, occurred for 10% of cells in Fig. 4 (top). We did not observe that any cells were joined erroneously.

### Morphology of travel routes and the organization of cities [^ecc6c05b]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Biasing forces found in urban morphology. Three schematic urban street arrangements share similar topological structure, but different geometric layouts resulting in varying dynamics. a A grid structure where the shortest paths between points at the same radius show no directional bias. b Repulsive forces relative to the origin (marked in blue) emerge as we break the grid symmetry by relocating the four outer points on the inner equidistant ring line. Paths lying on this ring now have the shortest paths that traverse the periphery and avoid the center. c Further perturbing the topology by increasing connectivity to the center (marked as four green lines) now leads to shortest paths that go through the center as if an attractive force is present (marked in red)

To capture whether such an effect manifests itself at the scale of the city, or is indeed neutral due to the "detuning" at smaller scales, we define a metric called the inness I. Figure 2c illustrates how a typical route between any origin–destination (OD) pair can be divided into segments that are directionally biased toward or away from the city center as measured relative to the geodesic distance s between the pair. We label points lying closer to the center than the geodesic inner points while those lying further away are outer points. For example, in the schematic shown in Fig. 2c, points located in the pink shaded area are inner points, and those on the opposite side (shaded blue) are outer points. We define an inner travel area delineated by the polygon of inner points and the geodesic line, to which we assign a positive sign. Conversely, an outer travel area is defined by the geodesic line and the collection of outer points, whose sign is negative. Having adopted this convention, I is the difference between the inner area and outer travel areas:which can be calculated using the shoelace formula for polygons (see Methods). In Fig. 2d, we show three possible idealizations of a route; one with only outer travel area (blue), one with only inner travel area (red), and one with a mixture of both outer and inner travel areas (combination of blue and red).

### Consensus guide on CT-based prediction of stopping-power ratio using a hounsfield look-up table for proton therapy [^20db469a]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Studies have shown large variations in stopping-power ratio (SPR) prediction from computed tomography (CT) across European proton centres. To standardise this process, a step-by-step guide on specifying a Hounsfield look-up table (HLUT) is presented here.

Materials and Methods

The HLUT specification process is divided into six steps: Phantom setup, CT acquisition, CT number extraction, SPR determination, HLUT specification, and HLUT validation. Appropriate CT phantoms have a head- and body-sized part, with tissue-equivalent inserts in regard to X-ray and proton interactions. CT numbers are extracted from a region-of-interest covering the inner 70% of each insert in-plane and several axial CT slices in scan direction. For optimal HLUT specification, the SPR of phantom inserts is measured in a proton beam and the SPR of tabulated human tissues is computed stoichiometrically at 100 MeV. Including both phantom inserts and tabulated human tissues increases HLUT stability. Piecewise linear regressions are performed between CT numbers and SPRs for four tissue groups (lung, adipose, soft tissue, and bone) and then connected with straight lines. Finally, a thorough but simple validation is performed.

Results

The best practices and individual challenges are explained comprehensively for each step. A well-defined strategy for specifying the connection points between the individual line segments of the HLUT is presented. The guide was tested exemplarily on three CT scanners from different vendors, proving its feasibility.

Conclusion

The presented step-by-step guide for CT-based HLUT specification with recommendations and examples can contribute to reduce inter-centre variations in SPR prediction.

### Hybrid topological data analysis and deep learning for basal cell carcinoma diagnosis [^fbb8a6d3]. Journal of Imaging Informatics in Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

A vertex of a zero-dimensional simplex is represented by a single point
A line segment joining two points is referred to as a one-dimensional simplex
A triangle having three vertices and three edges is referred to as a two-dimensional simplex
A tetrahedron with four vertices, six edges, and four triangular faces is referred to as a three-dimensional simplex

Topological invariants can be computed from the simplicial complex by counting the number of simplexes of different dimensions that make up the complex. Let V be a set of vertices. A subset S of V is called a simplex of dimension n if it contains n + 1 elements that are affinely independent, meaning that the points do not lie in a lower-dimensional hyperplane. The elements of S are called the vertices of the simplex. A simplicial complex K is a collection of simplexes in V that satisfies the following conditions:
Any face of a simplex in K is also in K, meaning that if S is a simplex in K, then every subset of S that is a simplex is also in K.
The intersection of any two simplexes in K is either empty or a face of both.

Figure 5 shows a simplicial complex that includes a tetrahedron and a triangle.

Stepwise determination of conflict regions. White circles denote shared markers, and gray circles denote unique markers. The figure illustrates the process of delineating conflict regions based on overlapping regions of pairwise conflicts. Conflict between markers a and b includes the first five sets; the conflict region is bordered by a single line. Conflict between b and d starts in the first region (at set 4) and extends until the end (set 7) (its part outside the first region is marked by double lines). The whole conflict region is highlighted in gray.

Inversion and transposition transformations in consensus analysis. Black and gray circles represent shared and unique markers, respectively. Shared markers with the same name are connected with solid lines. The left part of the figure illustrates the operation "inversion": due to a large interval in set 2 (recombination rate ∼0.31), the distal part of the map in set 2 is in conflict with the one in set 1. Operation "inversion" returns a nonconflicting order. Similarly, in the right part of the figure, a source of the conflict is the interval with loose linkage in set 1. Operation "transposition" returns a nonconflicting order.

### Accelerating the inbreeding of multi-parental recombinant inbred lines generated by sibling matings [^92ecf6ed]. G3 (2012). Low credibility.

Selected advanced intercrosses

Although MAI achieves a substantial reduction in the number of generations required to fix an RIL, it does so with an average loss of approximately seven segments per line. This result is unfortunate because the number of segments determines the resolution of a RIL panel for quantitative trait mapping. Therefore, we attempted to overcome this loss by using marker-assisted techniques in the first 10 generations of inbreeding to select mating pairs most apt to increase the number of recombination segments. We refer to these lines as selected advanced intercrosses in that they attempt to increase the number of segments on every chromosome by maximizing diversity until a designated generation is reached. This is similar to work done in self-pollinating populations to maximize mapping resolution. After the designated generation, the same MAI techniques as discussed previously are used to select the breeding-pairs until the line is fixed. We found that it took on average 23.5 ± 3.82 generations to become inbred. At the point of peak diversity, the lines had an average of 196.1 ± 15.44 segments, compared with 167 segments in randomized sib-pair matings. The average number of segments in the final inbred animals was 155.6 ± 12.53. On the basis of our analysis, if genotyping is done at every generation, the lines will become inbred in approximately the same number of generations as the MAI breeding strategy but will have approximately 17 more segments per animal. This could lead to increased mapping resolution in the final population.

### Surface to bulk fermi arcs via weyl nodes as topological defects [^3a85eb14]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

A hallmark of Weyl semimetal is the existence of surface Fermi arcs. An intriguing question is what determines the connectivity of surface Fermi arcs, when multiple pairs of Weyl nodes are present. To answer this question, we show that the locations of surface Fermi arcs are predominantly determined by the condition that the Zak phase integrated along the normal-to-surface direction is. The Zak phase can reveal the peculiar topological structure of Weyl semimetal directly in the bulk. Here, we show that the winding of the Zak phase around each projected Weyl node manifests itself as a topological defect of the Wannier-Stark ladder, energy eigenstates under an electric field. Remarkably, this leads to bulk Fermi arcs, open-line segments in the bulk spectra. Bulk Fermi arcs should exist in conjunction with surface counterparts to conserve the Weyl fermion number under an electric field, which is supported by explicit numerical evidence.

### Quantifying complexity in DNA structures with high resolution atomic force microscopy [^3178661a]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

DNA tracing algorithm

Individual grain masks are skeletonised using our intensity-biased variation of Zhang's skeletonisation algorithm. Terminating branches with less than 15% of the total of the number of skeleton pixels were pruned, along with branches whose centre height was less than the average skeleton height minus 0.85 nm (the depth of the DNA major groove). A sliding window convolution of the pruned skeleton counts the number of pixel neighbours where > 3 neighbours indicates crossings, and 2 neighbours indicate the backbone. Crossing points separated by up to 7 nm (~ double the tip-convolved DNA width) are connected as they likely belong to the same crossing. The shortest path between two nodes with an odd number of emanating branches (resulting from insensitive segmentation) is also connected. Then, for each 20 nm crossing region (below the 45 nm persistence length of DNA), emanating branches are paired based on their bipartite graph maximal matching vectors, and height traces along the pair are used to calculate the FWHM and determine the overlying and underlying branches. To order the trace, the skeleton was split into connecting and crossing regions, and each linear segment ordered, starting from an endpoint or random connecting region and following on from the previous segment until the trace reached its starting point. If all segments were not used, another molecule trace was started, such as for the DNA catenanes. Simplified topological traces used the over/under-passing crossing region classification to label heights as ascending integers.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^9a18e059]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular (LV) volume quantification by echocardiography — acquisition and measurement guidance are as follows: LV volumes should be measured from the apical four- and two-chamber views. Two-dimensional echocardiographic image acquisition should aim to maximize LV areas, while avoiding foreshortening of the left ventricle, which results in volume underestimation. Acquiring LV views at a reduced depth to focus on the LV cavity will reduce the likelihood of foreshortening and minimize errors in endocardial border tracings (Table 1). Because the issue of foreshortening is less relevant in 3D data sets, 3D image acquisition should focus primarily on including the entire left ventricle within the pyramidal data set. To ensure reasonably accurate identification of end-systole, the temporal resolution of 3D imaging should be maximized without compromising spatial resolution. At the mitral valve level, the contour is closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the mitral ring with a straight line. LV length is defined as the distance between the bisector of this line and the apical point of the LV contour, which is most distant to it. The use of the longer LV length between the apical two- and four-chamber views is recommended. Contrast agents should be used when needed to improve endocardial delineation when two or more contiguous LV endocardial segments are poorly visualized in apical views.

### Global, regional, and national burdens of heart failure in adolescents and young adults aged 10–24 years from 1990 to 2021: an analysis of data from the global burden of disease study 2021 [^c4beb3c7]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

The prevalence, YLDs, and underlying causes of HF were analyzed by sex (male or female) and age group (10–14 years, 15–19 years, and 20–24 years) at regional, national, and SDI levels. To identify the direction and magnitude of changes in the prevalence and YLDs of HF over time, we calculated the annual percentage change (APC) and average APC (AAPC) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) with joinpoint regression analysis. A positive APC or AAPC indicates an increase, while a negative value indicates a decrease. The AAPC between 1990 and 1999, between 2000 and 2009, between 2010 and 2021, and between 1990 and 2021 were calculated.

In order to identify the year with the most marked changes, we detected trends in the data over time and fitted the optimal model curve to the data by segmenting the data into multiple linear pieces on a logarithmic graph using joinpoint regression analysis. These segmented points are referred to as "joinpoints". The "joinpoints" were data-driven (based on statistical significance). In detail, when we perform the joinpoint regression analysis, a logarithmic linear model (ln y = β ∗x) is used for segmented regression, and the grid search method (GSM) is used to establish all possible connection points. The mean squared errors (MSE) corresponding to each possible scenario are calculated, and the grid point with the smallest MSE is selected as the connection point. Then, the establishment of the optimal model for the regression of connection points (i.e. the number of connection points) is determined using the Monte Carlo permutation test. We set the maximum number of potential connection points to 5 and the minimum number of potential connection points to 0. The permutation test starts with the number of connection points k = 0 and k_max = 5. If k≠k_max, set k = k+1 to continue the test until the model corresponding to k = k_max is selected as the optimal model. For instance, the most basic model, which has no joinpoints, is represented by a single straight line. When additional joinpoints are incorporated, each is evaluated using the Monte Carlo permutation approach.

### Intra-operator repeatability of manual segmentations of the hip muscles on clinical magnetic resonance images [^4a87c326]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Muscle Point Morphing

Since muscle aponeuroses and attachment areas were not clearly visible on MRIs, muscle origin and insertion points were mapped to the medical imaging data from a generic atlas (i.e.g.ait2392 OpenSim model). Point morphing was performed in nmsBuilder, where the single value decomposition method was used to determine an affine transformation able to register corresponding pairs of bony landmarks (i.e. selected on both the gait2392 model and the MRIs, for each subject). The same transformation was then applied to all generic muscle points of interest (i.e. for the gluteus medius muscle: origin and insertion of the medial bundle; for the iliopsoas: origin of the psoas and insertion of the iliacus on the femur). Visual inspections were conducted to check for points (mis)placement. If deemed necessary (e.g. points not laying on the bone surfaces), the muscle attachments were snapped to the bone surface, i.e. (re)located to the nearest plausible surface point, through an automated procedure in MATLAB. A visual check was finally performed to ensure that the updated locations were in agreement with the underlying MRI.

Sub-volume Definition

All segmented muscle volumes were divided in sub-volumes. Starting from the mid-point between muscle attachments, two parallel cutting planes, orthogonal to the line connecting origin and insertion points, were iteratively moved up and down, respectively, along the muscle line of action in 5% steps (of the muscle length) (Fig. 2 a). At each iteration, only the volume included between the planes was preserved. Ten (sub)volumes per segmentation were thus generated. To ensure consistency, the process was fully automated via custom-written functions and scripts compiled in Python (v3.6).

### Minimum spanning tree analysis of the human connectome [^26a24c2e]. Human Brain Mapping (2018). Low credibility.

Tracts were reconstructed in native space. All possible tracts in the brain were reconstructed individually using the diffusion weighted images with an in‐house implementation of the fiber assignment by continuous tracking (FACT) algorithm (Mandl et al. 2010) with the following parameter settings: 8 seed points per voxel, stopping criteria: minimum voxel fractional anisotropy = 0.1 or tract angle between streamline steps > 45°, and maximum average angle with neighboring voxels = 45°. After tractography was completed, all fibers shorter than 10 mm were discarded, as they were deemed spurious. Finally, all remaining fibers were linearly extended by 5 mm in the orientation prior to termination to maximize the probability of penetration into the grey matter. The presence of a white matter connection between two grey matter regions was determined by labeling each streamline with the grey matter areas it touched based on the anatomical segmentation mask. The number of streamlines (NOS) was summed between all possible node pairs and represented in an 82 × 82 structural connectivity matrix M nos.

2.1.4 Network reconstruction

Further analyses were performed using Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc. Natick, MA, United States), and the brain connectivity toolbox. Networks were reconstructed for cortical and subcortical ROIs (N = 82), and for cortical ROIs only (N = 68). Several methods for connection estimation based tractography data have been proposed (Jones and Leemans, 2011). We used the number of streamlines to calculate the structural connectivity matrix M 1. However, network reconstruction based on the number of streamlines for segmented regions may be affected by the size of a region of interest (ROI), as regions with a bigger surface may have a higher probability of being adjacent to a streamline (Fornito et al. 2013; van den Heuvel and Sporns, 2011). We therefore also computed a structural connectivity matrix, where the number of streamlines was weighted by regional volume (M volume_weighted_nos), and one where the FA values were used as edge weights M FA (van den Heuvel and Sporns, 2011).

To quantify how MST characteristics may be influenced by connection definitions, we calculated correlations between nodal MST properties and ROI volume and surface, and estimated the MST edge length based on the Euclidean distance between the centroid voxel of each ROI.

### The apostasia genome and the evolution of orchids [^762ea34a]. Nature (2017). Excellent credibility.

We performed pairwise co-linearity analysis within A. shenzhenica and between A. shenzhenica and A. officinalis, A. comosus, V. vinifera, and A. trichopoda. Homologous pairs of A. shenzhenica and the above species were identified by all-against-all BLASTP (E value < 1 × 10 −5), followed by the removal of weak matches by applying a c -score of 0.5 (indicating their BLASTP bit-scores were below 50% of the bit-scores of the best matches). Then, i-ADHoRe 3.0 was used to identify co-linear segments with parameters as described above except using 'level_2_only = FALSE', enabling the functionality to detect highly degenerated co-linear segments resulting from more ancient large-scale duplications (this is achieved by recursively building genomic profiles based on relatively recent co-linear segments). All co-linear dot plots were drawn by selecting co-linear segments according to a specified required number of anchor pairs (given in the figure legend of each of the dot plots). For the comparisons between A. shenzhenica and the chromosome-level assembled genomes (A. officinalis, A. comosus, and V. vinifera) we retained co-linear segments with at least ten anchor pairs (Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Figs 5, 7, 8). For the comparisons with fragmented genomes, like A. trichopoda, and the self-comparison of A. shenzhenica, we kept co-linear segments with five anchor pairs (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Figs 3, 4). The start and end boundaries of selected co-linear segments were used to define broader regions containing such segments on the chromosomes or scaffolds by further connecting co-linear segments if they overlapped with each other. Then, duplication depths, that is, the number of connected co-linear segments overlapping at each position of a broader region, were illustrated in the margins of the plots by mapping the connected co-linear segments over each other. The number of anchors required in the co-linear segments could affect the duplication depth in such a way that increasing the number of anchors required tends to remove co-linear segments originating from more ancient WGD(s) due to increased gene loss.

### On convex decision regions in deep network representations [^b0b918c2]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

We now sample N s pairs of points within the given predicted class label and compute the shortest path in the graph between the pairs using Dijkstra's algorithm. For each path, we compute a score between 0 and 1. The path score is defined as the proportion of the number of nodes on the shortest path, without the endpoints, inside the decision region (i.e. with the same predicted label). If an edge directly connects the pair of nodes, the score is 1. If the points are not connected, the score is 0. We average the scores for all paths within one class to get a convexity score per class per layer. To get one convexity score per layer, we average over all paths regardless of class. Uncertainties are calculated as the standard error of the mean, where we set n as the number of points in the given class. This is likely a conservative estimate since the mean is based on many more pairs than there are points.

The runtime complexity of this procedure is, where N denotes the number of data points, D is the dimensionality of the representations and N c is the number of classes. See Supp. Mat. 1.4 for details.

Euclidean convexity is also measured for each layer and class separately. To measure the convexity of class C in layer l, we first extract hidden representations at l of all points predicted to belong to class C. We sample N s pairs of points. For each pair, we compute the N p = 10 equidistant points on the linear segment connecting the representations of the two endpoints. We feed the interpolated points to the rest of the network (after layer l). The score for each pair is then the proportion of the interpolated points that are also predicted to belong to class C. Finally, to get the score of Euclidean convexity for the whole class, we average the scores over all the pairs of points. To get the Euclidean convexity for each layer, we average over all classes.

### Geospatial mapping of distribution grid with machine learning and publicly-accessible multi-modal data [^c7745818]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Road modeling and link prediction

We further integrate road information to enrich the features for predicting whether there is a line connection between two predicted poles. Specifically, each road can be represented as a series of line segments. If a detected pole or a street view point has a distance ≤ D attach to a road, it will be attached to that road (Fig. 2 c). All attached street view points and poles are sorted in order along the road. Moreover, to reduce the number of poles missed by the pole detector, we insert pole(s) between a pair of poles if the distance between them is greater than a threshold D insert.

We develop a link prediction model that takes feature variables for a pair of poles as inputs and outputs whether there is a line connection between the pole pair. Any pair of poles with a distance less than a threshold D cand is considered as a candidate. We consider various types of classification models including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine, and gradient boosting. Feature candidates include (1) Distance between the two poles. (2) Whether the two poles are on the same road. (3) Whether the two poles are next to each other along the road. (4) Fraction of street view images with power lines detected between the two poles. (5) Minimum and average differences between the power line directions estimated from street view images and the direction of the line connecting the two poles. The small difference gives evidence that there is a power line connecting the two poles. (6) Whether either of the poles is detected by the pole detector or inserted. (7) Whether either of the poles is at a road intersection. (8) Whether the two poles are at the same road intersection. (9) The binary prediction of the modified Dijkstra's algorithm, running on a raster map. This algorithm finds the most efficient paths to connect poles: On a geospatial raster, each cell is assigned with a weight. By setting the weights at the positions of roads to be lower than others, connecting poles along a road is preferable (see the weight assignment scheme in Supplementary Note 1).

The best feature set and hyperparameters for link prediction are selected based on the 9-fold cross-validation on the San Carlos development set which are divided into 9 subsets according to the boundary divisions of the 9 census tracts in San Carlos. The output of the link prediction module is a geospatial graph with predicted poles as nodes and predicted line connections as edges.

### Two-phase analysis in consensus genetic mapping [^18161c9c]. G3 (2012). Low credibility.

Let us consider in more detail the developed algorithms. After getting the non-synchronized solutions based on independent mapping for each dataset (single-population mapping), conflict regions are formed by the analysis of all pairs of the resulting individual maps. Each conflict region contains shared conflicting and non-conflicting markers, and some unique markers. The remaining non-conflicting shared markers between the conflict regions are considered as "frozen" anchors during the solution process for each conflict region (hence, only conflict region markers participate in the optimization process). This version of the algorithm significantly reduces the computation time. Moreover, for certain sizes of conflict region, an exact solution can be obtained. The sequential steps of the analysis include:

Building skeleton maps for each of the initial datasets using the methodology described in, and.
Revealing conflicting shared markers for each pair of chromosomes (Figure 1A).
Integration of the results on detected pairwise conflicts (across all involved datasets) allows defining the conflicting regions separated by non-conflicting regions (Figure 2).
In case of a large interval between neighboring markers, the corresponding map may display an "inversion" or "transposition" of a large segment resulting in multiple conflicts with other maps. In such a case, before starting the main consensus procedure, we employ heuristic rules of transposition and inversion to get a better initial point for consensus ordering (Figure 3).
Evaluating the computation complexity of the conflict regions. On this stage, a crude estimate of the computation time needed to resolve the conflict by testing all possible permutations is provided. If the needed time is not affordable, the alternative is to use heuristic optimization.
Resolving the conflicts in each conflict region by synchronous optimization. This means that the allowed trial solutions must fit the following condition: for the considered chromosome, the map order in none of the mapping populations is in conflict with the order in any other mapping population. Obviously, for such a formulation, one may take advantage of parallel computations.
Detecting and resolving higher-order conflicts and loops, which are much less frequent than pair conflicts (Figure 1B).

### LinkedSV for detection of mosaic structural variants from linked-read exome and genome sequencing data [^f423756f]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

If we regard (R (F i 1), L (F i 2)) as a point in a two-dimensional plane, according to Eq. (2), for almost all (98.01%) of the fragment pairs (F i 1, F i 2), ((R (F i 1), L (F i 2)) is restricted in a G × G square region with the point (b 1, b 2) being a vertex (Supplementary Fig. 14b).

We used a graph-based method to fast group the points into clusters and find square regions where the numbers of points were more than expected. First, every possible pair of endpoints (R (F 1), L (F 2)) meeting B (F 1) = B (F 2) formed a point in the two-dimensional plane. Each point indicated a pair of fragments that share the same barcode. For example, if ten fragments share the same barcode, pairs of endpoints will be generated. A point/pair of endpoints may or may not support an SV because there are two possible reasons for observing two fragments sharing the same barcode: (1) the two fragments originated from two different HMW DNA molecules but were dispersed into the same droplet partition and received the same barcode and (2) the two fragments originated from the same HMW DNA molecule but the reads were reconstructed into two fragments due to an SV. The points are sparsely distributed in the two-dimensional plane and it is highly unlikely to observe multiple points in a specific region. Next, a k – d tree (k = 2) was constructed, of which each node stores the (X, Y) coordinates of one point. A k – d tree is a binary tree that enable fast query of nearby nodes. Therefore, we could quickly find all pairs of points within a certain distance. Any two points (x 1, y 1) and (x 2, y 2) were grouped into one cluster if | x 1 − x 2 | < G and | y 1 − y 2 | < G. For each cluster, if the number of points in the cluster was more than a user-defined threshold (default: 5), it was considered as a potential region of enriched fragment endpoints. If the points in the cluster were not within a G × G square region, we used a G × G moving square to find a square region where the points are best enriched. Theoretically, the best enriched square region should contain 98.01% (0.99 × 0.99) of the points, according to Eq. (2). The predicted breakpoints were the X and Y coordinates of the right-bottom vertex of the square. The points in the square region were subjected to a statistical test describe below.

### Quantification of the shape of fiber tracts [^cbeacc43]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The fiber tracts generated using diffusion MRI are usually simply displayed and assessed visually for a specific clinical or medical research purpose. This paper proposes computational techniques that can be used to study the shape of the tracts and make interindividual comparisons. These methods make use of fundamental geometric invariants, such as curvatures and torsions, or Fourier descriptors, together with the link of a pair of curves. Intersubject comparisons only require that the starting and ending points of the tracts can be defined and do not require point-by-point correspondences such as obtained using image registration. Principal component analysis-based shape analysis is also investigated. The invariants are tested on simulations and in vivo datasets, and the scale dependence and noise sensitivity of the measures are assessed. The potential for these techniques to be used in neuroscience research and clinical applications is demonstrated.

### Intervention-based multidimensional phase unwrapping using recursive orthogonal referring [^f378c491]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

We present a new intervention-based phase unwrapping algorithm, which solves the inherent integration-path-dependent problem (typically resulting in streaks), by using a 2D recursive orthogonal referring (PUROR) approach. The streaks were removed by three consecutive procedures: intra-image phase unwrapping, inter-image cross-referring a "good-strip", and cross-referring line segments. The application of these procedures results in streak-free 2D phase images. The phase inconsistencies across slices in a 3D image were removed using a hybrid 3D PUROR algorithm: the two step approach involves stacking the individual slices, by using the mean phase values of each slice, then applying the 2D PUROR algorithm to reformatted 2D images that include the slice direction. The described approach was tested with in vivo multislice phase images acquired in the axial, sagittal, and coronal orientation. The results of the unwrapped phase volume recovered using the PUROR algorithm have equivalent quality to that achieved by using established methods, but the PUROR algorithm is about two orders of magnitude faster (between 1 and 5 s per 256×256 slice; independent of slice orientation and echo time).

### 2019 APHRS expert consensus statement on three-dimensional mapping systems for tachycardia developed in collaboration with HRS, EHRA, and LAHRS [^6334ab47]. Journal of Arrhythmia (2020). High credibility.

Multielectrode three-dimensional (3D) mapping — platform characteristics and limitations are detailed: Impedance-based electrofield mapping systems provide a more open platform, allowing visualization of any electrode catheter connected to the system. However, a potential disadvantage of multielectrode mapping is that contact force is unlikely to be uniform across all electrode pairs, and basket catheters placed in the endocardium are particularly susceptible because one hemisphere does not contact the myocardial surface. To address such issues, 3D mapping systems have evolved to calculate information relative to the most outer aspects of the geometric chamber, assuming that points "internal" to the outer chamber margins are not implemented into the wiring map display, and for all multielectrode platforms the number of points utilized are a mere fraction of the total sampled. Electrogram voltages are inherently dependent on electrode area and the relative angle of the incident wavefront to the electrode orientation, and in real-world practice mapping points from a multipolar catheter and a single-point catheter are frequently combined on the same map, which is scientifically inaccurate.

### Distinct roles of dentate gyrus and medial entorhinal cortex inputs for phase precession and temporal correlations in the hippocampal CA3 area [^205a179e]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Cell pair sequence analysis

Two simultaneously recorded units were considered a "pair" for the purpose of sequence analyses if (a) there were at least 50 theta cycles in which both units spiked, (b) at least 20% of each unit's spikes throughout the session occurred in theta cycles in which the other unit also spiked, and (c) at least 10% of all theta cycles in which a unit spiked included spikes from the other unit as well. For each unit pair, the cross-correlogram was computed and the relative time, τ, of the peak closest to the zero time lag was found. The physical separation of the peaks of the two units' place fields, d, was computed and used to make the tuple. In the case of the 8-arm maze where runs in opposite outbound and inbound directions were possible, each unit pair was treated twice — once for the inbound run and once for the outbound. We confirmed that in all cases, only one of the two-run directions had enough spikes to reliably assess pair co-modulation (i.e. the unreliable direction did not contribute atuple). Once alltuples were obtained for each experimental group (CTRL (DG), LESION (DG), CTRL (MEC), and LESION (MEC)), a linear regression model was fit to the data to assess the significance of the relationship between place field separation (d) and theta co-modulation (τ), as reported in Fig. 6. For the phase precession plots in Fig. 6b and Fig. 6f, trains from each cell were first mapped to the animal's path. The path equivalent of each train was then projected onto the line segment connecting the place field peaks of the two cells via a dot product. The midpoint of this line segment was considered the origin and was used on the x -axis of the phase-position plots. The sign of the direction of travel was defined to be positive if Cell 1's place field was visited before Cell 2's place field; otherwise, it was considered negative.

### Changes in articular cartilage after meniscectomy and meniscus replacement using a biodegradable porous polymer implant [^2c75a3df]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Immunohistochemistry

To determine the location of damaged collagen, the samples were stained using Col2-¾M and Col2-¾C short antibodies. Col2-¾M is a nonspecific indicator of collagen molecule damage, tagging an epitope within the triple-helix of the collagen molecule after the molecule is denatured. Col2-¾C short is a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the COOH terminus of the three-quarter fragment, which is generated very specifically by the cleavage of native type II collagen by mammalian collagenases. Using these antibodies, distinction can be made between mechanical damage (Col2-¾M) and enzymatic cleavage (Col2-¾C short). The staining procedures have been described in detail elsewhere. Adjacent sections were stained with safranin O.

Cartilage thickness

The thickness measurements were made according to a previously described method. The cartilage thickness was measured in the central zone of the tibial plateau and in the corresponding zone on the femoral condyle. For each specimen, five equally distanced (100 μm), safranin O-stained sections were measured at a 12.5× magnification using custom-made software. Manually, a polyline roughly delimiting the cartilage from the subchondral bone was produced. This polyline was converted to a b-spline consisting of a fixed number of points (500 points/section). Two parallel polylines were constructed from this b-spline. One of these polylines was offset to the inside, the other to the outside. A series of straight line segments was generated between each pair of points on these polylines. On each line segment, two points were automatically calculated (Fig. 4). The first one represents the transition between calcified cartilage and cartilage (tidemark level). The second one represents the outside edge of the cartilage. If necessary, these points could be corrected manually. The distance between these points was considered as the cartilage thickness along the line segment. The cartilage thickness was calculated as the mean length of all the segments generated. All sections were investigated blinded and in random order.

Fig. 4
Schematic representation of cartilage thickness measurements. A series of straight line segments perpendicular to both of the polylines were generated. On each line segment, two points were automatically calculated. One point represents the transition between calcified cartilage and cartilage (tidemark), and the other point represents the outer edge of the cartilage. The distance between these points was considered as the cartilage thickness along the line segment. The mean length of all line segments between the two points was calculated as overall cartilage thickness

### Optical segmentation-based compressed readout of neuronal voltage dynamics [^3278ecd2]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Functional imaging of biological dynamics generally begins with acquiring time-series images, followed by quantifying spatially averaged intensity traces for the regions of interest (ROIs). The conventional pipeline discards a substantial portion of the acquired data when quantifying intensity traces, indicative of inefficient data acquisition. Here we propose a conceptually novel acquisition pipeline that assigns each ROI to a single pixel in the detector, enabling optimally compressed acquisition of the intensity traces. As a proof-of-principle, we implemented a detection module composed of a pair of spatial light modulators and a microlens array, which segments the original image into multiple subimages by introducing distinct angular shifts to each ROI. Each subimage exclusively encodes the signal for the corresponding ROI, facilitating the compressed readout of its intensity trace using a single pixel. This spatial compression allowed for maximizing the temporal information without compromising the spatial information on ROIs. Harnessing our novel approach, we demonstrate the recording of circuit-scale neuronal voltage dynamics at over 5kHz sampling rate, revealing the individual action potential waveforms within subcellular structures, as well as their submillisecond-scale temporal delays.

### Use of carotid ultrasound to identify subclinical vascular disease and evaluate cardiovascular disease risk: a consensus statement from the American Society of Echocardiography carotid intima-media thickness task force. endorsed by the Society for Vascular Medicine [^254ea43f]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2008). Medium credibility.

Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) measurement approach — B-mode is preferred and calibration is advised: B-mode imaging is preferred over M-mode imaging, as M-mode provides measurement of only a single point of thickness rather than a segmental value and perpendicular imaging is challenging. Because M-mode or point-to-point B-mode measurements are limited to multiples of the pixel size, precision is reduced unless multiple (several hundred) points are measured, and multiple measurements of several extended segment lengths permit higher precision expression of CIMT values. All reported observational studies relating CIMT values to cardiovascular events used B-mode measurements. A small parts ultrasound phantom should be used to determine whether the ultrasound system is calibrated.

### Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging of the brachial plexus shows specific changes in nerve architecture in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, multifocal motor neuropathy and motor neuron disease [^4e8494cf]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Before processing, we resampled the 3D TSE SPIR to a 2 × 2 × 2 mm 3 isotropic resolution. Subsequently, we manually drew a rough mask of the brachial plexus area using ITK SNAP (10 minutes per dataset). These masks were drawn in the resampled 3D TSE SPIR and in the diffusion‐weighted image to guide the registration and fiber tract selection (Figure 1b). The first automated part of the processing pipeline comprised data denoising, affine registration to correct for subject motion and eddy currents, b‐spline registration to correct for echo‐planar imaging distortions, tensor estimation using an iterative weighted linear least squares algorithm and whole volume fiber tractography (seed point resolution 1 × 1 × 1 mm 3, step size 1 mm, seed FA threshold 0.15, FA track range 0.1–0.8, fiber length range 20–200 mm, angle threshold 15° per step; Figure 1c). This first automated processing step required approximately 35 minutes per dataset to complete.

Next, we manually defined slices with starting and ending points of tracts. Starting points were located next to the ganglion of nerve root C5, C6 and C7, ending points were located five slices further in the distal direction (5 minutes per dataset). This aided a second algorithm to find all tract locations of the nerves using a tract density map (Figure 1d) and specified the appropriate regions of interest (ROIs) for nerve segmentation (Figure 1e). To pair ROIs in the proximal starting and distal ending slices, the algorithm performs a connectivity analysis for all defined ROIs. Every pair of ROIs with high connectivity is then defined as tract bundles which results in a reconstruction of the nerve roots (Figure 1f). Subsequently, the nerve root segments were constructed using the predefined starting and ending slice (Figure 1g). These nerve root segments were used to standardize the site of extraction of diffusion parameters (FA, MD, AD, RD), that is, next to the ganglion over a distance of 1 cm. This second automated part of the pipeline required approximately 5 minutes per dataset to complete.

Finally, we visually identified and labeled the selected tracts as the left and right nerve roots of C5, C6 or C7 (5 minutes per dataset). If necessary, manual ROIs were placed to optimize the result of the automated data processing (5 minutes per dataset). When no tracts were found, nor with the algorithm, nor manually, the dataset was excluded from further analysis. Finally, diffusion parameters per fiber tract were calculated using tract‐based analysis.

### Morphological diversity of single neurons in molecularly defined cell types [^63e2890c]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

Arbor detection and partition

We detected and partitioned a series of neuronal arbors out of each neuron reconstruction using a graph-partition clustering method. First, as a neuron consists of a number of topologically connected reconstruction nodes, the neuron was viewed as a graph, where every reconstruction node (unit) in the neuron was connected with its parent node with an edge specified by the topological connection of the parent-child pair with the edge weight, or 'similarity' s, set to be the exponential of the negative 3D Euclidean distance, d, of these two nodes, that is, s = exp(− d). Then, we considered the normalized graph-cut methodto extract 'clusters' of reconstruction nodes so that the within-cluster 'total similarity' of nodes would be maximized and cross-cluster total similarity would be minimized. As a result, each such coherent cluster corresponds to one neuron arbor, which was also visually checked to ensure its correctness. Third, to automatically determine the number of such clusters, for a presumed number of clusters, we calculated the normalized score of total cross-cluster similarity divided by the total within-cluster similarity, followed by trial testing a range (from 2 to 8) of such presumed cluster-numbers to determine the optimal number that would minimizes this normalized score. In the final result, the detected arbor that contains the soma is called soma arbor; the remaining arbors are called non-soma arbors.

Feature quantification of cortical arbors

We divided the cortex into consecutive 100-μm thick coronal slices. Anchor points were evenly sampled along the outer border of each slice, with normal vectors perpendicular to the local cortical surface and pointing to the inside of the brain. Nodes of arbors were assigned to their neighbour anchors and projected onto the surface by corresponding normal vectors. Depth of nodes were determined by the length of projection along normal vectors. We also estimated the area of an anchor by their distance to neighbour anchors and slice thickness. The 2D cortical area of an arbor was determined by the total areas of unique anchors occupied by its nodes. To determine the radius of an arbor, we assigned arbor 'centre' as the node that has the shortest average distance to other nodes. Radius was determined by a growing sphere until 70% of segments were inside it. For neurons with tufted apical dendrite, we vertically shifted the arbors, so the top of apical dendrites reached L1. We manually confirmed that all tufted apical dendrites reached L1 in the original image.

Spectral properties of interband pairing.

While for band-diagonal pairing a small superconducting order parameter can immediately open up a gap as time-reversal symmetry guarantees that the associated avoided crossings [gray regions in a] in the Bogoliubov spectrum are at the Fermi level, this is not the case for band-off-diagonal pairing (b). Here, a sufficiently strong order-parameter value is required to establish a full gap, see c. Its k dependence according to Eq. (3) is shown in d, where the red line indicates nodal points. If the band structure has Dirac points, there will be a point on the horizontal axis (blue cross). Consequently, if there is another momentum point located above the red line (blue circle), continuity of the Hamiltonian implies a nodal point on any path connecting the two momenta. e Gap of the isotropic A 2 state and δ k, ϵ k (zeros indicated in red) for the normal-state toy model defined in the text.

Quantitative imaging (QI) — challenges and sources of error emphasize that advances in QI are crucially dependent on technology and computational power, with massive data sets run through "black box" algorithms and distilled into selected "biomarkers" to evaluate their ability to detect, stratify, and monitor lung disease. Numerous imaging modalities, manufacturers, platforms, and algorithms may not integrate smoothly, and emergent QI metrics vary among centers in the methods of acquisition, quantification, interpretation, and extrapolation; technological advances contribute to difficulty in standardization. Systematic errors may arise at each step of image acquisition, processing, and analysis, including 1) technical issues (e.g., depth of inspiration, acquisition protocol, signal-to-noise ratio, resolution), 2) nonrepresentative sampling of parts of interest (e.g., comparing regions, lobes, or airways), and 3) lack of a well-defined reference space, as well as 4) inaccurate landmark coregistration for evaluating paired images obtained at different lung volumes and 5) failure to consider basic physiology and/or biological or spatiotemporal heterogeneity.

### Extracellular matrix stiffness cues junctional remodeling for 3D tissue elongation [^2c4dbb7f]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Morphometrics extraction

We used ImSAnE to unroll the follicle epithelium as previously described, with all measurements computed using the metric tensor. Follicle A–P orientation was defined either automatically by the longest axis or manually based on the position of the polar cells identified by anti-FasIII staining at the stages when follicles are close to spherical. Length along the A–P meridian was computed by determining the anterior and posterior poles as extreme points along the A–P axis, and then measuring the length of the geodesic connecting these two points. latitudinal length was computed by choosing an arbitrary point midway along the meridian and measuring the length around the circumference passing through this point. Follicle aspect ratio is defined as the ratio of A-P length to the length of future dorsoventral (DV) axis. Aspect ratios were computed from unflattened 3D stacks, except for Figs. 6 l, 7l, Supplementary Fig. 3 h, 4 d, g, which used single confocal sections of preparations with standard mounting. Follicle volume was computed by adding up all pixels contained within the 3D surface. The number of cells along the A–P meridian and the equatorial circumference was determined by first segmenting all cells in a pullback. Cells whose centroids are a given distance away from the line used to measure the meridional and latitudinal length were then counted accordingly. For fusing 3D representations of the surface, pullbacks showing anterior, posterior, and two cylinder projections were first segmented, and then stitched together in 3D. The pullbacks were based on a maximum intensity projection of 3 × 0.5 μm thick pullbacks from 3 to 4 μm inward of the basal-most surface extracted. Cell segmentation used simple thresholding of prediction maps obtained by using Ilastik. The thresholded images were treated with standard morphological operations to obtain skeletonized cell outlines. Automated methods for detecting branching points then enabled construction of a lattice. The lattice consists of a lookuptable, with vertices, bonds connecting vertices, and cells arranging bonds (cell–cell interfaces) to a closed outline. The number of neighbors in each cell was determined by the number of bonds. Surface area was obtained by integrating the square root of the metric tensor over the cell. Summing all individual cell areas gave total follicle surface area. Cell eccentricity is determined based on the long and short axis of the cell, while cell orientation is defined as the angle between the long axis of the cell and the circumferential axis of the follicle.

### Genomics reveals heterogeneous plasmodium falciparum transmission and selection signals in Zambia [^b801d262]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Evidence of high IBD-based relatedness among parasites at the cluster level

Our identity by descent (IBD) analysis revealed an overall low level of relatedness, with only 3.96% (1145/28,920) of sample pairs of genomes displaying at least one block of IBD shared (minimum 3.7 cM, 20 SNPs). 231 out of 241 genomes shared at least 1 IBD segment with other genomes. Overall, we found only 2% (23/1145) of shared pairs representing relatedness within three generations (i.e. sharing at least 5% IBD, calculated as the proportion of IBD segments over genome length) (Fig. 4A). Assuming an average generation interval of 3 months for P. falciparum, 2% of shared pairs had a common ancestor less than 1 year ago, reflecting a high degree of transmission and recombination between divergent parasites across Zambia. Additionally, the distribution of pairwise IBD blocks across the genome revealed that most segments were centered around a length of 100Kb with very few at the right tail, demonstrating high IBD (Supplementary Fig. 11 inset). This corresponds to approximately 8 cM in genetic distance and suggests a common ancestor around six generations, equivalent to approximately ~1.5 years (Supplementary Fig. 11).

Diameter Change

The 3mensio Vascular workstation 10.1 (Pie Medical Imaging BV, Maastricht, The Netherlands) was used to obtain a 3D segmentation of the aortic arch lumen in the phase-averaged CT volume with a smoothing factor of 5. Diameters of this segmentation were calculated in the planes perpendicular to the centerline with steps of 1 cm along the centerline of the stented aortic arch. For these centerline locations, two lines perpendicular to the centerline tangent were calculated. The locations where these perpendicular lines crossed on the 3D aortic arch segmentation were marked for the diameter calculations: the two marked points for each perpendicular line were used to calculate one diameter, resulting in two perpendicular diameters at each level along the centerline. In addition, diameters of the native aorta upstream and downstream of the stented aortic section were calculated. Diameter change, that is, pulsatile expansion, of the aortic arch was calculated as the difference between maximal and minimal diameter over the cardiac cycle by translating the marked points to each cardiac phase. The two diameters per centerline level were averaged into a mean diameter value per centerline level of 1 cm, that is, a diameter pair (Figure 3).

Two diameters were calculated at each 1 cm level of the centerline (bright green), forming a diameter pair. Each diameter pair is shown in a different color with a corresponding number. The white diameter pairs indicate the native aorta diameters upstream and downstream of the main body in the aortic arch.

Near-reciprocal SVs in HRD cancers

A classic reciprocal rearrangement (that is, balanced translocation or inversion) occurs without the loss or gain of genetic material and involves a pair of DNA junctions with break ends that adjoin the same break point (Fig. 1a, left). However, many rearrangements, including translocations and inversions, are near-reciprocal, with break ends that are nearby but not adjacent on the genome (Fig. 1a, middle). TICsand chromoplexies(chains of balanced rearrangements) are examples of complex SVs that are near-reciprocal.

Reciprocal pairs are enriched in BRCA1d and BRCA2d tumours.

a, Schematic of exact and near reciprocality, using translocations as an example. Exactly reciprocal junctions link break ends that adjoin the same break point (schematic on the right), giving rise to a balanced translocation. Near-reciprocal junctions are associated with a gap segment (dark blue) that is lost (middle left) or gained (right examples). The gap segment polarity refers to whether the adjoining junctions connect to the gap segment (+ polarity; right two examples) or to its adjacent segments (− polarity, middle left example). The polarity determines whether there is a copy gain (+) or loss (− polarity) of the gap segment. Both (−) and (+) gap segments can give rise to quasi-balanced translocations; however, (+) gap segments are also equally consistent with a templated insertion (right).

### Increased tortuosity of ACA might be associated with increased risk of ACoA aneurysm development and less aneurysm dome size: a computer-aided analysis [^f3471392]. European Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Sum of angle metrics

Calculation of SOAM begins from the division of curve into the subcurves of equal length. Then, for each subcurve, we calculate supplementary of the angle between lines connecting its center and ends. Angles are summed up and the result is normalized by the length of the entire curve:where φ indicates measured angles and n is its count. For a curve that is straighter, supplementary angles are larger and therefore the entire SOAM is larger. This descriptor is also sensitive to local tortuosity (Fig. 2 b).

Product of angle distance

The PAD is calculated using the below formula:

This descriptor defines global tortuosity which is the combination of deviation from the straight line given by RL and local angles metrics, which is given by the SOAM.

Triangular index

To calculate TI, the curve must be again divided into equal subcurves. Then, a triangle is built with vertices on each end of the subcurve and in its middle point. TI is calculated using the below formula:where n is the number of subcurves, a and b are the triangle sides, and c is its base. TI is smaller for more straight curves (Fig. 2 c).

Inflection count metrics

Inflection point is a point on a curve where it changes from being concave to being convex, or vice versa. ICM is defined with below formula:where n I is the number of curve's inflection points. That factor is more sensitive to global curvature than RL and is lower for more straight curves (Fig. 2 d).

Additional measurements

For each analyzed segment of ACA, we measured its diameter, which was defined as the shortest distance between the artery edge points in the selected region. In a similar way, we measured the diameter of C7 segment of ICA. We also obtained the length of A1–A3 ACA segments.

### The impact of sampling density upon cortical network analysis: regions or points [^6d1d005e]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

The choice of representation has a fundamental influence on the network analysis results of an empirical data set. The answers to two basic questions - how to define a node and how to define an edge between a pair of nodes - are not obvious in the network analysis of brain imaging data. We considered the first question in the case of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based cortical thickness networks. We selected network nodes to represent vertices of a cortical surface mesh or cortical brain regions. The first network represents the maximal level of detail available in the analysis of cortical thickness networks, while the latter network represents the typical level of detail in the current network analysis studies. We compared the network analysis results between these two representations. The basic network measures behaved approximately as expected when the level of detail increased. However, the overall connectivity of nodes was greater in the vertex level, degree of clustering was smaller in the vertex level, and the node centralities were different between the levels. Further, many parameters of vertex-level network were more robust to the selection of the correlation threshold used to define the edges of network. We conclude that albeit many qualitative network properties were consistent between the two resolution levels, the vertex-level resolution revealed details that were not visible at the regional-level networks, and this additional detail could be useful for some applications. Finally, a similar methodology as the one used here could be used to study effects of the sampling density in other brain-imaging-based networks, for example, in resting-state functional MRI.

### Thresholds of lake and reservoir connectivity in river networks control nitrogen removal [^7593c74f]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Pond connectivity was estimated to assess the degree of centeredness of a ponded water on the river network. For each ponded water, we estimated the geographic coordinates of the planer centroid and the midpoint of the intersecting reach. With these coordinates, we calculated the distance from the centroid to the midpoint (L centroid, m). For ponded waters that have several intersecting stream reaches (see details below), we estimated L centroid / L (Eq. (4)) for each segment. Then to provide a single value for each unique ponded water, we estimated the pond connectivity value as the mean of all corresponding pond segments. The average tendency of the connectivity of ponded waters throughout the river network (i.e. the average connectivity of all ponded waters upstream of a point in the network) was estimated as:

River network hydrography

We accounted for only ponded waters connected to the river network (i.e. has a corresponding stream reach) that are either a natural lake or reservoir. In total, we used 191,256 stream reaches with corresponding catchments (84,214 in CB and 107,042 in NE), of which 29,046 are covered by ponded waters (15%). The river network consists of 289,214 km (128,243 km in CB and 160,971 km in NE), with 6.4% of the total length covered by ponded waters (Supplementary Table 1). We excluded reaches that are geographically isolated, are diversions or canals, or are directly along coasts.

Some larger ponded waters have several intersecting stream reaches, which results in segmentation of a ponded water. There are a total 18,180 unique ponded waters (4305 in CB and 13,875 in NE), of which 2804 are segmented (generally the larger lakes and reservoirs), resulting in a combined total of 29,046 unique ponded waters and segments (6225 in CB and 22,821 in NE). NHD provides estimates of surface area (m 2) and mean annual discharge (m 3 d −1) for each pond segment, which allowed us to quantify different proportions of nitrogen removed for each segment. We chose to account for ponded water segmentation to provide better estimates of nitrogen removal because different portions of a large lake or reservoir have been shown to vary in removal efficiencies.

### A quantitative comparison of the fingerprint of twinned microstructures through surface and three-dimensional techniques [^c157fa66]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Fig. 2
Representative geometric alignments and domain morphologies for in-grain and cross-grain twin contacts.

a Twin contacts that form in-grain twin junctions through the intersections of separate twin variants in a single parent grain, and (b) twin contacts that form cross-grain twin pairs that connect at the shared parent grain boundary. The twins are illustrated by orange and blue point clouds of the exterior twin boundary and local reference frame axes detailing the K 1, η 1, and λ 1 directions placed at each twin centroid. Grain boundaries are illustrated by a grey point cloud.

The use of graphs for twin network characterization was inspired by prior network analysesin structural biology, the social sciences, and microstructural analysis of dislocation structures. In the present work, we extend the use of graph abstractions by developing a novel framework to succinctly visualize the fingerprint of the twin network present in the microstructure. As an example, different components of the twin fingerprint in 3D Cube 1 are visualized in Fig. 3. The connectivity of the twin network that evolves to accommodate plastic deformation comprises a variety of characteristic parameters that can be embedded in the graph, with nodes representing individual twins and edges representing contacts between twins. For Cube 1, the graph is initially generated by assigning nodes at the centroids of each twin – projected to a single plane for the 3D volumes – as shown in Fig. 3 a with the node size scaled by the cube root volume of the twin as shown in Fig. 3 b. The orientation of each twin variant is next encoded in each node and visualized by color mapping the node by the twin's nominal Schmid factor (SF) as observed in Fig. 3 c. While local stress states that activating twinning will vary from the macroscopic loading conditions, the differences between the twin SFs are detailed to highlight the differences between the alignment of the twins with respect to the macroscopic loading axis. The latter broadly provides a quantitative description of the difference between local and macroscopic stresses throughout the network. Finally, the connectivity in the twin network – arising from co-nucleation, cross-boundary transmission, intragranular junction formation, and incidental contact between separately nucleated isolated twins or twin chains – is also visualized by edges connecting the nodes. In-grain junctions and cross-grain contacts are differentiated by line style as shown in Fig. 3 (d-e), with intragranular twin contacts shown as dashed lines and intergranular twin contacts shown as solid lines. For twins that contact across grain boundaries, the geometric alignment of the twins is an important parameter that both reflects the mechanism by which the contact formed as well as the extent to which shear discontinuities are localized along the shared boundary. The cross-grain twin alignments in the graph are illustrated by color mapping the edges using the Luster and Morris m' parameter:whereandare the twin plane normal and twin shear direction, respectively, for connecting twinsandat each twin contact. We note m' varies from −1 for perfectly anti-aligned twins to 1 for perfectly aligned twins. The cross-grain twin contact in Fig. 2 b illustrates an example of a high m' (well-aligned) twin pair. The edge colors are scaled from −0.5 to 1 as no adjoining twin pairs are observed in highly anti-aligned configurations due to the sample texture and loading conditions. A highly aligned twin pair indicates that the lattice shearing induced by a twin on one side of the grain boundary is near fully accommodated by the twin on the opposite side, generating minimal plastic discontinuities along the grain boundary interface. Misaligned twin pairs alternatively indicate possible sources of high shear localization, or hot spots for defect accumulation during continued deformation.

Surgical Design

The present MRAT was designed on the basis of the modified Mohler's principle. Some points, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. were almost the same in both techniques. The details of the surgical landmarks and postoperative situation are shown in Fig. 1, as follows: Point 1 was the peak of Cupid's bow (cphi) on the non-affected side. Point 2 was the deepest point of Cupid's bow. Point 3 was the cphi at the medial segment of the affected side, and L 1~2 (the linear distance between points 1 and 2, and so on) = L 2~3. The vertical distance from points 1 to 3 was H. Point 4, Noordhoff's point, where the vermillion was the widest and started to converge medially at the lateral segment of the affected side. Point 5, subnasale (sn), was the midpoint of the columellar base. Point X was located on the straight-line connecting points 5 with 1, and L X~5 = H, the distance that point 3 should be dropped. Points 6 and 7 were on the nasal floor line of the affected side. In complete clefts, these points were at the mucocutaneous junctions of medial and lateral segments, respectively. In incomplete clefts, the specific positions should ensure equal-width nasal bases. A-flap was formed by sequentially straight connecting points 3, 5, and X. Along the white skin roll, two curves were formed by connecting points 3 and 6, with points 4 and 7, respectively. The red linewas marked on the vermilion on both sides. Point 8 was located on the red line just under point 2, and connected points 3 and 8 as an arc. Point 9 was on arcs 4–7, where the dry lip disappeared.

### A selection and targeting framework of cortical locations for line-scanning fMRI [^7d5ce816]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Anatomical measures confirm accurate line‐planning

First, we used anatomical information to assess planning accuracy. We created a binarized mask representing the nominal line by taking the middle 16 voxels (indicative of the nominal 4 mm gap between saturation pulses) in the phase encoding direction along the frequency encoding direction. Of note, due to the imperfect nature of these saturation slabs, there are contaminating signals coming from outside the region‐of‐interest (Raimondo, Knapen, et al; Raimondo, Priovoulos, et al.). Because the full registration cascade from target vertex to the line through the low‐resolution image, partial FOV image, and single slice is known, we can project the nominal line image back onto the surface (Figure 3a, b). This showed that for all subjects, the line was indeed placed on the target site as per the overlap of the line (white) and target vertex (red spot) (Figure 3c).

FIGURE 3
Assessment of line‐placement accuracy using anatomical measures. The registration cascade from target vertex (a) to line‐scanning acquisition (b; outer right panel) is known after registering the anatomical image from Session 1 (high‐res) to the anatomical image from Session 2 (low‐res). Within Session 2, we acquired a partial field‐of‐view image (partial FOV), as well as the anatomical slice without OVS pulses (slice). From this slice, we created an image representing the nominal line (line). For each subject, we projected this nominal line image back to the surface from which the target vertex originated, showing sufficient overlap between the target vertex (red dot) and nominal line image (white patches) (c). The patches represent the location at which the nominal line image intersects with GM and looks scattered due to unfolding of the cortex. (d) Variation in registration outcomes after registration anatomies from Sessions 1 and 2, a hundred times for each subject. (e) Effect of subject motion by means of manual alignment of the single slice images on positional stability of the target coordinate. (f) Curvature distributions within the gray patch intersecting with the target location of (c). The curvature is measured as 1/r, where r is the radius of an inscribed circle. Since mean curvature is the average of the two principal curvatures, it has the units of 1/mm.

### Effective use of tables and figures in abstracts, presentations, and papers [^9d553efc]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

In some situations, tables, graphs, and figures can present certain types of information (including complicated relationships and sequences of events) more clearly and in less space than the same information would require in sentence form. However, do not use tables, graphs, and figures for small amounts of data that could be conveyed clearly and succinctly in a sentence. Also, do not reiterate in sentences the data that are shown in a table, graph, or figure: the point of creating a table or graph or figure is to eliminate that type of sentence from your manuscript. In building a data table you must balance the necessity that the table be complete with the equally important necessity that it not be too complex. Sometimes it is helpful to break a large table into several smaller ones to allow the reader to identify important information easily, but, conversely, it is a common mistake of novice authors to split up into several tables data that belong in one table. In almost all cases, only one table or graph or figure should be included in an abstract, and then only if it can convey essential information in less space and in a more easily interpretable way than the sentence form. For a poster, in almost all instances you should use only one typeface and one font in a table, graph, or figure. In general, do not use bold, italics, or color unless you are presenting a great deal of data and you need to highlight certain data values and you are certain that using bold, italics, or color will improve readability, which is rare. Do not include identical information in a table and a graph/figure. In reporting a clinical trial you will need to include a patient flow chart that identifies the number of patients initially screened for the study, the number of patients who were excluded (and why) after initial screening or in the final analysis, and how many patients entered, exited early, and completed each arm of the study. A treatment protocol should also be described with a flow chart. In preparing a graph the most common error is to include a line that suggests an unsubstantiated extrapolation between or beyond the data points. In selecting the graph's axes, avoid truncating, enlarging, or compressing the axes in ways that might make the graph confusing or misleading. To prepare clear, accurate, easily interpretable tables, graphs, and figures, rely on the rules described in authoritative guides such as the Council of Science Editors' Scientific Style and Format and the American Medical Association's Manual of Style.

### Multiplexity of human brain oscillations as a personal brain signature [^2fc91d88]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

2.3.2 Surrogatesource connectivity analysis

To estimate the statistical significance of the iPLV/PAC‐interactions, which were estimated within frequencies and for every pair of frequencies, between all possible pairs of 90 virtual sensors, and at each successive sliding window, we employed surrogate data (Dimitriadis). Surrogate data analyses determined: (a) if a given iPLV/PAC value differed from what would be expected by chance alone, and (b) if a given nonzero iPLV/PAC indicated coupling that was, at least statistically, nonspurious.

Significant iPLV values were determined after calculating iPLV for r s = 10,000 surrogates for each connection derived by selecting a random time‐point from the amplitude time series of one of the two virtual sources and then exchanging the order of the two segments that were created (Dimitriadis,; Dimitriadis & Salis). Similarly, significant PAC values were determined after calculating PAC for r s = 10,000 surrogates for each connection derived by selecting a random time‐point from the amplitude time series (high‐frequency) and then exchanging the two ordered segments.

For every time window, virtual sensor‐pair, and pair of frequencies, we tested the null hypothesis H 0 that the observed PAC value came from the same distribution as the distribution of surrogate PAC‐values. Ten thousand surrogate time‐series As HF (t) were generated by cutting at a single point at a random location the amplitude A time series (high‐frequency, HF) and exchanging the two resulting time courses (Aru et al.). Repeating this procedure produced a set of surrogates with minimal distortion of the original amplitude dynamics and impact on the nonstationarity of brain activity as compared to either merely shuffling the time series or cutting and rebuilding the time series in more than one time point. With this aforementioned approach, the nonstationarity of the brain activity as captured from the source time series is less affected compared to circularly permuted phase time series (low‐frequency) for PAC relative to amplitude series (high‐frequency for PAC) and the phase of the time series for iPLV. This procedure ensures that the observed and surrogate indices share the same statistical properties. The amplitude distribution and Fourier spectra of original time series and surrogate time series are identical, the autocorrelation functions, the means, and standard deviations of amplitude distributions are also identical.

### Automatic correspondence on medical images: a comparative study of four methods for allocating corresponding points [^db565d3a]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2010). Low credibility.

The accurate estimation of point correspondences is often required in a wide variety of medical image-processing applications. Numerous point correspondence methods have been proposed in this field, each exhibiting its own characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. This paper presents a comprehensive comparison of four automatic methods for allocating corresponding points, namely the template-matching technique, the iterative closest points approach, the correspondence by sensitivity to movement scheme, and the self-organizing maps algorithm. Initially, the four correspondence methods are described focusing on their distinct characteristics and their parameter selection for common comparisons. The performance of the four methods is then qualitatively and quantitatively compared over a total of 132 two-dimensional image pairs divided into eight sets. The sets comprise of pairs of images obtained using controlled geometry protocols (affine and sinusoidal transforms) and pairs of images subject to unknown transformations. The four methods are statistically evaluated pairwise on all image pairs and individually in terms of specific features of merit based on the correspondence accuracy as well as the registration accuracy. After assessing these evaluation criteria for each method, it was deduced that the self-organizing maps approach outperformed in most cases the other three methods in comparison.

### Discovery and quality analysis of a comprehensive set of structural variants and short tandem repeats [^10e731e2]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Genome STRiP CNVDiscovery stitching of CNVs

Genome STRiP occasionally reports a single CNV as several adjacent CNVs. To address this issue, we analyzed sites that passed filtering, and were non-redundant, computing the correlation and distance between every pair of adjacent sites. We observed high genotype correlation between sites that overlapped or were close to each other (within ~40 kb) (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Pairs of sites were considered for stitching into a single CNV if they had high overall correlation (r > 0.9) between copy number genotypes and at least 80% concordance between copy number genotypes of non-mode samples for each variant (union). Because variants that are very far from one another are less likely to be fragmented variant calls, we also selected a maximum distance between a pair of variants to consider for stitching. To do so, we examined the number and percentage of adjacent variant pairs that passed genotype correlation requirements at different distance thresholds, and selected 30 kb, which maximized the number and percentage of pairs passing these requirements (Supplementary Fig. 4b). We then identified correlated adjacent CNVs to be stitched using a graph-based method: (1) a genotype correlation matrix was created for all the CNVs on each chromosome using estimated copy numbers across samples; (2) a graph was drawn with CNVs as nodes, connecting a pair of CNVs with an edge if they resided on the same chromosome and had correlation from their copy number estimates > 0.9; (3) for each connected component in the graph with more than a single CNV, CNVs were sorted by position and each adjacent pair was examined for potential stitching; and (4) CNVs were merged if they passed the correlation/concordance criteria described above and were within 30 kb of one another. This approach ensured that only highly correlated adjacent CNVs were merged. In cases where a set of CNVs was chosen to be stitched, a new breakpoint spanning the start point of the first CNV to the end point of the last CNV (sorted by start point) was defined, referred to hereafter as the stitch breakpoint, while the other CNVs in the cluster were considered constituent sites. Note that in cases when a stitch cluster was made up of a single CNV containing one or more smaller CNVs, the large CNV was identified as a stitch breakpoint. Overall, this process lead to 3558 sites being combined into 1252 putative stitch breakpoints, 355 of which were large breakpoints in the call set that contained smaller breakpoints, and 897 were new breakpoints. The set of 897 new stitch breakpoints (not already genotyped in our set) were then genotyped across all samples using Genome STRiP SVGenotyper (CNVDiscovery), separately for iPSCORE samples, HipSci fibroblast samples, and HipSci iPSC samples (as was described in initial discovery 3.3.1). Finally, we compared the genotypes of the stitched breakpoint with the genotypes of the constituent sites, and those that did not have high correlation (average r < 0.9 across all constituents) were unstitched, and if the stitch breakpoint was one of the 897 new breakpoints genotyped, it was marked for filtering. If the new stitched breakpoint had over 10% low-quality flagged genotypes (LQ) or was non polymorphic, the stitch cluster was also unstitched, and the breakpoint marked for filtering.

### Rotors detected by phase analysis of filtered, epicardial atrial fibrillation electrograms colocalize with regions of conduction block [^b7187501]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2018). Low credibility.

Spatial Comparison Between Conduction Block Lines and Phase Singularity

At the moment of PS detection, we compared the underlying conduction pattern in the phase map (Figure 1 D) and the isochrone wave map (Figure 1 F). Both isochrone and phase map presented in Figure 1 were manually interpolated to enhance the readability of maps, by combining multiple isochrones to one, if there were > 1 isochrone between 2 adjacent electrodes.

To assess the spatial association between PSs and conduction block lines, the distribution of the average Euclidian distances between PSs and the closest site of conduction block was computed. The time segment for comparison between PSs and conduction blocks was chosen as the full lifespan of the PS. Every millisecond when a PS was present, the distance of PSs to the closest block line was determined, and the average distance throughout the lifespan was calculated.

To check for the probability of colocalization of conduction block and PS locations because of chance, we also computed the average minimal distance to conduction block of a random sequence of locations where no PS was detected (named random non-PS location throughout the article) to the closest conduction block, covering the same time interval as the lifespan of each PS. We divided the average distance of PS points and of non-PS locations into 2 subgroups: those that are closer or exactly 1 electrode from the nearest conduction block and those that are farther than 1 electrode to the closest conduction block. The threshold of 1 electrode distance was set to 2 mm to include all block between electrodes in which at least one of the electrodes was adjacent to the PS point. Note that the PS is detected on the intersection of a square of 4 electrodes, and block is detected between pairs of adjacent electrodes.

Back-extrapolated volume (BEV) on the volume–time curve — Time 0 is found by drawing a line with a slope equal to peak flow through the point of peak flow on the volume–time curve and setting Time 0 to the point where this line intersects the time axis. The BEV is equal to the volume of gas exhaled before Time 0, which, in these two examples from the same patient, is 0.136 L for the left panel (acceptable) and 0.248 L for the right panel (unacceptable). For this patient, the BEV limit is 5% FVC = 0.225 L.

### Bonsai: an efficient method for inferring large human pedigrees from genotype data [^cda4350a]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

The second tool we introduce is an approximation of the likelihood of the degree separating two pedigrees, given the total IBD shared between the two pedigrees. This likelihood, which was inspired by the DRUID estimator, makes it possible to evaluate the relative likelihoods of different degrees separating two pedigrees in addition to obtaining a point estimate of the degree.

The third tool we introduce is a test for detecting segments of background IBD. Background IBD segments are regions of the genome that are shared identically-by-state (IBS) that did not arise by transmission from a single shared common ancestor. Instead, these segments arose because of demographic or evolutionary processes, such as a population bottleneck. They are long regions of IBS with hidden recombination events and they can provide misleading information about the degree of relationship between a pair of individuals. Background IBD segments can lead to mis-inferred pedigrees, particularly when pedigrees are sparsely genotyped.

The fourth tool we introduce is a method for determining the correct ancestral lineages through which two or more pedigrees are connected. This approach relies on detecting overlapping IBD segments that are inconsistent with certain lineage combinations.

We also derive a recursive formula for computing the probability of an observed presence-absence pattern of an ancestrally transmitted allele in a set of descendants. This formula is useful for developing the generalized DRUID estimator and the likelihoods for degree estimation and background IBD detection.

Together, the tools we introduce can be used to identify the ancestors through which two small pedigrees are connected, infer the degree separating the two ancestors, and identify and discard individuals whose IBD sharing patterns appear to be background IBD. By using these inference tools to identify highly likely ways of connecting pedigrees, the space of possible pedigrees can be reduced. We now describe each of these approaches in detail.

### Tissue feature-based and segmented deformable image registration for improved modeling of shear movement of lungs [^84619a72]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report a tissue feature-based image registration strategy with explicit inclusion of the differential motions of thoracic structures.

Methods and Materials

The proposed technique started with auto-identification of a number of corresponding points with distinct tissue features. The tissue feature points were found by using the scale-invariant feature transform method. The control point pairs were then sorted into different "colors" according to the organs in which they resided and used to model the involved organs individually. A thin-plate spline method was used to register a structure characterized by the control points with a given "color". The proposed technique was applied to study a digital phantom case and 3 lung and 3 liver cancer patients.

Results

For the phantom case, a comparison with the conventional thin-plate spline method showed that the registration accuracy was markedly improved when the differential motions of the lung and chest wall were taken into account. On average, the registration error and standard deviation of the 15 points against the known ground truth were reduced from 3.0 to 0.5 mm and from 1.5 to 0.2 mm, respectively, when the new method was used. A similar level of improvement was achieved for the clinical cases.

Conclusion

The results of our study have shown that the segmented deformable approach provides a natural and logical solution to model the discontinuous organ motions and greatly improves the accuracy and robustness of deformable registration.

Forbidden transitions

Transition lines for 12→21 and 21→12 do not appear in our phase diagram and it is quite easy to understand why. Let us assume that the transition line for 12→21 does exist. To obtain that transition, the idea would be to simultaneously increaseand decrease(that is, increase the damage in one part of the system and decrease in another part). Suppose we are in phase 12 and infinitesimally close to the supposed transition line. Considering the local geometry of this line, we may be able to observe its angle with respect to theaxis. If a transition occurs when increasingand decreasing, the tangent on the supposed line would have an angle of. From here, it follows that by increasingonly, while keepingconstant, we would also make a transition (cross the transition line). The only other possibility would be that we were moving along the transition line, but this is easy to disprove because it would imply that the transition does not depend on. If increasingonly causes a transition, the transition must end in state 22 and not in 21. This is because if we only increase, we increase damage to both network A (directly) and network B (indirectly, through the interdependent links).

### Layer-specificity in the effects of attention and working memory on activity in primary visual cortex [^a564606f]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Results

Layer-specific activity in V1 during the curve-tracing task

We recorded multi-unit activity (MUA) and local field potentials (LFPs) in the different layers of monkey V1 using a high-density depth probe with a spacing of 100 μm between electrodes (Fig. 1e, f). We used a version of a curve-tracing taskthat allowed a direct comparison between selective attention for stimuli that remained on the screen and working memory for stimuli that were only presented briefly. The monkeys directed their gaze to a red fixation point and we then presented four curves with green circles at their ends (Fig. 1a–d). After a delay the fixation point disappeared, cueing the monkey to make an eye movement to the green circle that was connected to the fixation point (for example the left circle in Fig. 1a). The initial contour segment at location 1 connected the fixation point to the left or the right main branch, and the contour segments at locations 2 and 3 established a connection between the main branches and one of two sub-branches and hence the saccade target. At each of the three locations the contour elements could be in one of two configurations, so that there were a total number of eight stimuli (Fig. 1a–d shows the variations at locations 1 and 2, Supplementary Fig. 1 shows all stimuli). We adapted the stimulus so that the neurons' RF fell on one of the possible segments at location 2, and the configuration at location 1 determined whether this segment belonged to the target curve (Fig. 1a) or a distractor curve (Fig. 1b), while RF stimulation was constant. For the two other stimuli the target (Fig. 1c) or distractor curve was adjacent to the RF (Fig. 1d). In the attention task, the stimulus was always visible and the fixation point disappeared after 750 ms, cueing the monkey to make a saccade (Fig. 2a). In the memory task, the stimulus disappeared after 150 ms and only part of the stimulus reappeared when the monkey was cued to respond (Fig. 2d). We held the orientation of the contour element in the neurons' RF constant to obtain a sufficient number of trials per condition, and we therefore did not determine orientation tuning.

### Using scalable computer vision to automate high-throughput semiconductor characterization [^8853793a]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The process of parallel segmentation uses a sequence of edge-detection filtersto first identify each island of material and then uniquely index each island based on its position within a graph connectivity network. The pixel coordinates of each segmented sample are then spatially mapped to their corresponding reflectance spectra, in turn, generating the segmented datacube. Parallel segmentation and mapping of these reflectance spectra accelerate a once point-by-point measurement process, to a rapid and scalable process that can rate-match the throughput of HT synthesis (Supplementary Fig. S-1). Furthermore, this segmentation process is shown to scale to more than 80 unique samples in parallel (Supplementary Fig. S-4). Algorithm 1 illustrates the sample size-agnostic nature of the method, highlighting its further scalable potential. These segmented reflectance data serve as the starting point for automating the mapping of composition and the computation of optical band gap and degradation for all N = 201 unique semiconductors.

Composition mapping

Semiconductor properties such as band gap and stability are largely governed by the chemical composition of the material. Thus, accurately determining and mapping composition to each sample is essential for scalable HT setups that deposit variable sample geometries. In this work, we use HT deposition of solution-processed precursors to synthesize perovskite semiconductor samples. The variable rotational velocities of two pumps, ω FA and ω MA, determine the output sample composition by combining the liquid-based formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI 3) and methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI 3) precursors. Figure 3 a illustrates this printing process as a function of both space and time. The FA-rich materials are printed first and then proportions of MA are added gradually as the print head rasters in a serpentine pattern. Thus, to determine the composition of each material deposit, ω FA and ω MA are spatially and temporally mapped onto the computer vision-segmented samples, and then integrated over time to determine each sample's computed FA 1− x MA x PbI 3 composition:where x is the proportion of MA, t a and t b are the starting and ending timesteps for the deposition of a single sample, and ω FA (t) and ω MA (t) are the pump velocities at a given timestep for the FAPbI 3 and MAPbI 3 precursors, respectively.

### Group-guided individual functional parcellation of the hippocampus and application to normal aging [^bce5603d]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Medium credibility.

2.4 Hippocampus definition

To define the individual functional subregions of hippocampus, the human bilateral hippocampus seed masks were defined using Harvard‐Oxford cortical atlas with 25% probability (Desikan et al.). After obtaining the hippocampus masks, the bilateral masks were downsampled into 3 mm cubic voxel to calculate functional connectivity for parcellation.

2.5 Group‐guided individual parcellation of hippocampus

To achieve individual parcellation of hippocampus, we first performed the group‐level parcellation of hippocampus across all the subjects. For group‐level parcellation, we first calculated the whole brain functional connectivity map for each voxel within hippocampus. Next, the similarity for the functional connectivity maps of every pair of voxels within the hippocampus was defined using eta 2 (Wang, Yang, et al; Wang et al.), and a similarity matrix S for each subject was obtained. Then, all the similarity matrixes were averaged to obtain one similar matrix which was clustered to obtain the parcellation results of hippocampus. To automatically identify the optimal number of clustering, the affinity propagation method (Frey & Dueck,) was employed to segment the similarity matrix.

The AP algorithm requires two input parameters: input similarity matrix S, in which S(i, k) is the negative value of the squared Euclidean distance between points i and point k in the similarity matrix (for similarity matrix X = { x 1, x 2,…, x N }, i ≠ k, i, k ∈{1,2,…, N }); and preference "P," recommended as the median of S(i, k) when there is no prior, determines the number of clustering (Frey & Dueck). The algorithm takes all data points as potential exemplars and calculates the following two messages including the "availability" a(i, k) and the "responsibility" r(i, k)) to characterize the appropriateness of exemplars selection for the data points iteratively to obtain the optimal clustering results (Zhang, Li, et al; Zhang, Tuo, et al.). The number of clusters was finally determined when the iterative process converges. The details of AP clustering are as follows (Xia et al.):

### Network statistics of the whole-brain connectome of drosophila [^1ea6fc64]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Pairwise distances between neurons

To determine the connection probability distribution as a function of distance between neurons, we first had to distil the available spatial information into a handful of points. This was the only practical way to enable distance comparisons between all neurons — a total of 14 billion pairs. For each neuron, we defined two coordinates based on the location of their incoming and outgoing synapses. We computed the average 3D position of all of the neuron's incoming synapses to approximate the position of the neuron's dendritic arbour, and did the same to approximate the position of the neuron's axonal arbour. We then computed for all neuron pairs the pairwise distances between the axonal arbour of neuron A and the dendritic arbour of neuron B. Binning by distance and comparing the number of true connections to the number of neuron pairs allowed us to compute connection probability as a function of space (Extended Data Fig. 1d).

NND model

Informed by the distribution of connection probability as a function of distance, we constructed a NND model with two zones of probability — a 'close' zone (0 to 50 μm) where connections are possible with a relatively high probability (p close = 0.00418) and a 'distant' zone (more than 50 μm) where connections occur with lower probability (p distant = 0.00418) (Extended Data Fig. 1e). The probabilities in these two zones were derived from the real network. Then, for every neuron pair (around 14 billion pairs), we generate a random number drawn uniformly from between 0 and 1. The distance between the two neuronal arbours sets the probability of forming an edge between the pairs, p close or p distant. If the random number is below the probability threshold, a connection is formed between these two neurons in the model.

American Society of Echocardiography — right ventricular fractional area change (FAC) by two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography uses an RV‑centric apical 4 chamber view with image optimized for endocardial border definition of the RV throughout cardiac cycle; avoid foreshortening or dropout; trace end‑diastolic area and end‑systolic area along endocardial borders from tricuspid annular hinge point, down to RV apex and back up to opposite hinge point; close the area with a straight line connecting the 2 hinge points; and cavity area should include moderator band, tricuspid valve and trabeculations. FAC reflects longitudinal and radial contraction, is reproducible if well standardized and modestly correlates to MRI EF, but is image quality dependent with RV walls difficult to visualize; trabeculations can make defining the endocardial border difficult and introduce variability; foreshortening; dilated RV apex may not fit within the sector near field; and it does not include RV outflow segment to estimate RV function.

### Differences in network controllability and regional gene expression underlie hallucinations in Parkinson's disease [^a0a0243c]. Brain (2020). Medium credibility.

Diffusion-weighted images underwent denoising, removal of Gibbs ringing artefacts, eddy-current and motion correction and bias field correction. Diffusion tensor metrics were calculated and constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) performed, as implemented in MRtrix. The raw T 1 -weighted images were registered to the diffusion weighted image using FLIRT and five-tissue anatomical segmentation was performed using the 5ttgen script in MRtrix. All resulting anatomical segmentations were visually inspected pre and post registration. Anatomically constrained tractography was then performed with 10 million streamlines using the iFOD2 tractography algorithm with dynamic seeding, as implemented in MRtrix. To improve anatomically constrained tractography (ACT) performance we used the -backtrack option, which allows tracks to be truncated and retracked in case of poor termination and the -crop_at_gmwmi option which crops streamline end points more precisely as they cross the grey matter–white matter interface. We then applied the spherical deconvolution informed filtering of tractograms (SIFT2) algorithm to reduce biases. SIFT2 uses information from the fibre orientation distribution to determine a cross sectional area for each streamline and generate streamline volume estimates between regions whilst using the whole connectome. The resulting set of streamlines was used to construct the structural brain network.

Structural connectome construction

For each participant, we generated a structural connectivity map by determining whether each pair of regions of interest were connected by a streamline; connections were weighted by streamline count and a cross-sectional area multiplier. Then, connections were combined into 379 × 379 undirected and weighted connectivity matrices. In accordance with SIFT2 recommendations, we did not apply a threshold to connectivity matrices (Fig. 1 A).

### Novel surgical safety zones on bony-en-face view of humeral greater tuberosity: a fresh cadaveric dissection study [^0238b312]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The neurovascular alignment in the humeral greater tuberosity (HGT) region has not been thoroughly investigated. However, many studies have documented the vascular-nerve architecture of the proximal humerus. The purpose of this study was to identify novel safety zones on the bony-en-face view of the HGT for surgical procedures.

Methods

Eighteen complete adult fresh frozen cadavers (36 paired shoulders) were dissected in this study (12 males and 6 females; mean age of 69.39 years). Five landmarks-A, B, C, D, and E-were established to define the boundary of the HGT. Point A was the intersection of the superior facet of HGT and the intertubercular groove of the long head of the biceps tendon. Point B was the junction of the attachment point between the supraspinatus and the infraspinatus muscle. Point C was the intersection of the infraspinatus and the teres minor muscle and point D was the lowest foot point of the teres minor muscle. Point E was on a vertical intersection line from point D to point A. Next, we segmented the individualized pentagon ABCDE into 15 zones. First, we drew line BF to ensure it was perpendicular to DE. Then, we designated points H, J, and M as the midpoints of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor, respectively, with H and J perpendicular to DE and M perpendicular to EA. Finally, we drew perpendicular lines from points J, C, and M to EA, which intersected at points K, G, and L, respectively. The neurovascular structures in each zone were identified to enable the calculation of percentages, allowing for the definition of safe and dangerous zones.

Results

We have identified the specific ranking of the safe zones for branches of the circumflex humeral artery as follows: 1a (19.44%, meaning blood vessels were observed in 7 of 36 shoulders, accounting for 19.44% of the total); 3a (25%); 2a (47.22%); 7 (66.66%); 2b (75%); 1b (77.77%); 3b (80.55%); 4, 10, and 11 (all 88.88%); 6 and 8 (both 91.67%); and 5, 9, and 12 (all 100%). The specific zone ranking of vascular-branch numbers is as follows: 1a < 3a < 2a < 7 < 2b < 1b < 10 < 3b < 4 < 6 < 11 < 8 < 9 < 12 < 5. The specific ranking of the dangerous zones for the anterior branches of the axillary nerve is 8 (5.55%), 11 (8.33%), 10 (38.88%), and 9 (66.66%).

Conclusion

We demonstrate the neurovascular distribution in the 15 zones on the bony-en-face view of the HGT, clearly highlighting both safe and dangerous zones. We recommend following clinical suggestions based on our anatomical findings: (1) selection of safe insert points from zones 1a, 3a, 2a, or 7 for screw fixation (Liu-Gang type I & II) and (2) avoidance of neurovascular dangerous zones 8, 11, 10, and 9 for plate fixation. However, we should keep in mind that this technique cannot prevent vascular disruption in these areas.

### Guidelines for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography in ischemic heart disease: from the American Society of Echocardiography [^b119155d]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Grading of regional function and segment models — "For assessment of regional myocardial function, either the 16- or 17-segment model of the LV may be used," and "the 16-segment model is commonly used." "The 17-segment model, which includes the apical cap, an area beyond the LV cavity, is recommended if myocardial perfusion is evaluated or if echocardiography is compared with another imaging modality." Segment analysis guidance states, "To assess wall motion, each segment should be analyzed individually and ideally, in multiple views," and "The function of each segment is graded at rest and with stress according to a five-point scoring system," with "normal or hyperkinesis = 1 (systolic increase in thickness > 50%), hypokinesis = 2 (< 40%), severe hypokinesis or akinesis = 3 (< 10%), dyskinesis (paradoxical systolic motion away from the center of the LV) = 4, and aneurysmal (diastolic deformation) = 5." "The wall motion score index (WMSI) should be derived by dividing the sum of the scores of individual segments by the number of segments visualized," and at rest clinicians should note segments with substantially decreased diastolic wall thickness "(< 70% of the thickness in normal segments or absolute thickness ≤ 6 mm), which is indicative of transmural infarction and scar."

### In vivo dissection of a clustered-CTCF domain boundary reveals developmental principles of regulatory insulation [^8ac68383]. Nature Genetics (2022). High credibility.

Vertebrate genomes organize into topologically associating domains, delimited by boundaries that insulate regulatory elements from nontarget genes. However, how boundary function is established is not well understood. Here, we combine genome-wide analyses and transgenic mouse assays to dissect the regulatory logic of clustered-CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) boundaries in vivo, interrogating their function at multiple levels: chromatin interactions, transcription and phenotypes. Individual CTCF binding site (CBS) deletions revealed that the characteristics of specific sites can outweigh other factors such as CBS number and orientation. Combined deletions demonstrated that CBSs cooperate redundantly and provide boundary robustness. We show that divergent CBS signatures are not strictly required for effective insulation and that chromatin loops formed by nonconvergently oriented sites could be mediated by a loop interference mechanism. Further, we observe that insulation strength constitutes a quantitative modulator of gene expression and phenotypes. Our results highlight the modular nature of boundaries and their control over developmental processes.

### Capturing pairwise and multi-way chromosomal conformations using chromosomal walks [^b046a625]. Nature (2016). Excellent credibility.

Chromosomes are folded into highly compacted structures to accommodate physical constraints within nuclei and to regulate access to genomic information. Recently, global mapping of pairwise contacts showed that loops anchoring topological domains (TADs) are highly conserved between cell types and species. Whether pairwise loops synergize to form higher-order structures is still unclear. Here we develop a conformation capture assay to study higher-order organization using chromosomal walks (C-walks) that link multiple genomic loci together into proximity chains in human and mouse cells. This approach captures chromosomal structure at varying scales. Inter-chromosomal contacts constitute only 7–10% of the pairs and are restricted by interfacing TADs. About half of the C-walks stay within one chromosome, and almost half of those are restricted to intra-TAD spaces. C-walks that couple 2–4 TADs indicate stochastic associations between transcriptionally active, early replicating loci. Targeted analysis of thousands of 3-walks anchored at highly expressed genes support pairwise, rather than hub-like, chromosomal topology at active loci. Polycomb-repressed Hox domains are shown by the same approach to enrich for synergistic hubs. Together, the data indicate that chromosomal territories, TADs, and intra-TAD loops are primarily driven by nested, possibly dynamic, pairwise contacts.

### Onabotulinumtoxina (Botox cosmetic) [^440dda01]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 4:

For simultaneous treatment with lateral canthal lines, the total dose is 64 Units, comprised of 20 Units for forehead lines, 20 Units for glabellar lines, and 24 Units for lateral canthal lines (see Lateral Canthal Lines Administration and Figures 2 and 3).

Platysma Bands

Using an appropriately sized sterile syringe, needle, and aseptic technique, inject 2 Units (0.05 mL) of reconstituted BOTOX Cosmetic into 4 sites in the upper segment of platysma muscle, below the jawline on each side. For each side, administer the 4 jawline injections to the upper platysma muscle approximately 1 to 2 cm inferior and parallel to the lower mandibular border. Ensure the anterior injection site is in line with the oral commissure, and the posterior injection is slightly anterior to the angle of the mandible. Administer the remaining 2 injections equidistant (approximately 1 to 2 cm apart) between the anterior and posterior injection points (see Figures 5 and 6).

In addition, inject 1 Unit (0.025 mL) of reconstituted BOTOX Cosmetic into 5 sites along each vertical neck band, 1 to 2 vertical neck bands per side. For each vertical neck band identified, 1 to 2 per side, distribute 5 injections vertically approximately 1 to 2 cm apart (see Figures 5 and 6). Ensure the most superior injection site is approximately 1 to 2 cm inferior to the jawline injections.

Depending on platysma band severity, the total dose may be 26 Units (1 band/side), 31 Units (1 band one side, 2 bands other side), or 36 Units (2 bands/side) (see Table 4 and Figures 5 and 6 below).

Administer all platysma muscle injections superficially and intramuscularly with the needle perpendicular to the surface of the skin. For vertical neck band injections, identify each band while the patient is contracting their platysma. Gently pinch the band to isolate the muscle from nearby anatomical structures during administration (see Table 4).

To reduce injection-related complications, administer injection at least 1 cm inferior to the lower mandibular border. Do not inject into structures deep to the platysma muscle, particularly in the anterior region of the neck.

### Meiotic chromosome structures constrain and respond to designation of crossover sites [^3d4d3985]. Nature (2013). Excellent credibility.

Crossover recombination events between homologous chromosomes are required to form chiasmata, temporary connections between homologues that ensure their proper segregation at meiosis I. Despite this requirement for crossovers and an excess of the double-strand DNA breaks that are the initiating events for meiotic recombination, most organisms make very few crossovers per chromosome pair. Moreover, crossovers tend to inhibit the formation of other crossovers nearby on the same chromosome pair, a poorly understood phenomenon known as crossover interference. Here we show that the synaptonemal complex, a meiosis-specific structure that assembles between aligned homologous chromosomes, both constrains and is altered by crossover recombination events. Using a cytological marker of crossover sites in Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that partial depletion of the synaptonemal complex central region proteins attenuates crossover interference, increasing crossovers and reducing the effective distance over which interference operates, indicating that synaptonemal complex proteins limit crossovers. Moreover, we show that crossovers are associated with a local 0.4–0.5-micrometre increase in chromosome axis length. We propose that meiotic crossover regulation operates as a self-limiting system in which meiotic chromosome structures establish an environment that promotes crossover formation, which in turn alters chromosome structure to inhibit other crossovers at additional sites.

### Relationships between intra-spinal resting-state functional connectivity and electrophysiology following spinal cord injury [^52129d86]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

3.6 Relationship Between Changes inCoherence andAfter Injury

We plotted broadband LFP coherence against rsFC r values for all six ROI pairs across all pre‐ and post‐injury time points and examined the correlative relationship between these two measures of functional connectivity (Figure 5). Figure 5A–F display the trends of LFP and rsFC for each of the six ROI pairs. The overall trend of connectivity changes between V‐D horns on the lesion side differed from the rest of the ROI pairs. The correlation between correlation coefficients of rsFC and LFP coherences was r = 0.52 when two outliers (V‐V and D‐V on the lesion side) were excluded in the analysis (Figure 5G, H). Standard statistical diagnostics were performed using GraphPad Prism (iterative Grubbs' test, alpha = 0.2) to identify outliers. The results indicate that changes in LFP and rsfMRI connectivity showed a trend toward correlation, but the relationship did not reach statistical significance (r = 0.52, p = 0.057).

FIGURE 5
Relationship between broadband LFP coherence and rsFC across six ROI pairs in the C5 segment. (A–F) Line plots show the rsFC r values (blue) and LFP coherence (orange) across different time points for each of the six ROI pairs. (G, H) Scatter plots display LFP coherence versus rsFC values across all ROI pairs: (G) includes pre‐ and post‐injury time points (Post‐SCI 1 and Post‐SCI 2 with data from 3 and 6 months, respectively), while (H) shows the same data with two outliers removed. Outliers selected using GraphPad Prism iterative Grubbs' test (alpha = 0.2; V‐V and D‐V on the lesion side, marked as red dots in G). Blue lines represent power law fits. Pearson correlation coefficients (r) and p ‐values are reported. The total number of data points is 16 in (G) and 14 in (H).

The two missing data points in Figure 5G, H are attributed to the "dead space" at the tip of the linear electrode array used in this study. In some sessions, the electrode could not sample LFPs from the ventral horn because of placement constraints or anatomical variability. This issue is also evident in Figure 5B, D, where no LFP coherence was obtained at the Post‐SCI 1 time point.

Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Magnetic resonance defecography (MRD) reference lines — pubococcygeal line (PCL) standardization and mid-pubic line (MPL) status are as follows: The PCL should be the used as the point of reference to quantify the prolapse of organs in all compartments of the pelvic floor (Degree of consensus: 89%), and on MRD the PCL should be defined as a line connecting the inferior edge of the pubic symphysis to the last coccygeal joint, not the coccygeal tip (Degree of consensus: 74%). The PCL is the most widely used reference line and has higher interobserver agreement than other landmarks; it is drawn on sagittal images from the inferior point of the pubic symphysis to the last coccygeal joint, and organ positions can then be measured in centimeters using lines drawn perpendicular to the PCL at rest and defecation to allow grading of prolapse. Experts proposed the PCL as most appropriate because it is not influenced by pelvic tilt and thus may be more reliably reproducible among centers, and it has shown good correlation with clinical examination for anterior and apical compartment prolapse. The mid-pubic line, drawn through the long axis of the pubic symphysis, was considered but not recommended because of higher reported inter- and intraobserver variability, and although its use can yield a higher observed frequency of posterior compartment prolapse than the PCL in asymptomatic women, this was felt to be of uncertain significance. The consortium experts agreed that prolapse in anterior (cystocele), apical (vaginal/uterine prolapse), and posterior compartments should be described and quantified to help clinicians consider the appropriate surgical options.

### Increased capillary branching contributes to angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker (ARB)-induced regression of sclerosis [^d78bc7ae]. The American Journal of Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is characterized by progressive glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. High-dose angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor can induce regression of existing glomerulosclerosis, at least in part by decreasing matrix accumulation. However, the potential mechanisms of remodeling of capillary loops remain obscure. This study aimed to determine whether capillary branching was augmented in glomeruli with ARB-induced regression of sclerosis. Three-dimensional confocal images were assessed by graph theory analysis to explore the topology of the glomerular capillary network. Compared with normal glomeruli, glomeruli of rats with progressive sclerosis were enlarged but had a significantly reduced number of capillary segments and capillary branch points and decreased complexity of the glomerular network. In contrast, in rats with regression of sclerosis induced by ARB, glomerular enlargement was due to a significantly increased number of glomerular capillary segments and capillary branch points and restored complexity of the capillary network. These data support the theory that capillary growth contributes to regression of sclerosis and is mediated at least in part by ARB-induced increased complexity and branching of capillary segments.

### Medial packing and elastic asymmetry stabilize the double-gyroid in block copolymers [^f3b7e627]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Strong segregation theory of the hexagonal columnar phase

To compute the SST free energy of the competitor Hex phase we use the method of ref. which considers a variable class of IMDS shapes — intermediate to circular and hexagonal shapes — and corresponding space-filling (so-called kinked-path) chain trajectories chain trajectories within domains. Complete details and subdomain packing analysis provided in Supplementary Note 6.

Finite segregation strength self-consistent field calculations

Self-consistent field (SCF) calculations of Lam, Hex and DG phases are done using the PSCF code as described in ref. Distributions of the free end junctions are computed from the SCF segment distribution functions as detailed in Supplementary Note 9. As detailed in Supplementary Note 8, the tilt of the chain trajectories is computed from the (polar) order parameter at the IMDS (i.e. regions composed equally of equal parts A and B segments), which is computed from spatial gradients of segment distribution functions as described in ref.

IDMS shape analysis

For the IMDS shape analysis, we adapted methods for calculating smooth approximations to curvature on a discrete meshes based on least-squares fitting of well-behaved quadric surfaces to small surface patches. The quadric surface fits provide for smooth evaluations of curvature that are local to each surface patch. We obtain a global curvature distribution by stitching together the collection of surface patches, averaging over individual patch curvature evaluations at the intersection of multiple patches. This algorithm also provides a route to smoothing over rough meshes, such as those that appear in the skeletal SST construction. This algorithm is described in detail in Supplementary Note 7 A. To construct the "band diagrams," we specify a set of cutting planes and find their intersections with a given meshed surface, yielding curved paths on the surface. We then identify the mesh edges that intersect each plane and use linear interpolation to evaluate vertex- or face-addressed data at the location where each edge intersects with a plane. This method is outlined in Supplementary Note 7 B.

End-exclusion zone corrected free energies

End-exclusion zone (EEZ) corrections to the parabolic brush theory calculations of chain stretching free energy, which are described in Supplementary Note 10, were found using the results of. We incorporated a look-up table and interpolation tool available in the supplementary code of that reference (available at 10.7275/rtvx-h237) to adjust the stretching free energy for each wedge in our medial SST calculations.

### Sex differences in brain connectivity and male vulnerability in very preterm children [^65a18085]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Medium credibility.

To estimate neuromagnetic activity originating from the cerebral cortex all 76 cortical regions of interests (ROIs) were selected from the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas (Tzourio‐Mazoyer et al. 2002). Each brain region was represented by one seed computed as the center of mass, under an extra condition that the center is within the given region. MEG data were band‐pass filtered from 1 to 150 Hz to remove low‐frequency drifts and ultra‐high frequencies. Then, for each pair of brain regions, we applied a multiple constrained minimum variance (MCMV) beamformer to estimate neuromagnetic activity at two selected locations (Moiseev, Gaspar, Schneider, & Herdman, 2011). The main advantage of such approach is that it computes a unique inverse solution for each source pair nulling the contribution of one source onto another and alleviating a signal leakage (Moiseev et al. 2011).

2.6 Connectivity and statistical analysis

Functional connectivity is often quantified in terms of coordinated phases of neural dynamics reconstructed at spatially distinctive locations (Vakorin & Doesburg, 2016). In our case, for each seed location, a complex wavelet decomposition was applied for each segment to estimate phase dynamics for each epoch at 50 frequency points equally spaced on a logarithmic scale from 4 to 50 Hz (Flandrin, Auger, Gonçalvès, & Lemoine, 1996). More specifically, to estimate MEG functional connectivity, we calculated the phase‐locking value (PLV; Lachaux, Rodriguez, Martinerie, & Varela, 1999), a measure which quantifies stability of phase differences across time, for each pair of reconstructed neuromagnetic dynamics at each frequency point. PLV values were subsequently averaged across epochs for each source pair.

### Evaluating brain parcellations using the distance-controlled boundary coefficient [^ab861d6b]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

One important approach to human brain mapping is to define a set of distinct regions that can be linked to unique functions. Numerous brain parcellations have been proposed, using cytoarchitectonic, structural, or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The intrinsic smoothness of brain data, however, poses a problem for current methods seeking to compare different parcellations. For example, criteria that simply compare within-parcel to between-parcel similarity provide even random parcellations with a high value. Furthermore, the evaluation is biased by the spatial scale of the parcellation. To address this problem, we propose the distance-controlled boundary coefficient (DCBC), an unbiased criterion to evaluate discrete parcellations. We employ this new criterion to evaluate existing parcellations of the human neocortex in their power to predict functional boundaries for an fMRI data set with many different tasks, as well as for resting-state data. We find that common anatomical parcellations do not perform better than chance, suggesting that task-based functional boundaries do not align well with sulcal landmarks. Parcellations based on resting-state fMRI data perform well; in some cases, as well as a parcellation defined on the evaluation data itself. Finally, multi-modal parcellations that combine functional and anatomical criteria perform substantially worse than those based on functional data alone, indicating that functionally homogeneous regions often span major anatomical landmarks. Overall, the DCBC advances the field of functional brain mapping by providing an unbiased metric that compares the predictive ability of different brain parcellations to define brain regions that are functionally maximally distinct.

### Feasibility of using the marginal blood vessels as reference landmarks for CT colonography [^6621cd41]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to show the spatial relationship of the colonic marginal blood vessels and the teniae coli on CT colonography (CTC) and the use of the marginal blood vessels for supine-prone registration of polyps and for determination of proper connectivity of collapsed colonic segments.

Materials and Methods

We manually labeled the marginal blood vessels on 15 CTC examinations. Colon segmentation, centerline extraction, teniae detection, and teniae identification were automatically performed. For assessment of their spatial relationships, the distances from the marginal blood vessels to the three teniae coli and to the colon were measured. Student t tests (paired, two-tailed) were performed to evaluate the differences among these distances. To evaluate the reliability of the marginal vessels as reference points for polyp correlation, we analyzed 20 polyps from 20 additional patients who underwent supine and prone CTC. The average difference of the circumferential polyp position on the supine and prone scans was computed. Student t tests (paired, two-tailed) were performed to evaluate the supine-prone differences of the distance. We performed a study on 10 CTC studies from 10 patients with collapsed colonic segments by manually tracing the marginal blood vessels near the collapsed regions to resolve the ambiguity of the colon path.

Results

The average distances (± SD) from the marginal blood vessels to the tenia mesocolica, tenia omentalis, and tenia libera were 20.1 ± 3.1 mm (95% CI, 18.5–21.6 mm), 39.5 ± 4.8 mm (37.1–42.0 mm), and 36.9 ± 4.2 mm (34.8–39.1 mm), respectively. Pairwise comparison showed that these distances to the tenia libera and tenia omentalis were significantly different from the distance to the tenia mesocolica (p < 0.001). The average distance from the marginal blood vessels to the colon wall was 15.3 ± 2.0 mm (14.2–16.3 mm). For polyp localization, the average difference of the circumferential polyp position on the supine and prone scans was 9.6 ± 9.4 mm (5.5–13.7 mm) (p = 0.15) and expressed as a percentage of the colon circumference was 3.1% ± 2.0% (2.3–4.0%) (p = 0.83). We were able to trace the marginal blood vessels for 10 collapsed colonic segments and determine the paths of the colon in these regions.

Conclusion

The marginal blood vessels run parallel to the colon in proximity to the tenia mesocolica and enable accurate supine-prone registration of polyps and localization of the colon path in areas of collapse. Thus, the marginal blood vessels may be used as reference landmarks complementary to the colon centerline and teniae coli.

### Voxel volume overlap: voxel-size sensitive indicators of subject motion in functional MRI [^5d16f703]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

When calculating subject motion, it is important to be precise about the respective reference frame. If motion is calculated w.r.t. the first image in a timeseries, this measure is known as total displacement (TD). It describes how far away from the original position a subject moved in the course of the session. This, however, is not necessarily the most relevant measure, as slow movements are more easily accounted for than rapid motion spikes (Maknojia et al.). For the latter in particular, scan‐to‐scan displacement (STS) is more relevant, which uses the individually preceding volume as the reference frame. The way these two indicators are calculated is similar, using a 3D expansion of Pythagoras theorem (Wilke) to calculate the joint displacement resulting from all shifts and all rotations.

2.1 Open Questions

While it is trivial to estimate the volumetric effects of simple shifts (see example in the introduction), it is far from trivial to account for rotations as there is a multitude of possible rotatory effects, and their combinations, on a 3D volume. Computing the exact overlap between two arbitrarily‐rotated cubic volumes, therefore, is mathematically highly challenging. However, while no elegant algebraic solution exists, it is possible to assess the overlap by using a geometric approach. Here, the reference voxel is defined as the intersection of six planar boundaries, with each plane dividing space into two categories: "definitely outside" and "potentially inside"; the intersection of all "potentially inside" volumes then unequivocally defines the cube. For example, consider a dice on a table and its top surface showing, for example, "1". Everything above that surface is outside of the dice, while everything below may be inside. The lower (opposite) surface will then be defined by the face of the dice showing "6", which in our example is facing the table. Again, everything below that surface is outside. Repeating this process of exclusion with the "4 & 3" and the "2 & 5" faces will unequivocally define the space, and hence, the volume of the dice. The intersection of a moved cube with a reference cube can therefore be calculated by iteratively looping over all six planes (of the reference cube) and by therewith removing all "definitely outside" sections (of the moved cube). The remaining part constitutes the overlapping remnant of the moved cube, the volume of which can then be computed.

### Precise segmentation of densely interweaving neuron clusters using G-cut [^fc0f2561]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Evaluation of G-Cut accuracy with simulated neuron clusters

To our knowledge, only two other algorithms have been proposed to address the challenge of multi-neuron reconstruction. One is TREES toolbox, which uses a growth competition algorithm to reconstruct multiple neurons with minimum wiring cost. Another method, NeuroGPS-Tree locates neuronal cell bodiesand uses statistical distribution of several biological features to determine break points between bridged neurons. Although these two algorithms can reconstruct individual neurons from a neuron cluster, they have several limitations for reconstructing densely interweaving neurons. Output of TREES toolbox is highly parameterization dependent. Both TREES toolbox and NeuroGPS-Tree rely on local morphological features and are therefore unable to determine the most probable partition in the entire connected graph.

To systematically evaluate the accuracy of G-Cut and compare it with NeuroGPS-Tree and TREES toolbox, we investigated the accuracy of all three methods with respect to two characteristics of a neuron cluster: cluster scale and degree of inter-neuron entanglement. Cluster scale refers to the number of neurons in a cluster. Cluster degree of entanglement is represented by the number of spurious links bridging proximal neurons. Both characteristics change with experimental protocols (e.g. volume of the tissue, density of neuronal labeling, etc.) and influence the difficulty of the segmentation problem. We created two large synthetic datasets of simulated neuron clusters of varying scale and degree of entanglement, respectively, using reconstructed single neurons hosted on NeuroMorpho. Org. Briefly, single neurons were randomly placed in space, where any pair of branches in close proximity was subsequently connected, bridging neurons into a cluster (Fig. 4, Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2). This allowed the rapid evaluation of the outcomes of each algorithm against an established ground truth. We measured the accuracy of neuron segmentation results with the Miss-Extra-Scores (MES), which quantifies topological resemblance between segmented and ground truth neurons.

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^ff4cd5db]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society and Fleischner Society joint workshop — quantitative lung imaging overview describes that quantitative analysis of functional and structural lung imaging complements traditional visual assessment for enhancing understanding and for diagnosis and monitoring, that structural features such as airway dimensions and branching patterns can be quantified and parenchyma evaluated by threshold, histogram, morphological and textural patterns, and that functional imaging with computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission CT (SPECT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses endogenous molecules, contrast agents, or radioactive isotopes to assess airway mechanics and regional ventilation and perfusion. Volumetric CT is routinely used to render three-dimensional (3D) maps of lung structures and combined with PET to obtain functional data; beyond visual assessment, quantitative imaging (QI) endpoints could be used in clinical trials to identify anatomical and physiological phenotypes; and intravenous iodine and dual-energy CT (DECT) are used to separate blood and tissue volumes. Coregistered landmarks on paired images obtained at different lung volumes are used to infer regional air trapping, lung compliance, and deformation; MRI using ultrashort-echo time (UTE) sequences improves signal detection from parenchyma; contrast agents including oxygen and hyperpolarized noble gases are used to deduce physiological processes; and Proton MRI is used to measure regional perfusion and ventilation-perfusion ratio. Major challenges cited include technical and analytical standardization across modalities and platforms, effects of differing lung inflation states, image acquisition, segmentation and measurement techniques, quality of training data, lack of gold standards for validation, and the need to verify imaging-based interpretations against physiological and clinical outcomes.

Diagnostic catheter selection for mapping — Catheters with a smaller French size and fewer electrodes are more flexible, exert lower axial force, and may carry a lower risk of perforation, but should perhaps be avoided because of difficulty maintaining stable catheter position. Catheters with more electrodes can facilitate rapid recognition of arrhythmia activation patterns and are particularly beneficial at sites such as the coronary sinus. Smaller electrodes and narrower interelectrode spacing detect a more local activation signal and can provide more precise activation mapping, but may be less maneuverable, and activation confined to a small structure or circuit may be difficult to localize with narrow electrode spacing. The field of signal detection can be increased by wider electrode spacing or reconfiguring electrode pairing, but with a wider field of view, anatomical localization is decreased. Specialized configurations such as circular/ring, basket, or star-shaped catheters can enable rapid deciphering of activation patterns even with a paucity of arrhythmia, and the number of catheters and recording sites should be adequate to meet procedural end points without causing vascular damage, obstruction, or intracardiac entanglement.

### Sequential stacking link prediction algorithms for temporal networks [^ea69988e]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Link prediction algorithms are indispensable tools in many scientific applications by speeding up network data collection and imputing missing connections. However, in many systems, links change over time and it remains unclear how to optimally exploit such temporal information for link predictions in such networks. Here, we show that many temporal topological features, in addition to having high computational cost, are less accurate in temporal link prediction than sequentially stacked static network features. This sequential stacking link prediction method uses 41 static network features that avoid detailed feature engineering choices and is capable of learning a highly accurate predictive distribution of future connections from historical data. We demonstrate that this algorithm works well for both partially observed and completely unobserved target layers, and on two temporal stochastic block models achieves near-oracle-level performance when combined with other single predictor methods as an ensemble learning method. Finally, we empirically illustrate that stacking multiple predictive methods together further improves performance on 19 real-world temporal networks from different domains.

### Dynamic patterns of functional connectivity in the human brain underlie individual memory formation [^b6c539fd]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

block of random data, as the cross-correlation functionnormalized by the mean and standard deviation of R overall:

We then averaged the estimates of the coupling function W (τ) across the randomly selected data blocks. Electrodes that exhibit consistent delays when computing the cross-correlation of their time series will exhibit an average cross-correlation function with a robust peak. Hence, the maximum value of the averaged coupling function, W max, provides a measure of how consistently correlations between the two signals are time-locked at their associated time delay (τ max) relative to all other delays (Fig. 1d). Using these W max and τ max values for every electrode pair, we also calculated the widely used CI to characterize the sharpness of the peak in the coupling profile. We operationalized the CI as the normalized full width at half the maximum area under the curve of the dominant peak (Fig. 1d).

To examine dynamic communication between brain regions, we identified functionally connected pairs of electrodes by examining the coupling function for each electrode pair. We identified the effective functional connections that exhibit robust cross-correlations at a preferred and a relatively fixed time lag based on the following thresholding heuristic. We fit the distributions of W max and CI from all available electrode pairs with a mixture of two Gaussians. We defined a knee point that occurs between the two means and used that value as the threshold for connected vs unconnected pairs(see Fig. 1e for an example). We also removed all electrode pairs where the W max occurred with zero time delay, τ max = 0 since these functional connections can arise spuriously, for example, due to volume conduction(see Supplementary Fig. S14 for results after inclusion of these electrode pairs). To capture electrode pairs that are reliably functionally connected across time, we further selected electrode pairs only if they met thresholding criteria across all sessions for each participant, which were often recorded hours or days apart (Supplementary Table S3). In this manner, we identified functionally connected electrode pairs that show a high coupling value, W max, with a consistent and preferred time delay, τ max. To understand which frequencies may be involved in functional connectivity, we computed the spectral coherence for each identified pair over the task period (Fig. 1f). We also identified the broad anatomic regions involved in each electrode pair to understand how these functionally connected electrode pairs are distributed across brain regions (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Table S4, and Supplementary Fig. S11).

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^347703fb]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society and Fleischner Society joint workshop — quantitative imaging (QI) for pulmonary pathophysiology summarizes fundamental "good practice" stereological principles, evaluates technical capabilities and limitations of imaging modalities, and assesses major QI endpoints to link structure to function in lung disease. Volumetric computed tomography (CT) renders three-dimensional maps and may be combined with positron emission tomography (PET) to obtain dynamic physiological data, while magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using ultrashort-echo time (UTE) sequences has improved signal detection from lung parenchyma; contrast agents are used to deduce airway function, ventilation–perfusion–diffusion, and mechanics, and proton MRI can measure regional ventilation-perfusion ratio. QI-derived endpoints include air–blood–tissue volume partition, bronchovascular remodeling, emphysema, fibrosis, and textural patterns indicating architectural alteration; coregistered landmarks on paired images at different lung volumes are used to infer airway caliber, air trapping, gas and blood transport, compliance, and deformation. The goal is to promote unbiased quantification and interpretation of in vivo imaging data, compare metrics obtained using different QI modalities to ensure accurate and reproducible metric derivation, avoid misrepresentation of inferred physiological processes, and emphasize imaging-based computational modeling, with principles described as critical for all forms of QI irrespective of acquisition modality or disease entity.
