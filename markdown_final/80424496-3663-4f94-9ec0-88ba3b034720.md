## Question

Is the CAT used to screen for COPD?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) is used as a screening tool for COPD. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "screening" means in guideline terms and who it applies to. Then, I should verify how authoritative sources (USPSTF, GOLD, ACP/ACCP/ATS/ERS) position screening for COPD. Next, I will check where the CAT is placed in the COPD care pathway (screening vs symptom assessment). After that, I'll contrast the CAT with actual COPD screening instruments mentioned in the literature. Finally, I'll synthesize a clear conclusion and note practical implications for case finding and diagnosis [^111TqToy] [^113eVjqR] [^115AHYBD] [^116iPKqM] [^114dqZmo].

> Let me first confirm the definition and scope of screening so I don't misclassify the CAT. Screening refers to applying a test to asymptomatic adults who do not recognize or report respiratory symptoms to identify those who might have disease and warrant diagnostic work-up, and the USPSTF explicitly evaluated COPD screening in this population and context [^111TqToy] [^113gDXhw].

> Next, I should review where the CAT sits in guidelines. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — people sometimes use "questionnaire" generically. The CAT is consistently described as a patient-reported measure of symptom burden/health status used after COPD is suspected or diagnosed to stratify severity and guide management grouping (e.g., the A–B–E framework relies on instruments like mMRC and CAT to classify symptom level), not as a population screening tool for undiagnosed COPD [^114dqZmo] [^111szwkx] [^112FyEAf].

> Now, I need to check authoritative screening recommendations. The USPSTF recommends against screening asymptomatic adults for COPD (D recommendation), concluding there is no net benefit; this has been reaffirmed and is consistent with prior statements [^111TqToy] [^113gDXhw]. In parallel, GOLD emphasizes that spirometry is required to establish the diagnosis and does not endorse screening asymptomatic individuals; rather, it supports case-finding in those with symptoms and/or risk factors, again anchoring diagnostic confirmation on post-bronchodilator spirometry [^113eVjqR] [^115AHYBD]. I should also confirm consistency across other societies — ACP/ACCP/ATS/ERS similarly recommend not using spirometry for screening of asymptomatic adults, reinforcing the same principle [^116iPKqM] [^116mVi1y].

> But wait, what if there are questionnaires actually intended for screening? Let me double-check. When screening tools are discussed, the literature and contemporary commentaries refer to instruments like CAPTURE and COPD-SQ for identifying high-risk individuals who might merit further testing, whereas the CAT does not appear on that list, underscoring its different purpose in symptom assessment rather than screening [^114FgjLb] [^113VYEYi].

> Hmm, wait a minute — I initially wondered if some clinics might have repurposed the CAT for quick case-finding in primary care. Hold on, I should verify that with the sources. I don't see guideline or trial evidence positioning CAT as a screening instrument; instead, every guideline touchpoint places it in the symptom/severity assessment domain after COPD is suspected/established, while diagnostic confirmation still hinges on spirometry and screening of asymptomatic adults is discouraged [^113eVjqR] [^112FyEAf] [^111TqToy].

> Pulling this together, the CAT is not used to screen for COPD; it is used to quantify symptom burden and health status in patients with known or suspected COPD to inform grouping and management, whereas screening asymptomatic adults is not recommended and, when case-finding is pursued in symptomatic or at-risk persons, other tools (e.g. CAPTURE, COPD-SQ) may be used as pre-spirometry filters but diagnosis requires spirometry confirmation [^114dqZmo] [^114FgjLb] [^113VYEYi] [^113eVjqR] [^111TqToy].

---

The CAT is a **validated, 8-item questionnaire** that quantifies COPD symptom burden and impact on daily life, with scores from 0 to 40. It is **not a diagnostic tool** [^113eVjqR] and should not be used to screen asymptomatic individuals; diagnosis requires post-bronchodilator spirometry (FEV₁/FVC < 0.70) [^111TqToy]. The CAT is recommended for routine monitoring to guide treatment and assess response, but it does not replace spirometry or imaging [^112FyEAf] [^113kCmXQ].

---

## Structure and scoring of the CAT

- **Items**: 8 (cough, sputum, chest tightness, breathlessness, activity limitation, confidence, sleep, energy)
- **Scoring**: 0–5 per item; total 0–40
- **Interpretation**: Higher scores = greater impact

| **Score range** | **Impact level** | **Clinical interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| 0–10 | Low | Minimal impact |
| 11–20 | Medium | Moderate impact |
| 21–30 | High | Severe impact |
| 31–40 | Very high | Very severe impact |

---

## Clinical utility of the CAT

The CAT is a **practical tool** for routine clinical use, providing a standardized measure of symptom burden and health status. It is **quick and easy to administer** and helps clinicians [^112FyEAf]:

- **Monitor symptoms**: Track changes over time [^113VuywN]
- **Guide treatment**: Inform therapy adjustments [^112FyEAf]
- **Assess response**: Evaluate interventions

---

## Limitations of the CAT

Despite its utility, the CAT has **important limitations**:

- **Not diagnostic**: Cannot confirm COPD; spirometry is required [^113eVjqR]
- **Subjective**: Influenced by patient perception and comorbidities
- **Not for asymptomatic screening**: Should not be used in asymptomatic adults [^113gDXhw] [^111TqToy]

---

## Comparison with other screening tools

The CAT is **one of several tools** for COPD assessment [^111szwkx]:

| **Criterion** | **CAT** | **Spirometry** | **Chest CT** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Purpose | Symptom assessment [^111szwkx] | Diagnostic [^113eVjqR] | Imaging [^113kCmXQ] |
| Strengths | - Simple <br/> - Validated <br/> - Widely used | - Objective <br/> - Gold standard [^114SZhXd] | Detailed lung structure |
| Limitations | - Not diagnostic <br/> - Subjective | Requires equipment/training | - Expensive <br/> - Radiation exposure |

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines **emphasize the CAT's role** in monitoring and management. According to **GOLD 2025**, using the CAT to assess symptom burden and guide therapy is recommended [^112FyEAf], whereas **USPSTF 2022** advises against screening asymptomatic adults for COPD [^113gDXhw] [^111TqToy].

---

## Impact on patient outcomes

The CAT can **improve outcomes** by enabling early detection of worsening symptoms and guiding targeted therapy adjustments. It also enhances patient engagement and supports self-management.

---

## Practical considerations for implementation

Effective use of the CAT requires **clinician training** in administration and interpretation, as well as integration into clinical workflows. Patient education is also essential to explain its purpose and importance [^113VuywN].

---

The CAT is a **useful tool** for assessing symptom burden and guiding management in COPD, but it is not diagnostic [^113eVjqR] and should not be used to screen asymptomatic individuals [^111TqToy]. It complements spirometry and imaging in comprehensive care [^113kCmXQ].

### Screening for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: US Preventive Services Task Force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^111TqToy]. JAMA (2022). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an irreversible reduction of airflow in the lungs. Progression to severe disease can prevent participation in normal activities because of deterioration of lung function. In 2020, it was estimated that approximately 6% of US adults had been diagnosed with COPD. Chronic lower respiratory disease, composed mainly of COPD, is the sixth leading cause of death in the US.

- **Objective**: To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a reaffirmation evidence update that focused on targeted key questions for benefits and harms of screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults and treatment in screen-detected or screen-relevant adults.

- **Population**: Asymptomatic adults who do not recognize or report respiratory symptoms.

- **Evidence assessment**: Using a reaffirmation process, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults has no net benefit.

- **Recommendation**: The USPSTF recommends against screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults. (D recommendation)

### The guideline approach to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: how effective [^113PuaLq]. Respiratory Care (2003). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines are systematically developed to assist health care decisions in specific clinical circumstances. They first arose to improve quality of care by decreasing unexplained practice variation, controlling health care costs, fostering evidence-based decision-making, and accelerating the application of new advances in medical science to everyday practice. Unfortunately, multiple studies demonstrate incomplete and varied effectiveness of clinical practice guidelines in altering clinician behavior and improving patient outcomes. Efforts to enhance guideline effectiveness have focused on improving the methods for guideline development, diffusion, dissemination, and implementation. Despite evidence of limited effectiveness, more than 40 clinical practice guidelines pertaining to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have been published since 1985. The present article reviews those guidelines, evidence for their effectiveness, and approaches to improve their implementation.

An official American Thoracic Society/Japanese Respiratory Society clinical practice guideline [^115uTgz6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Recommendations regarding key aspects related to the diagnosis and pharmacological treatment of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) were recently published. We now provide additional recommendations regarding four specific questions related to the diagnosis of LAM and management of pneumothoraces in patients with LAM.

- **Methods**: Systematic reviews were performed and then discussed by a multidisciplinary panel. For each intervention, the panel considered its confidence in the estimated effects, the balance of desirable (i.e. benefits) and undesirable (i.e. harms and burdens) consequences, patient values and preferences, cost, and feasibility. Evidence-based recommendations were then formulated, written, and graded using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach.

- **Results**: For women who have cystic changes on high-resolution computed tomography of the chest characteristic of LAM but who have no additional confirmatory features of LAM (i.e. clinical, radiologic, or serologic), the guideline panel made conditional recommendations against making a clinical diagnosis of LAM based on the high-resolution computed tomography findings alone and for considering transbronchial lung biopsy as a diagnostic tool. The guideline panel also made conditional recommendations for offering pleurodesis after an initial pneumothorax rather than postponing the procedure until the first recurrence and against pleurodesis being used as a reason to exclude patients from lung transplantation.

Conclusions: Evidence-based recommendations for the management of LAM are available, providing guidance for clinicians in handling specific diagnostic and treatment considerations.

There is little direct evidence about the management of COVID-19 in people with COPD. Clinicians should maintain a high level of suspicion for COVID-19 in patients with COPD who present with new or worsening respiratory symptoms, fever, and/or any other symptoms that could be COVID-19 related, even if these are mild, and should test for SARS-CoV-2. Patients should continue taking their oral and inhaled respiratory medications for COPD as directed, as there is no evidence that these medications should be changed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Patient factors influencing respiratory-related clinician actions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease screening [^116ZgT9e]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to identify patient-related factors that may explain the increased likelihood of receiving a respiratory-related clinician action in patients identified to be at risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in a U.S.-based pragmatic study of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease screening.

- **Methods**: This post hoc analysis (conducted in 2014–2015) of the Screening, Evaluating and Assessing Rate Changes of Diagnosing Respiratory Conditions in Primary Care 1 (SEARCH1) study (conducted in 2010–2011) used the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Population Screener questionnaire in 112 primary care practices. Anyone with a previous chronic obstructive pulmonary disease diagnosis was excluded. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to assess patient factors associated with the likelihood of receiving a respiratory-related clinician action following positive screening.

- **Results**: Overall, 994 of 6,497 (15%) screened positive and were considered at risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, only 187 of the 994 patients (19%) who screened positive received a respiratory-related clinician action. The chances of receiving a respiratory-related clinician action were significantly increased in patients who visited their physician with a respiratory issue (p < 0.05) or had already been prescribed a respiratory medication (p < 0.05). Most (81%) patients who screened positive or had a respiratory-related clinician action had one or more comorbidity, including cardiovascular disease (68%), diabetes (30%), and depression/anxiety.

### Screening and early diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a population study [^113Qjo3w]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Although chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease leading to further morbidity and significant mortality, there is still limited data on screening for COPD. The purpose of this study was to establish an early COPD screening system for the community and hospitals in Nanshan District in Shenzhen City to improve the rate of early diagnosis and treatment of patients with COPD.

- **Methods**: We identified individuals at high risk of COPD using a questionnaire survey and analyzed the relevant influencing factors in the early stages of COPD in high-risk groups.

- **Results**: We collected a total of 5,000 COPD screening questionnaires, and 449 patients were diagnosed with COPD by pulmonary function examination. The prevalence of COPD in individuals aged 20 and above in Nanshan District of Shenzhen City was estimated to be 8.98% based on a sample size of 5,000. The severity classification as per the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria was: GOLD I accounted for 34.74%; GOLD II for 37.64%; GOLD III for 16.04%; and GOLD IV for 11.58%.

	- **Common features of early COPD included**:
	1. Patients were mainly males, accounting for 68.0%.
	2. COPD was prevalent among individuals aged 50–59 years, comprising 31% of cases.
	3. 96.0% of patients often had severe respiratory symptoms and frequent coughs when they did not have a cold.
	4. 57.2% of patients experienced shortness of breath when walking quickly on level ground or climbing gentle slopes.

### Emphysema: The review of radiological presentation and its clinical impact in the LDCT screening era [^1125GPh5]. Clinical Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Emphysema is one of three main lung pathologies in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), along with chronic bronchitis and small airway obstruction. The diagnosis is based on the detection of low attenuation areas in lung tissue on chest computed tomography (CT), either visually by a radiologist or automatically by the applied CT software.

Results of studies on the association between emphysema and lung cancer incidence are mixed. Many studies have demonstrated that chronic lung diseases, like COPD, are associated with lung cancer morbidity. There is also evidence that emphysema can be related to worse prognosis in patients with detected lung cancer.

In this review article, we aim to:

- **Summarize knowledge**: About emphysema detection and evaluation on CT, both quantitative and qualitative.

- **Summarize data**: On the correlation between emphysema and lung cancer, as well as its potential use in selecting patients who would most benefit from lung cancer screening.

### Chest X-rays in COPD screening: Are they worthwhile [^115WJnAo]. Respiratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The BTS/NICE COPD guideline recommends a chest X-ray at initial COPD evaluation; this is a grade D recommendation based on expert opinion. We have investigated which pathologies other than COPD are detected by chest X-ray and how they alter management.

Dundee smokers aged 40 or over and receiving bronchodilators are assessed for COPD by their practice nurse and offered a chest X-ray if there is no record of a chest X-ray within the previous three years. We retrospectively analyzed the chest X-ray reports and case records of these patients. The chest X-ray report was structured with seven specific questions, most importantly: "Are there any features of other disease likely to be causing dyspnoea?" and "Are there any features to suggest lung cancer?" Management of patients with chest X-ray findings suggesting other disease causing dyspnoea or lung cancer was assessed by questionnaire and case record study.

Five hundred forty-six consecutive chest X-ray reports were analyzed. Fourteen percent of all chest X-rays detected potentially treatable dyspnoea causing disease; where management following receipt of X-ray reports was audited, 84% were thought to help. Eleven lung cancers were detected, three had stage 1 disease. Considerable benign and malignant pathology is detected by chest X-ray performed at initial COPD assessment. Clinical management is changed in the majority with a potentially treatable abnormality. This evidence suggests that the NICE guideline to perform chest X-ray at initial COPD evaluation should be elevated from a grade D to grade C recommendation.

Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, the ACP 2011 guidelines recommend not to obtain spirometry for the screening of airflow obstruction in individuals without respiratory symptoms.

### Strategies for screening for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112cmA5u]. Respiratory Care (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is easily detected in its preclinical phase using office spirometry. Successful smoking cessation prevents further disease progression in most patients. Spirometry measures the ratio of the forced expiratory volume in the first second to the forced vital capacity (FEV₁/FVC), which is the most sensitive and specific test for detecting airflow limitation. Primary care practitioners see the majority of adult smokers, but few currently have spirometers or regularly order spirometry for their smoker patients. Improvements in spirometry software have made it much easier to obtain good quality spirometry test sessions, thereby reducing the misclassification rate. Respiratory therapists and pulmonary function technologists can help primary care practitioners select good office spirometers for identifying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and teach staff how to use spirometers correctly.

### Computed-tomography findings of emphysema: Correlation with spirometric values [^116ZA5o6]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

There is increasing interest in using multichannel computed-tomography scanning to characterize subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Three distinct components — emphysema, large-airway inflammation, and small-airway abnormality — have been evaluated using qualitative and quantitative approaches. Here, we highlight computed-tomography findings of COPD and their correlation with spirometric values.

Recent findings have revealed that a considerable percentage of subjects with emphysema detected by computed-tomography screening exhibit normal spirometry results. The severity of emphysema varies widely, even at the same disease stage in COPD. Studies of the relationship between high-resolution computed-tomography lung-attenuation measurements, acquired under spirometric control of inspiratory and expiratory lung volumes, and pulmonary function showed that inspiratory measurements assess the extent of emphysema, while expiratory measurements reflect airflow limitation and air trapping. Evaluations using three-dimensional computed tomography demonstrate that airflow limitation is more closely related to the dimensions of small airways than large airways.

Volumetric computed-tomography scans enable the diagnosis and quantification of individual small airway and emphysema phenotypes present in people with COPD. New computed-tomography scanning techniques should provide insights into further understanding the heterogeneity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

### Management of central airway obstruction: An American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^112YkoMX]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for central airway obstruction, specifically during initial evaluation, the ACCP 2025 guidelines recommend eliciting a comprehensive history and performing a physical examination focusing on the respiratory system. Additionally, obtaining a chest CT and appropriate laboratory investigations pertinent to non-malignant central airway obstruction (CAO) and preoperative assessment in patients with suspected CAO is advised.

### Ct imaging and comorbidities in COPD: Beyond lung cancer screening [^116nmoah]. Chest (2021). Low credibility.

Comorbidities significantly contribute to morbidity, mortality, and health-care costs in individuals with COPD. Comorbidity prevalence does not always correlate with lung disease severity, and the elevated risk of certain comorbidities is often independent of shared risk factors such as tobacco burden. Although COPD management guidelines recognize the importance of identifying and treating comorbidities as part of the comprehensive management of COPD patients, little guidance is provided regarding best screening practices. Whereas universal comorbidity screening in COPD patients is likely not cost-effective, targeted early screening and treatment in those at highest risk may have a significant impact on COPD outcomes. Recent studies suggest that certain radiographic features on thoracic imaging may serve as surrogate markers of comorbidity in patients with COPD. This review evaluates these studies in the context of the growing availability of chest CT scans in the lung cancer screening era and discusses how chest CT imaging can be leveraged to identify those COPD patients at highest risk for comorbid disease.

### VA/DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116mVi1y]. VA/DoD (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more specifically with respect to diagnosis, the DoD/VA 2021 guidelines recommend confirming the clinical diagnosis of COPD based on post-bronchodilator spirometry.

### Unmet need in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the Middle East and Africa region: An expert panel consensus [^115vgobm]. Respiratory Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has a significant impact on healthcare systems and health-related quality of life. The increased prevalence of smoking is an important factor contributing to the high burden of COPD in the Middle East and Africa (MEA). Several other factors, including a sedentary lifestyle, urbanization, second-hand smoke, air pollution, and occupational exposure, are also responsible for the upsurge of COPD in the MEA. Frequent COPD exacerbations accelerate disease progression, progressively deteriorate lung function, and negatively affect quality of life.

This consensus is based on a review of the published evidence, international and regional guidelines, and insights provided by expert committee members from the MEA region. Spirometry, though the gold standard for diagnosis, is often unavailable and/or underutilized, leading to underdiagnosis of COPD in primary care settings. Low adherence to treatment guidelines and delayed use of appropriate combination therapy, including triple therapy, are additional barriers to the management of COPD in the MEA.

Recognizing COPD as a screenable condition and developing easy and simple screening tools to facilitate early diagnosis is necessary. Knowledge of disease symptomatology at the patient and physician levels and adherence to international or regional guidelines are important to create awareness about the harmful effects of smoking and develop national guidelines focused on COPD prevention. Implementation of vaccination programs and pulmonary rehabilitation are equally valuable for managing patients with COPD.

### Spirometry for the diagnosis and management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114SZhXd]. Respiratory Care (2009). Low credibility.

Spirometric testing is one of the oldest clinical tests still in use today. It is a straightforward test that requires the patient to maximally exhale from total lung capacity. The key measurements include the forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV₁) and the maximum exhaled volume (vital capacity [VC]). However, the utility of spirometric testing depends heavily on the quality of equipment, patient cooperation, and the skill of the technician performing the test. Spirometry should therefore be considered a medical test and not simply a vital sign that can be performed by minimally trained personnel.

In obstructive lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), characteristic changes in spirometry include a reduction in the FEV₁ with respect to the vital capacity (FEV₁/VC ratio). This measurement can diagnose the presence and severity of airway obstruction, guide therapies, and predict outcomes. However, using spirometry to screen for obstructive lung disease can be problematic, and the effect of screening on outcomes has yet to be demonstrated.

### Chest CT signs in pulmonary disease: A pictorial review [^112ygy8A]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

CT scanning of the chest is one of the most important imaging modalities available to a pulmonologist. The advent of high-resolution CT scanning of the chest has led to its increasing use. Although chest radiographs are still useful as an initial test, their utility is limited in the diagnosis of lung diseases that depend on higher resolution images, such as interstitial lung diseases and pulmonary vascular diseases. Several metaphoric chest CT scan signs have been described, linking abnormal imaging patterns to lung diseases. Some of these are specific to a disease, whereas others help narrow the differential diagnosis. Recognizing these imaging patterns and CT scan signs is thus vitally important. In the present article, we describe a comprehensive list of the commonly encountered metaphoric chest CT scan signs and their clinical relevance.

### Issues in pulmonary function testing for the screening and diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113Bo2iE]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review article is to provide an up-to-date summary on the evidence for, or against the use of lung function tests as screening and diagnostic tools for airflow obstruction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and to consider the relevant issues in context.

- **Recent findings**: COPD is characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation with only partial reversibility on lung function testing. However, screening on a population basis or within an enriched 'at-risk' subset like chronic smokers is not supported by findings from previous epidemiological studies, screening trials, or in currently published clinical management guidelines by professional societies and review bodies. The definition of airflow obstruction and the classification of disease severity in COPD also differ slightly between guidelines and statements from different professional societies.

- **Summary**: Given the experience from previous screening trials and the controversial classification of airflow obstruction by severity, it is impossible to have accurate screening results for COPD based on lung function tests alone. Clinical respiratory symptoms should be taken into consideration in the diagnosis and management of COPD, as well as in any screening trial or program that is to be attempted or implemented.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: GOLD executive summary [^111szwkx]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a global health problem, and since 2001, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) has published its strategy document for the diagnosis and management of COPD. This executive summary presents the main contents of the second 5-year revision of the GOLD document that has implemented some of the vast knowledge about COPD accumulated over the last years.

Today, GOLD recommends that spirometry is required for the clinical diagnosis of COPD to avoid misdiagnosis and to ensure proper evaluation of severity of airflow limitation. The document highlights that the assessment of the patient with COPD should always include assessment of:

- **Symptoms**: Consideration of the patient's symptoms is essential.
- **Severity of airflow limitation**: This evaluates the extent of airflow obstruction.
- **History of exacerbations**: Understanding past exacerbations is crucial for risk assessment.
- **Comorbidities**: Identification and treatment of comorbidities must have a high priority.

The first three points can be used to evaluate the level of symptoms and risk of future exacerbations, and this is done in a way that splits patients with COPD into four categories — A, B, C, and D. Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of COPD match this assessment in an evidence-based attempt to relieve symptoms and reduce the risk of exacerbations. A separate section in the document addresses the management of comorbidities as well as COPD in the presence of comorbidities. The revised document also contains a new section on exacerbations of COPD.

The GOLD initiative will continue to bring COPD to the attention of all relevant shareholders and will hopefully inspire future national and local guidelines on management strategies.

### Screening and early diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A population study [^113VYEYi]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Materials and methods

Screening participants: We randomly selected six of the 79 social health centers in Shenzhen Nanshan District Medical Group for the study. There were regular scheduled consultations as well as unscheduled free consultations and talks. We distributed 5,000 copies of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease screening questionnaire (COPD-SQ) to permanent residents aged 20 years and above in Nanshan District of Shenzhen City through WeChat QR code scanning and on-site form-filling. In accordance with the principle of informed consent for clinical research, we obtained written informed consent from all participants. We obtained approval from the Ethics Committee of the hospital before the implementation of the project (Ethics approval number: 2022–107 (Shen)-01 K).

COPD-SQ design and identification of high-risk individuals with COPD: We developed the COPD Screening Questionnaire based on the criteria recommended by the Chinese Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COPD Disease (2021 Revised Edition) and the Guidelines for Primary Level Diagnosis and Treatment of COPD Disease (2018).

The questionnaire includes observation indicators such as age, smoking index, body mass index (BMI), respiratory symptoms (such as cough and dyspnea), family history of respiratory disease, and so on. These indicators were selected based on the criteria of high-risk groups of COPD as defined in the Guidelines for Primary Level Diagnosis and Treatment of COPD Disease (2018), and those with COPD-SQ scores ≥ 16 were designated as high-risk individuals.

### Diagnosis and treatment outcomes from prebronchodilator spirometry performed alongside lung cancer screening in a lung health check programme [^114hCEG5]. Thorax (2023). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a worldwide health problem that causes significant morbidity and mortality and shares the common risk factor of smoking with lung cancer. It is widely recognized that COPD is underdiagnosed, but screening for the disease in asymptomatic adults is not recommended by either the United Kingdom National Screening Committee or the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). In comparison, the most recent Global Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines advocate active case finding in individuals with symptoms and/or risk factors, alongside aggressive identification and management of coexisting comorbidities.

In the United Kingdom, several programmes have offered low-dose CT (LDCT) screening for lung cancer as part of a Lung Health Check (LHC), whereby a number of interventions (screening, prebronchodilator spirometry, smoking cessation) are offered as a bundle to improve lung health. Studies have reported between 10% and 20% of screening attendees having symptomatic undiagnosed airflow obstruction (AO) picked up by these programmes. However, there is limited evidence of subsequent downstream events, such as the proportion of individuals who undergo postbronchodilator spirometry as a formal diagnostic test for COPD. Only one study has reported treatment outcomes in this context, with 11% of individuals commencing new pharmacotherapy and 2% entering a pulmonary rehabilitation programme. Here, we present the downstream clinical assessment and management as a result of spirometry offered as part of an LHC in the Yor.

### A Research Agenda to Improve Outcomes in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Cardiovascular Disease: An Official American Thoracic Society Research Statement [^114dqZmo]. American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine (2024). Low credibility.

After some deliberation, the committee believed that the concept of COPD as a risk-enhancing factor was important. Because patients with COPD are so much more likely than the general population to develop atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the consensus was that screening and aggressive mitigation of atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk factors in the long term (cholesterol, blood pressure, etc) might improve outcomes. However, a definitive study has not demonstrated this. Given that this research statement is not intended to make clinical recommendations, the committee believed strongly that the statement should at least call for research to quantify the benefit of treating individuals with COPD and concomitant cardiovascular disease with aggressive risk factor control. Trials that examine cardiac risk screening and aggressive risk factor management strategy would likely strengthen the evidence in favor of treating COPD as a risk-enhancing factor and inform future iterations of clinical guidelines. Patients with COPD and cardiovascular disease should not be excluded from receiving guideline-directed primary and secondary prevention for cardiovascular disease.

A recent article in the Journal proposes a shift in the guideline-based paradigm of how to choose which inhalers to initiate first in stable patients with COPD. Instead of the 2023 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease paradigm of A-B-E classification by Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale score, COPD Assessment Test score, and number of exacerbations, the authors suggest adding a th

### Preventing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: What is known and what needs to be done to make a difference to the patient [^1122Przq]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable systemic disease with symptoms that overlap other respiratory illnesses. An estimated 24 million adults in the United States have COPD, but over 50% of them are misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. Spirometry remains the "gold standard" for diagnosing COPD and for monitoring the progression of the disease. Cigarette smoking is the main cause of COPD; therefore, smoking cessation is an integral component of any program to reduce COPD risk and delay or limit the progression of airflow obstruction. Influenza vaccinations will also reduce acute respiratory illness in patients with COPD. With increasing awareness of COPD and earlier diagnosis, implementation of treatment guidelines and smoking-cessation efforts may lead to more effective management of this disease, which is projected to be the third leading cause of death in the United States by 2020.

Approximately 30% of patients with SARS or MERS had persistent lung abnormalities and abnormal radiology consistent with fibrotic lung disease after their acute illness. There are not yet long-term studies on the follow-up of patients with COVID-19, nor recommendations for monitoring these patients; thus, the follow-up of patients with COPD who developed COVID-19 is still based on expert opinion and consensus. The intensity of the monitoring obviously depends on the severity of the COVID-19 episode.

- **Mild COVID-19 cases**: Patients should be followed with the usual protocols used for patients with COPD.

- **Moderate COVID-19 cases**: This includes hospitalization and pneumonia but no respiratory failure. These patients should be monitored more frequently and accurately than usual COPD patients, with particular attention to the need for oxygen therapy.

- **Persistent abnormality monitoring**: If chest X-ray abnormalities have not resolved at hospital discharge, a chest X-ray, and possibly a CT scan, should be considered at 6 months to 1 year. Complications occurring during or after the COVID-19 episode should also be monitored.

Patients with COPD are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19. Multimorbid survivors frequently have required prolonged ICU stays. Until we have evidence from prospective studies, survivors of severe COVID-19 with COPD should be considered at high risk of developing a "critical illness" or a "chronic critical illness", a severe heterogeneous condition linked not only to the acute infectious episode but also to the long-term management of their condition.

### Definition, epidemiology and natural history of COPD [^117MrZE5]. The European Respiratory Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fifth leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed world and represents a substantial economic and social burden. Patients experience a progressive deterioration up to end-stage COPD, characterized by very severe airflow limitation, severely limited and declining performance status with chronic respiratory failure, advanced age, multiple comorbidities, and severe systemic manifestations or complications. COPD is frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated.

Today, COPD develops earlier in life and is less gender specific. Tobacco smoking is the major risk factor for COPD, followed by occupation and air pollution. Severe deficiency of alpha(1)-antitrypsin is rare; several phenotypes are associated with elevated risk for COPD in the presence of risk factor exposure. Any patient presenting with cough, sputum production, or dyspnoea should be assessed by standardized spirometry.

Continued exposure to noxious agents promotes a more rapid decline in lung function and increases the risk for repeated exacerbations, eventually leading to end-stage disease. Without major efforts in prevention, there will be an increasing proportion of end-stage patients who can live longer through long-term oxygen therapy and assisted ventilation, but with elevated suffering and high costs. Smoking prevention and cessation are the most important epidemiological measures to counteract the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease epidemic.

### Screening and early diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a population study [^116jagQ8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Although chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease leading to further morbidity and significant mortality, there is still limited data on screening for COPD. The purpose of this study was to establish an early COPD screening system for the community and hospitals in the Nanshan District of Shenzhen City, aiming to improve the rate of early diagnosis and treatment of patients with COPD.

- **Methods**: We identified individuals at high risk of COPD using a questionnaire survey and analyzed the relevant influencing factors in the early stages of COPD in high-risk groups.

- **Results**: We collected a total of 5,000 COPD screening questionnaires, and 449 patients were diagnosed with COPD by pulmonary function examination. The prevalence of COPD in people aged 20 and above in Nanshan District of Shenzhen City was estimated to be 8.98%, based on a sample size of 5,000. The severity classification as per the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria was as follows: GOLD I accounted for 34.74%; GOLD II accounted for 37.64%; GOLD III accounted for 16.04%; and GOLD IV accounted for 11.58%. Common features of early COPD identified were:
	- Patients were mainly males, accounting for 68.0%.
	- COPD was common among people aged 50–59 years, comprising 31%.
	- 96.0% of patients often had severe respiratory symptoms and frequent coughs when they did not have a cold.
	- 57.2% of patients experienced shortness of breath when walking quickly on level ground or climbing gentle slopes.

### Low-dose computed tomography screening for lung cancer: How strong is the evidence [^116ouSvs]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In 2013, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended low-dose computed tomographic (CT) screening for high-risk and former smokers with a B recommendation, indicating a level of certainty that it offered a moderate to substantial net benefit. Under the Affordable Care Act, the USPSTF recommendation requires commercial insurers to fully cover low-dose CT. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is now considering whether to also offer coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. Although the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated the efficacy of low-dose CT, implementation of national screening may be premature.

The magnitude of benefit from routine screening is uncertain; estimates are based on data from a single study and simulation models commissioned by the USPSTF. The potential harms — which could affect a large population — include false-positive results, anxiety, radiation exposure, diagnostic workups, and the resulting complications. It is unclear if routine screening would result in net benefit or net harm. The NLST may not be generalizable to a national screening program for the Medicare age group because 73% of NLST participants were younger than 65 years. Moreover, screening outside of trial conditions is less likely to be restricted to high-risk smokers and qualified imaging centers with responsible referral protocols. Until better data are available for older adults who are screened in ordinary (nontrial) community settings, CMS should postpone coverage of low-dose CT screening for Medicare beneficiaries.

The most important GOLD objective is raising awareness that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is an increasing health problem. The first step in the GOLD program was to prepare a consensus report, named "Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of COPD", based on best-validated evidence and pathogenetic and clinical knowledge. It encourages the implementation of effective strategies for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of the disease in all countries and emphasizes the importance of renewed research initiatives.

### Baseline characteristics of participants in the randomized national lung screening trial [^113mfuhU]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). Low credibility.

The study involved a total of 53,456 participants, with 26,733 randomly assigned to chest radiograph screening and 26,723 to computerized tomography. The distribution of sex and age by study arm revealed that 31,533 (59%) of participants were men, and 39,234 (73%) were younger than 65 years. The mean age for the entire cohort was 61.4 years (standard deviation = 5.0 years), with a median age of 60 years (interquartile range = 57–65 years). Due to stratified randomization by sex and 5-year age groups, participant numbers were virtually identical in these categories across study arms.

- **Demographic factors and baseline smoking status**: Most participants (48,549 or 91%) were white, 2,378 (4.4%) were black, and 935 (1.7%) identified as Hispanic or Latino. Educational status varied, with 3,252 (6%) not having a high school degree and 16,839 (approximately 32%) having at least a college degree. Additionally, 15,017 (28%) of the participants were classified as obese according to the Centers for Disease Control criteria (ie, body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m²).

### Screening for lung cancer: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111FPE4F]. Chest (2018). High credibility.

Low-dose chest CT screening for lung cancer has become a standard of care in the United States in the past few years, primarily due to the results of the National Lung Screening Trial. Both the benefits and harms of low-dose chest CT screening vary in frequency and magnitude. Translating a favorable balance of benefits and harms into practice can be challenging. In this report, we update the evidence base for the benefits, harms, and implementation of low radiation dose chest CT screening. We utilize the updated evidence base to provide recommendations where evidence supports, and make statements based on experience and expert consensus where it does not.

- **Methods**: Approved panelists developed key questions using the PICO (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome) format to address the benefits and harms of low-dose CT screening, along with key areas of program implementation. A systematic literature review was conducted using MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Reference lists from relevant retrievals were searched, and additional papers were included. The quality of evidence for each critical or important outcome was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Important clinical questions were addressed based on evidence developed from the systematic literature review. Graded recommendations and ungraded statements were drafted, voted on, and revised until consensus was reached.

- **Results**: The systematic literature review identified 59 studies that informed the res.

### Guidelines for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1156rEKg]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory condition characterized by a progressive decline in lung function. It imposes a considerable burden on patients, healthcare services, and society, which is likely to increase in the future. Therefore, it is important to ensure that this disease is managed as effectively as possible.

In many therapeutic areas, management guidelines have been developed to ensure that physicians are aware of optimal disease management and the cost-effective use of healthcare resources. Such guidelines are usually prepared by consensus among clinical experts or following a systematic review of the evidence. However, several barriers exist to the implementation of treatment guidelines, including the sheer weight of guidelines in all therapeutic areas, focus on scientific knowledge rather than on clinical practice, lack of trust in the recommendations, and practical considerations (e.g. time, resources, budget). Additionally, failure to include the perspective of patients is also a significant barrier.

- **Implementation considerations**: The management guidelines most likely to be implemented are those that are quick and easy to use, relevant to the user's practice, and from a credible source.

In COPD, over 40 guidelines have been developed, mainly by local respiratory societies as a result of local expert consensus. The guidelines developed by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) are evidence-based and have the backing of international experts. Local implementation plans have been developed to help ensure that GOLD recommendations are implemented in practice.

### The clinical impact of high resolution computed tomography in patients with respiratory disease [^114oRizd]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

High resolution computed tomography is widely used to investigate patients with suspected diffuse lung disease. Numerous studies have assessed the diagnostic performance of this investigation, but the diagnostic and therapeutic impacts have received little attention.

- **Objective**: The diagnostic and therapeutic impacts of high resolution computed tomography in routine clinical practice were evaluated prospectively. All 507 referrals for high resolution computed tomography over 12 months in two centers were included. Requesting clinicians completed questionnaires before and after the investigation detailing clinical indications, working diagnoses, confidence level in each diagnosis, and planned investigations and treatments.

- **Results**: Three hundred and fifty-four studies on 347 patients had complete data and were available for analysis. Following high-resolution computed tomography, a new leading diagnosis (the diagnosis with the highest confidence level) emerged in 204 (58%) studies; in 166 (47%) studies, the new leading diagnosis was not in the original differential diagnosis. The mean confidence in the leading diagnosis increased from 6.7 to 8.5 out of 10 (p < 0.001). The invasiveness of planned investigations increased in 23 (7%) studies and decreased in 124 (35%) studies. The treatment plan was modified after 319 (90%) studies.

- **Conclusions**: Thoracic high-resolution computed tomography alters leading diagnosis, increases diagnostic confidence, and frequently changes investigation and management plans.

### Screening for and early detection of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113QueU7]. Lancet (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a substantially underdiagnosed disorder, with the diagnosis typically missed or delayed until the condition is advanced. Spirometry is the most frequently used pulmonary function test and enables health professionals to make an objective measurement of airflow obstruction and assess the degree to which it is reversible. As a diagnostic test for COPD, spirometry is a reliable, simple, non-invasive, safe, and inexpensive procedure. Early diagnosis of COPD should provide support for smoking cessation initiatives and lead to a reduction of the societal burden of the disease, but definitive confirmation of both proves elusive. Despite substantial effort and investment, implementation of quality spirometry is deficient because of several hurdles and limitations described in this review. Overall, spirometry is recognized as the essential test for the diagnosis and monitoring of COPD.

### Unmet diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in low- and middle-income countries [^114wWUYp]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the most prevalent of the chronic respiratory diseases and is the third most common cause of death worldwide. COPD is associated with systematic disadvantage throughout the life course and respiratory exposures. The greatest burden of COPD falls in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which account for 75% of the cases, 80% of the deaths, and considerable morbidity, premature mortality, and lost productivity.

There are many challenges to mitigating COPD in LMICs, notably underdiagnosis, absence of LMIC-relevant evidence and guidelines, access to affordable interventions, and heterogeneous implementation of evidence-based care. Addressing these issues requires an investment in healthcare staff, services, and facilities. Better care for COPD in LMICs begins with improved access to diagnostics. We have recently reported on the discriminative accuracy of simple screening tools to identify people at high risk for COPD in three diverse LMIC sites in Nepal, Peru, and Uganda. The overall prevalence of COPD was 9.4%, varying by site. Forty-nine percent of the cases had clinically significant disease, and more than 95% were previously undiagnosed. Our findings contrast with recommendations from the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, which recently reiterated that screening-detected cases of COPD are generally mild and that intervention other than smoking cessation is not indicated. This conclusion does not hold true in LMIC settings.

After a diagnosis of COPD, the next consideration is implementation.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease prevalence and prediction in a high-risk lung cancer screening population [^112Qu7Ka]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer are associated diseases, sharing tobacco as a common cause. Individuals with COPD are two times more likely to develop lung cancer than those without COPD, and individuals with emphysema on CT scan are also at higher risk. A common pathophysiology may in part be founded on genetic susceptibility, as exemplified by two single nucleotide polymorphisms in the α-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (CHRNA 3/5) locus, but also more broadly through commonalities in oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and changes in matrix proteinases. While there are global variations in prevalence, up to one in four North Americans may be diagnosed with COPD in their lifetime. Despite this, there is strong evidence of underdiagnosis of COPD in the primary care population as well as in patients who have lung cancer.

Screening of asymptomatic individuals for COPD is not currently recommended by the US Preventative Services Task Force as clinical benefit has not been demonstrated in this population. Conversely, based largely on the results of the National Lung Screening Trial, low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening for lung cancer is recommended by the US Preventative Services Task Force and funded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. Further momentum to implement screening is provided by the mortality reduction seen in the recently published, large, randomized, NELSON screening trial. A significant proportion of ever smokers is found to have pulmonary emphysema on their screening low-dose CT scan (LDCT), although the implications of this finding are still under evaluation.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: definition and epidemiology [^111mjBjC]. Respiratory Care (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) continues to impose a significant health and economic burden in the United States and globally. Some well-known risk factors for COPD include smoking, occupational exposures, air pollution, airway hyperresponsiveness, asthma, and certain genetic variations. However, many questions remain, such as why fewer than 20% of smokers develop substantial airway obstruction. There are several definitions of COPD, and these depend on accurate diagnosis. Small differences in definitions can significantly affect estimates of COPD prevalence in the population. Additionally, newer measures, such as functional status or exercise capability, have emerged as important factors in determining the prognosis of COPD patients. Evidence continues to suggest that COPD comprises several different disease processes, potentially requiring different interventions.

In most parts of the world, COPD prevalence and mortality are still increasing and will probably continue to rise due to increases in smoking, particularly among women and adolescents. Resources focused on smoking cessation and prevention, COPD education, early detection, and improved treatment will be most beneficial in our ongoing efforts to combat this important cause of morbidity and mortality.

### Screening for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112RCC3U]. JAMA (2016). Low credibility.

The prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) among US adults aged 40 to 79 years is approximately 14%, and it ranks as the third leading cause of death in the United States. Individuals with severe COPD often face significant limitations in engaging in normal physical activities due to diminished lung function.

The objective of this recommendation statement is to update the 2008 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines on screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults.

- **Evidence review**: The USPSTF examined whether screening for COPD in adults without recognized or reported respiratory symptoms enhances health outcomes. The evaluation included reviewing the diagnostic accuracy of screening tools such as prescreening questionnaires and spirometry. Additionally, it assessed whether screening enhances the delivery and uptake of targeted preventive services, including smoking cessation programs and relevant immunizations, along with the potential harms of screening for and treating mild to moderate COPD.

- **Findings**: Consistent with the 2008 findings, the USPSTF did not find evidence indicating that screening for COPD in asymptomatic individuals enhances health-related quality of life, reduces morbidity, or decreases mortality. The Task Force concluded that early detection of COPD, prior to symptom development, neither alters the disease course nor improves patient outcomes. There is moderate certainty that screening for COPD in asymptomatic individuals provides no net benefit.

- **Conclusions and recommendation**: The USPSTF recommends against screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults (D recommendation).

### The changing definition and perception of COPD [^113fLp8N]. Respiratory Care (2022). Low credibility.

COPD remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The impact of smoking and air pollution remains important causative factors. Traditional classification of COPD includes the overlap of emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and asthma. More recently, the COPDGene definition includes the terms possible, probable, and definite COPD. These are supported by findings from exposures, symptoms, spirometry, and radiologic imaging. This new approach can lead to earlier diagnosis, modification of risk factors, earlier therapeutic intervention, and improved treatments of established disease.

### The role of chest computed tomography in the evaluation and management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113fwknU]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to compile recent data on the clinical associations of computed tomography (CT) scan findings in the literature and potential avenues for implementation into clinical practice.

- **Recent findings**: Airways dysanapsis, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and pulmonary vascular metrics have all recently been associated with poor chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) outcomes when controlled for clinically relevant covariables, including risk of mortality in the case of emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Other authors suggest that CT scans may provide insight into both lung parenchymal damage and other clinically important comorbidities in COPD.

- **Summary**: CT scan findings in COPD relate to clinical outcomes. There is a continued need to develop processes to best implement the results of these studies into clinical practice.

- **Recommendation 1**: In patients with respiratory symptoms, particularly dyspnea, spirometry should be performed to diagnose airflow obstruction. Spirometry should not be used to screen for airflow obstruction in asymptomatic individuals. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.)
- **Recommendation 2**: Treatment for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) should be reserved for patients who have respiratory symptoms and FEV₁ less than 60% predicted, as documented by spirometry. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.)
- **Recommendation 3**: Clinicians should prescribe one of the following maintenance monotherapies for symptomatic patients with COPD and FEV₁ less than 60% predicted: long-acting inhaled beta-agonists, long-acting inhaled anticholinergics, or inhaled corticosteroids. (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence.)
- **Recommendation 4**: Clinicians may consider combination inhaled therapies for symptomatic patients with COPD and FEV₁ less than 60% predicted. (Grade: weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.)
- **Recommendation 5**: Clinicians should prescribe oxygen therapy in patients with COPD and resting hypoxemia (Pao₂ ≤ 55 mm Hg). (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.)
- **Recommendation 6**: Clinicians should consider prescribing pulmonary rehabilitation in symptomatic individuals with COPD who have an FEV₁ less than 50% predicted. (Grade: weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.)

### Screening and early diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a population study [^116NPoPL]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous pulmonary condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms. It is caused by persistent airflow obstruction due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities, and is associated with high morbidity, disability, and mortality. Currently, there is no internationally accepted definition of early COPD, and no relevant information exists. Data must be extrapolated from known patients with mild to moderate COPD. A large proportion consists of patients with grade I and grade II severity as per the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria, with mild symptoms, which should be considered the early stages of COPD.

Growth in COPD continues due to the rapidly increasing smoking rates in developing countries, in addition to the aging population in developed countries. Prevention, early diagnosis, and early treatment of COPD is a worldwide concern. At the time of writing, data on COPD are ambiguous and have not resulted in the widespread implementation of similar screening for COPD in most health economies, including China. In order to fill this gap, the Shenzhen Qianhai Shekou Free Trade Zone Hospital launched a public health project titled "Screening and Early Diagnosis of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease" on March 27, 2022. On November 15, 2022, Professor Chen Rongchang led the launch of the "Happy Breathing" China COPD Standardized Graded Diagnosis and Treatment Promotion Project in Shenzhen, which is based on the Nanshan District Medical Group Respiratory Disease Prevention and Treatment Regional Discipline.

### Improving selection criteria for lung cancer screening: The potential role of emphysema [^111EVyxu]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Lung cancer (LC) screening using low-dose chest computed tomography is now recommended in several guidelines using the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) entry criteria (age, 55–74; ≥ 30 pack-years; tobacco cessation within the previous 15 years for former smokers). Concerns exist about the lack of sensitivity of these criteria.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the performance of NLST criteria in two different LC screening studies from Europe and the United States, and to explore the effect of using emphysema as a complementary criterion.

- **Methods**: Participants from the Pamplona International Early Lung Action Detection Program (P-IELCAP; n = 3,061) and the Pittsburgh Lung Screening Study (PLuSS; n = 3,638) were considered. LC cumulative frequencies, incidence densities, and annual detection rates were calculated in three hypothetical cohorts, including subjects who met NLST criteria alone, those with computed tomography-detected emphysema, and those who met NLST criteria and/or had emphysema.

- **Measurements and Main results**: Thirty-six percent and 59% of P-IELCAP and PLuSS participants, respectively, met NLST criteria. Among these, higher LC incidence densities and detection rates were observed. However, applying NLST criteria to our original cohorts would miss as many as 39% of all LC. Annual screening of subjects meeting either NLST criteria or having emphysema detected most cancers (88% and 95% of incident LC of P-IELCAP and PLuSS, respectively) despite reducing the number of screened participants by as much as 52%.

- **Conclusions**: LC screening based solely on NLST criteria could miss a significant portion of cases.

### The role of chest imaging in the diagnosis, management, and monitoring of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [^114cFEVv]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Chest imaging is not recommended for routine screening of COVID-19 in a normal clinical situation. However, it still plays an integral role in the work-up and staging of the disease, especially when assessing complications or disease progression. Radiologists are primarily responsible for identifying patients at the greatest risk of imminent clinical decompensation. This identification is achieved by efficiently and promptly stratifying cases of COVID-19 based on radiologic imaging.

The availability of multiple and more refined CT grading systems and classifications now facilitates this task. Consequently, this contributes to recent improvements in COVID-19 treatment and outcomes.

### New horizons in early stage COPD: Improving knowledge, detection and treatment [^112gRrHX]. Respiratory medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Early stage COPD carries a significant healthcare burden that is currently underrecognized, underdiagnosed, and undertreated. Patients at this stage can rapidly decline to advanced disease, especially if they continue to smoke. The natural history of the disease in early stages remains largely unknown. Emerging evidence indicates that we can reduce lung function decline and exacerbations and improve quality of life in early stage COPD, mainly through smoking cessation. However, new evidence from randomized clinical trials also suggests an impact of pharmacotherapy on clinical outcomes in early disease.

Guidelines need to be updated to reflect this greater understanding of early stage disease. Trials need to be conducted to definitively show the benefits of intensive treatment to meet the large, unmet clinical needs of this important patient group.

### Mimickers of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on chest CT: Spectrum of CT and clinical features [^111v5xDi]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

A broad spectrum of pulmonary conditions demonstrates imaging features that mimic those of COVID-19 and are difficult to differentiate from it. Awareness of these conditions, careful radiologic analysis, and attention to the clinical data are required to prevent an erroneous diagnosis that could potentially adversely impact management and patients' outcomes. A correct diagnosis of these conditions may prevent unnecessary hospitalization and reduce strict quarantine measures for all suspected patients, which hold significant pressure on healthcare providers and medical infrastructure.

### Addressing the use of the CAPTURE (a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease screening tool) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatment decisions [^114FgjLb]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

It is important to emphasize the difference between this study and the recently published studies of the CAPTURE tool in a U.S. primary care population and in community populations in three lower-resourced countries (Peru, Uganda, and Nepal). Both of those studies assessed the operating characteristics of CAPTURE for identifying new diagnoses of clinically significant COPD, as this screening tool was originally designed to do. Sensitivity estimates reported by Li and colleagues are based on individuals who already have a confirmed diagnosis of COPD, so sensitivity comparisons across the three studies are not appropriate. Similarly, to community-based screening studies, Li and colleagues confirm that using CAPTURE as designed with five questions and peak flow results in the best sensitivity and specificity for all of these populations.

Li and colleagues' definition of symptom burden and exacerbation risk requiring daily maintenance COPD pharmacotherapy therapy is different from that used in previous CAPTURE COPD screening studies, which defined clinically significant COPD in those with FEV₁ percent predicted < 60% and/or an exacerbation history. Li and colleagues' assessment of symptom burden is more concordant with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) COPD recommendations for immediate treatment, although Li and colleagues seem to be arguing for using these symptom classifications to designate patients ineligible for treatment in resource-poor settings, which is an entirely different goal altogether.

### Global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease 2023 report: GOLD executive summary [^113kCmXQ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Imaging plays a crucial role in the evaluation of COPD. A chest X-ray cannot confirm a diagnosis of COPD; however, radiological changes associated with COPD may include signs of lung hyperinflation, such as a flattened diaphragm and increased retrosternal air space, lung hyperlucency, and rapid tapering of the vascular markings. Additionally, a chest X-ray can help exclude alternative diagnoses and establish the presence of significant comorbidities such as concomitant pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiectasis, pleural diseases, kyphoscoliosis, and cardiomegaly.

CT of the chest can provide information of potential clinical relevance, including:

- **Presence, severity, and distribution of emphysema**: This has implications for potential surgical or endoscopic lung volume reduction and is associated with faster FEV₁ decline, higher mortality, and increased risk of lung cancer.
- **Bronchiectasis visible on CT**: About 30% of COPD patients have bronchiectasis visible on CT, which is associated with increased exacerbation frequency and mortality.
- **Lung cancer screening eligibility**: Most COPD patients fulfill the inclusion/exclusion criteria for lung cancer screening in the general population, so they should be offered a similar strategy.
- **Quantification of airway abnormalities**: Although these methods are less well standardized than those used for emphysema quantification, they provide valuable information.
- **Information about COPD comorbidities**: A CT scan offers information about comorbidities, including coronary artery calcifications, pulmonary artery enlargement, bone density, and muscle mass. Some of these findings are associated with all-cause mortality independently of the severity of airflow obstruction.

Thus, GOLD 2023 recommends chest CT in COPD patients to gather comprehensive data for the effective management of the disease.

### Guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatment and issues of implementation [^115cUyw5]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Treatment advances over the last decade, although limited, have precipitated the development of clinical practice guidelines, with the aim of improving the quality of care received by patients through fostering evidence-based decision making and accelerating the application of new advances to everyday practice.

Of the COPD guidelines that have been developed, those from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) — initially a joint activity between the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization — and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom have both published their methods for evaluation of evidence. These comprehensive guidelines cover all aspects of the disease, aiming to provide the basis for local care pathways.

The guideline development process includes evaluation of the evidence, development of the guideline, and dissemination of the findings. Efforts to enhance guideline effectiveness have focused on improving the methods and approaches to implementation, which requires an appreciation of the issues that stop translation of guideline definitions of best practice into improved patient care.

A variety of questions remain unanswered in the clinical management of COPD, including the definition of outcome measures that move beyond lung function and the potential application of multidimensional grading systems that assess respiratory and systemic expressions of COPD.

### Monitoring of patients with COPD: A review of current guidelines' recommendations [^113VuywN]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The goals for the management of COPD are to delay the progression of the disease and alleviate its manifestations. The follow-up of the patient's physical and mental condition is part of best practice management, especially when monitoring routines result in information that contributes to achieving management goals. However, the recommendations on monitoring procedures may differ between guidelines and might not be based on scientific evidence. The aim of this article is to review the guideline recommendations on monitoring routines for COPD.

- **Methods**: Clinical practice guidelines on the management of COPD were identified through a Medline search, an Internet search, and were further expanded by experts in the respiratory field. These guidelines were analyzed for recommended monitoring routines and the recommended frequency of monitoring.

- **Results**: Eighteen clinical practice guidelines on the management of COPD were analyzed. The follow-up of lung function indices was the most frequently recommended monitoring routine. Additionally, regular monitoring of symptoms, exercise tolerance, comorbidity, and smoking habits was recommended. In none of the guidelines were the recommended monitoring routines evidence-based. Only one guideline provided a different set of monitoring parameters for advanced COPD compared to mild and moderate COPD.

- **Conclusion**: Some monitoring routines were recommended frequently, particularly the follow-up of lung function indices. However, there is a lack of evidence to support the guideline recommendations for the monitoring of patients with COPD.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment [^116mGrfY]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Radiographic findings in pneumonia generally fall into three categories: focal non-segmental or lobar pneumonia, multifocal bronchopneumonia, and focal or diffuse interstitial pneumonia. In patients who clinically improve, ATS/IDSA guidelines do not recommend routine follow-up chest imaging. However, in cases where clinical presentation is atypical despite radiographic evidence of pneumonia, repeat CXR is advised to rule out alternative diagnoses. Besides, repeat CXR can show progression of disease, but more importantly, may reveal fluid collections (rarely abscess, more commonly pleural effusions) which could represent lack of source control, like empyema requiring drainage. Radiographic resolution can lag days to weeks beyond clinical improvement. In patients under 50 and those with mild-to-moderate pneumonia, radiographic infiltrates typically resolve within four weeks. Conversely, resolution may take up to 10 weeks in older patients, those with multiple comorbidities and COPD, or severe pneumonia. Slow radiographic resolution alone is not an indicator of treatment failure.

Point-of-care LUS can also be beneficial as it is more sensitive than CXR for identifying pleural effusions and can identify fluid characteristics that suggest the presence of an empyema. While LUS avoids the cost and radiation of CT, it requires technical expertise and is less effective for assessing pathology deep to the lung pleura.

For non-resolving pneumonia or clinical deterioration, repeat imaging — especially a chest CT scan — is strongly recommended.

### Meeting unmet needs in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease diagnosis and treatment in low- and middle-income countries [^115w2bUS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Although COPD underdiagnosis is a global challenge, the rate is higher in LMICs both at the population level and in clinical practice. In a population-based COPD screening study in Nigeria, more than 99% of persons identified to have COPD were previously undiagnosed. The PUMA (Prevalence Study and Regular Practice, Diagnosis and Treatment, among General Practitioners in Populations at Risk of COPD in Latin America) study, a primary care screening study in four Latin American countries, revealed a 77% rate of COPD underdiagnosis. Inadequate knowledge about COPD diagnosis and treatment among doctors, low community literacy about COPD, and an absence of local management strategies or guidelines in LMICs contribute to high rates of underdiagnosis. In India, about 1% of the population had ever heard of COPD, and most had poor understanding of the disease. Additionally, respiratory symptoms, particularly cough and poor exercise tolerance, are often considered part of normal aging in some LMICs, and care is usually not sought. Notably, older adults in African movies are often depicted as persons with cough.

In this issue of the Journal, Florman and colleagues provide underpinning data that highlight the magnitude of the problem of COPD underdiagnosis and undertreatment in LMICs. By describing unmet therapeutic opportunities among 1,000 persons with COPD identified through the screening of randomly selected population-based samples in three LMICs (Nepal, Peru, and Uganda), they show how ubiquitous the problem is.

### Validation of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease screening questionnaire for population surveys [^112GCmd6]. Respiratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The Confronting Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Survey conducted in North America and Europe during 1999–2000 aimed to identify international differences in the clinical management of COPD and the patients' perspectives on their disease. Our aim was to validate the screening questionnaire used in this study in a sample of patients presenting at a respiratory clinic. Interviews were conducted at an outpatient clinic of the London Chest Hospital. Of the 136 patients contacted, 25 refused or were not able to participate.

Questionnaire data were validated by comparison with medical records and spirometry on 104 patients. Overall, the questionnaire correctly identified 86.5% of patients with a diagnosis of COPD, with a chance-corrected agreement (kappa = 0.66, SE 0.098), which indicates good agreement between the questionnaire alpha and the medical records. The questionnaire had a high sensitivity (92.0%) and specificity (72.4%) with respect to the diagnosis of COPD. The screening questionnaire used in the Confronting COPD Survey appears to be a valid screening tool to differentiate COPD from other respiratory diseases.
