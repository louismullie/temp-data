## Question

Is it safe to take hydroxyzine while pregnant?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether hydroxyzine is safe to use during pregnancy and what the recommendation should be, given regulatory labeling and available evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the specific hydroxyzine formulations and what the FDA labels actually say. Then, I should verify the animal versus human data that underpin those labels. Next, I will consider timing by trimester, especially organogenesis. After that, I should assess the consistency and credibility of the evidence across labels and guidelines. Finally, I need to examine safer alternatives and synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation with appropriate counseling language and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the drug and its formulations to avoid confusion later. Hydroxyzine appears as hydroxyzine pamoate capsules and oral solution under the Vistaril brand and as hydroxyzine hydrochloride in oral and intramuscular forms; these share the same active moiety and class effects, including sedation and anticholinergic properties, with labeling cross-referencing hypersensitivity to cetirizine and levocetirizine because of structural relatedness, so any conclusion should span these formulations unless a route-specific risk is identified [^1156Lirv] [^113Gt7JS] [^112dz8Ju].

> Wait, let me verify what the FDA labels actually state about pregnancy because this is the crux. Multiple high-credibility FDA labels consistently note that hydroxyzine produced fetal abnormalities in rats and mice at doses above the human therapeutic range and that clinical data in humans are inadequate to establish safety in early pregnancy; until such data are available, hydroxyzine is contraindicated in early pregnancy, which is explicitly stated across pamoate and hydrochloride labels and the Vistaril brand information [^113Gt7JS] [^1156Lirv] [^112dz8Ju].

> Hold on, I should verify the timing implications of "early pregnancy". Organogenesis typically spans approximately days 31–71 after the last menstrual period in a standard 28‑day cycle, a window of peak teratogenic susceptibility, so a label stating "contraindicated in early pregnancy" targets precisely that high‑risk period; I initially thought the text implied contraindication throughout pregnancy, but I need to correct that: the labels explicitly name early pregnancy, and for later trimesters they highlight a lack of adequate human safety data rather than an absolute contraindication, which in practice supports avoidance beyond the first trimester when alternatives exist and the clinical need is not compelling [^113Gt7JS] [^1156Lirv] [^112dz8Ju] [^11233en9].

> I should confirm how strong and consistent this signal is and how to interpret the animal data. The regulatory language is concordant across multiple hydroxyzine SPLs and brands, which strengthens confidence in the early‑pregnancy contraindication, even though the fetal abnormalities were observed in animals at exposures above the human therapeutic range; translation from animal reproductive studies to human risk is imperfect and often conservative, but in the absence of robust human data, the precautionary stance in labeling is appropriate and carries high regulatory credibility [^113Gt7JS] [^1156Lirv] [^112dz8Ju] [^115wAs6r].

> Hmm, wait a minute, there is a potential labeling nuance I should double-check. One SPL entry lists hydroxyzine pamoate with an Australian category A designation while simultaneously advising to avoid use and to not use in early pregnancy; this discrepancy between narrative contraindication and legacy categorical systems underscores why the U.S. PLLR moved away from letter categories and toward narrative, evidence‑based risk summaries, so I should not let a legacy category override the explicit early‑pregnancy contraindication and the lack of adequate human safety data [^113i7cD9] [^113wNMsC] [^111wJywQ].

> Next, I should review alternatives because clinical need often involves pruritus, urticaria, or anxiety symptoms in pregnancy. Let me consider guideline‑supported options: for pruritus and urticaria in pregnancy, chlorpheniramine is commonly recommended early in pregnancy, and loratadine or cetirizine are generally favored second‑generation H1 antihistamines with reassuring data, often introduced after the first trimester; several reviews and guidelines align on these as preferred agents, whereas hydroxyzine is specifically noted as contraindicated in pregnancy in product information and should be avoided when safer antihistamines suffice [^113G2uPV] [^114L7UUy] [^113ZfqGq] [^114QWBsW].

> I need to ensure I'm not overlooking non–pregnancy-specific safety that could still matter. Hydroxyzine carries QT prolongation and torsade de pointes risk and cautions regarding CNS depression and additive effects with other sedatives; pregnancy can unmask arrhythmic vulnerability, and peripartum sedative exposure can complicate neonatal adaptation, so even beyond teratogenicity concerns, hydroxyzine's cardiac and CNS profiles argue for caution and favor alternatives with cleaner safety signals in pregnancy [^113qa3m7] [^114si9UN].

> Let me synthesize this into a practical recommendation with clear trimester framing. Early pregnancy: do not use hydroxyzine because it is contraindicated given animal teratogenicity findings and inadequate human safety data; mid to late pregnancy: avoid use when possible due to the persisting lack of robust human safety data and the availability of safer antihistamines, reserving hydroxyzine only for compelling indications after shared decision‑making when alternatives are ineffective or inappropriate, while documenting the rationale and counseling on known uncertainties and potential risks [^113Gt7JS] [^1156Lirv] [^112dz8Ju] [^113G2uPV] [^114L7UUy].

> But wait, what if the patient is already taking hydroxyzine and presents after the first trimester? I should double‑check the counseling approach under PLLR principles: discuss background risks, explain that human data for hydroxyzine are limited, review safer substitutes such as loratadine or cetirizine, consider tapering and switching if symptoms allow, and if continued use is deemed necessary, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration with ECG risk assessment for QT prolongation when appropriate, consistent with narrative labeling practices that prioritize individualized risk–benefit analysis and registry participation when available [^1127v51N] [^111wJywQ] [^113ZfqGq] [^113qa3m7].

> Final take: I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Hydroxyzine is contraindicated in early pregnancy per FDA labeling because of animal teratogenicity and inadequate human data, and in later pregnancy it should generally be avoided in favor of better‑studied antihistamines such as chlorpheniramine in early gestation and loratadine or cetirizine thereafter; reserve hydroxyzine only for exceptional circumstances after thorough counseling, attention to QT risk, and documentation of risk–benefit reasoning and shared decision‑making [^113Gt7JS] [^1156Lirv] [^112dz8Ju] [^113G2uPV] [^114L7UUy] [^113qa3m7].

---

Hydroxyzine is generally not considered safe in pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, due to animal data showing fetal abnormalities and inadequate human data [^1156Lirv] [^113Gt7JS] [^112pFZi5]. It is contraindicated in early pregnancy and should be avoided throughout gestation unless no safer alternatives exist and the benefits clearly outweigh the risks [^113Gt7JS] [^112dz8Ju] [^1127v51N] [^114L7UUy]. If an antihistamine is needed, use loratadine or cetirizine, which have better safety profiles in pregnancy [^113ZfqGq].

---

## Evidence from animal studies

Animal studies show hydroxyzine caused **fetal abnormalities** in rats and mice at doses above the human therapeutic range [^113Gt7JS] [^1156Lirv]. Based on these findings and inadequate human data, the **regulatory stance** is that hydroxyzine is contraindicated in early pregnancy [^1127v51N] [^112dz8Ju].

---

## Human data and clinical guidelines

Human data are lacking; **no adequate, well-controlled studies** of hydroxyzine in pregnancy exist [^113Gt7JS] [^112pFZi5]. Current **guidelines** state that hydroxyzine is contraindicated in early pregnancy and should be avoided throughout gestation unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks [^114L7UUy] [^112dz8Ju].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

Potential risks and adverse effects include **neonatal risks**, as exposure — especially late in pregnancy — may cause neonatal respiratory depression, hypotonia, and CNS depression. Maternal risks include **QT prolongation and torsade de pointes**, posing risks to both mother and fetus [^113qa3m7].

---

## Alternative medications

Preferred options include **loratadine and cetirizine** due to better safety profiles [^113ZfqGq]. Other options, such as **chlorpheniramine**, are also considered safe and effective for pruritus in pregnancy [^113G2uPV] [^114QWBsW].

---

## Clinical recommendations

- **First trimester**: Avoid hydroxyzine due to potential teratogenicity and lack of human data [^113Gt7JS] [^1156Lirv].

- **Second and third trimesters**: Use only if benefits clearly outweigh risks and no safer alternatives are available [^113Gt7JS] [^112dz8Ju] [^113i7cD9].

- **Monitoring**: If used, monitor for neonatal respiratory depression, hypotonia, and CNS depression.

## Summary table: hydroxyzine safety in pregnancy

| **Trimester** | **Safety status** | **Recommendations** |
|-|-|-|
| First trimester | Contraindicated | Avoid use due to potential teratogenicity and lack of human data [^113Gt7JS] [^1156Lirv] |
| Second trimester | Use with caution | Only if benefits clearly outweigh risks and no safer alternatives available [^113Gt7JS] [^112dz8Ju] [^113i7cD9] |
| Third trimester | Use with caution | Only if benefits clearly outweigh risks; monitor for neonatal respiratory depression, hypotonia, and CNS depression |

### Exposing fetal drug exposure [^114EwTzs]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Pregnancy neither protects women from susceptibility to illness nor generally decreases drug dosage requirements of preexisting pharmacotherapy. Thus, a major concern of drug use during pregnancy is the maintenance of maternal health while minimizing fetal drug exposure. Important assumptions in reproductive medicine are that fetal exposure to any medication can present risks in pregnancy — because not all risks are known, as little exposure as possible is desirable.

### Safety of haloperidol and penfluridol in pregnancy: A multicenter, prospective, controlled study [^111Nr1eX]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

To assess the safety of the butyrophenone neuroleptics haloperidol and penfluridol in pregnancy, this multicenter, prospective, controlled study compared the rate of major anomalies between a cohort of pregnant women counseled for gestational exposure to haloperidol or penfluridol and a control group counseled for nonteratogen exposure. The study was conducted within the European Network of Teratology Information Services (ENTIS) and included women who contacted one of four teratology information services for counseling between January 1989 and December 2001.

We followed up on the outcomes of 215 pregnancies exposed to haloperidol (N = 188) or penfluridol (N = 27) — 78.2% of 206 were in the first trimester — and compared them to outcomes of 631 ENTIS controls. The rate of congenital anomalies did not differ between the haloperidol/penfluridol-exposed group and the control group (6/179 = 3.4% vs. 22/581 = 3.8%, p = .787). No difference was found by limiting the analysis to those exposed to butyrophenones during the first trimester. There were two cases of limb defects in the butyrophenone-exposed group (one after haloperidol and one after penfluridol exposure) and none in the controls. A higher rate of elective terminations of pregnancy (8.8% vs. 3.8%, p = .004), a higher rate of preterm birth (13.9% vs. 6.9%, p = .006), a lower median birth weight (3155 g vs. 3370 g, p < .001), and a lower median birth weight of full-term infants (3250 g vs. 3415 g, p = .004) were found in the butyrophenone-exposed group compared to the controls.

### SPL drug information for thioridazine hydrochloride [^1127qDkz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of thioridazine hydrochloride PO in pregnant patients across all trimesters: use this drug only if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. It is crucial to monitor neonates for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms and respiratory depression. Thioridazine hydrochloride PO is classified under category C in the Australian categorization system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This classification indicates that the drug has pharmacological effects that have caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, although not malformations. Notably, these effects may be reversible.

### Pruritus in pregnancy [^113G2uPV]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Antihistamine drugs: Several studies have evaluated the safety of antihistamines during pregnancy. The first-generation H1 antihistamine (sedative) chlorpheniramine (4 mg every 4–6 h; FDA pregnancy category B) can be administered in early pregnancy as first-line therapy. It is widely available, inexpensive, and can be useful on an as-needed basis and/or before bed. Second-generation antihistamines (nonsedative) have a less sedating effect and fewer cholinergic side effects than first-generation agents. They should be introduced from the second trimester onward as they may incur a higher risk of malformations (neural tube defects, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, and tetralogy of Fallot) when used in early pregnancy. Loratadine 10 mg once daily and cetirizine 10 mg once daily are considered second-generation antihistamines of choice in pregnancy. Data regarding the use of levocetirizine (FDA pregnancy category B) and fexofenadine (FDA pregnancy category C) are also reassuring.

Phototherapy: Narrowband UVB is considered safe in pregnancy and is recommended as a second-line treatment, especially in early pregnancy when other medications are contraindicated. Although patients who have been exposed to high levels of UVB radiation do not have an increased risk of abnormal delivery outcomes, it is worth remembering that there is a paucity of studies regarding ultraviolet A (UVA) or UVB light therapy and pregnancy-related complications or long-term effects on the fetus. The use of UVB therapy was linked with low levels of serum folate, and folate supplementation (0.8 mg/day) should be considered.

### Hydroxychloroquine early in pregnancy and risk of birth defects [^112VByJA]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine is generally considered safe in pregnancy for the treatment of rheumatic conditions, but studies have been too small to evaluate teratogenicity. Quantifying the risk of congenital malformations associated with early pregnancy exposure to hydroxychloroquine is important in both the context of its ongoing use for rheumatological disorders and its potential future use for coronavirus disease 2019 prophylaxis, for which a number of clinical trials are ongoing despite initial trials for coronavirus disease 2019 treatment having been negative.

- **Objective**: The study objective was to evaluate the risk of major congenital malformations associated with exposure to hydroxychloroquine during the first trimester of pregnancy, the period of organogenesis.

- **Study design**: We performed a population-based cohort study nested in the Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX, 2000–2014) and IBM MarketScan Research Database (MarketScan, 2003–2015). The source cohort included 2045 hydroxychloroquine-exposed pregnancies and 3,198,589 pregnancies not exposed to hydroxychloroquine. Participants were continuously enrolled in their respective insurance program for 3 months before the last menstrual period through at least 1 month after delivery; infants were enrolled for at least 3 months after birth. We compared the risk of congenital malformations in women using hydroxychloroquine during the first trimester of pregnancy with that of those not using hydroxychloroquine, restricting the cohort to women with rheumatic disorders and using propensity score matching to control for indication and demographic variables.

### Teratogenicity of recently introduced medications in human pregnancy [^112pFZi5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

To determine how long it takes following a new drug is marketed to establish whether or not its use by pregnant women is likely to pose a substantial teratogenic risk, we used standard clinical teratology resources. These resources assessed the teratogenic risks in human pregnancy of therapeutic treatment with 468 drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration between 1980 and 2000. The teratogenic risk of each treatment was classified using the online version of TERIS into one of three categories: no risk or minimal risk or unlikely to produce an increased risk; associated with a small, moderate, or high risk; or risk undetermined.

We found that the teratogenic risk in human pregnancy was still undetermined for 91.2% of drug treatments approved in the United States between 1980 and 2000. The proportion of treatments classified as having an "undetermined" teratogenic risk was more than 80% for drugs approved for marketing 0–4, 5–9, 10–14, or 15–20 years ago. However, the highest proportion of drugs with an "undetermined" teratogenic risk was found among those approved 15–20 years ago. The agreement between TERIS risk ratings and Food and Drug Administration Use-in-Pregnancy Categories for 163 drugs that had been assessed by both systems was poor (kappa ± standard error = 0.082 ± 0.042).

We conclude that inadequate information is available for pregnant women and their physicians to determine whether the benefits exceed the teratogenic risks for most drug treatments introduced in the past 20 years.

### Hydroxyzine pamoate [^113Gt7JS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

**Contraindications**: Hydroxyzine, when administered to the pregnant mouse, rat, and rabbit, induced fetal abnormalities in the rat and mouse at doses substantially above the human therapeutic range. Clinical data in human beings are inadequate to establish safety in early pregnancy; until such data are available, hydroxyzine is contraindicated in early pregnancy. Hydroxyzine is contraindicated in patients with a prolonged QT interval. Hydroxyzine pamoate is contraindicated for patients who have shown a previous hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. It is also contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to hydroxyzine products, cetirizine hydrochloride, or levocetirizine hydrochloride.

### Over-the-counter medications: Risk and safety in pregnancy [^113j1iAU]. Seminars in Perinatology (2015). Low credibility.

Over-the-counter (OTC) medications are among the most commonly used products in pregnancy. Similar to prescription medications, for many products, there is a lack of adequate data on their safety of use in pregnancy. Assumptions of safety for these products based on long experience and OTC status, in the absence of data, may be ill-founded. Examples of four OTC products used to treat common conditions in pregnancy are described. Potential links to adverse short- and long-term infant outcomes for these products are reviewed, along with the strengths and limitations of data to support these associations. Research to detect or rule out these risks is essential.

### Medication exposure during pregnancy: A pilot pharmacovigilance system using health and demographic surveillance platform [^1169nudz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

A total of 15 participants (1.5%) reported not using any drugs during pregnancy. However, 974 participants (98%) used one or more of the three drug groups recommended by the Ministry of Health for antenatal intervention, all of which were used during the second and third trimesters. Notably, 931 participants (93.7%) used vitamins and mineral supplements, while 929 (93.5%) used the anthelmintic mebendazole. Additionally, 946 participants (95.2%) received at least one dose of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) for intermittent preventive treatment of malaria (IPTp), with 735 (73.9%) receiving two doses and 211 (21.2%) receiving one dose [see Tables 2 and 3].

- **Classes of drugs**: A variety of drugs were reported to be used by pregnant women, excluding SP for IPTp. Details on the use of these drugs can be found in Tables 2 and 3. Drug classification was based on the US FDA pregnancy risk categorization.

- **Anti-infective drugs**: For the treatment of illnesses, 170 women (17.1%) used antibiotics; 148 (14.9%) used antimalarial drugs; 59 (5.9%) used antifungals; and 29 (2.9%) used antiretrovirals. Some women used more than one type of these anti-infective drugs during their pregnancy period.

Tables 2 and 3 provide a summary of the drug exposures during pregnancy among the study participants. Note: Some women were treated for malaria more than once during their pregnancy.

Abbreviations: SP - Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine; IPTp - Intermittent Preventive Treatment for malaria in pregnancy; AL - Artemether-lumefantrine.

### Assuring access to safe medicines in pregnancy and breastfeeding [^115wAs6r]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

New medicines are usually supported by nonclinical studies to assess potential reproductive toxicity, from conception through embryo‐fetal stages, birth, and sexual maturation. Generally intended as informed screening tests, these can also provide insight into potential risks associated with in utero exposure. However, it is well known that outcomes in animal testing do not necessarily correlate with clinical outcomes, resulting in uncertainty about translating findings to human risk. This is the case for many reasons, some rooted in different species pharmacology and physiology, but many in how testing is conducted and assessed. For example, animal studies focus on maternal, not fetal exposure; mechanistic insights are limited; studies are limited in size; and exposure is typically throughout pregnancy, making it difficult to assess how shorter exposures may relate to human use.

Nonclinical approaches also focus on using a limited number of doses that result in establishing possible harm rather than likely harm in the fetus at clinically relevant doses, which in some cases is an important distinction. Unfortunately, rather than facilitating informed clinical studies in pregnant women to proceed, the approach serves as a barrier. Any adverse effect from preclinical data, even at exposures higher than those anticipated in pregnant women (and similarly in animal breastfeeding studies), tends to result in recommendations to avoid use, and further investigative studies (animal, mechanistic, or human) are rarely pursued to elucidate clinical risk.

### Halaven [^116MsTu9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Based on findings from an animal reproduction study and its mechanism of action, Halaven can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. There are no available data on the use of Halaven during pregnancy. In an animal reproduction study, eribulin mesylate caused embryo-fetal toxicity when administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis at doses below the recommended human dose [see Data]. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.

The estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically-recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

- **Data**: In an embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study, pregnant rats received intravenous infusion of eribulin mesylate during organogenesis (Gestation Days 8, 10, and 12) at doses approximately 0.04, 0.13, 0.43, and 0.64 times the recommended human dose, based on body surface area. Increased abortion and severe fetal external or soft tissue malformations, including the absence of a lower jaw and tongue, or stomach and spleen, were observed at doses 0.64 times the recommended human dose of 1.4 mg/m² based on body surface area. Increased embryo-fetal death/resorption, reduced fetal weights, and minor skeletal anomalies consistent with developmental delay were also reported at doses at or above a maternally toxic dose of approximately 0.43 times the recommended human dose.

### Difficulties in the study of adverse fetal and neonatal effects of drug therapy during pregnancy [^115oWT2U]. Seminars in Perinatology (2001). Low credibility.

This article reviews the difficulties in studying adverse effects of drugs during pregnancy on the fetus and newborn. A study design should strive for prospective recording of drug intake during pregnancy, comparison to appropriate control groups adjusted for inherited traits, and single drug exposures for evaluation of specific syndromic causation, such as the Fetal Hydantoin Syndrome. Animal models are best used in the mechanistic study of adverse drug effects on the fetus rather than for screening for adverse effects. Careful conclusions about the causation of drug-induced adverse effects are needed to avoid false associations while providing appropriate safeguards to the fetus and newborn.

### SPL drug information for midazolam hydrochloride [^112UVWLM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of midazolam hydrochloride IM (also known as Nayzilam) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: avoid use due to evidence of fetal harm in humans. The US FDA categorizes it in pregnancy category D. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking it, the patient should be informed of the potential harm to the fetus. Neonates exposed to this drug in the last weeks of pregnancy or in high doses during labor and delivery should be monitored for irregularities in fetal heart rate, hypotonia, poor sucking, hypothermia, and moderate respiratory depression. If used during pregnancy, monitor the newborn for acute withdrawal syndrome symptoms during the postnatal period.

The drug, midazolam hydrochloride IM, is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. Due to its pharmacological effects, this drug has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate. These effects, although not causing malformations, may be reversible.

### Safety of dermatologic medications in pregnancy and lactation: Part I. Pregnancy [^116azAkk]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Dermatologists frequently face questions about the safety of commonly prescribed topical and systemic medications during pregnancy and lactation from women of childbearing age who are pregnant, considering pregnancy, or breastfeeding. Safety data, particularly regarding medications that are unique to dermatology, can be difficult to locate and are not consolidated in a single reference guide for clinicians. Parts I and II of this continuing medical education article provide a capsule summary of key points for the most commonly prescribed dermatologic medications to facilitate patient medication risk counseling in pregnancy.

A summary table details safety classification data for three primary international classification systems: the US Food and Drug Administration, the Swedish Catalogue of Approved Drugs, and the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee. Additionally, this table includes an alternative pregnancy classification system developed by a consortium of active members of teratology societies in the US and Europe, detailed in "Drugs during Pregnancy and Lactation: Treatment Options and Risk Assessment", and a safety classification system developed for breastfeeding mothers, detailed in "Medications and Mother's Milk".

### SPL drug information for acetaminophen / caffeine / dihydrocodeine bitartrate [^112EtxXN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of acetaminophen / caffeine / dihydrocodeine PO (also known as Trezix) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: insufficient evidence. The drug acetaminophen / caffeine / dihydrocodeine PO (also known as Trezix) is classified under category A in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by a large number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without any proven increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the fetus having been observed.

### Over-the-counter medications in pregnancy [^113ZfqGq]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Use of desloratadine PO (also known as Clarinex) in pregnant patients across all trimesters should be reserved for situations where it is clearly needed. First-generation and second-generation antihistamines do not appear to increase fetal risk in any trimester. According to the British Association of Dermatologists guidelines, loratadine or cetirizine can be offered as acceptable second-generation H1-antihistamines during pregnancy, preferably after the first trimester. Desloratadine PO is classified under category B1 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This classification indicates that while a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age have taken the drug, no increase in malformations or other harmful effects on the human fetus has been observed. Animal studies have also not shown evidence of increased fetal damage.

### Safety of antihypertensive medications in pregnancy: Living with uncertainty [^116n23Mp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The safety of antihypertensive medications during pregnancy remains a topic of ongoing debate and research. In their study, Mito et al. explore the complexities and challenges associated with prescribing these medications to pregnant women. The authors highlight the lack of comprehensive data and the necessity for more rigorous clinical trials to determine the safest options for managing hypertension during pregnancy.

Current guidelines often offer conflicting recommendations, which can complicate decision-making for healthcare providers. The study stresses the importance of balancing potential risks to both the mother and the fetus while considering individual patient circumstances.

The authors call for increased collaboration among researchers and practitioners to generate robust evidence that can guide clinical practices more effectively. This approach would help address the uncertainties and improve outcomes for pregnant women requiring antihypertensive therapy.

### Veozah [^116aSYcD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

There are no data on Veozah use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In embryo-fetal toxicity animal studies with fezolinetant, embryo-lethality occurred at high doses above the human therapeutic dose in rats and rabbits, but no teratogenicity was observed. In the pre- and post-natal development animal study, delayed parturition and embryo-lethality occurred at high doses above the human therapeutic dose in rats. Additionally, in male offspring, delayed reproductive maturation was observed, characterized by incomplete preputial separation, which affected male fertility at doses above the human therapeutic dose in rats [see Data].

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

- **Animal data**: In embryo-fetal development toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, embryo-lethality was noted at the highest doses (128- and 174-fold the human AUC24 at the human therapeutic dose for rats and rabbits, respectively). The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for embryo-fetal development was 50 mg/kg/day in rats and 45 mg/kg/day in rabbits (62- and 16‑fold the human AUC24 at the human therapeutic dose for rats and rabbits, respectively). Fezolinetant showed no effects on fertility and early embryonic development in rats [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

### Central neuromodulators in irritable bowel syndrome: Why, how, and when [^112TsL7t]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Central neuromodulators are considered safe during pregnancy, especially TCAs, SNRIs, mirtazapine, and AAPs. Although SSRIs appear to be less safe, they are the most prescribed antidepressants during pregnancy; however, publications questioning the safety profile of SSRIs appear to have confounding factors that may produce questionable results, such as maternal age, smoking, and/or concomitant use of other medications like anticonvulsants.

While SSRIs are the most used neuromodulators during pregnancy, evidence shows that their use is associated with reduced fetal head growth and increased risk of preterm birth. Avoid paroxetine as it is related to congenital heart defects compared with other SSRIs. Other birth defects may be related to the use of SSRIs. Thus, sertraline seems to increase the risk of heart defects and craniosynostosis, citalopram with cardiac malformations, and escitalopram with musculoskeletal malformations.

SNRIs during pregnancy do not appear to be associated with an increased risk of birth defects; however, although the evidence is not extensive, SNRIs have been associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage, particularly venlafaxine with hypertension during pregnancy.

Treating with central neuromodulators during pregnancy should balance its associated risks. If the patient is stabilized on a specific drug, it is preferable to maintain the same treatment, except for paroxetine. If it is a woman who has not received treatment with neuromodulators, the use of TCAs, mirtazapine, AAPs, and SNRIs is recommended.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use during early pregnancy and congenital malformations: A systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies of more than 9 million births [^115UQhQ4]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The report of this systematic review and meta-analysis followed the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) group. Before study selection, the protocol for this review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018088358).

- **Methods**:

- **Data sources and searches**:
	- PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library were searched from database inception to January 17, 2018. The search strategy combined medical subject heading (MeSH) and Embase subject heading (EMTREE) terms with other unindexed or free-text terms. Details of the full search strategy are provided in Additional file 2. Reference lists of retrieved articles and previous systematic and narrative reviews were searched manually to retrieve all relevant documents. No language restrictions were imposed.

- **Study selection**:
	- Cohort studies or randomized controlled trials reporting original data were eligible if they reported any congenital malformations in infants born to mothers exposed to SSRIs or individual SSRIs (citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, or fluvoxamine) during the first trimester. Studies must have included a comparison group of pregnant women not exposed to any antidepressants and/or teratogens such as folic acid antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, anticonvulsants, coumarin derivatives, and retinoids. If a risk estimate was not reported, studies needed to provide necessary distributions of exposure, non-exposure, cases, and non-cases from which a risk estimate could be calculated.

### Over-the-counter medications in pregnancy [^111NGFuu]. American Family Physician (2023). Low credibility.

High-quality research on the safety and effectiveness of over-the-counter medications in pregnancy is limited. Physicians should explore nonpharmacologic treatments before recommending medication. For nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), H1 antihistamines, and ginger are safe and effective. Physicians can recommend calcium carbonate, H2 antihistamines, and proton pump inhibitors for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Osmotic laxatives, fiber preparations, and probiotics are safe and effective treatments for constipation. Many over-the-counter topical medications are safe in pregnancy due to low systemic absorption, but topical retinoids, such as adapalene, should be avoided. Hypertonic saline nasal rinse and antihistamines are safe, beneficial options for treating pregnancy-induced rhinitis, and intranasal corticosteroids have demonstrated benefit for chronic allergic rhinitis. The safety of acetaminophen for the treatment of headaches and low back pain during pregnancy has come into question with recent studies; therefore, judicious use is advised. Physicians should screen all pregnant patients for their risk of developing preeclampsia and initiate low-dose aspirin from 12 weeks' gestation until delivery for those at increased risk. Data are limited on the safety and effectiveness of herbal supplements during pregnancy.

### Fluoxetine hydrochloride [^1135GzXf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Pregnancy category C**: Fluoxetine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes regardless of drug exposure.

- **Treatment of pregnant women during the first trimester**: There are no adequate and well-controlled clinical studies on the use of fluoxetine in pregnant women. Results of a number of published epidemiological studies assessing the risk of fluoxetine exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy have demonstrated inconsistent results. More than 10 cohort studies and case-control studies failed to demonstrate an increased risk for congenital malformations overall. However, one prospective cohort study conducted by the European Network of Teratology Information Services reported an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations in infants born to women (N = 253) exposed to fluoxetine during the first trimester of pregnancy compared to infants of women (N = 1,359) who were not exposed to fluoxetine. There was no specific pattern of cardiovascular malformations. Overall, however, a causal relationship has not been established.

- **Nonteratogenic effects**: Based on data from published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage. Neonates exposed to fluoxetine and other SSRIs or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors…

### Adzynma [^115L8mKq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

- **Risk summary**: The safety of Adzynma for use during pregnancy has not been established in controlled clinical trials. Limited data with Adzynma use during pregnancy are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. In determining whether Adzynma should be used in pregnancy, healthcare providers should balance the potential benefits with the potential risks.

The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage in the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

- **Data**

- **Human data**: There have been four cTTP patients exposed to Adzynma during pregnancy.

	- Two patients in a long-term extension study were found to be pregnant early in the first trimester while receiving prophylaxis with Adzynma. Both patients were discontinued from the study to comply with the protocol requirements. The first patient had no further exposure to Adzynma and had a first trimester miscarriage approximately two months after study discontinuation. The investigator assessed the event was unrelated to Adzynma. The second patient resumed treatment with Adzynma under a compassionate use program and delivered a healthy full-term baby with no safety concerns reported by the investigator.

### Fetzima [^1164oJSC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

- **Clinical considerations**: Women who discontinued antidepressants during pregnancy were more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continued antidepressants. This finding is from a prospective, longitudinal study that followed 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. Consider the risk of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum.

- **Maternal adverse reactions**: Use of Fetzima in the month before delivery may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

- **Fetal/neonatal adverse reactions**: Neonates exposed to SNRIs or SSRIs, including Fetzima, late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, and hypotonia.

### Akeega [^1175XfeY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Pregnancy**:

	- **Risk summary**: The safety and efficacy of Akeega have not been established in females. Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)], Akeega can cause fetal harm and potential loss of pregnancy. There are no human data on the use of Akeega in pregnant women. Niraparib has the potential to cause teratogenicity and/or embryo-fetal death since it is genotoxic and targets actively dividing cells in animals and patients (e.g. bone marrow) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Due to the potential risk to a fetus, animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies were not conducted with niraparib.

	- **Data**: In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of abiraterone acetate to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental effects at maternal exposures approximately ≥ 0.03 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended dose.

	- **Animal data**:
		- **Niraparib**: Niraparib is genotoxic and targets actively dividing cells. Animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies were not conducted with niraparib.
		- **Abiraterone acetate**: In an embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study in rats, abiraterone acetate caused developmental toxicity when administered at oral doses of 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg/day throughout the period of organogenesis (gestational days 6–17). Findings included embryo-fetal lethality, indicated by increased post-implantation loss and resorptions, and a decreased number of live fetuses, as well as fetal developmental delays.

### Contrave extended-release [^113msDkD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In clinical studies, 21 (0.7%) of 3,024 women became pregnant while taking CONTRAVE: 11 carried to term and gave birth to a healthy infant, three had elective abortions, four had spontaneous abortions, and the outcomes of three pregnancies were unknown.

Data from the international bupropion Pregnancy Registry (675 first-trimester exposures) and a retrospective cohort study using the United Healthcare database (1,213 first-trimester exposures) did not show an increased risk for malformations overall.

No increased risk for cardiovascular malformations overall has been observed after bupropion exposure during the first trimester. The prospectively observed rate of cardiovascular malformations in pregnancies with exposure to bupropion in the first trimester from the international Pregnancy Registry was 1.3% (9 cardiovascular malformations out of 675 first-trimester maternal bupropion exposures), which is similar to the background rate of cardiovascular malformations (approximately 1%). Data from the United Healthcare database and a case-control study (6,853 infants with cardiovascular malformations and 5,763 with non-cardiovascular malformations) from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS) did not show an increased risk for cardiovascular malformations overall after bupropion exposure during the first trimester.

Study findings on bupropion exposure during the first trimester and risk for left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) are inconsistent and do not allow conclusions regarding a possible association. The United Healthcare database lack.

### Vistaril [^1156Lirv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

**Contraindications**: Hydroxyzine, when administered to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, induced fetal abnormalities in the rat and mouse at doses substantially above the human therapeutic range. Clinical data in humans are inadequate to establish safety in early pregnancy, and until such data are available, hydroxyzine is contraindicated in early pregnancy. Hydroxyzine is also contraindicated in patients with a prolonged QT interval. Additionally, hydroxyzine pamoate is contraindicated for patients who have shown a previous hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Hydroxyzine is further contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to hydroxyzine products, as well as in those with known hypersensitivity to cetirizine hydrochloride or levocetirizine hydrochloride.

### Hydroxyzine hydrochloride [^112dz8Ju]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

**Contraindications**: Hydroxyzine hydrochloride intramuscular solution is intended only for intramuscular administration and should not, under any circumstances, be injected subcutaneously, intra-arterially, or intravenously. Hydroxyzine is contraindicated in patients with a prolonged QT interval. This drug is contraindicated for patients who have shown a previous hypersensitivity to it. When administered to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, hydroxyzine induced fetal abnormalities in rats at doses substantially above the human therapeutic range. Clinical data in humans are inadequate to establish safety in early pregnancy. Until such data are available, hydroxyzine is contraindicated in early pregnancy.

### Science-based approach to harmonize contraception recommendations in clinical trials and pharmaceutical labels [^1146w9ee]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). High credibility.

The primary risk associated with toxicity to the male and/or female reproductive tissues, such as the testis and/or ovary, is reduced fertility and not adverse pregnancy outcomes or fetal risk following the establishment of pregnancy (implantation). Although it is possible that gonadal toxicants could result in adverse pregnancy outcomes, published examples demonstrate genetic and/or developmental toxicity in addition to gonadal toxicity, such as the case with cyclophosphamide. Following an exhaustive search, we have been unable to find any published examples, including drugs, environmental, and industrial chemicals, and no convincing data to support that gonadal toxicity, in the absence of genetic and/or developmental toxicity, can induce malformations or embryo‐fetal lethality. We thus conclude that gonadal toxicity alone should not serve as a justification for contraception recommendations.

Mid‐gestation evaluation of early embryo lethality is included following maternal and paternal dosing prior to conception, with a duration of dosing sufficient to induce gonadal toxicity as part of the guideline‐driven fertility study. However, these guidelines do not require the potential for malformations or fetal lethality later in gestation to be explored as part of the fertility study because this is typically evaluated separately in the EFD study that uses female subject only dosing after the establishment of pregnancy (implantation). Whereas some sponsors combine fertility and EFD assessments in a single study, which may or may not include male dosing, there is no regulatory requirement to evaluate such.

### Does lack of exposure to individual antidepressants at different points during pregnancy associate with reduced risk of adverse newborn outcomes [^117ApNdn]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

- **Maternal characteristics and outcomes**: For women prescribed antidepressants at any point during pregnancy, data are presented as n (% with characteristic or outcome) in individual groups. The cohort included 2,741 women, of whom 262 were prescribed more than one drug, accounting for a total of 3,006 drug prescriptions. The percentages are based on the number of women in the cohort or on the number of women exposed to each drug, unless specified otherwise. Note that there are statistically significant rate differences in outcome distribution between the drugs (p < 0.05).

- **Exposure profile**: This is based on when prescription orders were placed relative to the estimated due date. Pre-pregnancy is defined as up to 100 days before the last menstrual period. The first trimester extends from the last period to 14 weeks of gestation, the second trimester from 15 to 28 weeks, and the third trimester after 28 weeks. Percentages are provided for the number of women with exposure at different times for each drug.

### Documentation of contraception and pregnancy when prescribing potentially teratogenic medications for reproductive-age women [^112xdSzr]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Certain medications are identified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as class D or X because they increase the risk for birth defects if used during pregnancy.

- **Objective**: To assess pregnancy rates and the frequency of contraceptive counseling documented with prescriptions for class D or X drugs filled by women of reproductive age.

- **Design**: Description of prescriptions filled in 2001.

- **Setting**: A large health maintenance organization in northern California in 2001.

- **Patients**: 488,175 women aged 15 to 44 years who filled a total of 1,011,658 class A, B, D, or X prescriptions.

- **Measurements**: Medications dispensed, contraceptive counseling, and pregnancy testing.

- **Results**: A class D or X prescription was filled by 1 of every 6 women studied. Women who filled a prescription for class D or X medications were no more likely than women who filled prescriptions for safer, class A or B medications to have received contraceptive counseling, filled a contraceptive prescription, or been sterilized (48% vs. 51% of prescriptions). There was little variation by clinical indication in rates of contraceptive counseling with class D or X prescriptions, except for isotretinoin. Women who filled a class D or X prescription were only slightly less likely to have a pregnancy documented within 3 months than women filling a class A or B prescription (1.0% vs. 1.4% of prescriptions).

- **Limitations**: International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes underestimate contraceptive counseling. Documentation of a positive pregnancy test after filling a prescription may not be accurately captured.

### SPL drug information for midazolam hydrochloride [^112nX1Ga]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of midazolam hydrochloride (also known as Nayzilam) orally in pregnant patients for all trimesters: avoid use as there is evidence of fetal harm in humans. It is classified as a US FDA pregnancy category D drug. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking it, the patient should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus.

Neonates exposed to this drug in the last weeks of pregnancy or in high doses during labor and delivery should be monitored for irregularities in fetal heart rate, hypotonia, poor sucking, hypothermia, and moderate respiratory depression. If used during pregnancy, monitor the newborn for acute withdrawal syndrome symptoms during the postnatal period.

Midazolam hydrochloride orally is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, due to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

### An update on maternal medication-related embryopathies [^1156Pvv9]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Low credibility.

There is a general perception that any exposure to medication during pregnancy poses a potential risk to the fetus. Most available data about teratogenic drugs is derived from animal studies, case reports, or cohort studies. As a result, counseling women and their partners about the safety of drugs during pregnancy can be difficult due to limited information about the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and teratogenicity of some drugs. However, this should always be done in the context of weighing potential teratogenic risks against the perinatal risks of an untreated medical or psychiatric condition. Ideally, this counseling should occur prior to a planned pregnancy so that medications and treatment of chronic medical conditions can be optimized. It is important that clinicians providing antenatal care are able to confidently manage women, including utilizing appropriate resources. This paper aims to review a selected (non-exhaustive) list of the most commonly prescribed medications considered significant human teratogens and provides recommendations for pre-conception and antenatal counseling.

When a woman suffering from a hematological condition is contemplating pregnancy, she may need to continue the use of medications that do not have sufficient evidence of fetal safety. We discuss the evidence existing for some therapies of major hematological conditions in the context of major principles in clinical teratology. It is critical to always balance the potential fetal risks of the drug in question against the maternal and fetal risks of the untreated hematological condition.

### Science-based approach to harmonize contraception recommendations in clinical trials and pharmaceutical labels [^112WnXgQ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). High credibility.

A scientifically justified sponsor position highlights that human pregnancy exposure data are typically either not available or very limited both during drug development and for an average of 27 years following a drug is marketed, unless data are proactively collected in a registry. Therefore, contraception recommendations to minimize potential risk associated with human pregnancy exposure are based on available nonclinical data (including genotoxicity and embryo-fetal developmental toxicity), characteristics of the drug, and the study population.

Although the same set of nonclinical genetic and developmental toxicity data inform contraception recommendations, differences in the risk management approach often arise between clinical trials and the postmarketing setting due to the totality of the available nonclinical data and the desire to minimize pregnancies during clinical trials. Before all necessary data have been gathered on the risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, the highest category of concern is assumed.

Contraception recommendations must take into account the risk of pregnancy exposure for both exposed women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and female sexual partners of exposed male subjects. The starting point is to determine the population that will be using the product for the indication under development in clinical trials and for marketed products (both the approved indication as well as expected off-label use). If the population that the pharmaceutical is intended to treat includes WOCBP and/or male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential, an algorithm can be followed.

### Medication exposure during pregnancy: A pilot pharmacovigilance system using health and demographic surveillance platform [^117U2kNh]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

The study focused on the following pregnancy information: pregnancy outcomes (miscarriage, stillbirth, or live birth), mother's complications at delivery, number of babies born, birth weight, gestational age at delivery (estimated from the last date of normal menstrual period [LNMP], or fundal height examination when LNMP was unknown), and any congenital abnormalities. In the case of home delivery, women were advised to take the baby to the hospital within seven days post-delivery for proper examination.

Congenital abnormalities were assessed post-delivery by a study clinician or health facility midwife. Screening for congenital abnormalities was performed using a specifically developed checklist. The screening was limited to the identification of external abnormalities, regardless of the degree of severity. No examination was performed to determine neurological scores for sensory or motor patterns. Cases with suspected anomalies were referred to the district and regional hospital for appropriate management.

Pregnancy risk of drug exposure during the pregnancy period was categorized according to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The US FDA classifies drugs into five categories to describe their risk of teratogenicity: Category A (adequate and well-controlled studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in all trimesters), Category B (animal reproductive studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women), Category C (animal reproductive studies hav…

### Obstetric toxicology: Teratogens [^113VA1V8]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The emergency physician frequently encounters women who seek care for pregnancy- and nonpregnancy-related complaints. Many medications are safe for use during pregnancy, including several listed as potential teratogens based on the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) pregnancy classification. However, it is important for the emergency physician to know and recognize which drugs can be administered during pregnancy and which are absolutely contraindicated. Expert resources should be identified and utilized because the FDA's classification of drugs based on pregnancy risk does not represent the most up-to-date or accurate assessment of a drug's safety.

### SPL drug information for hydroxyzine pamoate [^114si9UN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of hydroxyzine pamoate PO (also known as Vistaril):

- **Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as hydroxyzine has rarely been associated with acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis.

- **CNS depression**: Use extreme caution when using concurrently with CNS depressants, such as narcotics, non-narcotic analgesics, and barbiturates.

- **Somnolence**: Use extreme caution in patients performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating machinery.

- **Torsade de pointes**: Use caution in patients with risk factors for QT prolongation, congenital long QT syndrome, a family history of long QT syndrome, other conditions predisposing to QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia, or taking other QT-prolonging drugs, as well as recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, and bradyarrhythmias.

### Fyarro [^116ySRFN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Risk summary**: Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action, Fyarro can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. Although there are no data on the use of Fyarro in pregnant women, there are limited data on the use of sirolimus during pregnancy. In animal studies, oral sirolimus was embryo/fetotoxic in rats at sub-therapeutic doses. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.

	- The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

- **Data**:

	- **Animal data**: Reproductive studies in animals have not been performed with Fyarro. Studies with an oral formulation of sirolimus have shown that it crosses the placenta and is toxic to the conceptus.

		In rat embryo-fetal development studies, pregnant rats were administered an oral formulation of sirolimus during the period of organogenesis (Gestational Day 6–15). Sirolimus produced embryo-fetal lethality at 0.5 mg/kg and reduced fetal weight at 1 mg/kg. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for fetal toxicity in rats was 0.1 mg/kg. Maternal toxicity (weight loss) was observed at 2 mg/kg. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 1 mg/kg.

### Prescription medications for use in pregnancy-perspective from the US Food and Drug Administration [^1127v51N]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Obstetrical healthcare providers frequently field questions about the safety of medications recommended or prescribed to their pregnant patients. Most women use at least one medication during pregnancy; however, there is little information about the safety or appropriate dosing of many medications during this phase of life. Additionally, the development of drugs for use in pregnant women trails behind the development of drugs intended for other sectors of the population. Our goal is to inform the obstetrics community about the US Food and Drug Administration's authority and their role in approving drugs for marketing.

We begin with the statutes that led to the creation of the Food and Drug Administration and its organization. We then cover drug development and the Food and Drug Administration review process, including the role of the advisory committee. The different types of drug approvals are discussed, with some specific examples. Finally, we enumerate the drugs specifically approved for use in obstetrics and contrast them with drugs commonly used by pregnant women and drugs used "off-label" during pregnancy. The Food and Drug Administration is committed to protecting and advancing the public health of pregnant women by guiding the development and ensuring the availability of effective and safe therapeutics for obstetrical indications and for medical conditions during pregnancy. We hope this review will inspire more research addressing drug use during pregnancy.

### SPL drug information for clemastine fumarate [^113767ga]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of clemastine PO (also known as Dayhist, Tavist) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. There is evidence of fetal harm in humans. Most antihistamines generally are not recommended for use in pregnancy, especially during the third trimester, because of a seizure risk to the fetus. Additionally, antihistamines should be avoided in the last two weeks of pregnancy due to a possible association between these drugs and retrolental fibroplasia in premature neonates.

Other antihistamines would be preferred to clemastine if an antihistamine is necessary for use. The drug clemastine PO (also known as Dayhist, Tavist) is classified under category A in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by a large number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without any proven increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the fetus having been observed.

### Thalomid [^1146KfsK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Contraindications**: Thalomid is contraindicated in the following situations:

4.1 Pregnancy
Thalomid is contraindicated in females who are pregnant. Thalomid can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Thalomid is a powerful human teratogen, inducing a high frequency of severe and life-threatening birth defects, even following a single dose [see Boxed Warning]. Mortality at or shortly after birth has been reported in about 40% of infants. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential risk to a fetus. If pregnancy occurs during Thalomid treatment, the drug should be discontinued immediately.

4.2 Hypersensitivity
Thalomid is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug or its components [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16)].

Regarding the use of hydroxyzine pamoate PO (also known as Vistaril) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: avoid use, as there is evidence of fetal harm in animals. Do not use in early pregnancy. Hydroxyzine pamoate PO is classified under category A in the Australian categorization system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This classification indicates that the drug has been taken by a large number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without any proven increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the fetus having been observed.

### Hyzaar [^1141mLoP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Hyzaar can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Hyzaar as soon as possible (see Clinical Considerations).

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

### Efficacy and safety of praziquantel for the treatment of human schistosomiasis during pregnancy: a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1112XvJG]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2016). High credibility.

With respect to safety outcomes, both the Ugandan study and our study did not observe significant differences in the rate of congenital anomalies or other serious adverse events when comparing the praziquantel and placebo groups. Our study additionally captured abortion, defined as fetal loss occurring before 20 weeks gestation, which in this case would have been within 4–8 weeks of praziquantel dosing. There were no differences between groups in either abortion or rates of fetal death in utero at any point in gestation. Taken together, these studies contribute key toxicology data regarding the use of praziquantel during human pregnancy, supporting its safety at different time points after 12 weeks gestation.

In WHO guidelines from 2002 and 2006, it was recommended that all schistosomiasis-infected pregnant and lactating women be considered high-risk groups and be offered treatment with praziquantel individually or during treatment campaigns. These recommendations were based on safety from animal studies, as well as inadvertent exposures during human pregnancy, rather than data from controlled trials in humans. As such, the recommendations did not provide conclusive data regarding safety and, due in part to this constraint, many schistosomiasis-endemic regions continue to exclude pregnant and lactating women from both MDA and individualized treatment programs. Results from this study, together with the Ugandan study, should provide necessary reassurance that praziquantel given after 12 weeks gestation is safe, effectively treats schistosomiasis, and may improve both maternal and fetal health outcomes.

### Safety of medication use during pregnancy in mainland China: Based on a national health insurance database in 2015 [^112xfvXh]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Low credibility.

Medication safety during pregnancy has drawn global attention, and little has been reported about the Chinese population. This study aims to describe patterns and risks of medication use among pregnant women in mainland China with reference to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pregnancy risk category.

- **Methods**: Hospital diagnostic and drug dispensing information of a national representative sample of basic medical insurance (BMI) beneficiaries was obtained from the China Health Insurance Association (CHIRA) database in 2015. The prevalence of use and the number of medicines involved in each risk category were calculated. Most commonly used medicines from each risk category were illustrated. Factors associated with the use of category D/X medicines were evaluated through multiple logistic regression.

- **Results**: Out of 11,373 women who had singleton deliveries in 2015, there were 2,896 women with records covering their entire pregnancies, 5,377 with records through the 2nd trimester, and 7,946 with records through the 3rd trimester. It was found that 11.1% of pregnant women used at least one medication, and a total of 321 medications had been used during pregnancy. Most pregnant women used medicines classified as FDA category C (66.2%), followed by category B (57.8%), category A (16.8%), category X (7.5%), and category D (5.0%). The most commonly used medicines from category D and X were anxiolytics and hormonal preparations, respectively. Women who were from the mid-western area (p = 0.045) or used four or more medications (p < 0.001) were more likely to use category D/X medicines.

### Re-analysis of safety data supporting doxylamine use for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^116cYCFd]. American Journal of Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Antihistamines are commonly used to treat nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP). We re-analyzed the 24 primary studies cited in a 1997 meta-analysis that concluded antihistamine use for NVP was safe as they had been studied in more than 200,000 participating women and the pooled odds ratio for congenital malformations was 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.60–0.94). Our analysis of this meta-analysis showed that 139,414 women were included in 22 original studies involving antihistamines, 129,108 of which were in studies involving doxylamine. In these studies, 23,485 women were exposed to antihistamines, 14,624 of which were exposed to doxylamine.

The summary relative risk (cohort studies) and odds ratio (case-control studies) for congenital malformations from antihistamine exposure were 1.09 (95% CI: 1.01–1.18) and 1.04 (95% CI: 0.91–1.19). For doxylamine exposure, the summary relative risk and odds ratio were 0.94 (95% CI: 0.80–1.10) and 1.07 (95% CI: 0.93–1.23), respectively.

Although not a new systematic review, our re-analysis demonstrates that the safety data for antihistamines, and doxylamine in particular, are based on many fewer than 200,000 participating women and exposures. Furthermore, doxylamine use is not associated with a decreased risk of malformations as previously reported.

### SPL drug information for fluphenazine decanoate [^116PnL4B]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of fluphenazine IM in pregnant patients for all trimesters, use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. There is evidence of fetal harm in animals. It is crucial to monitor neonates for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms. Neonates exposed during the third trimester are at risk of developing severe and/or prolonged side effects, such as agitation, hyper/hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder. The side effects have varied in severity and duration, with some neonates requiring intensive care support and prolonged hospitalization.

### Improving safe and effective use of drugs in pregnancy and lactation: Workshop summary [^11233en9]. American Journal of Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

Human embryogenesis, the initial stages of cell division and differentiation of the human embryo, relies on the ability of stem cells to divide, migrate, and specialize. This intricate process results in vulnerability and increased risk of teratogenicity. The teratogenic period can be particularly severe from day 31 after the last menstrual period in a 28-day cycle to 71 days thereafter. In this timeframe, teratogens may induce malformations noticeable at birth. Exposure to teratogens prior to day 31 may result in an "all-or-nothing" effect, where the conceptus either does not survive or survives with anomalies. It is also possible for the fetus to survive without anomalies due to tissue regeneration.

In addition to developmental susceptibility, functional maturation begins in utero and continues into the postnatal period, a time that also presents potential harm. Differential susceptibility exists by trimester of pregnancy and organ system. Several examples illustrate how specific fetal malformations are caused by exposure to medications during critical times in pregnancy, including thalidomide, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and certain antiepileptic medications.

- **Risk assessment**: The evaluation of the teratogenic risk of a given drug is complex. It is ultimately based on animal, human, and pharmacologic data when available. Scientific evidence of teratogenicity relies on nonclinical data, drug class characteristics, and biological plausibility.

### Safety of medication use during pregnancy in mainland China: Based on a national health insurance database in 2015 [^115EaSuG]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Low credibility.

Medication safety during pregnancy has drawn constant attention globally since the thalidomide disaster in the 1960s. Information on prenatal medication safety is seriously lacking since pregnant women are usually excluded from pre-marketing clinical trials out of ethical concerns. Animal studies as a source of reference also have significant limitations and should be interpreted with caution. To facilitate clinical decision-making, many countries have developed a classification system based on existing clinical and animal evidence to describe the risks of medication use during pregnancy, such as the Swedish system (Farmaceutiska Spesialiteter i Sverige, FASS), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pregnancy risk category, and the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) classification.

The FDA pregnancy risk category was developed in 1979, consisting of five categories (A, B, C, D, and X) based on published evidence of the risks and benefits of medication use during pregnancy. According to the Requirements on Content and Format of Labeling for Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products (21 CFR Part 201) issued in 1979, there were two subsections under the "Pregnancy" part: (i) Teratogenic effects, which refer mainly to the risk of fetal abnormalities related to medication use; (ii) Nonteratogenic effects, which refer mainly to the drug's effects on reproduction or nonteratogenic effects in the fetus or newborn infant, such as withdrawal symptoms or hypoglycemia. While highlighting the toxicological consideration of antenatal medication use, this system provides essential guidance for evaluating medication safety during pregnancy.

### Drug safety: Pregnancy rating classifications and controversies [^113wNMsC]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

This contribution consolidates data on international pregnancy rating classifications, including the former US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Swedish, and Australian classification systems, as well as the evidence-based medicine system, and discusses discrepancies among them. It reviews the new Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule (PLLR) that replaced the former FDA labeling system with narrative-based labeling requirements. PLLR emphasizes human data and highlights pregnancy exposure registry information. In this context, the review discusses important data on the safety of most medications used in the management of skin disease in pregnancy. There are also discussions of controversies relevant to the safety of certain dermatologic medications during gestation.

### SPL drug information for trifluoperazine hydrochloride [^1156eTvx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of trifluoperazine hydrochloride PO in pregnant patients across all trimesters, it should be used only if the benefits outweigh potential risks. There is evidence of fetal harm in animal studies. The drug is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. Due to its pharmacological effects, trifluoperazine hydrochloride PO has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate without causing malformations. However, these effects may be reversible.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of reproductive health in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases [^111iPfjW]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the use of sulfasalazine PO (also known as Azulfidine) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if clearly needed. Continue sulfasalazine during pregnancy for rheumatic and musculoskeletal indications, and consider continuing it for IBD. Consider folate supplementation during pregnancy. Sulfasalazine PO is classified under category A in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by a large number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without any proven increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the fetus having been observed.

### Management of urticaria: Not too complicated, not too simple [^114L7UUy]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

During pregnancy, urticaria should be managed using the minimum effective level of medication. The use of H1-antihistamines, preferably second-generation, is recommended as the first therapeutic step. However, no H1-antihistamine is categorized as A regarding safety in pregnancy. Category B for safety in pregnancy includes loratadine, cetirizine, levocetirizine, and chlorpheniramine. Hydroxyzine is contraindicated in pregnancy as specified in the product's information.

Lactation also poses challenges for treating chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). During lactation, only loratadine and cetirizine are recommended among H1-antihistamines. The minimum possible dose and shortest duration of treatment should be used, considering the benefits versus potential risks. H1-antihistamines are excreted in breast milk. Chlorpheniramine should be avoided as it can cause sedation and poor feeding in infants.

Similar to rheumatologic diseases or asthma, systemic corticosteroids may be administered for CSU during pregnancy. However, they should only be used at the lowest doses and for the shortest duration due to concerns such as congenital malformations during the first trimester, neonatal adrenal insufficiency, and low birthweight. Despite these concerns, the absolute risk remains low. Additionally, systemic corticosteroids have potential risks including hypertension, gestational diabetes, and preterm delivery.

### Common teratogenic medication exposures-a population-based study of pregnancies in the United States [^115UWBCy]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2024). Low credibility.

Risk mitigation for most teratogenic medications relies on risk communication via drug labels, and prenatal exposures remain common. Information on the types of and risk factors for prenatal exposures to medications with teratogenic risk can guide strategies to reduce exposure.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to identify medications with known or potential teratogenic risk commonly used during pregnancy among privately insured persons.

- **Study design**: We used the Merative™ MarketScan® Commercial Database to identify pregnancies with live or non-live outcomes, including ectopic pregnancies, spontaneous and elective abortions, and stillbirths among persons aged 12 to 55 years from 2011 to 2018. Start and end dates of medication exposure and pregnancy outcomes were identified via an adapted algorithm based on validation studies. We required continuous health plan enrollment from 90 days before conception until 30 days after the pregnancy end date. Medications with known or potential teratogenic risk were selected from TERIS (Teratogen Information System) and drug monographs based on the level of risk and quality of evidence, including 138 with known and 60 with potential risk. We defined prenatal exposure based on at least one outpatient pharmacy claim or medical encounter for medication administration during target pregnancy periods, considering medication risk profiles (e.g. risk only in the first trimester or at a certain dose threshold). Sex hormones and hormone analogs, as well as abortion and postpartum/abortion hemorrhage treatments, were not considered teratogenic medications because of challenges.

### FDA drug labeling for pregnancy and lactation drug safety monitoring systems [^111wJywQ]. Seminars in Perinatology (2015).

The product label required by the FDA for every drug approved for marketing in the U.S. is a legal document that originates with the company that wants to market the drug, but it must be approved by the FDA. Despite the recognized limitations of registries, the FDA's new labeling rule, effective from July 1, 2015, has given the data available from post-marketing surveillance priority in the new label.

For this information to be maximally useful to both providers and consumers, providers must refer as many exposed consumers as possible to the registries, preferably prior to knowledge of the outcomes of the pregnancies. Consumers need to cooperate with the registries to share their health information with as much detail as possible with the registries. It will take years to accumulate a meaningful quantity of information in many of the registries, but they promise to be our best hope for useful counseling information in the future.

### Paracetamol use during pregnancy - a call for precautionary action [^112FuyBg]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2021). Low credibility.

In vivo, in vitro, and ex vivo studies have shown that APAP directly perturbs hormone-dependent processes, including inhibition of androgen production, increased oestrogen production, disruption of steroidogenesis, depletion of sulfated sex hormones, perturbation of immune function, induction of oxidative stress, and indirect activation of the endocannabinoid system. Independently of APAP, these processes have been implicated as mechanisms related to the development of neurodevelopmental and reproductive disorders. In addition to potential effects on neuronal and reproductive development, a combination of clinical studies and experimental work in animal models and cell lines has suggested that APAP exposure during pregnancy might decrease fetal haematopoietic stem cell numbers, alter steroidogenesis in the placenta, and induce placental damage.

Studies of intrauterine APAP exposure have found effects on development in both mouse and rat models. In these studies, doses ranged from the maximum safe dose for a pregnant woman of 50 mg/kg per day to 1,430 mg/kg per day. The majority of studies have used between 200 and 400 mg/kg per day, which is well within the appropriate range for comparing animal and human exposure studies, if the difference in body size is taken into consideration. Hence, for such studies, a system of allometry (how anatomy, physiology, and behavior change based on body size) based on body surface area is normally applied, where mouse and rat dose data are divided by a factor of 12.33 and 6.2, respectively.
