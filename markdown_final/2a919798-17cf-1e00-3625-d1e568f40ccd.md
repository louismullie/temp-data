## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which statements are true when R² equals exactly zero in a regression model. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definition of R² and what it implies about explained variance. Then, I should verify what that means for the slope coefficients in both simple and multiple regression. Next, I will examine whether the fitted surface is horizontal and what the intercept must be. Finally, I will double-check for any exceptions or edge cases before selecting the correct option.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't jump to conclusions: R² is the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables, so R² = 0 means none of the variability in y about its mean is explained by the model, which directly supports statement (iii) [^notfound].

> Now, I should verify what that implies for the slope coefficients. In ordinary least squares, R² = 0 occurs when the predictors have no linear relationship with the outcome, which in turn forces all partial regression coefficients (slopes) to be zero; wait, let me verify that I'm not overstating this — yes, in OLS, if R² is exactly zero, the fitted slopes are zero, so statement (i) is correct [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should confirm the geometric interpretation. If all slopes are zero, the fitted regression surface is flat (horizontal) with respect to each explanatory variable, meaning the predicted value does not change as any X changes; that aligns with statement (ii) being true [^notfound].

> Next, I will examine the intercept. My first instinct is to say the intercept must be zero, but wait, let me verify that because I need to ensure I'm not conflating the slope being zero with the intercept being zero. The intercept is the predicted value of y when all Xs are zero, and when R² = 0 the best-fitting model is simply the mean of y, so the intercept equals the mean of y and is not necessarily zero; therefore, statement (iv) is false [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider the full set of statements to avoid a mistake: (i) slopes are zero, (ii) the fitted surface is horizontal, (iii) no variance is explained, and (iv) intercept is zero — only the first three are true, so the correct choice is C, not D or any of the others [^notfound].

---

When R² = 0, the regression model explains **none of the variance** in the dependent variable [^notfound]. This means all slope coefficients are zero (i), the fitted line is **horizontal** (ii), and the model has not explained any variability in y about its mean (iii). However, the intercept is **not necessarily zero** (iv); it equals the mean of y. Therefore, the correct answer is **C. (i), (ii), and (iii) only**.

---

## Interpretation of R² = 0

R² measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables. When R² = 0, the model explains **none of the variance**, indicating no linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables [^notfound].

---

## Implications for regression coefficients

### Slope coefficients (i)

When R² = 0, all slope coefficients are **zero** because there is no linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. The model reduces to a horizontal line at the mean of y, indicating no change in y for any change in x [^notfound].

---

### Intercept coefficient (iv)

The intercept coefficient is **not necessarily zero** when R² = 0. It equals the mean of the dependent variable, as the best-fitting line is a horizontal line at ȳ. Only if the mean of y is zero will the intercept be zero [^notfound].

---

## Geometric interpretation of the fitted line

The fitted regression line is **horizontal** (ii), indicating no relationship between the independent and dependent variables. This aligns with the interpretation that the model explains none of the variance in y [^notfound].

---

## Explained variability (iii)

The regression model has **not explained any variability** in y about its mean value (iii). This is the definition of R² = 0, indicating no explanatory power of the independent variables [^notfound].

---

## Summary of implications

| **Statement** | **True/false** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|-|
| (i) All coefficient estimates on the slopes will be zero | True | No linear relationship implies zero slopes [^notfound] |
| (ii) The fitted line will be horizontal with respect to all explanatory variables | True | No relationship implies a horizontal line [^notfound] |
| (iii) The regression line has not explained any of the variability of y about its mean value | True | R² = 0 means no explained variance [^notfound] |
| (iv) The intercept coefficient estimate must be zero | False | Intercept equals mean of y, not necessarily zero [^notfound] |

---

## Conclusion

When R² = 0, the regression model explains **none of the variance** in the dependent variable. This implies that all slope coefficients are zero, the fitted line is horizontal, and the model has not explained any variability in y about its mean. However, the intercept coefficient is not necessarily zero; it equals the mean of the dependent variable. Therefore, the correct answer is **C. (i), (ii), and (iii) only**.

### Regression: understanding what covariates and confounds Do in adjusted analyses [^204cc71f]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

The use of regression analysis is common in research. This article presents an introductory section that explains basic terms and concepts such as independent and dependent variables (IVs and DVs), covariates and confounds, zero-order correlations and multiple correlations, variance explained by variables and shared variance, bivariate and multivariable linear regression, line of least squares and residuals, unadjusted and adjusted analyses, unstandardized (b) and standardized (β) coefficients, adjusted R 2, interaction terms, and others. Next, this article presents a more advanced section with the help of 3 examples; the raw data files for these examples are included in supplementary materials, and readers are encouraged to download the data files and run the regressions on their own in order to better follow what is explained in the text (this, however, is not mandatory, and readers who do not do so can also follow the discussions in the text). The 3 examples illustrate many points. When important covariates are not included in regressions, the included IVs explain a smaller proportion of the variance in the DV, and the relationships between the included IVs and the DV may not be correctly understood. Including interaction terms between IVs can improve the explanatory value of the model whether the IVs are intercorrelated or not. When IVs are intercorrelated (such as when one is a confound), although their net effect in multivariable regression may explain a greater proportion of the variance in the DV, their individual b and β coefficients decrease in proportion to the shared variance that is removed. Thus, variables that were found statistically significant in unadjusted analyses may lose statistical significance in fully adjusted analyses. Readers may find it useful to keep these points in mind when running regressions on their data or when reading studies that present their results through regressions.

### Can perioperative hemodilution be monitored with non-invasive measurement of blood hemoglobin? [^e9a1ce3d]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Linear relationships

Linear relationships were evaluated by comparing non-invasive and invasive Hb on a regression plot. The scatter was used as the measure of precision and expressed as the coefficient of determination (r 2) of the regression line. The coefficient of determination is the fraction of the variability of y (non-invasive Hb) that can be explained by x (invasive Hb). A high r 2 is desirable, as it implies that data scattering around the regression line is small.

Whether the non-invasive decreases as much as the invasive Hb during hemodilution is a different issue. We use the slope, i.e. the steepness, of the regression line between these two variables to express the accuracy of a series of non-invasive measurements in the same subject. A slope lower than 1.0 means that the numerical change in non-invasive Hb is less than that for the invasive Hb. Values higher than 1.0 denote the opposite relationship.

### Why do phase III trials of promising heart failure drugs often fail? The contribution of "regression to the truth" [^1cb06d14]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2003). Low credibility.

There has been considerable recent disappointment with the failure of a number of major new pharmacological strategies for the treatment of chronic heart failure. In turn, there has been much speculation as to why trials of these therapies have not shown benefit. Among a number of plausible and scientifically valid reasons, consideration should be afforded to the potential contribution of "regression to the truth". Regression to the truth derives from the biological concept of regression to the mean, whereby random fluctuations in a biological variable occur over time, such that the true value of the variable is approached with repeated measurements. This same concept can be applied to clinical trial programs for new drugs for heart failure. Because only strongly positive trials generally go on to phase III testing, and some of these early phase studies are positive by chance alone, on retesting in phase III the results are very likely not be as strongly positive. Numerous examples of regression to the truth apply for trials of heart failure therapies, as well as in other areas. A major concern is how to minimize negative outcomes in phase III trials. One approach is to perform major rigorous phase II testing. Alternatively, avoidance of phase II testing will minimize "regression to the truth" because there are no data in phase II from which regression might occur. However, this approach does not obviate the need for an evaluation process in the selection of candidate agents (and their appropriate dose) in order to proceed to definitive testing.

Allergen extract test variability and statistical requirements — "For the radial immunodiffusion method, the correlation coefficient of the reference dose response line should be at least 0.9," and "A single concentration for a test extract is reproducible to ± 25% when estimated from the calculated regression line." Regarding immunoinhibition analyses, "the frequently used methods of comparing extracts at extrapolated 50% inhibition values is without special meaning when this procedure is used for standardization of extracts." In prospective evaluation, testing "assessing more than 45 sets of data from 3 individual investigators" showed that "The variability is proportional to the number of test methods, all of which should be performed at least in duplicate"; "For 3 tests, the calculated variability was 47% to 213%, and for 5 tests, it was 56% to 180%."

### Linear regression in medical research [^94d408a7]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Linear regression is used to estimate the association of ≥ 1 independent (predictor) variables with a continuous dependent (outcome) variable. In the most simple case, thus referred to as "simple linear regression," there is only one independent variable. Simple linear regression fits a straight line to the data points that best characterizes the relationship

between the dependent (Y) variable and the independent (X) variable, with the y -axis intercept (b 0), and the regression coefficient being the slope (b 1) of this line:

A model that includes several independent variables is referred to as "multiple linear regression" or "multivariable linear regression." Even though the term linear regression suggests otherwise, it can also be used to model curved relationships.

Linear regression is an extremely versatile technique that can be used to address a variety of research questions and study aims. Researchers may want to test whether there is evidence for a relationship between a categorical (grouping) variable (eg, treatment group or patient sex) and a quantitative outcome (eg, blood pressure). The 2-sample t test and analysis of variance, which are commonly used for this purpose, are essentially special cases of linear regression. However, linear regression is more flexible, allowing for > 1 independent variable and allowing for continuous independent variables. Moreover, when there is > 1 independent variable, researchers can also test for the interaction of variables — in other words, whether the effect of 1 independent variable depends on the value or level of another independent variable.

### Regressing an optimal variable to scale glomerular filtration rate: more variations in glomerular filtration rate are explained [^83ea15fa]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

To compare glomerular filtration rate (GFR) among individuals, GFR is usually scaled to body surface area (BSA) based on the ratio method, which has been debated for its accuracy in recent years. Reference to the BSA as a normalization standard is the most common method currently in use but has limitations. This study was designed to a better variable to scale GFR.

Methods

We measured 99mTc- diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid plasma clearance (uncorrected GFR, uGFR) for 322 healthy adults who were enrolled according to the SENIEUR protocol. The individuals were randomly grouped into A and B for regressing and validating the optimal variable, respectively. Nonlinear regression was performed against uGFR, and the selected independent variables were body weight, height, age, and sex.

Results

Among several tested models, the regression coefficients of weight-age formula (W-A) were in narrower 95% confidence interval (CI). The coefficient of determination of the regression line between W-A and uGFR, as an indicator to explain the percentage of variations of GFR, was higher than that of other variables in both groups. The coefficient of determination of the regression line between W-A and uGFR was 0.571, which was higher than that of BSA (0.203) or TBW (0.241).

Conclusion

The index variable, based on both body weight and age, has a better statistical relationship to uGFR and is a better variable to scale GFR in adults.

Regression analysis of phase shift

Figure 3 presents a clear phase shift in the seasonal cycle as a function of length-scale. In order to quantify the phase shift, we need to first extract a meaningful set of (k ℓ, time) points. To that end, we extract, for each k ℓ, the (i) times corresponding to the lowest 10% (dark blue in Fig. 3), (ii) two middle-most 10% for the two zero-crossings (white in Fig. 3), and (iii) highest 10% (dark red in Fig. 3) of the normalized deviations presented in Fig. 3. This is essentially extracting the (k ℓ, time)-coordinates for the line of darkest red, darkest blue, and the two white lines, resulting in a total of four regression sets. Periodic phase adjustment to the days of the year is applied to maintain monotonicity in time, and the k ℓ grid is truncated to focus on regimes with a clear linear trend. The extracted data points are shown as the dots/vertical bars in Fig. S3 in the SM, along with their corresponding regression fits.

Figure 7 presents the linear regression slope analysis for the data shown in Fig. S3. The different regression analyses generally agree well, with 12 of the 16 regression sets indicating a 35–45 day time-lag per octave of spatial scales. From this analysis, we conclude that length-scales that differ by a factor of two (i.e. ℓ 1 / ℓ 2 = 2) have seasonal cycles that are off-set by 41 ± 3 days. Scales that differ a decade (ℓ 1 / ℓ 2 = 10) would correspondingly have a phase shift of 136 ± 10days, or roughly 4.5 months.

Vertical dashed lines separate the data sources, with the text along the top indicating the source data and hemisphere. Diamonds indicate the regression slope estimate, dark envelopes the 75% confidence interval, and light envelopes the 95% confidence interval. The r -value for each regression fit is printed alongside the corresponding slope distribution. The left-most illustration, separated by a thick black line, presents the mean (diamond) and confident intervals (envelopes) across the 16 regression analyses. In the legend, 'min' means the lowest 10% z-score, 'mid' the two middle-most 10% groups, and 'max' the highest 10%.

### Species interactions can explain Taylor's power law for ecological time series [^c24c43a3]. Nature (2003). Excellent credibility.

One of the few generalities in ecology, Taylor's power law, describes the species-specific relationship between the temporal or spatial variance of populations and their mean abundances. For populations experiencing constant per capita environmental variability, the regression of log variance versus log mean abundance gives a line with a slope of 2. Despite this expectation, most species have slopes of less than 2 (refs 2, 3–4), indicating that more abundant populations of a species are relatively less variable than expected on the basis of simple statistical grounds. What causes abundant populations to be less variable has received considerable attention, but an explanation for the generality of this pattern is still lacking. Here we suggest a novel explanation for the scaling of temporal variability in population abundances. Using stochastic simulation and analytical models, we demonstrate how negative interactions among species in a community can produce slopes of Taylor's power law of less than 2, like those observed in real data sets. This result provides an example in which the population dynamics of single species can be understood only in the context of interactions within an ecological community.

### Year-by-year blood pressure variability from midlife to death and lifetime dementia risk [^6600125c]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Figure 2 presents HRs of dementia for BPV and mean SBP at each age from 60 to 90 years. Meta-regression suggested that the association of BPV with elevated dementia risk only developed nonlinearly with older age. The meta-regression line explained 63% of heterogeneity between HRs. The difference in association between SBP and dementia risk with older age was inversely linear, with meta-regression explaining 45% of heterogeneity between HRs.

Figure 2.

Depicted are best-fitting regression lines: nonlinear for BPV and linear for SBP, with shaded areas representing credible intervals. R 2 values represent the percentages of heterogeneity between the HRs at different ages explained by each regression line. Change in association between BPV and dementia risk with older age best fit a nonlinear vs linear model (Akaike information criterion [AIC], −72.9 vs −64.3). Change in association between SBP and dementia risk with older age best fit a linear vs nonlinear model (AIC, −84.2 vs −85.9).

### Algorithms for converting estimates of child malnutrition based on the NCHS reference into estimates based on the WHO child growth standards [^49a27bcc]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Results

In total, 64 national and 4 research surveys were selected from the WHO global database. The age coverage of the surveys was: 0–60 months for 64 surveys, 0–36 months for 2 surveys, and 1 each for 3–60 and 6–60 months. The total number of national/regional estimates used for creating the algorithms for underweight, stunting and wasting was 271. For overweight, the sample size was decreased to 255 since the NCHS-based estimate of overweight was not available from the database for 16 surveys.

The scatter plots of the two prevalence estimates, WHO vs. NCHS, used for algorithm estimation are presented in Figure 1. The observed estimates are very close to the fitted regression lines in the prevalence scale.

Figure 1
Observed WHO and NCHS prevalence estimates and fitted regression lines in the algorithm estimation. ▲: scatter plot of the observed WHO vs. NCHS prevalence estimates. —: fitted regression line in the prevalence scale.

Table 1 presents the parameter estimates from the simple linear regressions in the logit scale. The correlation coefficients, R 2, are all greater than 0.90, indicating that most of the variability of the dependent variable, logit (P WHO), can be explained by the fitted model for each algorithm. The point estimates of the slopes are greater than 0.9 for all four indicators; and assuming they are equal to "1", the odds ratios of the two prevalence estimates, WHO vs. NCHS, can be approximated by the exponential function of the intercept, i.e. exp [intercept], which are 0.84, 1.24, 1.03 and 1.26 for underweight, stunting, wasting and overweight, respectively. As shown in Table 1, among all the parameter estimates of the model, only the intercept from the wasting algorithm is not significant; the others, intercepts and slopes, are all significant at the 5% level, with their 95% CIs not including "0".

Fig. 4
Empirical distribution of estimated variance components for high and low F ST G × E interaction. Distributions of G × E variance attributable to high and low F ST SNPs for grain yield (a) and plant height (b) from 1000 replicated model fittings. 1248 high F ST SNPs were included, while each model fitting used a subsample of 1248 low F ST SNPs chosen randomly from the full set of 263,243 low F ST SNPs. Proportion variance explained represents non-environmental model variance, i.e. was calculated using only genotype, G × E for high and low F ST SNPs, and residual variances

Classification of variants associated with G × E

To determine whether significant SNPs controlling G × E are primarily genic or non-genic, we first quantified plasticity of each hybrid using a method similar to that originally described by Finlay and Wilkinson. We started by performing simple linear regression of each hybrid's location-specific phenotypes against an environmental gradient, which was calculated as the mean phenotype at each location of the common hybrids that were grown across at least 20 environments. We did this separately for plant height, ear height, days to silk and anthesis, and grain yield. Using the slope and MSE parameters resulting from these regressions, we were able to assess two measures of plastic response for each hybrid. These measures of plasticity are also referred to as type II and type III stability. Lines that are said to display type II stability have a response to changing environments that is parallel to the average response for that environmental gradient. Genotypes with a slope near one have changes in performance parallel to the checks, and are therefore determined to be type II stable. Type III stability is characterized by having little variation around a line regressing performance on ordered environmental indices. In the case of this experiment, hybrid lines with low MSE are considered to be type III stable. By using slope and MSE as the response variables in GWAS, we were able to identify genomic loci that are associated with different types of stability. Additionally, we performed GWAS on the traits per se using the hybrid line best linear unbiased predictions (BLUPs) derived from the experimental design random effects model.

Figure 1:
A linear regression model fits a straight line (in blue) as close as possible to every data point (in black) on the scatterplot. The difference between each data point and the line produced by the model is called the "residual," represented here by the red lines.

Figure 2:
Scatterplots with linear regression line, residual plots, normal probability plots and histograms of residuals for both an example of a linear relationship, and an example of a non-linear relationship in which linear regression clearly does not fit the data. In the linear example (A), the residuals are spread randomly around the regression line (A1–A3), following an approximate normal distribution (A4), indicating a constant variance of residuals (i.e. homoscedasticity). In the non-linear example (B), a pattern is visible in the distribution of residuals (B1–B3), and the residuals follow a skewed, non-normal, distribution (B4), indicating heteroscedasticity — an important departure from the linear regression assumption of constant variance of residuals.

It should be noted that linear regression is not the only model that relies on a linear relationship; this assumption is common across many statistical models. In the case of linear regression, the model coefficient is interpreted as the change in outcome for a one-unit increase in the independent variable, and that this effect is constant across the full range of the independent variable. Logistic regression, for instance, used to model binary outcomes, also relies on the assumption of a linear relationship between a continuous independent variable and the log-odds — or logit — of the outcome occurring. Similar to linear regression, the modeled coefficient is interpreted as the change in the log-odds of the outcome occurring for every unit increase in the continuous independent variable. A residual plot of the continuous independent variable on the X-axis and the residuals on the Y-axis may help reveal any non-linear patterns in logistic regression. As mentioned above, splines can also be used exploratively to visualize the relationship between the continuous independent variable on the X-axis and the log odds on the Y-axis.

### Advanced statistics: linear regression, part I: simple linear regression [^18239641]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Simple linear regression is a mathematical technique used to model the relationship between a single independent predictor variable and a single dependent outcome variable. In this, the first of a two-part series exploring concepts in linear regression analysis, the four fundamental assumptions and the mechanics of simple linear regression are reviewed. The most common technique used to derive the regression line, the method of least squares, is described. The reader will be acquainted with other important concepts in simple linear regression, including: variable transformations, dummy variables, relationship to inference testing, and leverage. Simplified clinical examples with small datasets and graphic models are used to illustrate the points. This will provide a foundation for the second article in this series: a discussion of multiple linear regression, in which there are multiple predictor variables.

### Tenecteplase (Tnkase) [^a45b0564]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12	CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1	Mechanism of Action

Tenecteplase is a modified form of human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) that binds to fibrin and converts plasminogen to plasmin. In the presence of fibrin, in vitro studies demonstrate that tenecteplase-mediated conversion of plasminogen to plasmin is increased relative to its conversion in the absence of fibrin. This fibrin specificity decreases systemic activation of plasminogen and the resulting degradation of circulating fibrinogen as compared to a molecule lacking this property. The clinical significance of fibrin-specificity on safety (e.g., bleeding) or efficacy has not been established.

12.2	Pharmacodynamics

Following administration of 30, 40, or 50 mg of TNKase, there are decreases in circulating fibrinogen (4%–15%) and plasminogen (11%–24%).

12.3	Pharmacokinetics

Distribution

In patients with STEMI, TNKase administered as a single IV bolus exhibits a biphasic disposition from the plasma.

Volume of distribution at central compartment ranges from 4.22 to 5.43 L, approximating plasma volume. Steady-state volume of distribution was approximately 50% greater (6.12 to 8.01 L), suggestive of some extravascular distribution.

Elimination

After IV bolus administration, the terminal phase half-life of tenecteplase was 90 to 130 minutes. In 99 of 104 patients treated with TNKase, TNKase has linear PK with mean maximum concentrations increased in a dose-proportional manner and mean plasma clearance was similar for the 30, 40, and 50 mg doses ranging from 99 to 119 mL/min.

Metabolism

Liver metabolism is the major clearance mechanism for tenecteplase.

Body weight

A stepwise linear regression analysis indicated that total body weight explained 19% of the variability in plasma clearance and 11% of the variability in volume of distribution.

### A robust and interpretable machine learning approach using multimodal biological data to predict future pathological tau accumulation [^7db99ad6]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Prognostic index predicts individual variability in trajectories of regional tau accumulation in asymptomatic and mildly impaired samples

Using the ADNI3 sample we fit linear regression equations to test whether the continuous prognostic index (derived from the model trained on ADNI2/GO) predicts individual variability in future tau accumulation. Of the 11 regions that were shown to significantly accumulate tau (Fig. 4b) 7 showed a significant relationship between the prognostic index and individual rates of future tau accumulation, explaining up to 21% of variance in the temporal lobe and medial regions of the posterior parietal cortex (Supplementary Table 5). Figure 6a shows an example case of the relationship between our prognostic index and rate of tau accumulation in Fusiform gyrus, a region that is known to be susceptible to early pathological tau deposition in AD.

### White matter degeneration pathways associated with tau deposition in Alzheimer disease [^50e22e06]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Another line of evidence that supports the association between WM NDI and tau burden can be deduced based on the variance explained from the multiple linear regression models with 29 WM NDI as the input variables and Braak flortaucipir SUVRs as outcomes. These 29 WM NDIs accounted for 30.15% variance of the flortaucipir SUVR in Braak I region, 27.80% to flortaucipir SUVRs in Braak III/IV regions, and 19.92% to Braak V/VI regions, respectively. Moreover, when the input parameters were reduced from 29 to 10 most contributing and independent NDIs selected by LASSO, the regression model still explained 15.02% variance of Braak I flortaucipir SUVR, 17.67% to Braak III/IV flortaucipir SUVR, and 13.70% to Braak V/VI flortaucipir SUVR.

### Non-linear relationships in clinical research [^7d93540b]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 3:
The raw data points (in black) clearly indicate a non-linear relationship between the independent variable and the outcome, which is poorly fit by a linear regression line (in blue). Categorization according to tertiles of the independent variable (in red) seems to better reflect the relationship between the two variables, particularly for the lower two tertiles. However, the third tertile does not reflect the underlying data very well, and may obscure the underlying trend as it encompasses a wide range of outcome values. A simple linear spline with knots placed at x = 2.5 and x = 7.5 provides more flexibility, and a better representation of the data (green). A restricted cubic spline function fits the data best (purple), with knots placed at tertiles of the independent variable.

The consequences of categorization differ depending on the type of study. In prediction models, categorization of an important predictor may mask valuable predictive information, limiting model accuracy. Increasing the number of categories may help recover part of this information, but at the loss of statistical power. Similarly, in causal research, adjusting for a continuous confounder using categorization can lead to residual confounding due to the loss of information caused by categorization. An additional issue arises with changes in the independent variable at the threshold of each category, which may lead to abrupt, stepwise changes in the outcome. For example, age-adapted CKD definitions use eGFR thresholds to define CKD by age group. While the advantage of these definitions is that they account for normal age-related decline in kidney function, they can lead to abrupt, unrealistic, changes in CKD diagnosis status around birthdays, as a result of which they move from one age category to another, even without a change in their eGFR, which is problematic.

Based on the variable selection procedure described in the Methods, body weight change, HbA1c change, apoC‐III change, baseline body weight and sex entered the regression model explaining triglyceride changes (Table S5). Changes in apoC‐III levels explained up to 22.9% of the variability in triglycerides in the two highest tirzepatide dose groups, whereas tirzepatide‐induced weight loss only explained up to 4.4%.

### Introduction to statistical modelling 2: categorical variables and interactions in linear regression [^5a3f2495]. Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

In the first article in this series we explored the use of linear regression to predict an outcome variable from a number of predictive factors. It assumed that the predictive factors were measured on an interval scale. However, this article shows how categorical variables can also be included in a linear regression model, enabling predictions to be made separately for different groups and allowing for testing the hypothesis that the outcome differs between groups. The use of interaction terms to measure whether the effect of a particular predictor variable differs between groups is also explained. An alternative approach to testing the difference between groups of the effect of a given predictor, which consists of measuring the effect in each group separately and seeing whether the statistical significance differs between the groups, is shown to be misleading.

### Impact of water quality on chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) in thunukkai division in mullaitivu district, Sri Lanka [^8a585147]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

By using Geographic information system (GIS) software (ArcGIS 10.1) mapping was conducted for nitrate, phosphate, total hardness, total dissolved solid, fluoride and Arsenic content in water.

Physicochemical parameters of the test samples were compared with those of the control samples and the Sri Lankan standards for potable water. To assess the correlation between water quality parameters and serum creatinine levels of the CKDu patients, linear regression, model was used. Through this analysis, relationships between the target variable (dependent variable) and a set of independent variables (covariates) were quantified. The regression equation estimates a coefficient for each variable. The goal of regression analysis is to generate the line that best fits the observations. However, the best fitted line for the data leaves the least amount of unexplained variation, such as the dispersion of observed points around the line. The following formula describes the linear relationship between dependent and independent variables.

Where, dependent variable (Y) is the serum creatinine levels of the CKDu patient. Independent variables; a-nitrate, b-fluoride, c- phosphate, d- Total Dissolved Solid, e- Total hardness, f- Arsenic content in water. Intercept β0- is a constant that defines where the linear trend line intercepts the Y-axis. Coefficient β1, β2, β3, β4, β5 and β6; constants that represent the rate of change in the dependent variable as a function of changes in the independent variable. It is the slope of the linear line. Error, represents the unexplained variation in the target variable. It is treated as a random variable that picks up all the variation in Y that is not explained by X.

Multiple linear regression model to predict the motor outcome at T3, measured as the % variation in UPDRS III score between baseline and T3 (dependent variable).

For each dependent variable beta (B), standardized beta (S Beta), standard error (std. Error), p values, and confidence interval (CI) are reported.

We also tested the power of the clinical assessment alone to predict the motor outcome. So, we built a multiple linear regression model including as independent variables the UPDRS III score at T0 and LEDD at T3 and as dependent variable the percentage of variation in UPDRS III between T3 and T0. This model was able to explain only the 13.5% of the variance (R square 0.187, adjusted R square 0.135, p 0.04).

### Using multilevel models and generalized estimating equation models to account for clustering in neurology clinical research [^bc7f3349]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

A random coefficient model is described in the right panel of Figure 4. In this hypothetical situation, we have used a random coefficient model to regress individuals' systolic blood pressure on age, allowing both the intercept and slope for age to vary across clusters. There is 1 regression line per cluster. The cluster-specific regression lines have different slopes and different intercepts. The thick solid red line denotes the average regression line across the population of clusters.

When fitting a multilevel model, one obtains 2 sets of parameter estimates. When fitting the random intercept model in formula (2), one obtains estimates of the 2 fixed effects:One also obtains an estimate of the variance of the random effects: The estimates of the fixed effects have an interpretation similar to that arising from a similar GLM fit to nonclustered data, with one important distinction. The distinction is that the regression coefficients have a conditional interpretation: they are interpreted as conditional on the random effect. Thus, for the random intercept model described by formula (2), the regression coefficientdenotes the mean change in the outcome in women, compared with men, who are of the same age and who belong to clusters with the same value of the cluster-specific random effects. In our experience, this is rarely mentioned in applied articles when interpreting the regression coefficients.

When fitting model 3 that allows for random slopes, one obtains estimates of the distribution of each of the regression coefficients:For the kth regression coefficient, one would say thatdenotes the mean or average cluster-specific regression coefficient across the clusters whiledenotes the variance of the distribution of cluster-specific regression coefficients across the clusters. Larger values of this variance indicate greater variability in the regression coefficients across clusters.

The simple multilevel models described in formulas (2) and (3) incorporate individual-level covariates (age and sex). However, multilevel models can incorporate variables measured at any level of the hierarchy. Thus, given a 3-level data hierarchy with patients (level-1 units) nested within attending physicians (level-2 units) who in turn are nested within hospitals (level-3 units), a multilevel model could incorporate patient, physician, and hospital characteristics.

### Logistic regression in medical research [^cbe948a6]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure.
Relationship between a continuous independent variable X and a binary outcome that can take values 0 (eg, "no") or 1 (eg, "yes"). As shown, the probability that the value of the outcome is 1 seems to increase with increasing values of X. A, Using a straight line to model the relationship of the independent variable with the probability provides a poor fit; results in estimated probabilities < 0 and > 1; and grossly violates the assumptions of linear regression. Logistic regression models a linear relationship of the independent variable with the natural logarithm (ln) of the odds of the outcome variable. B, This translates to a sigmoid relationship between the independent variable and the probability of the outcome being 1, with predicted probabilities appropriately constrained between 0 and 1.

Logistic regression is actually an extension of linear regression. Rather than modeling a linear relationship between the independent variable (X) and the probability of the outcome (Figure A), which is unnatural since it would allow predicted probabilities outside the range of 0–1, it assumes a linear (straight line) relationship with the logit (the natural logarithm of the odds) of the outcome. The regression coefficients represent the intercept (b 0) and slope (b 1) of this line

### Influence of footwear fitting on feet morphology in 9 year old girls [^b7730555]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

✱ p < 0.05

The total impact of predictors characterizing indoor footwear on the value of the Wejsflog index was statistically significant for the right (F = 10.37; p < 0.001) and left foot (F = 13.02; p < 0.001). Taking into account the right foot, the predictors explained a total of 17% of the variance of the dependent variable (R 2 = 0.17), and in the case of the left one 21% of the variance of the dependent variable (R 2 = 0.21). The analysis of simple regression results, taking into account the exclusive influence of each of the explanatory variables on the dependent variable, showed that in the case of the right and left shoes, the size of the length excess has a statistically significant impact on the Wejsflog index. The slope coefficient of the regression line for these variables was b = − 0.02 and b = − 0.01, respectively. This means that the increase in the length excess by a unit will affect the reduction of the Wejsflog index by 0.02 (right foot) and 0.01 (left foot). The size of the width excess of the left indoor shoe had a statistically significant impact on Wejsflog index. The slope coefficient of the regression line for these variables has reached the value of 0.01. This means that the increase in the width excess by a unit affects the increase in Wejsflog index by the value equal to 0.01.

The influence of prediction variables on the heel angle (γ) of the left foot was statistically significant (F = 5.38; p = 0.006). These variables jointly explained 10% of the variation of the heel angle (R 2 = 0.10). Simple regression showed that only the influence of the length excess of the indoor footwear on the heel angle of the left foot was statistically significant (r p = 0.31; p = 0.001). The slope of the regression line for variables: the length excess of the indoor footwear and the heel angle of the right foot was b = 0.19, which means that if the shoe length increases by a unit, then the heel angle will increase on average by 0.19°.

3.4 Association between gait domain and global cognitive performance

Gait domains that differed significantly between groups (rhythm, variability, and postural control), were included as predictors of MoCA scores (global cognition) in a linear regression model to test their association with progressive cognitive impairment. Among all affected gait domains, only gait variability was significantly associated with MoCA score in the whole sample (unstandardized Beta = −0.852, 95% CI ‐1.229 to ‐0.474; P < .0001). Gait variability was also independently associated with MoCA score in the AD spectrum(Controls+SCI+MCI+AD participants) (P < .0001). In another linear regression model in the PD spectrum of cognitive decline (PD+PD‐MCI+PDD) the association between gait variability and MoCA score was also significant (unstandardized Beta, ‐1.569, P = 0.001) (see Tables S3 to S5). This association, however, was attenuated by 33.6% when we included the parkinsonism severity (UPDRS‐III score) as a covariate in the model, but remained statistically significant (unstandardized Beta, ‐1.042, P = 0.02). There was a weak but significant association between parkinsonian signs and gait variability in the PD cohort (unstandardized Beta,.025, P = 0.01). When MoCA and UPDRS‐III score were included as predictors of gait variability, only MoCA was significantly associated with gait variability (unstandardized Beta, ‐.066, P = 0.04). To test whether gait variability better explained cognitive performance compared with a clinical motor scale, we modeled another linear regression having UPDRS‐III and gait variability as predictors of MoCA scores. The results showed that gait variability (Beta,.30, P = 0.009) significantly explained MoCA scores better than UPDRS‐III (Beta,.16, P = 0.156). Overall, high gait variability was significantly associated with low global cognition in AD and PD classes. ROC analysis showed that variability could not significantly classify or discriminate AD from the PD group (AUC = .48, P = 0.62).

### Variability explained by strength, body composition and gait impairment in activity and participation measures for children with cerebral palsy: a multicentre study [^b9116127]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the amount of variability in scores on activity and participation measures used to assess ambulatory individuals with cerebral palsy explained by strength, body composition, gait impairment and participant characteristics.

Design

Multicentre prospective cross-sectional study.

Setting

Seven paediatric-orthopaedic specialty hospitals.

Participants

Three hundred and seventy-seven ambulatory individuals (241 males, 136 females) with cerebral palsy, Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels I-III (I = 148, II = 153, III = 76), ages 8–18 years (mean 12 years 9 months, SD 2 years 8 months).

Methods

Participants completed assessments of GMFCS level, patient history, lower extremity muscle strength, Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-66), Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (PODCI), instrumented gait analysis, 1 minute walk test, Timed Up-and-Go and body composition. Multiple linear regression and bootstrap analyses were performed for each outcome measure, stratified by GMFCS level.

Results

The amount of variability in outcome measures explained by participant characteristics, strength, and gait impairment ranged from 11% to 50%. Gait impairment was the most common predictor variable and frequently explained the greatest variance across all outcome measures and GMFCS levels. As gait impairment increased, scores on outcome measures decreased. Strength findings were inconsistent and not a primary factor. Body composition contributed minimally (< 4%) in explaining variability. Participant characteristics (cerebral palsy type, gestational age and age at walking onset), were significant predictor variables in several models.

Conclusions

Variability in outcome measure scores is multifaceted and only partially explained by strength and gait impairment illustrating the challenges of attempting to explain variation within this heterogeneous population. Clinicians treating individuals with cerebral palsy should consider this when developing treatment paradigms.

### Replication timing alterations are associated with mutation acquisition during breast and lung cancer evolution [^ecf71040]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Comparison analyses of the association of alterations in RT and chromatin structure with the mutation distribution across the genome

To explore whether the variability in local mutation burden across the genome in BRCA tumours can be better explained by RT or chromatin structure in normal or cancer cells, we conducted multiple linear regression models. First, we applied 4 univariate linear regression models for both BRCA cell lines (MCF-7 and T47D) separately with the mutation load in BRCA tumours as an independent variable and the RT signal (Repli-seq log2-ratio) and chromatin compartment signal (Hi-C values) in normal (HMEC) and cancer cells as the dependent variable, respectively. Afterwards, we compared the resulting R 2 -values between the 4 models for both BRCA cell lines. To evaluate whether RT in cancer is still the best predictor in a multivariate setting, we z-transformed the RT signal and chromatin compartment signal in normal (HMEC) and cancer (MCF-7 and T47D) cells and used the resulting values as dependent variables in a multivariate linear regression model with mutation load in BRCA tumours as independent variable. Due to the z-transformation, we were able to compare the absolute estimate values between the different values to explore which of them contributes the most in explaining the variability in the mutation distribution across the genome.

### Associations between diagnosis with type 2 diabetes and changes in physical activity among middle-aged and older adults in the United States [^d31d96d2]. Innovation in Aging (2020). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

To examine whether changes in PA occurred following diagnosis (turning points) and whether any changes were sustained over time (trajectories), we estimated piecewise linear mixed-effects models. This approach enabled us to partition the effect of independent variables into intervals — with separate regression lines for each interval — and included random intercepts to account for observations nested within respondents. Piecewise analysis is considered an appropriate strategy for examining trajectories and transitions in PA, particularly as they relate to a critical period or specific event.

The first regression line was estimated for the survey waves leading up to the diagnosis, reflecting changes in PA before diagnosis. The second regression line was estimated for the survey waves after diagnosis (including the wave of diagnosis), representing changes in PA following diagnosis. These two regression lines were estimated in a combined model, allowing us to determine the change in the slope (reflecting change in the rate of PA decline between the prediagnosis and postdiagnosis intervals) and the change in the intercept (reflecting a change in PA shortly after diagnosis).

To strike a balance between model fit and parsimony, we estimated a series of nested models in a hierarchical regression framework by adding variables to a previous model at each step. The first model estimated the unadjusted effects of diagnosis on PA. Estimation of piecewise regression models involves the creation of several variables to estimate change in the regression intercept and slope in a single model. Specifically, we created four variables for which the regression coefficients, respectively, reflect (i) prediagnosis linear slope, (ii) change in slope postdiagnosis from prediagnosis, (iii) predicted mean PA level for someone who is infinitely close to a diagnosis (but not quite), and (iv) the jump that occurs at wave of diagnosis, representing the predicted mean PA for someone who was just diagnosed minus the predicted mean for someone who is infinitely close to being diagnosed. Model 2 added age, sociodemographic, psychological, and health covariates. Model 3 examined age at diagnosis, gender, race/ethnicity, and educational level as potential moderators of the changes in PA as a function of diagnosis. Moderators that were statistically significant were retained in the final model. To facilitate the interpretation of results, we used Stata's Margins command to calculate the predicted PA levels for each subgroup. We computed scaled weights and robust standard errors and accounted for sampling strata using methods detailed in. All analyses were conducted in Stata 15.1 SE (, College Station, TX).

### Drawing statistical conclusions from experiments with multiple quantitative measurements per subject [^70dff523]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

In experiments with multiple quantitative measurements per subject, for example measurements on multiple lesions per patient, the additional measurements on the same patient provide limited additional information. Treating these measurements as independent observations will produce biased estimators for standard deviations and confidence intervals, and increases the risk of false positives in statistical tests. The problem can be remedied in a simple way by first taking the average of all observations of each specific patient, and then doing all further calculations only on the list of these patient means. A more sophisticated statistical modeling of the experiment, for example in a linear mixed model, is only required if (i) there is a large imbalance in the number of observations per patient or (ii) there is a specific interest in actually identifying the various sources of variation in the experiment.

### Primer on binary logistic regression [^8c5f1975]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Family medicine has traditionally prioritised patient care over research. However, recent recommendations to strengthen family medicine include calls to focus more on research including improving research methods used in the field. Binary logistic regression is one method frequently used in family medicine research to classify, explain or predict the values of some characteristic, behaviour or outcome. The binary logistic regression model relies on assumptions including independent observations, no perfect multicollinearity and linearity. The model produces ORs, which suggest increased, decreased or no change in odds of being in one category of the outcome with an increase in the value of the predictor. Model significance quantifies whether the model is better than the baseline value (ie, the percentage of people with the outcome) at explaining or predicting whether the observed cases in the data set have the outcome. One model fit measure is the count- [Formula: see text], which is the percentage of observations where the model correctly predicted the outcome variable value. Related to the count- [Formula: see text] are model sensitivity-the percentage of those with the outcome who were correctly predicted to have the outcome-and specificity-the percentage of those without the outcome who were correctly predicted to not have the outcome. Complete model reporting for binary logistic regression includes descriptive statistics, a statement on whether assumptions were checked and met, ORs and CIs for each predictor, overall model significance and overall model fit.

Classification vs regression.

a Regression plane concept. The classical way to model a biological process includes the phenotypical analysis of cells (i.e. subdividing cells into classes). However, in a high-content screening scenario, the multitude of different phenotypes makes it extremely challenging to create a set of representative classes. A possible solution builds on using a regression line, allowing to represent a single effect without the need of discretization. Nonetheless, biological processes are typically characterized by numerous ongoing effects. Thus, the regression plane represents a good trade-off between visualization capabilities and annotation complexity. Basically, it allows to represent a biological process with the limits of a planar graph. b Active regression. The aim of an active regression algorithm is to improve the training set (TS) to achieve better prediction performance. It is an iterative process where a cell that is difficult to annotate is proposed to the oracle who annotates it, and by doing so moves it to the TS used to train the regression model. c Synthetic dataset.

### Somatic mutation rates scale with lifespan across mammals [^60dc49ad]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Therefore, the cross-species average end-of-lifespan burden (k), can be estimated as the slope parameter of a zero-intercept linear regression model with the mutation rate per year (m) as the dependent variable, and the inverse of lifespan (1/ L) as the explanatory variable. To this purpose, the LME model described in the previous section was altered by removing the fixed-effect intercept parameter, thus considering only fixed- and random-effect slope parameters for 1/Lifespan.

The zero-intercept LME model estimated a value of k = 3,210.52 (95% confidence interval 2,686.89–3,734.15). The fraction of inter-species variance explained by the zero-intercept model (FVE) was 0.82, whereas the LME model described in the previous section (which estimated k = 2,869.98, and an intercept of 14.76) achieved FVE = 0.84 (see 'Association of mutation rate with life-history traits'). To test whether the increase in model fit justifies the inclusion of an intercept, both models were compared using a LRT (as implemented by the 'anova' function in the nlme R package (v.3.1–137)). This yielded P = 0.23, indicating that the free-intercept model does not achieve a significantly better fit than the zero-intercept model. Similarly, the zero-intercept model yielded lower values for both the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Notably, equivalent analyses using somatic mutation rates per megabase and per protein-coding exome (instead of per whole genome) yielded comparable results (Extended Data Fig. 11).

### Modulatory effects of magnetic vestibular stimulation on resting-state networks can be explained by subject-specific orientation of inner-ear anatomy in the MR static magnetic field [^be20323f]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

The regressor (or the subject-specific proxy to account for MVS, pMVS) was calculated by transforming the measured angles " α " of the horizontal canal relative to the z-direction (or magnetic field direction) to radians and then determining the sinus of " α ", as required for the Lorentz force: In summary, this resulted in a design matrix with nine regressors (one regressor for pMVS or pReidsAv, and the other eight regressors).

As a next step, these "continuous" regressors and ROI data were z -scored using MATLAB's " z score.m" function before fitting the slopes (betas). This adjustment of the regressors and the data resulted in "normalized" slope (beta) values. Before plotting the data and regression line (slope) for pMVS, we removed the effects of all other regressors (age, time until RS-fMRI measurement, sex, and handedness) by means of subtraction from the data to keep only the pMVS effects (and remaining other variance) for display.

To understand the contribution of the regressors for sex, handedness, and pMVS more closely, we used a stepwise regression approach, which enables the estimation of the effect size in terms of R-squared (coefficient of determination) added by each variable following the recommendations in. In short, we created all possible permutations of the variables in the regression model and repeatedly applied the regression adding one more regressor at each step. Each of the steps for each permutation results in an R -squared value (% of explained variance). Then, the added R-squared effect size was estimated as the median of all differences in R -squared for each regressor in all models for every permutation. In other words, the added R -square in each step was the difference of the R -square value for that step to the previous step, and the final added R -squared value (% of explained variance) for each variable was estimated as the median of these differences. The final added R -squared value for each variable, and each ROI was reported separately in Table 1 and displayed in Fig. 5.

### Does expecting more pain make it more intense? Factors associated with the first week pain trajectories after breast cancer surgery [^9f8fe28c]. Pain (2017). Low credibility.

2.8. Pain trajectories

The R statistical package (version 3.2.2) was used to calculate pain trajectories. Linear models were calculated using Python 2.7.11 module Statsmodels (version 0.6.1). The pain trajectory of each patient was summarized by a linear latent growth curve. Trajectories were formed to describe 2 features of pain during the first postoperative week: pain intercept that represents the intensity of pain on the hypothetical day zero assessment point and the slope that represents the change of the pain intensity with time. A negative slope indicates that pain is decreasing and a positive slope the opposite. These features were calculated by fitting a regression line across the pain measures of the 7 postoperative days using an ordinary least squares fit. This gives an approximation of the real pain trajectories and also simultaneously minimizes measurement error, which is always a source of bias when a person evaluates her pain level. The purpose of growth curve modelling is to individually estimate the dynamic course of acute pain. Similar to Chapman et al.we also formed 3 slope groups regarding the direction of the curves: individual slope values with 50% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and slopes with CIs crossing value zero were defined as flat slopes, whereas entirely positive CIs were considered increasing slopes and entirely negative CIs were defined as decreasing slopes. This was done to describe the distribution of the studied patients into these 3 groups of different pain resolutions (slopes).

2.9. Regression analyses

We built 2 linear regression models, one to explain the intercept of the linear trend for each individual (hypothetical initial pain intensity) and the other to explain the change of the pain intensity with time (the slope). For both models, we chose the explanatory variables to include to the model, by fitting a simple linear regression model. Each variable associated individually with a liberal threshold (P < 0.2) was included in the multivariate models. Stepwise elimination was used to determine the variables in the final model.

2.10. Subgroup analyses

In addition to the linear regression analyses that defined factors associated with acute postoperative pain trajectories, we analyzed more closely the role of expectation and its relation to experimental pain variables and psychological variables. We used the Mann–Whitney U test to compare patients expecting severe postoperative pain (NRS ≥ 7/10) with those expecting no or mild pain (NRS ≤ 3/10). For experimental pain measures, we used NRS 0 to 10 at the end of the heat pain test and the total time the patients tolerated cold pain.

### Ecological and geographical overlap drive plumage evolution and mimicry in woodpeckers [^3713f385]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Treating climate, habitat, latitude, longitude, natural log body mass, and sexual size dimorphism as explanatory variables, we used multi-model inference to identify PGLS regression models that explained each of the four PCA plumage axes of interest. We also visualized pairwise correlations and distributions of these traits using corrplotter (Supplementary Fig. 2). We used a model averaging approach to determine which explanatory variables strongly influenced plumage (Fig. 5). To test the robustness of our conclusions to phylogenetic uncertainty, for each dependent variable (colorPC1, colorPC2, patternPC1, and patternPC2), we identified all explanatory variables with model-averaged coefficients that did not overlap zero. We then fit a series of 1000 PGLS regressions per dependent variable to the identified variables where, for each regression, we used a different one of the complete phylogenies. Variation in the coefficient estimations was small, as shown in Supplementary Figs. 3–6. In the main text, when reporting pseudo- r 2 and values for the PGLS regressions, we report the median values from these 1000 models.

### Developing an individualized risk calculator for psychopathology among young people victimized during childhood: a population-representative cohort study [^f14f7ef0]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

A full description of our analyses is available in Supplementary Material. Briefly, we conducted regularized regression using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to identify subsets of predictors that maximized prediction accuracy for each outcome in unseen cases within the sample. LASSO shrinks coefficients towards zero, thereby reducing the variance of these estimates. Predictors whose coefficients are shrunk to zero are excluded from the model, enabling parsimonious solutions. The degree of shrinkage is determined by a tuning parameter, lambda (λ). Cross-validation was used to identify the optimal λ for a model. To obtain an estimate of prediction accuracy in new cases from the same underlying population, we internally validated each model using nested 10-fold cross-validation (see Supplementary Fig. S2 ;).

Performance measures were based on each child's predicted probability when held out from model selection and estimation as an unseen 'test case'. Discrimination (the model's ability to accurately classify those with and without psychopathology) was visualized using the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve, and quantified using the area-under-the-curve (AUC;). AUC ranges from 0.5 (chance-level) to 1 (perfect discrimination), with the following proposed benchmarks: < 0.7 (poor); 0.7–0.8 (acceptable); 0.8–0.9 (excellent); 0.9–1.0 (outstanding;). Calibration was assessed by plotting predicted probabilities (grouped into equal-interval bins) against observed outcomes, where a 45° line indicates perfect agreement. A chi-square test of unreliability (U) determined whether each calibration plot's intercept ('calibration-in-the-large') and slope significantly differed from the ideal line. Overall performance was assessed by the proportion of explained deviance ('pseudo- R 2 '), and the Brier score, or mean squared difference between predicted probabilities and actual binary outcomes. We scaled Brier scores by their maximum possible values, which vary based on the incidence of the outcome, from 0% (non-informative) to 100% (perfect;)

### Exploring the relationship between effort perception and poststroke fatigue [^d6f06653]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that poststroke fatigue, a chronic, pathologic fatigue condition, is driven by altered effort perception.

Methods

Fifty-eight nondepressed, mildly impaired stroke survivors with varying severity of fatigue completed the study. Self-reported fatigue (trait and state), perceived effort (PE; explicit and implicit), and motor performance were measured in a handgrip task. Trait fatigue was measured with the Fatigue Severity Scale-7 and Neurologic Fatigue Index. State fatigue was measured with a visual analog scale (VAS). Length of hold at target force, overshoot above target force, and force variability in handgrip task were measures of motor performance. PE was measured with a VAS (explicit PE) and line length estimation, a novel implicit measure of PE.

Results

Regression analysis showed that 11.6% of variance in trait fatigue was explained by implicit PE (R = 0.34; p = 0.012). Greater fatigue was related to longer length of hold at target force (R = 0.421, p < 0.001). A backward regression showed that length of hold explained explicit PE in the 20% force condition (R = 0.306, p = 0.021) and length of hold and overshoot above target force explained explicit PE in the 40% (R = 0.399, p = 0.014 and 0.004) force condition. In the 60% force condition, greater explicit PE was explained by higher force variability (R = 0.315, p = 0.017). None of the correlations were significant for state fatigue.

Conclusion

Trait fatigue, but not state fatigue, correlating with measures of PE and motor performance, may suggest that altered perception may lead to high fatigue mediated by changes in motor performance. This finding furthers our mechanistic understanding of poststroke fatigue.

### Factors associated with healthy aging in latin American populations [^fa72e35b]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Multimethod analyses

To confirm the robustness of our approach, we implemented multimethod confirmatory analyses (Fig. 1f, g, k). This comparative assessment involved examining the outcomes of ridge regression in conjunction with linear regression, elastic net and LASSO techniques. Linear regression was used to fit a predictive model to the observed data. It calculates the strength of the relationship between risk factors and outcome variables and helps to determine whether some explanatory variables may have no linear relationship with the outcomes. Elastic net combines the advantages of ridge and LASSO regression, incorporating both L1 and L2 regularization. Furthermore, it balances the benefits of both techniques, providing a compromise between the sparsity of LASSO and the stability of ridge regression. This can result in better prediction accuracy and improved model interpretability. LASSO regressions encourage sparsity in the model by driving some coefficients to zero, leading to more straightforward and more interpretable models, and allowing for automatic feature selection to deal with many risk factors.

Goodness-of-fit and weight of risk factor parameters

We used different parameters to assess the goodness of fit in the studies, including (1) F -statistic (F) for the regression coefficients of the models; (2) R 2, a measure of how close the data points correspond to the fitted line and as the coefficient of determination for the regression models; (3) Cohen's F 2 to assess the effect sizes of the regression models and risk factors; (4) MSE, an estimator of the average of the squared difference between estimated and actual values and to assess the goodness of fit of the regression models; (5) the RMSE as a measure of the standard deviation of the residuals (prediction errors) and to assess the distance between the regression line data points; and (5) β estimates to assess the weight of a factor in a regression model. Different linear regression models were used to identify the best goodness-of-fit parameters across the analyses. The multimethod procedure confirmed the consistency of the results and suggested that linear approaches were the best choice. Other additional nonlinear methods are out of the scope of this study.

### Associations between lifestyle factors and multidimensional frailty: a cross-sectional study among community-dwelling older people [^84c4510a]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Correlations between lifestyle factors and frailty total and frailty domains

‡ Correlations (pair-wise exclusion of missing values) with nutrition are only based on data of sample WB, whereas other correlations are based on the data of both samples together.

* ✱ p < 0.05; ✱ p < 0.001

Turning to the results of the regression analyses predicting total frailty for the entire sample (second column, Table 3), 23% of the variance of total frailty was explained by background variables. More frailty was associated with higher age, with being a woman, lower education, and struggling to get along with household's income. Controlling for demographic variables, explained variance of total frailty increased 0.7% by the smoking variables (Cohen's f 2 = 0.009), 0.8% by the alcohol variables (Cohen's f 2 = 0.01), and 6.5% by the physical activity variables (Cohen's f 2 = 0.095). When controlling for the effects of all predictors, the effects of smoking, drinking, and physical activity variables reduced somewhat to 0.4%, 0.5%, and 5.6%, of increased explained variance, respectively. In total, all predictors together explained 32.1% of total frailty. In this final model with all predictors, the associations controlled for other predictors' effects were such that less total frailty was associated with lower scores on smoking variables, higher scores on the drinking variables, and higher scores on the physical activity variables (except active work Light and active work Heavy).

Results of regression analyses: Effect of background characteristics and lifestyle factors (smoking, use of alcohol, physical activity, nutrition) on frailty total and domains 1

1 Estimates of unstandardized regression coefficients (B) with standard error (SE) of background, drinking, smoking, and physical activity variables are based on the final regression model including all these predictors simultaneously, applied to both the West-Brabant (WB) and Hart voor Brabant, Brabant Zuidoost, Zeeland (HZ) together. ΔR 2 is the increase in explained variance of adding all predictors of this block (drinking, smoking, physical activity) after controlling for the effect of the background variables (first line) or after controlling for all other predictors in the final model (last line).

### Disparate stroke rates on warfarin among contemporaneous cohorts with atrial fibrillation: potential insights into risk from a comparative analysis of SPORTIF III versus SPORTIF V [^0288f8fe]. Stroke (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The rate of stroke among warfarin-treated patients in SPORTIF V was approximately half that of patients enrolled in SPORTIF III (1.16%/year versus 2.30%/year). SPORTIF III was an open-label trial comparing ximelagatran with warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. SPORTIF V was a double-blind trial performed in North America. The trial design was otherwise identical. We sought to determine if differences in baseline characteristics, use of potentially risk-modifying medications, or anticoagulation control help to explain the lower risk of stroke among warfarin-treated patients in SPORTIF V.

Methods

Cox regression with stepwise model selection was used to define the covariates independently associated with stroke. Secondary analyses identified covariates with the strongest influence on the study factor (V/III). These covariates were then added to the primary model. Cox regression was used to determine the degree of confounding exerted by these covariates that might help to explain the differences between the trials.

Results

Independent risk factors for stroke on warfarin included prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, coronary artery disease, international normalized ratio, weight, and study. Patients in SPORTIF V were at half the risk as those in SPORTIF III. We found that lower international normalized ratio variability, a higher proportion of prevalent warfarin use, lower systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein, and a greater proportion of statin use among patients in SPORTIF V collectively conferred a lower risk of stroke.

Conclusions

Differences in blood pressure control, international normalized ratio variability, proportion of prevalent warfarin users, statin exposure, and high-density lipoprotein collectively conferred a lower risk of stroke to patients in SPORTIF V. These findings suggest that the different event rates were not due to chance and provide potential insights into stroke risk among warfarin-treated patients with atrial fibrillation.

### Low growth resilience to drought is related to future mortality risk in trees [^9a5c4501]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Table 1
Summary of the fitted linear mixed model of resilience, resistance and recovery.

The response variables are log-transformed resistance, recovery and resilience computed for tree-ring width (TRW) data, assuming a Gaussian error distribution with an identity link. The fixed part of the model included status (now-dead or surviving), taxonomic group (angiosperm or gymnosperm), diameter at breast height (DBH i, cm), time period between drought event and last year recorded in each individual tree ring-width series (Δtime, years), average ratio between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (aridity) for the period 1970–2000, a measure of soil fertility, and interactions between status and other fixed effects. The random part of the model included site nested within species nested within genus. The intercept corresponds to the reference status (now-dead) and taxonomic group (angiosperms). This summary corresponds to the reduced model (the full model is presented in Supplementary Table 1; for model selection, see Supplementary Table 2). Values represent the standardised estimates of regression coefficients (std. β), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), the t statistic or χ 2 statistic and the associated P value of significance (bold type for significant fixed effects, P < 0.05). Estimates of regression coefficients for the intercept were not standardised. The signs indicate the direction of the effects. R 2 m is the marginal R 2, R 2 c is the conditional R 2, ΔAIC is the increment on AIC values with respect to that of the model without status (Supplementary Table 2). The low marginal R 2 explained by the fixed effects of the reduced models might be a consequence of data heterogeneity, with high variation within species and sites. Nevertheless, differences between statuses were detected, and smaller AICs and larger differences (ΔAIC) > 2.0 related to models without status indicate that models including status showed higher explanatory power

### Development and validation of a prediction model for fat mass in children and adolescents: meta-analysis using individual participant data [^62e902f3]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Model performance and internal validation

The performance of the final model was assessed using several approaches:

- R 2 — proportion of the variance in natural logarithm of fat-free mass explained by the included predictors

- Root mean square error (RMSE) — the average difference between the predicted and observed values. The RMSE of fat mass predictions was also assessed overall and within subgroups for age, ethnicity, and sex

- Calibration slope — based on model regressing observed on predicted values of natural logarithm of fat-free mass (with a slope of 1 being ideal)

- Calibration-in-the-large — intercept term from the model regressing observed on predicted values of natural logarithm of fat-free mass (with an intercept of 0 being ideal)

- Comparing mean observed with mean predicted values of natural logarithm of fat-free mass.

Calibration was also assessed graphically by displaying fat-free mass and fat mass on a calibration plot with a local regression (loess) smoother fitted across all children

We carried out internal validation to estimate optimism (the level of model overfitting)and correct measures of predictive performance (R 2, calibration slope, and calibration-in-the-large) for model overfitting by bootstrapping1000 samples of the derivation data (with replacement). The entire variable selection process, including the choosing of the fractional polynomial terms, was repeated within the model development for each of the 1000 bootstrap samples. This led to a set of 1000 bootstrap models that were derived using the same methods as in our original model development. We then applied each of these bootstrap sample models within the original dataset to estimate optimism in the performance statistics (difference in test performance and apparent bootstrap performance) of R 2, calibration slope, and calibration-in-the-large (see Appendix 2 for further details), referred to as adjusted R 2, adjusted calibration slope, and adjusted calibration-in-the-large, respectively. To adjust for optimism after model development, we obtained estimates of a uniform shrinkage factor (the average calibration slope from each of the bootstrap samples) and multiplied these by the original β coefficients to obtain optimism adjusted coefficients. At this stage, we re-estimated the intercept of the model based on the adjusted coefficients to maintain overall model calibration, producing a final model.

### A brief neuropsychological battery for measuring cognitive functions associated with obesity [^c32bf66a]. Obesity (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Although ample evidence links obesity to cognitive dysfunction, the trajectory of cognitive change, the underlying mechanisms, and the involvement of related factors, such as metabolic disease and diet, remain unclear. To support further investigations of BMI and cognition, this study aimed to create a concise test battery to be used in future trials.

Methods

Twenty neurocognitive measures were regressed on BMI in the Human Connectome Project Healthy Young Adult S1200 data release by using linear mixed models and by adjusting for major confounders. Measures were then identified by using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis to select tests most strongly associated with BMI. To guide further test selection, the explained variance for each variable was visualized in the final model.

Results

BMI was negatively associated with seven neurocognitive measures. Variable selection yielded a model that included years of education and, in order of model weight, delay discounting, the relational task, the Penn Progressive Matrices test, the oral reading recognition test, the Variable Short Penn Line Orientation test, and the Penn Word Memory test.

Conclusions

This research resulted in an approximate 40-minute test battery for the BMI-cognition relationship in young adults that can be used in trials investigating the interrelationship between obesity and cognitive performance.

### Regression plane concept for analysing continuous cellular processes with machine learning [^46bc5ef2]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

In our analysis, a field expert created a regression plane representing the process of mitosis, resulting in a training set of 585 cells (Fig. 3a). After prediction, the cells followed the designed circular path recalling canonical mitotic phases (Fig. 3b–d), while they also represented subtle phenotypic changes and single-cell differences in the regression plane. Additionally, we investigated whether the fluorescent tags have effect on the distribution of cells on the regression plane, and in most cases we did not observe undesired cellular behaviour due to the perturbations (Supplementary Fig. 4). Finally, we compared the results of the original methodology presented by Cai et al. (multi-dimensional dynamic time warping for creating the standard mitotic time, Fig. 3e) with the results obtained by RP (Fig. 3f), and we concluded that RP is capable of reproducing a mitotic time model equivalent to the original one. This indicates that RP can compete with complex analysis techniques, such as DTW. Moreover, RP provides the flexibility to customize the output space, enabling higher resolution analysis of user-defined sections of the biological process.

### Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis established as a multistep process across phenotypes [^8bca81f3]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Given the accepted multistep process of disease causation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the present study was undertaken to determine the number of steps required for disease onset across each of the ALS phenotypes.

Methods

Clinical and demographic data were prospectively accumulated using the Australian Motor Neurone Disease Registry (2005–2016), and age-specific incidence rates were calculated. Poisson regression was utilized to assess the relationship between log age-specific incidence and log age of onset, with McFadden's R 2 used to assess the goodness of fit of the model.

Results

In total, 2647 ALS patients were included, with mean disease-onset age being 62.2 ± 12.1years. A linear relationship between log incidence and log age was established across ALS phenotypes, with variable slope estimates: bulbar 5.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.6–5.6); cervical 2.7 (95% CI 2.3–3.0); lumbar 3.5 (95% CI 3.2–3.9); flail arm 4.7 (95% CI 3.9–5.5); flail leg 3.6 (95% CI 2.6–4.5); primary lateral sclerosis 2.7 (95% CI 1.8–3.7). Slope estimates were significantly higher in the bulbar compared to the cervical, lumbar and primary lateral sclerosis phenotypes. McFadden's R 2 values were > 0.4 for all phenotypes indicating excellent model fit.

Discussion

A multistep process has been established across all ALS phenotypes with variable slope estimates, suggesting that the number of steps to develop disease is different across clinical presentations. Identification of mechanisms underlying slope estimate variability could exert pathophysiological significance.

### Most of the variation in length of stay in emergency general surgery is not related to clinical factors of patient care [^fa2b36a9]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hospital length of stay (LOS) is currently recognized as a key quality indicator. We sought to investigate how much of the LOS variation in the high-risk group of patients undergoing Emergency general surgery could be explained by clinical versus nonclinical factors.

Methods

Using the 2007 to 2015 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database, we included all patients who underwent an emergency appendectomy, cholecystectomy, colectomy, small intestine resection, enterolysis, or hernia repair. American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program defines emergency surgery as one that is performed no later than 12 hours after admission or symptom onset. Using all the ACS-NSQIP demographic, preoperative (comorbidities, laboratory variables), intraoperative (e.g., duration of surgery, wound classification), and postoperative variables (i.e., complications), we created multivariable linear regression models to predict LOS. LOS was treated as a continuous variable, and the degree to which the models could explain the variation in LOS for each type of surgery was measured using the coefficient of determination (R).

Results

A total of 215,724 patients were included. The mean age was 47.1 years; 52.0% were female. In summary, the median LOS ranged between 1 day for appendectomies (n = 124, 426) and cholecystectomies (n = 21,699) and 8 days for colectomies (n = 19,557) and small intestine resections (n = 7,782). The R for all clinical factors ranged between 0.28 for cholecystectomy and 0.44 for hernia repair, suggesting that 56% to 72% of the LOS variation for each of the six procedures studied cannot be explained by the wide range of clinical factors included in ACS-NSQIP.

Conclusion

Most of the LOS variation is not explained by clinical factors and may be explained by nonclinical factors (e.g., logistical delays, insurance type). Further studies should evaluate these nonclinical factors to identify target areas for quality improvement.

### Gait variability in Parkinson's disease: an indicator of non-dopaminergic contributors to gait dysfunction? [^ecb90759]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Gait variability has potential utility as a predictive measure of dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD). Current understanding implicates non-dopaminergic pathways. This study investigated the explanatory characteristics of gait variability in PD on and off medication under single and dual task conditions. Fifty people with PD were assessed twice at home (on and off L: -dopa) whilst walking under single and dual task conditions, and variability (coefficient of variation, CV) was calculated for stride time and double limb support (DLS) time. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to identify predictors. The first block of variables included age, gait speed, depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory), and the second block included motor severity (UPDRS III), executive function (Hayling and Brixton) and attention (Test of Everyday Attention). Motor severity predicted stride time variability and DLS time variability independent of L: -dopa during single task gait. Dual task gait yielded a more complex picture. Depression made a unique contribution of 9.0% on medication and 5.0% off medication to stride time variability, and visual attention and younger age contributed to DLS variability on medication, explaining 3% and 2%, respectively. Motor severity predicted DLS variability off medication, explaining 74% of variance. Different characteristics explain the two measures of gait variability, pointing to different control mechanisms.

### Parametric and nonparametric statistical methods for genomic selection of traits with additive and epistatic genetic architectures [^99479362]. G3 (2014). Low credibility.

Parametric and nonparametric methods have been developed for purposes of predicting phenotypes. These methods are based on retrospective analyses of empirical data consisting of genotypic and phenotypic scores. Recent reports have indicated that parametric methods are unable to predict phenotypes of traits with known epistatic genetic architectures. Herein, we review parametric methods including least squares regression, ridge regression, Bayesian ridge regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), Bayesian LASSO, best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP), Bayes A, Bayes B, Bayes C, and Bayes Cπ. We also review nonparametric methods including Nadaraya-Watson estimator, reproducing kernel Hilbert space, support vector machine regression, and neural networks. We assess the relative merits of these 14 methods in terms of accuracy and mean squared error (MSE) using simulated genetic architectures consisting of completely additive or two-way epistatic interactions in an F2 population derived from crosses of inbred lines. Each simulated genetic architecture explained either 30% or 70% of the phenotypic variability. The greatest impact on estimates of accuracy and MSE was due to genetic architecture. Parametric methods were unable to predict phenotypic values when the underlying genetic architecture was based entirely on epistasis. Parametric methods were slightly better than nonparametric methods for additive genetic architectures. Distinctions among parametric methods for additive genetic architectures were incremental. Heritability, i.e., proportion of phenotypic variability, had the second greatest impact on estimates of accuracy and MSE.

### A multimodal imaging study of recognition memory in very preterm born adults [^441882ca]. Human Brain Mapping (2017). Low credibility.

Prediction of On‐Line Performance

All brain measures that were found to be significantly different between the groups were used as independent variables in a multiple linear regression model to predict A scores. A scores were transformed byto meet the assumptions of multiple linear regression. Regions with bilateral activation were averaged and used as one variable to avoid multicollinearity issues. Three multiple linear regression models were built using activation differences in encoding > low level baseline, recognition > low level baseline, and recognition > encoding contrasts. Structural brain variables were included in all models. Only the model built using activation differences in recognition > encoding was significant and LOC activation emerged as the best predictor of A scores (P < 0.001, adjusted R 2 = 0.204, Table 5, Fig. 4). Multiple linear regression models of the separate groups were not statistically significant.

Figure 4
Scatterplot of A score and LOC activation in the whole sample.

Table 5
Coefficients of the multiple linear regression model to explain A scores in the whole sample

As recognition performance relies to a degree on the effectiveness of the previous encoding stage, we extracted LOC activation in the same location of the significant recognition > encoding contrast (LOC recognition, inferior division) in the encoding > low level baseline (LOC encoding, inferior division) contrast. We then built a multiple linear regression model including LOC recognition, inferior division, LOC encoding, inferior division, white matter structures, and volume of the hippocampi. In the whole sample, this model was significant (P < 0.001, adjusted R 2 = 0.195). However, only LOC recognition, inferior division was significant in explaining on‐line task performance, not LOC encoding in the same cluster. This result shows that while accounting for LOC activation during encoding, it is activation of the recognition > encoding contrast that significantly explains on‐line task performance.

### People are more error-prone after committing an error [^608ef81c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Analysis

We used a sliding window technique to visualize the mean of response accuracy as a function of PT. The sliding window was performed separately for each level of err n −1. The width of the sliding window was 100 ms, the step size was 1 ms, and the window moved from 0 to 2000 ms.

We used Bernoulli regression models to assess the credibility of apparent effects in the smoothed conditional accuracy functions. The models had hierarchical slopes and intercepts (i.e. participant-level variables sampled from group-level distributions) and focused on specific contiguous intervals over PT (e.g. 0 ms < PT < 500 ms). We used the R-package brmsto specify the models and to approximate posterior distributions over unobserved variables, given the observed data. From these distributions, we report the median value, the 95% credible interval (CI), and the probability of direction (pd). Given the observed data, the effect of interest has a 95% probability of falling within the range of values specified by the credible interval. The probability of direction (ranging from 0.5 to 1.0) refers to the probability that an effect goes in a particular direction (i.e. negative or positive).

We used a response preparation model to explain the observed time courses of performance. This model enables inferences about the speed with which responses were prepared (μ), the variability in this preparation (σ), the probability that a prepared response will be expressed if it is prepared (efficacy, β), as well as effects of covariates (Δ) on these variables. This model also includes a parameter that governs chance level accuracy when no response has been prepared (α). We specified the model using Stan. In this model, the unobserved variables mentioned above were computed as linear functions of err n −1, and the effects of err n −1 were captured by a set of delta parameters. All intercepts and slopes in the model (μ 0, Δ μ, σ 0, Δ σ, β 0, Δ β) were hierarchical (i.e. participant-level variables sampled from group-level distributions), and we assigned weakly informative priors to the group-level variables. The model specification is reported below, whereis the observed response accuracy, is the probability of correct response, is the response preparation function which computesgiven the observed preparation timeand the unobserved variables, andis the unobserved variablefor participantand condition(i.e. post-error level).

### A village in a dish model system for population-scale hiPSC studies [^36ceb3cc]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

hiSPC line proportional changes between samples

The proportional changes of lines between samples were estimated using scCODA v0.1.8. An FDR of 0.05 was used for all scCODA analyses. scCODA was sequentially run once using each cell line as the reference for each analysis and the majority vote was used to identify cell lines whose proportion was credibly changed more than half the time. The specific metrics are provided in Supplementary Data 8).

Correlation of growth rates with hiPSC line proportions − 18-line hiPSC Village

The growth rates of the hiPSC lines in the 18-line village that were estimated with ratrackwere correlated with proportions of hiPSC line estimated using Demuxafy at each time single cells were captured. Two-sided Spearman rank correlation was used to measure the strength of the correlation and statistical significance.

Covariate contribution to gene variance

The proportion of the variance explained by the hiPSC line, the replicate and the village status for each gene was determined by fitting a linear mixed model for normalized and regularized expression of each gene. Briefly, normalized UMI counts were fit as the dependent variable of a linear mixed model with the independent variables as random effects. The intra-class correlation (ICC) was used to estimate the variance explained by each variable where var is the estimated variable, i: n is all the variables, including residual and σ 2 represents the estimated variance.

The variables included for the fresh samples across the three sites were: line, village, site, and replicate. For the cryopreserved samples, the variables were line, village, cryopreservation and replicate. For the village containing 18 lines, the covariates modeled were line and passage number. The significance of a given variable was tested using an ANOVA between the model with and without that covariate. Significant covariates were then tested for significant interaction as well.

Pluripotent gene differential expression

All genes expressed in at least 10% of cells in a given line at a given site were tested for differential expression with a logistic regression between the uni-culture and village samples. For comparison across the samples, all groups were down-sampled to the smallest number of cells at one condition (n = 572). Differential expression was detected using logistic regression implemented in Seurat. Replicates were fit as a covariate in the model, and significance was corrected for all tests across all groups with the Bonferroni correction method.

### Systems biology-derived biomarkers to predict progression of renal function decline in type 2 diabetes [^92150832]. Diabetes Care (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in diabetes has a complex molecular and likely multifaceted pathophysiology. We aimed to validate a panel of biomarkers identified using a systems biology approach to predict the individual decline of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in a large group of patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD at various stages.

Research Design and Methods

We used publicly available "omics" data to develop a molecular process model of CKD in diabetes and identified a representative parsimonious set of nine molecular biomarkers: chitinase 3-like protein 1, growth hormone 1, hepatocyte growth factor, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2, MMP7, MMP8, MMP13, tyrosine kinase, and tumor necrosis factor receptor-1. These biomarkers were measured in baseline serum samples from 1,765 patients recruited into two large clinical trials. eGFR decline was predicted based on molecular markers, clinical risk factors (including baseline eGFR and albuminuria), and both combined, and these predictions were evaluated using mixed linear regression models for longitudinal data.

Results

The variability of annual eGFR loss explained by the biomarkers, indicated by the adjusted R 2 value, was 15% and 34% for patients with eGFR ≥ 60 and < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, respectively; variability explained by clinical predictors was 20% and 31%, respectively. A combination of molecular and clinical predictors increased the adjusted R 2 to 35% and 64%, respectively. Calibration analysis of marker models showed significant (all P < 0.0001) but largely irrelevant deviations from optimal calibration (calibration-in-the-large: -1.125 and 0.95; calibration slopes: 1.07 and 1.13 in the two groups, respectively).

Conclusions

A small set of serum protein biomarkers identified using a systems biology approach, combined with clinical variables, enhances the prediction of renal function loss over a wide range of baseline eGFR values in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD.

Data synthesis and analysis methods

Our analysis combined data at the study level. Our primary analysis sought to assess exposure to common infections vs no common infections (referent group) on the risk of developing ALL, relying on each study's definition. The most frequent infection was used when studies did not report a common infection variable. We used the adjusted odds ratio (OR) or rate ratio (RR) to calculate a pooled overall effect, and assumed OR and RR were equivalent due to the rarity of the outcome; ORs or RRs < 1 suggest infections are protective against ALL. If a study presented multiple frequency categories, we used the lowest vs the highest category, a method commonly used in meta-analyses. The method described by Greenland was used to calculate the variance using the reported 95% confidence intervals (CI). We calculated a crude OR for studies not reporting one, and to facilitate the calculation we added 0.5 to all cells if one of the four cells reported a zero. In secondary analyses, we used the different exposure levels of infection to compute a regression slope. If an exposure level was defined using a range, we used the midpoint of the range (e.g. 1–3 infections was assigned a frequency of 2), and if the level was ⩾4, we assigned a frequency of 4. For infection severity, a dichotomous variable (yes vs no) was used to determine the relationship with ALL. Post hoc analyses examined the timing of infections in the first year of life compared to infections that occurred after the first year of life, and putative infectious agents was conducted if ⩾3 studies reported the agent.

### Quantile regression in the study of developmental sciences [^563d5efa]. Child Development (2013). Low credibility.

Linear regression analysis is one of the most common techniques applied in developmental research, but only allows for an estimate of the average relations between the predictor(s) and the outcome. This study describes quantile regression, which provides estimates of the relations between the predictor(s) and outcome, but across multiple points of the outcome's distribution. Using data from the High School and Beyond and U.S. Sustained Effects Study databases, quantile regression is demonstrated and contrasted with linear regression when considering models with: (a) one continuous predictor, (b) one dichotomous predictor, (c) a continuous and a dichotomous predictor, and (d) a longitudinal application. Results from each example exhibited the differential inferences which may be drawn using linear or quantile regression.

### Postprogression therapy and confounding for the estimated treatment effect on overall survival in phase III oncology trials [^332465dd]. BMJ Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Continuous variables were summarised by median and IQR, and categorical variables were summarised by frequency. The trends of PPT adjustments over time were evaluated by ordinary least squares linear regression, in which the slope (m) of the regression represented the rate of change. Univariable binary logistic regression models examined associations of trial-level variables with the outcome of any PPT adjustment to calculate ORs and 95% CIs. Multivariable analysis was not performed due to low numbers of the event of interest. All tests were two sided. Missing data were not encountered for this analysis of public data. The significance (α) level was set at 0.05. Analyses were performed by using SAS V.9 and plots were created using Prism V.10 (GraphPad, La Jolla, California, USA).

### The relationship between IQ, memory, executive function, and processing speed in recent-onset psychosis: 1-year stability and clinical outcome [^11ee0d95]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2010). Low credibility.

Predictors of 1-Year Clinical Outcome From Baseline WAIS-III Subscale Scores

We used the significant (P < .05) correlations between baseline clinical and WAIS-III scores to determine the analysis of 1-year clinical outcome in those pairs that had been successfully followed up. In each case, a linear regression was used to determine whether the relevant baseline cognitive score was a significant predictor of the 1-year clinical measure, once the equivalent baseline clinical measure was already entered as a predictor in the model. Thus, controlling for baseline symptoms, we found no effects of block design on disorganization (first step: baseline syndrome score r 2 = 0.02, F 1,27 = 0.37, P = 0.550; second step: baseline block design–scaled score r 2 = 0.02, F 1,26 = 0.70, P = 0.409), arithmetic on disorganization (first step: baseline syndrome score r 2 = 0.01, F 1,27 = 0.37, P = 0.550; second step: baseline block design–scaled score r 2 = 0.05, F 1,26 = 1.17, P = 0.290), arithmetic on mania (first step: baseline mania score r 2 = 0.01, F 1,27 = 0.28, P = 0.602; second step: baseline arithmetic-standardized residual score r 2 = 0.03, F 1,26 = 0.70, P = 0.409), or block design on mania (first step: baseline mania score r 2 = 0.01, F 1,27 = 0.28, P = 0.602; second step: baseline block design–standardized residual score r 2 = 0.04, F 1,26 = 1.106, P = 0.312). Regarding the negative syndrome, digit symbol–scaled score had no effect (first step: baseline syndrome score r 2 = 0.11, F 1,27 = 3.45, P = 0.074; second step: baseline digit symbol–scaled score r 2 = 0.01, F 1,26 = 0.35, P = 0.559), but digit symbol–standardized residual score accounted for a significant amount of the variance in the negative syndrome score once the baseline negative syndrome had been taken into account (second step: baseline digit symbol–standardized residual score r 2 = 0.16, F 1,26 = 5.83, P = 0.023).

### The relationship between estimated glomerular filtration rate, demographic and anthropometric variables is mediated by muscle mass in non-diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease [^c370f796]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Background

In this study (the first of two related papers), we report whether the relationship between the demographic and anthropometric variables (DA, i.e. age, gender, height and weight) employed in current creatinin (Cr)-based glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation equations and actual GFR is mediated by muscle mass.

Methods

We studied 77 patients (mean age ± SD, 65.1 ± 11.9 years) with chronic kidney disease (mean GFR 45.7 ± 28.6 ml/min/1.73 m2). Actual GFR was measured by the renal clearance of inulin (GFR(inu)). Appendicular lean mass (ALM) and its index (ALMI) by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry provided markers of muscle mass. Multiple regression analyses identified variables explaining variance in (i) GFR, (ii) ALM and (iii) Cr.

Results

(i) The DA variables used in the abbreviated modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) equation accounted for only 59.6% (P < 0.001) of the variance in GFR(inu), whilst adding ALMI explained an additional 10.4% variance (P < 0.001). If ALMI was entered first, the relationship between DA variables and GFR(inu) was reduced (for weight) or completely abolished (for age, gender and height). (ii) After inputting all the commonly used DA variables, 17.2% of the variance in ALM was unexplained. (iii) All the DA variables explained only 60.6% (P < 0.001) of the variance in Cr, whilst adding ALM explained an additional 4.2% variance (P < 0.005).

Conclusions

Muscle mass explained more variance in GFR(inu) than MDRD DA variables and mediated the relationship between GFR(inu) and DA variables. Furthermore, DA variables failed to account for individual differences in muscle mass or Cr. Consequently, there is a need to validate simpler, clinically obtainable measures of muscle mass and determine whether these measures will improve GFR estimation.

### Age-related progression of arterial stiffness and its elevated positive association with blood pressure in healthy people [^41018faf]. Atherosclerosis (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Arterial stiffness occurs as a consequence of age and arteriosclerosis, but the mechanics of the progression of arterial stiffness along with age is not fully explored. We aim to investigate the age-related progression of arterial stiffness through the examination of 4659 healthy subjects aged from 20 to 75.

Methods

The cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) was used as a marker of arterial stiffness. Piecewise linear regression model was utilized to analyze the association between different stages of age and arterial stiffness. The mean CAVI values of age groups were calculated to fit the linear regression and curvilinear regression models. We also constructed multiple regression models to examine the interactions of blood pressure and age on CAVI.

Result

The regression coefficients (β) of piecewise linear regression of each age group (< 35, 35–44, 45–59, > 59) were 0.07062, 0.03133, 0.03840 and 0.07272 for men, and 0.03342, 0.02025, 0.04826 and 0.10604 for women, respectively. The highest R square came from curvilinear regression for men (R(2) = 0.9220), and piecewise linear regression for women (R(2) = 0.9454). The interactions between each type of blood pressure and age were significant (all P < 0.001).

Conclusion

There were various increased trends between different stages of age. Age-related progression of arterial stiffness could be better explained by a growth curve, rather than a straight line. In addition, blood pressure has an increasingly positive association with CAVI values as age increases.

### Estimating equations for cardiopulmonary exercise testing variables in fontan patients: derivation and validation using a multicenter cross-sectional database [^fc26f68e]. Pediatric Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is a common method of evaluating patients with a Fontan circulation. Equations to calculate predicted CPET values are based on children with normal circulation. This study aims to create predictive equations for CPET variables solely based on patients with Fontan circulation. Patients who performed CPET in the multicenter Pediatric Heart Network Fontan Cross-Sectional Study were screened. Peak variable equations were calculated using patients who performed a maximal test (RER > 1.1) and anaerobic threshold (AT) variable equations on patients where AT was adequately calculated. Eighty percent of each cohort was randomly selected to derive the predictive equation and the remaining served as a validation cohort. Linear regression analysis was performed for each CPET variable within the derivation cohort. The resulting equations were applied to calculate predicted values in the validation cohort. Observed versus predicted variables were compared in the validation cohort using linear regression. 411 patients underwent CPET, 166 performed maximal exercise tests and 317 had adequately calculated AT. Predictive equations for peak CPET variables had good performance; peak VO2, R (2) = 0.61; maximum work, R (2) = 0.61; maximum O2 pulse, R (2) = 0.59. The equations for CPET variables at AT explained less of the variability; VO2 at AT, R (2) = 0.15; work at AT, R (2) = 0.39; O2 pulse at AT, R (2) = 0.34; VE/VCO2 at AT, R (2) = 0.18; VE/VO2 at AT, R (2) = 0.14. Only the models for VE/VCO2 and VE/VO2 at AT had significantly worse performance in validation cohort. Of the 8 equations for commonly measured CPET variables, six were able to be validated. The equations for peak variables were more robust in explaining variation in values than AT equations.

### Cortical microinfarcts and demyelination affect cognition in cases at high risk for dementia [^d3fe913c]. Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the possible synergistic effect of microvascular lesions with mild Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology in mixed cases.

Methods

We assessed the cognitive impact of cortical microinfarcts, deep white matter and periventricular demyelination, as well as diffuse and focal gliosis in a large series of 43 prospectively evaluated autopsy cases scored Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage III, but without macroscopic vascular pathology or substantial non-AD, nonvascular microscopic lesions. We included bilateral assessment of all types of microvascular lesions and used multivariate models that control for the possible confounding effect of age and amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) deposits.

Results

Only cortical microinfarcts and periventricular demyelination were significantly associated with the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) score. In a univariate model, the cortical microinfarct score explained 9% of the variability in CDR scores and periventricular demyelination score 7.3%. Abeta deposition explained only 3.5% of the CDR variability. In a logistic regression model, both variables were strongly associated with the presence of dementia (R = 0.45; p < 0.05). When the CDR sum of the boxes was used, Abeta staging explained 8.9% of cognitive variability, the addition of cortical microinfarct predicted an extra 15.5%, and that of periventricular demyelination an extra 9%.

Conclusions

Cortical microinfarcts and, to a lesser degree, periventricular demyelination contribute to the cognitive decline in individuals at high risk for dementia. Both should be taken into account when defining the neuropathologic criteria for mixed dementia.

Figure 3.
Trends in Forest Plot Missing Visual Elements (MVEs)

The linear regression over time is shown. The shaded regions represent the 95% CI of the slope (m) of the linear regression. Because of the small number of trials analyzed in this dataset published in the years prior to 2006 (4 trials) or after 2019 (3 trials), data prior to 2006 or after 2019 were excluded from the graph.

Unadjusted associations between trial-level characteristics and forest plot MVEs are shown in Table 1, and adjusted associations are shown in Table 2. More recent publication year for the primary end point was associated with lower odds of MVE on multivariable analysis (publication year as a continuous factor: aOR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.83–0.95; P < .001).

Step 4. Prepare data for analysis

Data often need cleaning and other preparation before conducting analysis. Problems requiring cleaning include values outside of an acceptable range and missing values. Any particular value could be wrong because of a data entry error or data collection problem. Visually inspecting data can reveal anomalies. For example, an age value of 200 is clearly an error, or a value of 9 on a 1–5 Likert-type scale is an error. An easy way to start inspecting data is to sort each variable by ascending values and then descending values to look for atypical values. Then, try to correct the problem by determining what the value should be. Missing values are a more complicated problem because a concern is why the value is missing. A few missing values at random is not necessarily a concern, but a pattern of missing values (eg, individuals from a specific ethnic group tend to skip a certain question) indicates a systematic missingness that could indicate a problem with the data collection instrument. Descriptive statistics are an additional way to check for errors and ensure data are ready for analysis. While not discussed in the communication assessment exemplar, the authors did prepare data for analysis and report missing values in their descriptive statistics.

Step 5. Always start with descriptive statistics

Before running inferential statistics, it is critical to first describe the data. Obtaining descriptive statistics is a way to check whether data are ready for further analysis. Descriptive statistics give a general sense of trends and can illuminate errors by reviewing frequencies, minimums and maximums that can indicate values outside of the accepted range. Descriptive statistics are also an important step to check whether we meet assumptions for statistical tests. In a quantitative study, descriptive statistics also inform the first table of the results that reports information about the sample, as seen in table 2 of the exemplar study.

Step 6. Check assumptions of statistical tests

All statistical tests rely on foundational assumptions. Although some tests are more robust to violations, checking assumptions indicates whether the test is likely to be valid for a particular data set. Foundational parametric statistics (eg, t tests, ANOVA, correlation, regression) assume independent observations and a normal linear distribution of data. In the exemplar study, the authors noted 'Data from both groups met normality assumptions, based on the Shapiro–Wilk test' (p508), and gave the statistics in addition to noting specific assumptions for the independent t tests around equality of variances.

The comparison of (EXP) and (ANN) data through a linear regression model,

(Leptin ANN = a + b Leptin EXP) and (Insulin ANN = a + b Insulin EXP), showed regression coefficients of R 2 > 0.973 and R 2 > 0.9873 for leptin and insulin, respectively. Upper and lower values of the statistical test (Table 4) indicate that the slope included one and the intercept contained zero, with a 99.8% confidence level for both UCB determinations. These results demonstrated a good correlation between ANN predictions and experimental values.

### Effect of age, sex, and morbidity count on trial attrition: meta-analysis of individual participant level data from phase 3 / 4 industry funded clinical trials [^578c6013]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Objectives

To estimate the association between individual participant characteristics and attrition from randomised controlled trials.

Design

Meta-analysis of individual participant level data (IPD).

Data Sources

Clinical trial repositories (Clinical Study Data Request and Yale University Open Data Access).

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Eligible phase 3 or 4 trials identified according to prespecified criteria (PROSPERO CRD42018048202).

Main Outcome Measures

Association between comorbidity count (identified using medical history or concomitant drug treatment data) and trial attrition (failure for any reason to complete the final trial visit), estimated in logistic regression models and adjusted for age and sex. Estimates were meta-analysed in bayesian linear models, with partial pooling across index conditions and drug classes.

Results

In 92 trials across 20 index conditions and 17 drug classes, the mean comorbidity count ranged from 0.3 to 2.7. Neither age nor sex was clearly associated with attrition (odds ratio 1.04, 95%credible interval 0.98 to 1.11; and 0.99, 0.93 to 1.05, respectively). However, comorbidity count was associated with trial attrition (odds ratio per additional comorbidity 1.11, 95%credible interval 1.07 to 1.14). No evidence of non-linearity (assessed via a second order polynomial) was seen in the association between comorbidity count and trial attrition, with minimal variation across drug classes and index conditions. At a trial level, an increase in participant comorbidity count has a minor impact on attrition: for a notional trial with high level of attrition in individuals without comorbidity, doubling the mean comorbidity count from 1 to 2 translates to an increase in trial attrition from 29% to 31%.

Conclusions

Increased comorbidity count, irrespective of age and sex, is associated with a modest increased odds of participant attrition. The benefit of increased generalisability of including participants with multimorbidity seems likely to outweigh the disadvantages of increased attrition.

### Model selection: finding the right fit [^6940b900]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

There are numerous possible goals for building statistical models. Those statistical goals, the associated model types, and each statistical tool involved in model building come with its own assumptions and requirements. In turn, these requirements must be met if we are to ensure that our models produce meaningful, interpretable results. However, beyond these technical details is the intuition, and the additional set of tools and algorithms, used by the statistician, to build the contextually appropriate model: not only must we build an interpretable model, we must build a model that answers the particular question at hand and addresses the particular goal we have in mind. In this column we discuss the methods by which statisticians build models for description, risk factor identification, and prediction.

### DSM-IV alcohol dependence: a categorical or dimensional phenotype? [^fb886fcd]. Psychological Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Etiologic research on complex disorders including alcohol dependence requires informative phenotypes. Information is lost when categorical variables represent inherently dimensional conditions. We investigated the validity of DSM-IV alcohol dependence as a dimensional phenotype by examining evidence for linearity and thresholds in associations with validating variables.

Method

Current drinkers in the National Longitudinal Alcohol Epidemiologic Survey (NLAES) (n = 18352) and National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) (n = 20836) were analyzed. Validating variables included family alcoholism, early-onset drinking, and alcohol treatment. Logistic or Poisson regression modeled the relationships between the validating variables and dependence in categorical, dimensional or hybrid forms, with severity defined as number of current DSM-IV alcohol-dependence criteria. Wald tests assessed differences between models.

Results

No evidence was found for boundaries between categories. Instead, the association of alcohol dependence with the validating variables generally increased in linear fashion as the number of alcohol-dependence criteria increased. For NLAES models of family alcoholism, early-onset drinking and treatment, the lines had zero intercepts, with slopes of 0.18, 0.27, 0.70, respectively. For NESARC models of family history and early-onset drinking, the zero intercept lines had slopes of 0.20, 0.33, and 0.77, respectively. Wald tests indicated that models representing alcohol dependence as a dimensional linear predictor best described the association between dependence criteria and the validating variables.

Conclusions

The sample sizes allowed strong tests. Diagnoses are necessary for clinical decision-making, but a dimensional alcohol-dependence indicator should provide more information for research purposes.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^fe17f2f6]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder discontinuation and maintenance guidance states that successful medication treatment should be continued for 1–2 years before considering a gradual taper by decrements of 10%–25% every 1–2 months while observing for symptom return or exacerbation [I]. Successful exposure and response prevention (ERP) should be followed by monthly booster sessions for 3–6 months, or more intensively if response has been only partial [II]. Given variability across discontinuation trials, discontinuation of pharmacotherapy should be carefully considered, and for most patients, continued treatment of some form is recommended [III], and the data suggest that CBT consisting of ERP may have more durable effects than some SRIs after discontinuation, although observed differences in relapse rates could be explained by other factors.

Three-tiered fetal heart rate (FHR) interpretation system — category definitions are as follows: Category I FHR tracings include all of the following — baseline rate 110–160 beats per minute, baseline FHR variability moderate, late or variable decelerations absent, early decelerations present or absent, and accelerations present or absent. Category II FHR tracings include all FHR tracings not categorized as category I or category III, with examples that include bradycardia not accompanied by absent baseline variability or tachycardia; minimal baseline variability, absent baseline variability with no recurrent decelerations, or marked baseline variability; absence of induced accelerations after fetal stimulation; and periodic or episodic decelerations including recurrent variable decelerations accompanied by minimal or moderate baseline variability, prolonged deceleration more than 2 minutes but less than 10 minutes, recurrent late decelerations with minimal or moderate baseline variability, or variable decelerations with other characteristics such as slow return to baseline, overshoots, or "shoulders". Category III FHR tracings include either absent baseline FHR variability and any of the following — recurrent late decelerations, recurrent variable decelerations, or bradycardia — or a sinusoidal pattern.

### A practical guide for understanding confidence intervals and P values [^c0a7d4a0]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The 95 percent confidence interval about the mean demarcates the range of values in which the mean would fall if many samples from the universal parent population were taken. In other words, if the same observation, experiment, or trial were done over and over with a different sample of subjects, but with the same characteristics as the original sample, 95 percent of the means from those repeated measures would fall within this range. This gives a measure of how confident we are in the original mean. It tells us not only whether the results are statistically significant because the CI falls totally on one side or the other of the no difference marker (0 if continuous variables; 1 if proportions), but also the actual values so that we might determine if the data seem clinically important. In contrast, the P value tells us only whether the results are statistically significant, without translating that information into values relative to the variable that was measured. Consequently, the CI is a better choice to describe the results of observations, experiments, or trials.

### American Thyroid Association guide to investigating thyroid hormone economy and action in rodent and cell models [^432b35ea]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 9b — Estimating thyroid hormone receptor (TR) maximum binding capacity in tissue can be performed via saturation analysis with T3 and Scatchard data reduction. Combined administration of tracer [125I]T3 with increasing amounts of cold T3 progressively saturates high-affinity TR binding sites, after which nuclei are isolated and processed for [125I]T3; results are expressed per milligram of DNA, and Scatchard analysis allows calculation of TR maximum binding capacity and relative affinity. The plasma T3 versus nuclear T3 curve enables calculation of TR saturation at any given T3 level, including physiological plasma levels.

### A prognostic model for functional outcome in early rheumatoid arthritis [^85a7c030]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To construct a prognostic algorithm to predict 5-year functional outcome in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), based on the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ).

Methods

Data from all patients with 5-year followup (n = 985) were used from an inception cohort, the Early Rheumatoid Arthritis Study (ERAS). Possibly relevant prognostic factors considered in the initial stage of the model-building process were standard clinical, radiological, and laboratory features measured at baseline and at 1 year. Multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression, and the predictive performance of the model was tested using measures of discrimination and calibration.

Results

Bootstrap resampling identified 6 variables that consistently predicted severe functional outcome. Functional grade III/IV (odds ratio 6.7) and HAQ at 1 year (odds ratio 2.4) were the most important. Other variables included socioeconomic status, hemoglobin, and radiographic and disease activity scores. Estimates of the regression coefficients and performance were corrected for over-fitting. Reasonably large values for the c-index (0.82) and the Nagelkerke R(2) (0.39) indicate that the set of prognostic factors explains the variation in outcome to a degree that implies good prediction for individual patients.

Conclusion

The algorithm identifies patients in the first year of RA who are likely to have poor function by 5 years and who could potentially benefit from aggressive drug therapy. A nomogram is produced for simple application of the model in clinical practice. While further external validation is necessary, this model could allow clinicians to target aggressive therapy earlier in a patient's disease course.

### The effect of hospital volume on patient outcomes in severe acute pancreatitis [^77300b5f]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Statistics

Data were analyzed using the SAS software, version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc. Cary, NC, USA). Continuous variables are presented as median (interquartile range, IQR); discrete ones as count or percentage. A two-tailed p value of < 0.05 was considered significant.

We hypothesized that hospital volume is inversely associated with hospital LOS, charges and mortality. We assumed that the relationship is linear. In the univariate analysis, we performed ANOVA test for the linearity of scaled variables and linear-by-linear association Chi-square test for categorical data. To account for clustering, the effect of hospital volume was analyzed by using regression model with generalized estimating equations methods, specifying an exchangeable structure of a working correlation matrix, to construct regression models. Hospital mortality was regressed with a logit link function and hospital LOS and charges were log-transformed and then regressed with a linear link function on hospital volume. Both univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to yield the crude and adjusted estimates. In the multivariable analysis, we performed two consecutive models adjusting for the baseline covariates in model 1 and for the baseline and additional covariates in model 2. We examined the volume effect by first using hospital volume as a continuous variable and then as a categorical variable, as aforementioned. The effects of hospital volume are presented as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for hospital mortality, and as percentage changes with 95% CI, which were calculated from the exponentiated regression coefficients minus 1, for hospital LOS and charges. Model performance was assessed by using R-squared and c statistics. The variance of outcomes explained by hospital volume was assessed and compared with that of other covariates by using the coefficient of determination (r 2) for hospital LOS and charges and, by the percentage change of -2 log likelihood (-2LL) for hospital mortality. The change in -2LL (%) was calculated by dividing the difference in -2LL values between the univariable and the intercept-only models by the corresponding value of the intercept-only model. The r 2 was derived from the univariable linear regression model. We examined the estimated slope coefficients and the standard errors of the mean and found no indication of collinearity.

### Influence of kinesiophobia and catastrophizing on pain and disability in anterior knee pain patients [^8add788e]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the prevalence and participation of catastrophizing and fear to movement beliefs on present pain and disability in anterior knee pain patients.

Methods

A cross-sectional study on 97 patients with chronic anterior knee pain was performed in a secondary healthcare setting. Pain was measured with Visual Analogue Scale and disability with Lysholm Scale. The psychological variables anxiety, depression, pain coping strategies, catastrophizing and fear to movement beliefs were studied by using auto-administered questionnaires.

Results

Patients showed a high incidence of psychological distress (anxiety and depression), kinesiophobia and catastrophizing. A moderate correlation between pain and disability was found. Among all the coping strategies, only catastrophizing correlated with pain and disability. Anxiety depression and kinesiophobia also correlated with present pain and disability. In the regression model, catastrophizing and depression explained 56% of the variance of disability and catastrophizing alone explained 37% of present pain.

Conclusion

The moderate correlation between pain and disability suggests that pain per se is not able to explain all the variability of disability. Catastrophizing and kinesiophobia are shown to be predictors of present pain and disability in anterior knee pain patients. These findings support the fear avoidance model in the genesis and persistence of pain and disability in anterior knee pain patients and open the door to a biopsychosocial perspective in the management of these patients.

### LINE-1 methylation in visceral adipose tissue of severely obese individuals is associated with metabolic syndrome status and related phenotypes [^64d92263]. Clinical Epigenetics (2012). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

Non-normally distributed phenotypes were log 10 or negative inverse transformed. The general linear model (GLM) and the type III sum of squares (all subjects: sex included in the model; sex-specific: unadjusted) were used to compare the mean phenotype levels between subjects without (MetS-) and with (MetS+) MetS. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to predict each MetS-related phenotype and MetS per se while including LINE-1%meth as an independent variable along with MetS-related potential confounding factors (see the Results section for more details about adjustments). After dividing the subjects into quartiles based on their LINE-1%meth and dichotomized by MetS- and MetS + groups, a logistic regression analysis was performed to compute odds ratios (ORs) and Wald's confidence limits to evaluate whether LINE-1%meth quartiles can predict MetS risk. Finally, a multiple linear regression analysis was used to predict LINE-1%meth levels where age, sex and smoking were included in the model as independent variables. The statistically significant P value was set at 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software V.9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

### Independence and overlap among neurocognitive correlates of community functioning in schizophrenia [^a26b6bb6]. Schizophrenia Research (2002). Low credibility.

Existing literature on the neurocognitive correlates of community functioning in schizophrenia has not adequately focused on the relationships among the correlated variables. In a sample of 40 outpatients with schizophrenia and related disorders, we studied two sets of variables that we expected to be related to broad ratings of community functioning: (1) the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III) index scores for verbal comprehension, perceptual organization, working memory, and processing speed; and (2) positive, negative, disorganized and affective symptom variables. Of the WAIS-III index scores, working memory and processing speed entered a stepwise regression, together accounting for substantial variance in functional ratings (R(2) = 0.37). However, only processing speed remained significantly associated with community functioning after controlling for the other indexes. In relation to community functioning, the remaining indexes appeared to be overlapping markers of general cognitive ability, rather than specific measures of discrete cognitive domains. Addition of positive and negative symptom variables in a further analysis greatly increased the explained functional variance (R(2) = 0.65). Processing speed overlapped substantially with negative symptoms in predicting functioning, while the other WAIS-III indexes were independent of symptomatology. Results illustrate the importance of (1) knowing which neurocognitive variables have specific relationships to community functioning and which reflect the influence of more general cognitive ability in daily life, and (2) appreciating areas of overlap and independence among classes of correlates of functioning, such as neurocognitive and symptom variables. This improved understanding has implications for predictive models of community functioning, for cognitive rehabilitation and deficit compensation strategies, and for assessment practice.

### Adjusting diet-outcome associations for random error: comparison of associations based on observed and estimated usual intakes [^bdf70322]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

To compare linear regression coefficients adjusted for random errors with true coefficients.

Subjects/Methods

Three hundred and two individuals from the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil answered 20 non-consecutive 24-hr. Means of 20 24-hr were used as an approximation of the usual dietary intakes. It was simulated outcomes with pre-defined linear regression coefficient (β = 1.0, referred as 'true coefficient') for usual coffee and soft-drink intakes as explanatory variables controlled for sex and age. Regression calibration was applied in each 1000 random combinations of j days of intake (j = 2, 4 and 6), and adjusted coefficients were compared with true one.

Results

Mean-adjusted coefficients were 1.06 to 1.03 (coffee) and 1.17 to 1.11 (soft drink). The association was not detected (95% CI included zero) in 33 to 23% (coffee) and 37 to 23% (soft drink) when using two and six collection days, respectively, compared with 20% when using observed usual intake. Frequency of consumption as covariate in the regression calibration model increased the precision of the adjusted coefficients.

Conclusions

Adjustment for random errors de-attenuates the association but its precision depends mainly on the number of collection days and sample size.

### Non-linear relationships in clinical research [^61022473]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 5:
A restricted cubic spline. Panel (A) illustrates how a cubic spline is constructed segment by segment, with the X-axis segmented by the 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 95th percentiles, using cubic polynomials to define the shape of each segment. As the cubic spline is "restricted," the first (before the 5th percentile) and last (after the 95th percentile) segment are forced to be linear. Panel (B) shows how segments are connected to each other using knots (placed at the 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 95th percentiles), and shows how the spline is restricted to join at these knots so there are no gaps in the curve. Figure copied from: Gauthier J, Wu, QV, Gooley TA. Cubic splines to model relationships between continuous variables and outcomes: a guide for clinicians. Bone Marrow Transplant 55, 675–680 (2020).

Generalized additive models

Splines can be incorporated into various types of models; they can be used not only to deal with non-linearity in simple linear regression models, but also to deal with non-linearity in other types of models that rely on the assumption of a linear relationship (i.e. logistic regression). Many of these models are included under the umbrella of a broader class of models referred to as generalized linear models (GLMs). GLMs provide a framework to model outcome variables that do not follow the traditional normal distribution assumed by simple linear regression, such as the binary outcome in logistic regression, or a count outcome in Poisson regression. It does so by using a so-called "link function" (e.g. the logit for logistic regression) which links the combination of independent variables in the model (i.e. "the linear predictor") into a form that matches the outcome variable's distribution (the binomial distribution in the case of logistic regression). Irrespective of the type of outcome, GLMs assume a linear relationship between the (link function–transformed) outcome and the independent continuous variable.

### Finding a constrained number of predictor phenotypes for multiple outcome prediction [^7c80a2bd]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2025). High credibility.

Feature importance for the constrained set of candidate predictors

Figure 4 shows the median logistic regression absolute coefficient value for each predictor across databases and prediction tasks. The higher the value, the more impact the predictor has across models. We used Spearman's rank correlation to compare the predictors' median logistic regression absolute coefficient values and the order in which the predictor was identified using #-SMD-significant. Spearman's r was 0.26, showing weak positive correlation. Figures showing the mean absolute coefficient value and number of times the variable had a non-zero coefficient can be found in online supplemental appendix E.

Figure 4
The aggregated variable importance for the constrained predictors across models developed on the different databases and prediction tasks. The aggregated variable importance is the median of the absolute coefficient value across the models. The higher the value, the more impact the predictor made across models.

### Adolescent ADHD and electrophysiological reward responsiveness: a machine learning approach to evaluate classification accuracy and prognosis [^de083943]. Psychiatry Research (2023). Medium credibility.

We evaluated event-related potential (ERP) indices of reinforcement sensitivity as ADHD biomarkers by examining, in N = 306 adolescents (M age = 15.78, SD = 1.08), the extent to which ERP amplitude and latency variables measuring reward anticipation and response (1) differentiate, in age- and sex-matched subsamples, (i) youth with vs. without ADHD, (ii) youth at-risk for vs. not at-risk for ADHD, and, in the with ADHD subsample, (iii) youth with the inattentive vs. the hyperactive/impulsive (H/I) and combined presentations. We further examined the extent to which ERP variables (2) predict, in the ADHD subsample, substance use (i) concurrently and (ii) prospectively at 18-month follow-up. Linear support vector machine analyses indicated ERPs weakly differentiate youth with/without (65%) - and at-risk for/not at-risk for (63%) - ADHD but better differentiate ADHD presentations (78%). Regression analyses showed in adolescents with ADHD, ERPs explain a considerable proportion of variance (50%) in concurrent alcohol use and, controlling for concurrent marijuana and tobacco use, explain a considerable proportion of variance (87 and 87%) in, and predict later marijuana and tobacco use. Findings are consistent with the dual-pathway model of ADHD. Results also highlight limitations of a dichotomous, syndromic classification and indicate differences in neural reinforcement sensitivity are a promising ADHD prognostic biomarker.

### Pica in childhood: concurrent and sequential psychiatric comorbidity [^0fd85332]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

3.1.2.1 Aim 1

In early childhood, pica was significantly associated with all SDQ subscales and total SDQ score (Table 3). R 2 values were negligible for the emotional [b = 0.389, sr 2 = 0.00, R 2 = 0.004, q < 0.01], conduct [b = 0.88, sr 2 = 0.00, R 2 = 0.009, q < 0.01], and peer problems subscales [b = 0.74, sr 2 = 0.00, R 2 = 0.007, q < 0.01] and small for the prosocial [b = −0.80, sr 2 = 0.00, R 2 = 0.036, q < 0.01], hyperactivity [b = 0.83, sr 2 = 0.00, R 2 = 0.031, q < 0.01], and total difficulties subscales [b = 1.03, sr 2 = 0.01, R 2 = 0.017, q < 0.01] (Table 3; Cohen). The presence of pica corresponded to a z score increase on the conduct problems (0.88), emotional problems (0.39), hyperactivity (0.83), peer problems (0.74), and total difficulties (1.03) subscales compared to no pica. Pica also corresponded to 0.80 z‐score points lower on the prosocial scale.

### Body fat measurement in adolescent athletes: multicompartment molecular model comparison [^e00678e0]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the accuracy of air displacement plethysmography (ADP) and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) per cent body fat (%BF) estimations in comparison with a reference five-compartment (5C) model used as the reference method.

Design

Cross-sectional study.

Setting

Outpatient University Laboratory, Lisbon, Portugal.

Methods

A total of 32 girls (age: 15.1 ± 0.3 years) and 46 boys (age: 15.3 ± 1.2 years) athletes were measured. Body volume was assessed by ADP; bone mineral content was assessed by DXA; and total-body water was assessed by deuterium dilution. Statistical analyses included examination of the coefficient of correlation (r), standard error of estimation (s.e.e.), slope, intercept, and pure error (p.e.) and the agreement between models.

Results

For boys and girls, differences between the 5C model and ADP %BF were 0.2 and 1.7% (r = 0.86 and 0.98, s.e.e. = 2.50 and 1.55%, p.e. = 2.77 and 2.23%), respectively. Differences between the 5C model and DXA %BF were -1.0 and -3.7% (r = 0.85 and 0.91, s.e.e. = 2.60 and 2.91%, p.e. = 2.90 and 4.66%), for boys and girls, respectively. For girls, regression between ADP and DXA against the reference method did not differ from the line of identity (P > 0.05) while for boys differences were found (P < 0.05). Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry overestimated %BF, particularly in girls. For both genders, large limits of agreement were found between the reference method and both techniques, with the exception of ADP in female athletes.

Conclusion

We conclude that the two techniques were not precise for individual %BF prediction, though ADP revealed better agreement for girls. However, considering all performance criteria for the mean group, our analysis highlights ADP as a valid and nonbiased tool for the evaluation of body composition in adolescent athletes.
