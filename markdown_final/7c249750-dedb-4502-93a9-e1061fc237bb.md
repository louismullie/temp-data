## Question

Fda indicated meds borderline personality disorder

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether any medications are FDA-indicated for borderline personality disorder. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental FDA approval status for borderline personality disorder. Then, I should verify the first-line, guideline-recommended treatment framework. Next, I will review the evidence for off-label pharmacotherapies by symptom domain, followed by safety and polypharmacy concerns. After that, I will outline guideline-driven prescribing principles and a practical decision pathway, and finally synthesize the bottom line and recommendations. As I do this, I will continually cross-check against current APA guidelines, Cochrane reviews, and recent summaries such as the JAMA review to ensure accuracy and balance.

> Let me first confirm the FDA status so I don't misstate a core fact. I need to check whether any medication carries an FDA indication specifically for borderline personality disorder; wait, I should verify across guideline summaries and regulatory outcomes. The APA guideline frames pharmacotherapy as adjunctive and time-limited for specific target symptoms, which implies off-label use rather than a formal BPD indication [^117XSk8v]. The updated Cochrane review explicitly notes that medications used in BPD are off-label, despite common prescribing in clinical settings [^114yTJqK]. The JAMA review likewise states there is no evidence that any psychoactive medication consistently improves core BPD symptoms, which is consistent with the absence of an FDA-approved agent for BPD; large industry trials (for example, olanzapine) did not lead to approval, reinforcing that no drug currently holds a BPD indication [^114yTJqK] [^114v4CDT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment hierarchy before I corroborate first-line care. Psychotherapy is the treatment of choice and should be prioritized, with structured approaches such as dialectical behavior therapy and mentalization-based therapy demonstrating medium effect sizes and consistent benefits on global BPD symptom severity and functioning [^114SSj7a]. I should confirm this with primary care guidance and specialty guidelines: AAFP recommends offering psychotherapy first-line, and the APA guideline emphasizes structured psychotherapies targeting core features, aligning on psychotherapy as the foundation of care [^112Cn7CJ] [^116WnnvB].

> Next, I should review off-label pharmacotherapies by symptom domain, but I need to be careful to separate signals from noise. For affective dysregulation and impulsivity, omega-3 fatty acids have replicated signals in small RCTs and a meta-analysis demonstrating moderate reductions in global BPD severity, with specific benefits on affect dysregulation and impulsive behavior and a favorable risk profile; let me double-check that the effect sizes are not overstated: pooled standardized differences around the moderate range were reported with low heterogeneity, which supports cautiously considering omega-3s as a low-risk adjunct for defined targets [^111Bjqao] [^111UHESx].

> Now, regarding second-generation antipsychotics, I should double-check the magnitude and clinical meaningfulness of effects and not over-interpret individual trials. Quetiapine in one placebo-controlled RCT reduced distress, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, and hostility at 8 weeks, though higher doses had more adverse events and overall evidence remains limited and not definitive for core BPD improvement, so any use should be conservative and target-specific [^112waKZA]. Olanzapine has shown small-to-modest effects on BPD symptom scales in trials, but wait, I need to weigh this against metabolic risks and the lack of consistent clinically meaningful benefits across reviews; Cochrane analyses and subsequent updates caution against robust efficacy claims and highlight adverse effects including metabolic changes and potential signals of increased self-harm in some datasets, so the overall risk-benefit is poor for broad use [^113UjRug] [^116DWKe5] [^114yTJqK].

> I should also examine mood stabilizers and antidepressants carefully. Lamotrigine initially appeared promising in smaller studies, but hold on, I should verify large-scale pragmatic data; a large effectiveness trial did not detect beneficial effects in routine care, which shifts lamotrigine toward a negative recommendation for BPD targets [^1111ARFq] [^114v4CDT]. For SSRIs, my first thought was that they might help core BPD symptoms given frequent comorbidity with depression and anxiety, but wait, let me reconsider: contemporary reviews emphasize no consistent improvement in core BPD pathology; SSRIs may be appropriate when treating discrete comorbid major depression or anxiety per usual standards, but they should not be expected to modify BPD itself [^114SSj7a] [^114v4CDT].

> Before suggesting any off-label medication, I need to ensure safety context and practice patterns are transparent. Polypharmacy is prevalent in BPD despite weak evidence, with high rates of antipsychotic prescribing in both inpatient and outpatient settings; I should double-check that this is not guideline-concordant and recognize the metabolic, sedation, and other adverse risk burdens, particularly with agents like olanzapine; careful risk-benefit documentation and monitoring are essential if any off-label agent is tried [^114yTJqK] [^116DWKe5]. I will now examine whether any newly tested agents change the landscape; a recent phase 2 trial of a TRPC4/5 inhibitor failed to demonstrate efficacy on primary and secondary endpoints, reinforcing the current absence of a disease-modifying pharmacotherapy [^112bymbs].

> Next, I should review guideline-driven prescribing principles so I don't miss critical safeguards. The APA recommends that any pharmacotherapy be adjunctive to psychotherapy, time-limited, and focused on a specific, measurable target symptom, with ongoing collaborative psychoeducation and informed consent about off-label status and limited evidence [^117XSk8v] [^116qV3M2]. I should confirm the operational steps: obtain a thorough review of co-occurring disorders, prior psychotherapies, nonpharmacologic treatments, and current/past medications before starting a new drug, and reassess at least every six months to determine effectiveness and whether tapering or discontinuation is warranted [^112MYdM4] [^113jZxQs]. If medications are considered, family medicine guidance suggests they be used only to target specific symptoms, reflecting low-quality evidence and the need to prefer lowest-risk options first [^113ixViV].

> Let me translate this into a pragmatic decision pathway, but I should double-check that each branch aligns with evidence and guidelines. If the patient is not engaged in structured psychotherapy, prioritize referral and initiation of an evidence-based modality such as DBT or mentalization-based therapy as the foundational intervention; pharmacotherapy without psychotherapy is not guideline-concordant care [^112Cn7CJ] [^116WnnvB]. If discrete, severe target symptoms persist, consider a low-risk trial where evidence suggests potential benefit: omega-3 fatty acids for affective dysregulation or impulsivity; quetiapine may be considered at the lowest effective dose for distress or hostility with clear metabolic and sedation monitoring, recognizing limited and mixed evidence; treat comorbid major depression or anxiety per standard practice using antidepressants, while not expecting improvement in core BPD features [^111Bjqao] [^112waKZA] [^114SSj7a]. Establish baseline risk mitigation including weight, glucose, and lipids, conduct suicide risk assessment, and document measurable targets and a time-limited plan with a six-month reassessment and a willingness to taper if no meaningful benefit emerges [^117XSk8v] [^113jZxQs].

> I should double-check that the final synthesis is precise. Direct answer: there are no FDA-approved medications for borderline personality disorder; all pharmacotherapy is off-label and should be adjunctive, time-limited, and target-specific, with psychotherapy as first-line [^114yTJqK] [^117XSk8v]. Clinically, psychotherapy is mandatory foundational care; omega-3 fatty acids have the most favorable signal-to-risk profile for affective and impulsive symptoms; quetiapine shows limited short-term benefits but requires careful monitoring; lamotrigine is not effective in pragmatic trials; and olanzapine's risk-benefit is poor for routine use despite small effect sizes in some trials, aligning with the broader conclusion that medications do not consistently improve core BPD symptoms [^111Bjqao] [^112waKZA] [^1111ARFq] [^113UjRug] [^116DWKe5] [^114SSj7a]. Bottom line: approach pharmacotherapy with caution, avoid polypharmacy, align with guideline safeguards, and maintain rigorous monitoring with planned discontinuation if targets are not met; the lack of FDA approval reflects the limited and inconsistent efficacy data to date [^117XSk8v] [^113jZxQs] [^114v4CDT].

There are **no FDA-approved medications** for borderline personality disorder (BPD) [^114SSj7a]. Pharmacotherapy is used **off-label** [^117XSk8v] to target symptoms — such as affective instability, impulsivity [^114yTJqK], or aggression [^115U4cAc] — and should be adjunctive to psychotherapy [^117XSk8v]. Psychotherapy [^116WnnvB], particularly dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), is the first-line treatment for BPD [^112Cn7CJ].

## FDA-approved medications for BPD

Currently, there are **no FDA-approved medications** specifically for BPD [^114SSj7a] [^113C9ntZ]. For **off-label use** [^117XSk8v], medications may be prescribed to manage specific symptoms or comorbid conditions [^114SSj7a] [^113ixViV].

---

## Medications commonly used off-label for BPD

Although **no medications are FDA-approved** for BPD [^114yTJqK], several classes are used **off-label** [^115U4cAc] to target specific symptoms:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Target symptoms** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Antidepressants | - SSRIs (e.g. fluoxetine, sertraline) <br/> - SNRIs (e.g. venlafaxine) | - Affective instability <br/> - Depression <br/> - Anxiety | Moderate |
| Mood stabilizers | - Lamotrigine <br/> - Valproate <br/> - Topiramate | - Impulsivity <br/> - Aggression <br/> - Mood swings | Moderate |
| Antipsychotics | - Quetiapine <br/> - Olanzapine <br/> - Aripiprazole | - Impulsivity <br/> - Aggression <br/> - Cognitive-perceptual symptoms | Moderate [^114SSj7a] [^113UjRug] |
| Omega-3 fatty acids | - Ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (E-EPA) | - Aggression <br/> - Depressive symptoms | Low [^111UHESx] [^111Bjqao] [^113ixViV] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Psychotherapy first-line**: Psychotherapy [^116WnnvB], particularly DBT, is the primary treatment for BPD [^112Cn7CJ].

- **Adjunctive pharmacotherapy**: Medications should be used adjunctively [^117XSk8v], targeting specific symptoms, and regularly reviewed [^113jZxQs] for effectiveness and side effects.

- **Regular review**: Medications should be reviewed at least every six months [^113jZxQs] to assess effectiveness and identify those warranting tapering or discontinuation.

---

## Limitations and risks of pharmacological treatment

- **Limited evidence**: There is limited evidence supporting pharmacotherapy for core BPD symptoms [^114SSj7a].

- **Side effects**: Medications can cause significant side effects [^116DWKe5], including metabolic changes, weight gain [^113UjRug], and increased risk of self-harm.

- **Polypharmacy**: Polypharmacy [^113j9gnY] is common but often unsupported by evidence, increasing the risk of adverse effects [^114yTJqK].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

Research on **novel agents**, such as TRPC4/5 ion channel inhibitors, is ongoing [^1156MK6j], although initial results have not shown efficacy [^112bymbs]. Future work may explore **personalized medicine** approaches targeting specific symptom clusters or genetic markers [^114k46KG].

---

There are **no FDA-approved medications** for BPD [^113C9ntZ]. Pharmacotherapy is used off-label [^117XSk8v] to manage specific symptoms or comorbid conditions, and **psychotherapy remains the first-line treatment** [^112Cn7CJ].

### Pharmacological interventions for people with borderline personality disorder [^114yTJqK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Among people diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) who are engaged in clinical care, prescription rates of psychotropic medications are high, even though medication use is off-label for BPD treatment. Nevertheless, individuals with BPD often receive several psychotropic drugs simultaneously over sustained periods.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of pharmacological treatment for people with BPD.

- **Search methods**: For this update, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, 14 other databases, and four trials registers up to February 2022. We contacted researchers working in the field to obtain additional data from published and unpublished trials and handsearched relevant journals. We did not restrict the search by year of publication, language, or type of publication.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials comparing pharmacological treatment to placebo, other pharmacological treatments, or a combination of pharmacological treatments in individuals of all ages with a formal diagnosis of BPD. The primary outcomes were BPD symptom severity, self-harm, suicide-related outcomes, and psychosocial functioning. Secondary outcomes included individual BPD symptoms, depression, attrition, and adverse events.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, assessed risk of bias using Cochrane's risk of bias tool, and evaluated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We performed data analysis using Review Manager 5 and quantified the statistical reliability of the data using Trial Sequential Analysis.

### Borderline personality disorder: A review [^114SSj7a]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) affects approximately 0.7% to 2.7% of adults in the US. The disorder is associated with considerable social and vocational impairments and greater use of medical services.

- **Observations**: Borderline personality disorder is characterized by sudden shifts in identity, interpersonal relationships, and affect, as well as by impulsive behavior, periodic intense anger, feelings of emptiness, suicidal behavior, self-mutilation, transient stress-related paranoid ideation, and severe dissociative symptoms (e.g. experience of unreality of one's self or surroundings). Borderline personality disorder is typically diagnosed by a mental health specialist using semistructured interviews. Most people with BPD have coexisting mental disorders such as mood disorders (i.e. major depression or bipolar disorder) (83%), anxiety disorders (85%), or substance use disorders (78%). The etiology of BPD is related to both genetic factors and adverse childhood experiences, such as sexual and physical abuse.

Psychotherapy is the treatment of choice for BPD. Psychotherapy, such as dialectical behavior therapy and psychodynamic therapy, reduces symptom severity more than usual care, with medium effect sizes (standardized mean difference) between -0.60 and -0.65. There is no evidence that any psychoactive medication consistently improves core symptoms of BPD. For discrete and severe comorbid mental disorders, e.g. major depression, pharmacotherapy such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors escitalopram, sertraline, or fluoxetine may be prescribed.

### Acute, chronic, and everyday physical pain in borderline personality disorder [^113ecJ4n]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Appropriate treatment for chronic pain is an especially important issue for those with BPD given challenges specific to this population. Despite concerns about risks, prescription opioids remain a primary treatment option for chronic pain, particularly in the US. Frankenburg et al. found that participants with BPD (n = 264) were more likely to report prescription opioid use than comparison participants with another personality disorder (n = 63), which may be due to higher rates of co-occurrence of BPD with chronic pain conditions. Additional evidence suggests that people with BPD may be at risk for problematic prescription opioid use.

For instance, in a sample of outpatients who currently or have previously been prescribed pain medication (N = 185), BPD symptoms were associated with measures of prescription pain medication misuse. In college student samples, BPD features have been associated with negative reinforcement motives (coping and pain) for prescription opioid use (N = 594) and measures of misuse, including opioid consequences and dependence features (N = 606). Finally, in samples in treatment for chronic pain (N = 147) and samples in treatment for substance use disorder (N = 208), BPD features have been associated with prescription opioid misuse, with particularly strong associations between measures of misuse and the identity disturbance and self-harm/impulsivity facets of BPD.

It is important to note that these findings do not indicate that people with BPD cannot benefit from appropriate opioid therapy. However, patients with BPD and chronic pain may benefit.

### Renflexis [^115C8uSM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Patients or their caregivers should be informed of the potential benefits and risks of Renflexis. Physicians are advised to instruct their patients to read the Medication Guide before starting Renflexis therapy and to reread it each time they receive an infusion. It is crucial that the patient's overall health is assessed at each treatment visit and that any questions arising from the patient's or caregiver's reading of the Medication Guide are discussed.

- **Immunosuppression**: Inform patients that Renflexis may lower the ability of their immune system to fight infections. Instruct patients on the importance of contacting their doctors if they develop any infection symptoms, including tuberculosis and reactivation of hepatitis B virus infections. Patients should be counseled about the risk of lymphoma and other malignancies while receiving Renflexis.

- **Other medical conditions**: Advise patients to report any signs of new or worsening medical conditions such as heart disease, neurological disease, or autoimmune disorders. Additionally, patients should report any symptoms of cytopenia, such as bruising, bleeding, or persistent fever.

### Pharmacotherapy for borderline personality disorder: an update of published, unpublished and ongoing studies [^1111ARFq]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020). Low credibility.

We aim to identify the most recent evidence from randomized controlled trials evaluating continued drug treatments in people with a diagnosis of BPD, review the most recent findings, highlight trends in terms of currently ongoing studies, and comment on the overall body of evidence.

- **Recent findings**: We identified seven new RCTs and newly available data for an older RCT. Only three of these RCTs have been published in full text, while we found study data posted at trial registry platforms for the others.

- **Summary**: The new findings do not support fluoxetine as a treatment option for suicide and self-harm prevention. A large effectiveness study did not detect beneficial effects of lamotrigine in routine care. The prevalent use of medications in BPD is still not reflected or supported by the evidence. More research is needed regarding the most commonly used substances and substance classes, such as SSRIs and quetiapine, particularly in people presenting with distinct comorbid conditions.

### Toward integrated treatment for co-occurring borderline personality disorder and eating disorders: A clinician perspective [^112tsUin]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

The co-occurrence of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and eating disorders (ED) frequently leads to greater complexity and severity, necessitating the involvement of specialist services that may not work in a coordinated manner. Clinicians familiar with treating both disorders consider emotion dysregulation and distress intolerance to be core shared components. Treatments with proven effectiveness for treating either disorder may be combined in a holistic approach to address the shared psychopathology of co-occurring BPD and ED.

### The emerging field of psychedelic psychotherapy [^111mqU6N]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Aside from ketamine, no psychedelic treatments have yet been approved for therapeutic use by the US Food and Drug Administration. Both MDMA and psilocybin remain on Schedule 1 of the US Controlled Substances Act, which means that officially, they are still considered to lack legitimate medical uses. Should MDMA and psilocybin become FDA approved, they would be reclassified into a less restrictive scheduling category. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have determined that, on the basis of psilocybin's pharmacological characteristics, including its low abuse liability, it would be most appropriate for a Schedule 4 designation, which would place it in the same category as commonly used benzodiazepines. Similar conversations about the appropriate scheduling level for MDMA are unfolding as research progresses.

Meanwhile, researchers are increasingly exploring the role of psychedelics in other psychiatric conditions. Ongoing or planned trials for psilocybin are exploring its ability to treat bipolar depression, suicidal ideation, depression associated with early Alzheimer's disease, anorexia nervosa, and mood disorders in early-stage cancer patients (as opposed to late-stage/life-threatening cancers). There has also been discussion in the research community on the prospect of using psilocybin to treat personality disorders, including borderline personality disorder. Research with MDMA has for the most part remained focused on its use in PTSD.

### Recovery and functional outcomes following olanzapine treatment for bipolar I mania [^113X42iM]. Bipolar Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Typical experimental categorizations of treatment responses in bipolar disorder (BPD) patients may have a limited relationship to clinical recovery or functional status, and there is inadequate research on such clinically important outcomes.

- **Methods**: We analyzed data from a study of open continuation of olanzapine treatment following a 3-week placebo-controlled trial involving initially hospitalized adult subjects with DSM-IV BP-I mania to estimate rates and times to symptomatic remission (low scores on standardized symptomatic assessments) and clinical recovery (remission sustained for 8 or more weeks), associated clinical factors, and functional outcomes.

- **Results**: During treatment with olanzapine for 27.9 ± 20.1 weeks, symptomatic remission was attained by 70% of subjects, half by 8 weeks (95% CI 6–10 weeks), and later lost by 82% of remitted subjects; remitted (versus non-remitted) subjects had slightly lower baseline clinical global impression scores and greater trial completion. Sustained clinical recovery was attained by only 40 of 113 (35%) of subjects, half by 36 (95% CI 20–40) weeks, and later lost by 45%. Subjects with above-median (> 12) initial Hamilton Depression Rating Scale depression scores were half as likely to recover (p = 0.016) and did so much later (36 weeks versus 12 weeks) than those with lower scores. At the final assessment, self-rated well-being (SF-36 psychosocial functioning scores) improved substantially more among recovered versus non-recovered subjects (mean changes: 87% versus 23%), and two-thirds of recovered subjects remained unemployed for pay while…

### A dose comparison of olanzapine for the treatment of borderline personality disorder: a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^113UjRug]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). High credibility.

To examine the efficacy and safety of olanzapine at low and moderate doses for the treatment of borderline personality disorder, a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted. Involving 451 outpatients aged 18–65 years with DSM-IV borderline personality disorder, the participants received either olanzapine 2.5 mg/day (n = 150), olanzapine 5–10 mg/day (n = 148), or placebo (n = 153). The trial took place from February 2004 through January 2006 at 59 community-based and academic study centers across 9 countries, including the United States, Italy, Poland, Romania, Turkey, Chile, Peru, Argentina, and Venezuela.

The primary efficacy measure was the mean change from baseline to last-observation-carried-forward endpoint on the Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN-BPD) total score. Secondary measures included the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, the Modified Overt Aggression Scale, the Global Assessment of Functioning, the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised, and the Sheehan Disability Scale.

An overall mean baseline ZAN-BPD total score of 17.2 (SD = 4.9) indicated moderate symptom severity. Treatment with olanzapine 5–10 mg/day was associated with a significantly greater mean change from baseline to endpoint in ZAN-BPD total score relative to placebo (-8.5 vs -6.8, respectively; p = 0.010; effect size = 0.29; 95% CI, 0.06–0.52). Response rates, defined by a ≥ 50% decrease from baseline in ZAN-BPD total score, were significantly higher for olanzapine 5–10 mg/day (73.6%) compared to olanzapine 2.5 mg/day (60.1%; p = 0.018) and placebo (57.8%; p = 0.006).

### Pharmacotherapy for borderline personality disorder: An update of published, unpublished, and ongoing studies [^116BC1fk]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020). Low credibility.

- **Recently published RCT data**: We identified one new randomized controlled trial (RCT) that compared the effects of the two second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), olanzapine and asenapine, and two records adding new data to a previously published placebo-controlled RCT of quetiapine. Bozzatello and colleagues conducted a head-to-head comparison of olanzapine and asenapine, observing limited differences: olanzapine showed superiority regarding dissociation, while asenapine was superior in terms of affective instability. However, the trial lacked a placebo control group, rendering it a comparison of two substances with uncertain efficacy. At the time of writing, the evidence does not allow us to conclude that olanzapine is a helpful and safe treatment option, and asenapine has yet to be subjected to a placebo-controlled RCT in borderline personality disorder (BPD). Even if asenapine were convincingly superior to olanzapine, the benefit to patients remains uncertain. Given the limited therapeutic effects and well-documented adverse effects of both substances observed in this trial (asenapine: oral hypoesthesia, anxiety/restlessness, akathisia; olanzapine: weight gain, somnolence, fatigue), neither option seems to be a viable treatment.

- **New data on quetiapine**: New data have become available for the sole existing placebo-controlled RCT of quetiapine. The authors posted final raw data on the website, enabling calculations of between-group effect sizes during post-treatment. Using these data, we observed moderate to large, statistically significant effects.

### Efficacy and comparative effectiveness of atypical antipsychotic medications for off-label uses in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116F3g2v]. JAMA (2011). Low credibility.

Atypical antipsychotic medications are commonly used for off-label conditions such as agitation in dementia, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. This study aims to perform a systematic review on the efficacy and safety of atypical antipsychotic medications for conditions lacking approval for labeling and marketing by the US Food and Drug Administration.

- **Data sources and study selection**: Relevant studies published in the English language were identified by searches of six databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Cochrane DARE, and CENTRAL) from inception through May 2011. Controlled trials comparing an atypical antipsychotic medication (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, asenapine, iloperidone, or paliperidone) with placebo, another atypical antipsychotic medication, or other pharmacotherapy for adult off-label conditions were included. Observational studies with sample sizes of greater than 1000 patients were included to assess adverse events.

- **Data extraction**: Independent article review and study quality assessment were conducted by two investigators.

- **Data synthesis**: Of 12,228 citations identified, 162 contributed data to the efficacy review. Among 14 placebo-controlled trials of elderly patients with dementia reporting a total global outcome score that includes symptoms such as psychosis, mood alterations, and aggression, small but statistically significant effect sizes ranging from 0.12 to 0.20 were observed for aripiprazole, olanzapine, and risperidone. For generalized anxiety disorder, a pooled analysis of three trials showed that quetiapine…

### Pharmacological interventions for borderline personality disorder [^115U4cAc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). High credibility.

Drugs are widely used in borderline personality disorder (BPD) treatment, chosen because of properties known from other psychiatric disorders ("off-label use"), mostly targeting affective or impulsive symptom clusters.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of drug treatment in BPD patients.

- **Search strategy**: We searched bibliographic databases according to the Cochrane Developmental, Psychosocial and Learning Problems Group strategy up to September 2009, reference lists of articles, and contacted researchers in the field.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized studies comparing drug versus placebo or drug versus drug(s) in BPD patients were included. Outcomes assessed involved total BPD severity, distinct BPD symptom facets according to DSM-IV criteria, associated psychopathology not specific to BPD, attrition, and adverse effects.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently selected trials, assessed quality, and extracted data.

- **Main results**: Twenty-eight trials involving a total of 1,742 participants were included. First-generation antipsychotics (flupenthixol decanoate, haloperidol, thiothixene); second-generation antipsychotics (aripiprazole, olanzapine, ziprasidone); mood stabilizers (carbamazepine, valproate semisodium, lamotrigine, topiramate); antidepressants (amitriptyline, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, phenelzine sulfate, mianserin); and dietary supplementation (omega-3 fatty acid) were tested. First-generation antipsychotics were subject to older trials, whereas recent studies focused on second-generation antipsychotics and mood stabilizers. Data were sparse for individual outcomes of interest.

### Psychopharmacology of personality disorders: Review and emerging issues [^111YXtnk]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2001). Low credibility.

Progress with the development of models and general principles of psychopharmacologic management of personality-disordered patients is reviewed. Recent research using mood stabilizers and novel antipsychotics is discussed. The effects of these medications on impulsive aggressiveness are supported and the effects are evident early and are independent of the effects on mood, including depression. Research is needed with other personality disorders beyond just borderline personality disorder. Future research must develop measurable outcomes and delineate the causal and temporal relationships between the psychopathologic features of personality disorders.

### New frontiers in the role of hospitalization for patients with personality disorders [^1156XojY]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2007). Low credibility.

The question of hospitalization in patients who suffer from borderline personality disorder is very contentious. Through a case-based approach, this review article highlights the issues surrounding this controversy. It then reviews the practice guidelines and examines the evidence for various forms of hospitalization. A synthesis of this information leads to practical recommendations for the management of this challenging population.

Pharmacotherapy is a very common form of treatment for borderline personality disorder or its concomitant disorders. This paper reviews all the open-label and placebo-controlled trials of second-generation medications studied in samples of well-defined borderline patients. Most of the medications studied in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were efficacious. These medications were also useful in treating symptoms of affective dysregulation and impulsive aggression, which have been suggested to be the core dimensions of psychopathology underlying borderline personality disorder.

Taken together, the results of these studies suggest that the choice of medication can be guided as much by tolerability and safety as by symptom presentation. This also suggests that the common practice of polypharmacy, which has no empirical support, may be unnecessary for most patients with borderline personality disorder.

### Management and effectiveness of psychopharmacology in emotionally unstable and borderline personality disorder [^113j9gnY]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

The article by Paton and colleagues on the use of psychotropic medication in patients with emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD) in the issue of JCP is an important article. Assuming that EUPD as defined by ICD-10 (F60.3) is reasonably equivalent to borderline personality disorder (BPD) as defined in the United States by DSM, we gain insight into how practitioners think about prescribing medications to people with EUPD/BPD. The article not only offers information on the class of medication these practitioners are using but also provides reasons for the prescriptions, such as specific clinical signs and symptoms for which the medications are being prescribed.

### Borderline personality disorder [^1127MiMh]. Lancet (2004). High credibility.

The disease borderline personality disorder can be associated with various conditions, including anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and unstable interpersonal relationships. Other associated factors are child abuse, alcohol use disorder, self-harm, irritability, and fears of abandonment. Additionally, conditions such as PTSD, substance use disorder, ADHD, and suicidal ideation are often linked. Hostility, anxiety, emotional abuse, dissociative disorder, sexual abuse, and eating disorder are also prevalent connections. Furthermore, individuals may experience feelings of emptiness, emotional lability, use of transitional objects, personality disorder, and impulsivity.

### Ziprasidone in the treatment of borderline personality disorder: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study [^113cg2JH]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of ziprasidone in the treatment of adult patients with borderline personality disorder. Sixty DSM-IV borderline personality disorder patients were included from March 2004 to April 2006 in a 12-week, single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The subjects were randomly assigned to ziprasidone or placebo in a 1:1 ratio following a 2-week baseline period. The Clinical Global Impressions scale for use in borderline personality disorder patients (CGI-BPD) was the primary outcome measure, and other scales and self-reports related to affect, behavior, psychosis, general psychopathology domains, and clinical safety were included.

Analysis of variance indicated no statistically significant differences between ziprasidone and placebo in the CGI-BPD, nor were significant differences observed between groups in depressive, anxiety, psychotic, or impulsive symptoms. The mean daily dose of ziprasidone was 84.1 mg/day (SD = 54.8; range, 40–200). The drug was seen to be safe, and no serious adverse effects were observed.

This trial failed to show a significant effect of ziprasidone in patients with borderline personality disorder. Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00635921.

### Open-label study of atypical neuroleptic quetiapine for treatment of borderline personality disorder: Impulsivity as main target [^1172rwWf]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Recent studies indicate that atypical neuroleptics may be safe and useful in treating many symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD), including impulsivity, which can constitute the core dimension of this pathology. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of quetiapine in patients with well-defined BPD. It was hypothesized that quetiapine would reduce impulsivity (primary hypothesis) and also affective and micropsychotic symptoms, resulting in improved social and global functioning (secondary hypothesis).

- **Method**: Twenty-three outpatients with BPD according to DSM-IV criteria and the revised Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines completed a 12-week open-label study with quetiapine. The study was conducted from May 2001 to May 2003. Clinical efficacy was assessed using the following: Hamilton Rating Scales for Depression and Anxiety, Hopelessness Scale, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Barratt Impulsivity Scale, Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory, Temperament and Character Inventory, Social Adjustment Scale, and Global Assessment of Functioning.

- **Results**: The mean daily dose of quetiapine (251 ± 50 mg; range, 175–400 mg) was well tolerated. Impulsivity was significantly improved by quetiapine (p = .0015), as were most of our outcome measures: hostility, depression, anxiety, character dimensions, and social and global functioning (p < .05). In the small subgroup of patients with psychotic symptoms at baseline, there was a significant reduction in these symptoms (N = 8, p = .018).

- **Conclusion**: In a sample of patients with severe BPD, the results demonstrate that quetiapine is effective in improving impulsivity and other associated symptoms, although some text appears truncated. Further research is warranted to confirm these findings.

### Lamotrigine in psychiatric disorders [^115A1Y9G]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Owing to the prevalence of medication side effects and treatment resistance, prescribers often consider off-label uses of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agents for the treatment of persistent symptoms. The authors review the available literature on the FDA-approved and non-FDA-approved uses of lamotrigine in adults with psychiatric disorders.

- **Data sources**: We used PubMed, MEDLINE, and a hand search of relevant literature to find studies published between 1990 and 2012 and available in English language. The following keywords were searched: lamotrigine, psychiatric, mood disorders, depression, personality disorders, anxiety, schizophrenia, side effects, and rash.

- **Study selection**: Data were selected from 29 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). When RCTs were not available, open-label trials (6), retrospective case reviews (10), and case series (4) were summarized.

- **Data extraction**: We extracted results of monotherapy and augmentation trials of lamotrigine on primary and secondary outcome measures.

- **Results**: Lamotrigine is generally well tolerated, with the best evidence for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder, particularly in the prevention of depressive episodes. In acute bipolar depression, meta-analyses suggested a modest benefit, especially for more severely depressed subjects, with switch rates similar to placebo. In unipolar depression, double-blind RCTs noted benefit on subsets of symptoms and improved response in more severely depressed subjects. Data are limited but promising in borderline personality disorder.

### Association between quetiapine use and self-harm outcomes among people with recorded personality disorder in UK primary care: A self-controlled case series analysis [^111ti2Zg]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Low credibility.

Approximately 12% of the general population are estimated to meet criteria for a personality disorder, characterized by a pattern of maladaptive and inflexible personality traits, resulting in significant distress and functional impairment. A number of studies have highlighted the shortcomings of categorical distinctions between personality disorder subtypes, leading to their removal in the 11th version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).

Pharmacological approaches to managing symptoms associated with personality disorders are commonly delivered in clinical practice. However, these treatments are not supported by high-quality evidence regarding their effectiveness and are not recommended routinely in the majority of treatment guidelines for personality disorders. The United Kingdom (UK) National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines state that antipsychotic medication should not be used for the medium- to long-term treatment of antisocial or borderline personality disorder. We recently found that 25% of people in UK primary care with a personality disorder diagnosis (and no diagnostic code suggesting psychotic illness) have been prescribed antipsychotic medication. Quetiapine, a dopamine and serotonin receptor antagonist, and norepinephrine transporter inhibitor, is the antipsychotic medication most commonly prescribed in this group.

### The physician's unique role in preventing violence: A neglected opportunity [^113men64]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Although no drugs have a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved indication for violence, many therapeutic options have been tested in randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind trials. Psychiatrists use various classes of drugs as treatment for violence, but treatment guidelines have not been established. The point of this article is to introduce existent therapeutic options rather than to provide a detailed review of pharmacotherapy, which has been reviewed elsewhere.

Medication is not a panacea; all types of violence are not amenable to pharmacological therapy. For example, treatment with the classic anticonvulsant phenytoin was shown to reduce impulsive but not premeditated violence. In previous reviews, the use of anticonvulsants, beta blockers, and atypical antipsychotic agents has been described in detail. For more than 40 years, lithium has been used in many populations to treat violence. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors are commonly used in the setting of depression but can also be effective for reducing chronic anger. These inhibitors are often initially used at low doses to guard against any paradoxical exacerbating effect.

Since the use of all of these medications for reducing violence is "off label", it is important to carefully monitor for any adverse effects, which can in some instances cause an increase in irritability and aggression.

### Pharmacotherapy for borderline personality disorder — current evidence and recent trends [^116VWZTP]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Drug treatment for patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) is common but generally lacks support from high-quality research evidence. This review summarizes the evidence up to August 2014 and aims to identify research trends regarding ongoing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as well as research gaps.

There is some evidence for beneficial effects from second-generation antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and omega-3 fatty acids, although the overall evidence base remains unsatisfactory. The dominant role of SSRI antidepressants in the medical treatment of BPD patients is neither reflected nor supported by corresponding evidence. Any drug treatment for BPD patients should be planned and regularly evaluated against this backdrop of evidence.

Research trends indicate increasing attention to alternative treatments such as dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids or oxytocin.

### Olanzapine treatment of female borderline personality disorder patients: a double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study [^117VotQB]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

The intent of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of olanzapine versus placebo in the treatment of women meeting criteria for borderline personality disorder (BPD).

- **Method**: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of olanzapine in 28 female subjects meeting Revised Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines and DSM-IV criteria for BPD. The subjects were randomly assigned to olanzapine or placebo in a 2:1 manner. Treatment duration was 6 months. Primary outcome measures were self-reported changes on the anxiety, depression, paranoia, anger/hostility, and interpersonal sensitivity scales of the Symptom Checklist-90.

- **Results**: Nineteen subjects were randomly assigned to olanzapine, and 9 to placebo. When random effects regression modeling of panel data was used, controlling for baseline level of severity, olanzapine was associated with a significantly greater rate of improvement over time than placebo in all symptom areas studied except depression (p < .05). Weight gain was modest in the olanzapine-treated group but was significantly higher than in those treated with placebo (p < .02). Additionally, no serious movement disorders were noted.

- **Conclusion**: Olanzapine appears to be a safe and effective agent in the treatment of women with criteria-defined BPD, significantly affecting all four core areas of borderline psychopathology: affect, cognition, impulsivity, and interpersonal relationships.

### Omega-3 fatty acid treatment of women with borderline personality disorder: A double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study [^111UHESx]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (E-EPA) and placebo in the treatment of female subjects with borderline personality disorder.

- **Method**: The authors conducted an 8-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of E-EPA in 30 female subjects meeting Revised Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines and DSM-IV criteria for borderline personality disorder.

- **Results**: Twenty subjects were randomly assigned to 1 g of E-EPA; 10 subjects were given placebo. Ninety percent of those in both groups completed all 8 weeks of the trial. Analyses that used random-effects regression modeling and controlled for baseline severity showed E-EPA to be superior to placebo in diminishing aggression as well as the severity of depressive symptoms.

- **Conclusions**: The results of this study suggest that E-EPA may be a safe and effective form of monotherapy for women with moderately severe borderline personality disorder.

### Heritability of borderline personality disorder features is similar across three countries [^114k46KG]. Psychological Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Most of our knowledge about borderline personality disorder features has been obtained through the study of clinical samples. Although these studies are important in their own right, they are limited in their ability to address certain important epidemiological and aetiological questions, such as the degree to which there is a genetic influence on the manifestation of borderline personality disorder features. Though family history studies of borderline personality disorder indicate genetic influences, there have been very few twin studies, and the degree of genetic influence on borderline personality disorder remains unclear.

- **Method**: Data were drawn from twin samples from The Netherlands (n = 3918), Belgium (n = 904), and Australia (n = 674). In total, data were available on 5496 twins between the ages of 18 and 86 years from 3644 families who participated in the study by completion of a mailed self-report questionnaire on borderline personality disorder features.

- **Results**: In all countries, females scored higher than males, and there was a general tendency for younger adults to endorse more borderline personality disorder features than older adults. Model-fitting results showed that additive genetic influences explain 42% of the variation in borderline personality disorder features in both men and women, and that this heritability estimate is similar across The Netherlands, Belgium, and Australia. Unique environmental influences explain the remaining 58% of the variance.

- **Conclusion**: Genetic factors play a role in individual differences in borderline personality disorder.

### Pharmacological interventions for people with borderline personality disorder [^116GKfUa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is prevalent, affecting 2% of the general population and 20% of psychiatry in-patients. It has a major impact on health facilities, as affected individuals often present in crisis but subsequently make poor use of attempts to help them.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of pharmacological interventions for people with borderline personality disorder.

- **Search strategy**: We conducted a systematic search of 26 specialist and general bibliographic databases as of October 2002 and searched relevant reference lists for further trials.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized clinical trials comparing any psychoactive drugs with any other treatment for people with borderline personality disorder.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We independently selected, quality-assessed, and extracted data from studies. For binary outcomes, we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR), its 95% confidence interval (CI), and where possible, the number needed to help/harm (NNT/H). For continuous outcomes, endpoint data were preferred over change data. Non-skewed data from valid scales were synthesized using a weighted mean difference (WMD).

- **Main results**: We found ten small (total n = 554), short, randomized studies involving eight comparisons from which we could extract usable data. Studies comparing antidepressants with placebo were small (total n = 79, 2 RCTs), but for ratings of anger, fluoxetine may offer some improvement over placebo for those on antidepressant therapy (n = 22, 1 RCT, RR anger not improved 0.30 CI 0.10 to 0.85, NNT 2 CI 2 to 9). The one small study provided limited information.

### What is a mood stabilizer [^1177veiK]. Psychological Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The concept of mood stability is attractive to both patients and clinicians alike, and hence, the term "mood stabilizer" has widespread currency. However, its worldwide acceptance and use in clinical practice is at odds with the absence of official recognition by regulatory authorities. The ideal mood stabilizer is said to have efficacy in the treatment of acute manic and depressive episodes and also be effective in the prevention of recurrences. However, in reality, few drugs, with perhaps the exception of lithium, come close to this gold standard. Yet many agents aspire to the title, and some have arguably achieved it prematurely.

It is, therefore, important to reconsider the definition of a mood stabilizer and critically review which agents, if any, satisfy the necessary eligibility requirements by reference to reasonable criteria and comparator data. The term mood stabilizer is an important label. It needs to be applied judiciously because it confers clinical credibility and qualifies long-term use in maintenance and prophylaxis. It is also important with respect to developing guidelines for treatment and the further development of novel agents. Most importantly, however, it is a term that is innately appealing because of what it promises; for this reason alone, it should encompass only those agents that can deliver.

### How to mitigate risk in the treatment of patients with borderline personality disorder [^1154iHoU]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Clinicians treating patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) experience concerns about the risk for adverse events that can lead to litigation or complaints to administrative boards. This paper's goal is to outline steps to ensure the safety of both the patient and the clinician.

- **Recent findings**: Review of available data confirms that psychiatry is a subspecialty with relatively low risk for malpractice litigation but high risk for complaints to administrative agencies. Examination of litigation and complaints suggests that familiar challenges in work with patients with BPD are frequently cited. Risk management considerations have been impacted in recent years by changes in psychiatric training, health care delivery, and regulations about patient information transparency. Concurrently, empirically validated treatments for BPD have been refined and disseminated. Clinicians can address safety concerns by adapting established risk management guidance with an appreciation of key elements of BPD.

### Association between quetiapine use and self-harm outcomes among people with recorded personality disorder in UK primary care: A self-controlled case series analysis [^112waKZA]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). High credibility.

There has been one randomized controlled trial of quetiapine for borderline personality disorder for which results are available. This trial of 95 participants found that daily doses of 150 and 300 mg were associated with reduced psychological distress, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, and hostility at 8 weeks compared to placebo. There was no clear difference between doses, but there were higher rates of adverse events in the group receiving 300 mg per day. There have also been a number of small open-label studies for the treatment of borderline personality disorder that suggest some effect on impulsivity and affective symptoms.

Self-harm is common in patients receiving a diagnosis of personality disorder, particularly borderline or emotionally unstable personality disorder. There are case series reporting improvements in self-harming behavior in adolescents treated with quetiapine. However, observational studies in patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia have not found quetiapine prescribing to be associated with reduced self-harm. We are aware of no studies that examine quetiapine's effects on self-harm in people with personality disorder diagnoses. However, it is postulated that quetiapine may alleviate symptoms of self-harm in people with personality disorder via effects on impulsivity and aggression. Trials of quetiapine as an anti-suicidal agent in personality disorder are likely to be prohibitive due to issues of power, follow-up, and risk, whereas observational designs such as the self-controlled case series (SCCS) can potentially provide insight into these effects.

### Pharmacotherapy for borderline personality disorder: An update of published, unpublished and ongoing studies [^114v4CDT]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020). Low credibility.

As concluded in our 2015 review, the evidence regarding the effects of drug treatment for borderline personality disorder (BPD) has not substantially accumulated. This recent conclusion mirrors our findings from five years ago. Notably, recent data indicate no beneficial effects of fluoxetine in preventing suicidal behavior in individuals with BPD; psychotherapy appears to be superior. Despite SSRIs being frequently used for BPD, irrespective of co-existing comorbidities, only three placebo-controlled RCTs exist, involving data from a total of 85 participants.

Another significant new finding is the lack of beneficial effects from lamotrigine treatment in a real-world effectiveness study. This large-scale, pragmatic RCT provides conclusive results applicable to routine care, suggesting lamotrigine is not a clinically effective treatment for individuals with BPD.

The pharmaceutical industry has withdrawn from initiating large-scale trials in recent years. Eli Lilly sponsored two large-scale RCTs on olanzapine, each involving more than 300 participants, but these did not result in drug approval for use in BPD. Consequently, there have been no major industry-funded research efforts. Despite BPD medication use being off-label, drugs continue to be extensively prescribed. The lack of conclusive supporting evidence does not appear to hinder the routine prescription of medications. For instance, quetiapine is frequently prescribed to individuals with BPD despite the absence of comprehensive supporting evidence.

### Safety and tolerability of emerging pharmacological treatments for bipolar disorder [^117WiTc4]. Bipolar Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Numerous new agents have been examined for their efficacy in bipolar disorder (BPD) in recent years. New antiepileptic agents and atypical antipsychotics currently form the bulk of these emerging agents. As the armamentarium for treating BPD increases, it allows for the possibility of choosing drugs based on their tolerability as well as their efficacy, rather than efficacy alone.

- **Methods**: Efficacy data for newer antiepileptic drugs (lamotrigine, topiramate, gabapentin, oxcarbazepine) and atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine, clozapine, risperidone, quetiapine, ziprasidone, aripiprazole) are briefly reviewed. The article focuses on the relative safety and tolerability of these agents.

- **Results**: Generally, most of these newer agents have better side effect and tolerability profiles than older agents commonly used to treat BPD (lithium, valproate, carbamazepine). However, these must be weighed against efficacy demonstrated in randomized, controlled trials at the time of writing. Cognitive impairment is a concern with topiramate, weight gain and the risk of diabetes with some of the atypical antipsychotic agents, and rash with lamotrigine.

- **Conclusions**: Side effects of newer emerging agents for the treatment of BPD can be effectively managed, and the risks reduced by instituting practical strategies early in management.

### Pharmacotherapy for borderline personality disorder: An update of published, unpublished and ongoing studies [^116DWKe5]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020). Low credibility.

**Critical judgement of evidence**: International studies concordantly report that antipsychotics are prevalently prescribed to people with a diagnosis of BPD, with rates ranging between 70% and 79% of inpatients and 35% and 60% of outpatients. Given the evidence, it is surprising why quetiapine plays such an outstanding role in BPD treatment. Among antipsychotic agents, quetiapine is the one most often prescribed to people with a diagnosis of BPD, and, notably, it is also the most prescribed substance among all substance classes; every fifth to almost every third inpatient receives quetiapine. At the time of writing, only one single RCT has been published that evaluated the effects of this substance in people with BPD. At the same time, we are aware of a number of RCTs involving quetiapine that have been completed, but the results have not been published. Another RCT involving the antipsychotic risperidone has been registered and was recruiting; however, it is unknown if this trial was ever completed, and if so, what the results were. In our previous Cochrane review, we had included eight placebo-controlled RCTs of second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs; aripiprazole, olanzapine, ziprasidone), but did not observe robust evidence of clinically relevant effects for any of the substances. Instead, we found significant adverse effects for olanzapine, including metabolic changes and weight gain, as well as indications of more self-harming behaviour under olanzapine. Since our Cochrane review in 2010, only one placebo-controlled RCT of any SGA has been published.

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in patients with borderline personality disorder: A systematic review [^112LkfGx]. Psychiatry Research (2021). Low credibility.

The literature on the application of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in borderline personality disorder (BPD) is unclear, though its neuromodulatory effects on the underlying neural circuitry involved in BPD symptoms suggest that it could be a potential treatment option. We sought to review the evidence on rTMS as a treatment for BPD. PubMed (for Medline database), Google Scholar, and Scopus were systematically searched, following the PRISMA guidelines, for studies of any design examining the application of rTMS treatment in adult patients with a precise and primary diagnosis of BPD written in the English language. The systematic review has been registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020215927). Forty-one records were screened, and eight fulfilled the inclusion criteria, with a total of 63 patients. The existing studies suggest that rTMS is a well-tolerated treatment in patients with BPD. Double-blind randomized controlled studies are necessary to elucidate the effects of rTMS on the different symptoms of BPD and establish efficacy, as well as the best cortical targets and stimulation protocols. Longitudinal studies that combine evidence-based psychotherapy with rTMS may be a future line of investigation that could potentially improve outcomes for this population.

### Pharmacotherapy for borderline personality disorder: an update of published, unpublished and ongoing studies [^1156MK6j]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020). Low credibility.

We are facing a manifest gap between evidence and practice. In order to enable people affected by BPD as well as clinicians to make informed decisions, more RCTs are needed. On the one hand, these should replicate previous research where positive findings were observed in single, small studies. On the other hand, under-researched areas need to be approached: medication use (especially SSRI) is oftentimes justified by the prevalence of comorbid disorders, especially depression, but there is a clear lack of studies focusing on participants with distinct comorbidities.

In terms of interventions, we need more RCTs evaluating highly used drugs like SSRIs and quetiapine. Fortunately, there are new efforts from the industry to evaluate new substances in explanatory trials. As long as there is no definite conclusion about any substance being effective, trials should include a placebo comparison group. Outcome assessment should include BPD-specific pathology and pathology related to comorbid conditions if comorbid samples are in focus. Psychosocial functioning is crucial for judging mid- and long-term effects and should also be assessed. Adverse events should be regularly monitored in a standardized way. Lastly, observation periods should last sufficiently long to reflect clinical practice and allow for drawing conclusions about beneficial effects.

Our working group is currently updating the 2010 Cochrane review. Based on comprehensive searches, we intend to review and statistically integrate the available evidence.

### Marine omega-3 fatty acid supplementation for borderline personality disorder: A meta-analysis [^111Bjqao]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

Several promising studies have investigated the use of marine omega-3 fatty acids (i.e. fish oil) in treating borderline personality disorder (BPD); however, the overall effects remain unclear. This study aimed to estimate the effectiveness of omega-3 fatty acids in BPD using meta-analysis, with a priori differentiation of affective, impulsive, and cognitive-perceptual symptom domains.

We performed a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE using terms related to BPD and omega-3 fatty acids without restricting publication dates. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared omega-3 fatty acids to placebo or any active comparator and pooled the data using meta-analysis. A total of five studies were included in this meta-analysis, which described four RCTs testing the effects of omega-3 fatty acids in 137 patients with BPD or BPD-related behavior.

Using a pre-piloted data extraction form, we collected data on intervention dose, duration, and BPD symptom scale scores, differentiating among affective, impulsive, and cognitive-perceptual symptom domains.

The random effects meta-analysis indicated a significant overall decreasing effect of omega-3 fatty acids on BPD symptom severity, demonstrating a standardized difference in means (SDM) of 0.54 (95% CI = 0.91 to 0.17; Z = 2.87; P = 0.0041), with no observed heterogeneity (I² = 0.00; Q = 2.63; P = 0.45). A priori differentiation of symptom domains revealed significant effects on affect dysregulation (0.74 SDM; 95% CI = 1.21 to 0.27; Z = 3.11; P = 0.002) and impulsive behavior (0.45 SDM; 95% CI = 0.84 to 0.05).

### Borderline personality disorder [^117Msxri]. American Family Physician (2022). Low credibility.

Borderline personality disorder is a psychological disorder characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability in affect regulation, impulse control, interpersonal relationships, and self-image. It may be present in up to 6.4% of adult primary care visits, which is fourfold higher than in the general population. This disorder is underdiagnosed, and most patients who have it also have additional psychiatric conditions. Individuals with borderline personality disorder have an underlying vulnerability to emotional hyperarousal states and social and interpersonal stressors. Clinically, these patients may exhibit:

- **High health care utilization**: Accompanied by health-sabotaging behaviors.
- **Chronic or vague somatic concerns**: They frequently report a range of physical symptoms without clear medical explanations.
- **Aggressive outbursts and high-risk sexual behaviors**: These actions may pose significant risks to themselves and others.
- **Substance use**: Often co-occurring with obesity and binge-eating disorders.

There is an established correlation between borderline personality disorder and increased suicide risk. Structured interview assessments specifically designed for borderline personality disorder include the Revised Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines and the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-5 Alternative Model for Personality Disorders.

As general guidelines for practice, family physicians should:

- **Avoid excessive familiarity**: Maintain professional boundaries.
- **Schedule regular visits**: Provide consistent care and monitoring.
- **Set appropriate limits and maintain awareness of personal feelings**: This is crucial for effective patient management.

Effective communication strategies such as motivational interviewing and problem-solving techniques can aid in navigating the complexities of managing these patients.

### Clinical outcome of ECT in patients with major depression and comorbid borderline personality disorder [^114MjEgs]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Previous research suggests that the comorbidity of major depression with a personality disorder, especially borderline personality disorder, is associated with a poorer response to ECT. The study aimed to compare the acute outcome of ECT in depressed patients with borderline personality disorder, with those having personality disorders other than borderline personality disorder, and with no personality disorder.

The study subjects were 139 patients with a primary diagnosis of unipolar major depression and scores of at least 20 on the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Patients received suprathreshold right unilateral or bilateral ECT in a standardized manner and were assessed with the Hamilton depression scale within 3 days and 4–8 days after completing ECT.

Compared to patients with personality disorders other than borderline personality disorder (N = 42) and those with no personality disorder (N = 77), patients with borderline personality disorder (N = 20) showed less symptomatic improvement assessed up to 8 days after ECT. Patients with personality disorders other than borderline personality disorder responded as well to ECT as those with no personality disorder. Borderline personality disorder patients were more likely to be female, have medication-resistant depression, and be younger compared to the patients in the two comparison groups. However, these differences did not account for the poorer response to ECT observed in borderline personality disorder patients.

### Attentional salience and the neural substrates of response inhibition in borderline personality disorder [^117S5Nuc]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Method

Participants with BPD were required to meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders – Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR – Axis II Disorders (SCID-II) – German version. They were deemed ineligible to participate if they reported acute psychotic symptoms. Exclusion criteria for healthy controls (HC) included a prior history of a DSM-IV Axis I or Axis II disorder. All participants were at least 18 years of age and capable of giving informed consent for participation in the study. Alcohol and other substance use (except nicotine) was not allowed within one week before the scan day.

Participants with BPD (n = 45) were consecutively recruited from an inpatient treatment program in the Psychiatric University Hospital (UPK Basel) in Switzerland. The SCID-II was administered by either a licensed psychiatrist or a clinical psychology trainee supervised by a licensed psychiatrist. Information from the Axis I, including the attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) module, and Axis II diagnostic interviews was reviewed in a diagnostic meeting to arrive at consensus diagnoses for BPD and other psychopathologies. The HC participants (n = 29) were recruited using internet advertisements and, after being matched to BPD participants for age and sex, underwent the same diagnostic procedures.

### Rexulti [^115rc5kP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder, the 6-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose clinical studies in adult patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) found that the proportions of patients experiencing shifts in fasting glucose from normal (< 100 mg/dL) to high (≥ 126 mg/dL) and from borderline (≥ 100 and < 126 mg/dL) to high were similar between those treated with Rexulti and placebo. In long-term, open-label depression studies, 5% of adult patients with normal baseline fasting glucose experienced a shift to high while taking Rexulti plus an antidepressant (ADT), and 25% of patients with borderline fasting glucose experienced shifts to high. Overall, 9% of patients with normal or borderline fasting glucose experienced shifts to high fasting glucose during these long-term studies.

- **Schizophrenia (adults)**: In the 6-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose clinical studies of adult patients with schizophrenia, the proportions of patients experiencing shifts in fasting glucose from normal (< 100 mg/dL) to high (≥ 126 mg/dL) or from borderline (≥ 100 and < 126 mg/dL) to high were similar between those treated with Rexulti and placebo. In long-term, open-label schizophrenia studies, 8% of adult patients with normal baseline fasting glucose experienced a shift to high, while 17% of those with borderline fasting glucose experienced shifts from borderline to high. Combined data indicated that 10% of patients with normal or borderline fasting glucose experienced shifts to high fasting glucose during these long-term studies.

- **Schizophrenia pediatric patients (13 to 17 years of age)**: In a 6-week, placebo-controlled study, patients in this age group were observed for potential health outcomes while on Rexulti.

### State of the art in the pharmacologic treatment of borderline personality disorder [^113C9ntZ]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2011). Low credibility.

This article reviews the most recent studies of the pharmacologic treatment of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Although research continues using randomized controlled trials with a placebo arm, as well as active medication, meta-analyses and systematic reviews have revealed that the use of any specific medication or medication class in BPD remains at best uncertain and inconclusive. Studies indicate that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have fallen out of favor, prompting researchers to focus on mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics. Thus, it is not surprising that trends in prescribing appear to be shifting toward the use of these two classes over selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Yet, we remain without any medication that has a specific indication for the treatment of BPD or an indication for any symptom that is seen as part of the BPD syndrome.

### Qudexy XR [^113zdZYT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

- **Administration instructions**: Counsel patients to swallow Qudexy XR capsules whole or carefully open and sprinkle the entire contents on a spoonful of soft food. This drug/food mixture should be swallowed immediately and not chewed. Do not store the drug/food mixture for future use [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

- **Eye disorders**: Advise patients taking Qudexy XR to seek immediate medical attention if they experience blurred vision, visual disturbances, or periorbital pain [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 and 5.2)].

- **Oligohydrosis and hyperthermia**: Closely monitor Qudexy XR-treated patients, especially pediatric patients, for evidence of decreased sweating and increased body temperature, particularly in hot weather. Counsel patients to contact their healthcare professionals immediately if they develop a high or persistent fever, or decreased sweating [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Metabolic acidosis**: Warn patients about the potential significant risk for metabolic acidosis that may be asymptomatic and may be associated with adverse effects on kidneys (e.g. kidney stones, nephrocalcinosis), bones (e.g. osteoporosis, osteomalacia, and/or rickets in children), growth (e.g. growth delay/retardation) in pediatric patients, and on the fetus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), (8.4)].

- **Suicidal behavior and ideation**: Counsel patients, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including Qudexy XR, may increase the risk.

### Prevalence of antipsychotic prescriptions among patients with anxiety disorders treated in inpatient and outpatient psychiatric settings [^116wExr2]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

An increasing number of prescribers are using antipsychotics for the treatment of anxiety disorders, despite the lack of FDA-approved indications and mixed efficacy results from clinical trials. The objective of this study was to examine the prevalence of antipsychotic prescriptions in psychiatric inpatients and outpatients with anxiety disorders.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study utilized de-identified data from patients with a DSM-IV-TR anxiety disorder diagnosis in an academic psychiatric setting in 2013. The final cohort, after excluding those with bipolar or psychotic comorbidity, included 1699 patients. Logistic regression models were employed to explore associations between antipsychotic prescriptions and patient characteristics.

- **Results**: Among non-psychotic and non-bipolar patients with anxiety disorders, 53.6% of inpatients and 16.6% of outpatients received antipsychotic medication. Prescription rates varied with the disorder. Outpatients with post-traumatic stress disorder (OR: 2.24, 95% CI: 1.66–3.01) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OR: 2.80, 95% CI: 1.86–4.19) were more likely to receive antipsychotic prescriptions than those without these diagnoses. Comorbidity with depression was common, while comorbidity with borderline personality disorder was rare; both increased the odds of receiving an antipsychotic prescription (OR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.16–2.12 for depression; OR: 2.63, 95% CI: 1.42–4.88 for borderline personality disorder, respectively). Additionally, age was significantly associated with increased odds of being on an antipsychotic. Quetiapine and aripiprazole were the most prescribed medications.

### Effectiveness of pharmacotherapy for severe personality disorders: Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials [^113v7wtP]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

There has been little systematic attempt to validate pharmacologic treatment algorithms and guidelines for severe personality disorder. We evaluated studies on the effectiveness of psychoactive drugs on specific symptom domains for borderline and/or schizotypal personality disorder.

The literature was searched for placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials (PC-RCTs) on the effectiveness of psychopharmacologic drugs in personality disorder patients. The PubMed, PsychINFO, PiCarta, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases were searched using the following search terms:

- **Disorder types**: borderline personality, schizotypal personality, personality disorder, cluster A, cluster B
- **Treatment and methodology**: treatment, drug, pharmacotherapy
- **Drug categories**: antipsychotic, antidepressant, mood stabilizer
- **Study purpose/methodology**: effect, outcome, review, meta-analysis

These terms were used for studies published between 1980 and December 2007. References were also identified from bibliographies of articles and books.

Placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials on the efficacy of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and mood stabilizers regarding:

- **Symptom domains**: cognitive-perceptual symptoms, impulsive-behavioral dyscontrol, affective dysregulation
	- **Subdomains of affective dysregulation**: depressed mood, anxiety, anger, mood lability

These were selected for patients with well-defined borderline and/or schizotypal personality disorder. Studies whose primary emphasis was on the treatment of Axis I disorders were excluded. Meta-analyses were conducted using 21 retrieved studies.

Antipsychotics have a moderate effect on cognitive-perceptual symptoms based on the analysis of 5 PC-RCTs.

### Toward integrated treatment for co-occurring borderline personality disorder and eating disorders: A clinician perspective [^113kYdzm]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

- **Features of effective treatment**: Participants from the specialist eating disorder (ED) service emphasized the importance of allowing the client to own the process of weight restoration. Clinician 10 expanded on this: "assisting them to accept the need for health restoration… being supported in taking control of that themselves". Similar to borderline personality disorder (BPD) clinicians, ED clinicians discussed the value of distress tolerance. Clinician 9 stated, in relation to those who received BPD treatment prior to treatment for their ED: "there seems to be strong evidence that [DBT] has equipped them to be able to deal with inpatient admission in a more adaptive way, with less self-harming behaviours and more distress tolerance. That seems to be a really important intervention".

	- Regarding CBT, specific elements such as food and thought diaries were perceived as foundational for improving clients' understanding of their behaviour. For example, Clinician 7 shared that "there's a grade of exposure with a CBT food and thought diary to help people understand and stay on track", which was corroborated by Clinician 10, who noted "self-monitoring of food intake" as an important treatment element. ACT was also regarded as effective for this group, particularly "how they can live their life in a way consistent with their values… we'll look at awareness of their thoughts and cognitive defusion" (Clinician 6).

	- Emphasis on trust and rapport was also expressed, with Clinician 8 indicating that "if they don't even have that basis, you know, there'll be no commitment to any of this". Clinician 7 reinforced this notion of consistency.

### A life span perspective on borderline personality disorder [^116vapp8]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Low credibility.

The term "borderline" was first coined by Adolph Stern in 1938 when he identified a "border line group of patients" who "fit frankly neither into the psychotic nor into the psychoneurotic group, and are extremely difficult to handle by any psychotherapeutic method". The acceptance of borderline personality disorder (BPD) as a mental disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) 3rd edition in 1980 has stimulated both clinical and scientific attention. BPD is characterized by impulsivity, self-harm, suicidality, and emotional and interpersonal instability. DSM-5, like DSM-IV, allows diagnosing BPD under the age of 18 if the symptoms are pervasive, persistent, not limited to a particular developmental stage or another mental disorder, and have been present for at least one year.

The categorical DSM concept of BPD, and of personality disorders in general, has been criticized because of its heterogeneity, diagnostic overlap with other disorders, arbitrary threshold, low reliability, and poor empirical base. Factor analytic studies found support for one general factor of personality pathology underlying the nine criteria of BPD. Moreover, BPD presents with many comorbid disorders.

Because of these limitations, a growing number of studies focus on dimensional models of personality disorders, such as the Alternative Model of Personality Disorders (AMPD) in DSM-5 and the new personality disorder concept of the International Classifications of Diseases 11th Edition (ICD-11). Both models combine a severity dimension.

### Psychopharmacology of borderline personality disorder [^114n5qi2]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2004). Low credibility.

Psychopharmacology is widely used in the treatment of borderline personality disorder. However, support for this form of treatment has been largely based on case reports, case series, and open-label clinical trials. This evidence-based review examines the most recent randomized controlled trials of psychopharmacology in the treatment of borderline personality disorder, with a goal of highlighting the most promising pharmacotherapy for use in clinical practice, as well as for future large-scale research testing. The results and limitations of the randomized controlled trial data are presented, along with case vignettes illustrating the complexity of the disorder and the heterogeneity of its treatment. At the time of writing, there is at least some evidence-based support for the use of antipsychotics (conventional and atypical), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of borderline personality disorder.

### Borderline personality disorder [^115vQmXH]. Lancet (2004). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on borderline personality disorder:

- **Definition**: Borderline personality disorder is a mental health disorder characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability in affect regulation, impulse control, interpersonal relationships, and self-image.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathogenesis of borderline personality disorder is complex and not fully understood. It is believed to involve interactions among genetic, neurobiological, and environmental factors. Genetic factors and adverse life events, such as physical and sexual abuse during childhood, are thought to contribute to the development of the disorder.

- **Epidemiology**: The lifetime prevalence of borderline personality disorder in the US is estimated at 5.9%.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for borderline personality disorder are multifaceted and include temperamental factors, such as high impulsivity and emotional instability; environmental factors, including maltreatment such as physical, emotional, and sexual abuse; and genetic factors.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, borderline personality disorder is marked by emotional dysregulation, impulsive aggression, repeated self-injury, and chronic suicidal tendencies. Other key manifestations include intense mood swings, fear of abandonment, unstable relationships, and a distorted self-image.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of borderline personality disorder is variable. While the disorder is traditionally considered chronic and intractable, up to 85% of patients remit over a 10-year period.

### Efficacy and safety of BI 1358894 in patients with borderline personality disorder: Results of a phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group dose-ranging trial [^112bymbs]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2025). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to provide proof-of-concept (PoC), dose-range finding, and safety data for BI 1358894, a TRPC4/5 ion channel inhibitor, in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD).

- **Methods**: This was a phase 2, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients were randomized to receive oral placebo or BI 1358894 (5 mg, 25 mg, 75 mg, or 125 mg) once daily in a 2.5:1:1:1:2 ratio for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in the Zanarini Rating Scale for BPD (ZAN BPD) total score at Week 10. Secondary endpoints included the ≥ 30% ZAN-BPD reduction response from baseline at Week 10, change from baseline at Week 10 in the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale-16 item total, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-State Anxiety total, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 total, Clinical Global Impressions-Severity, and Patient Global Impression-Severity scores.

- **Results**: Of the 655 enrolled patients, 390 were randomized, and 323 (82.8%) completed the trial. For primary and secondary endpoints, no differences were observed between treatment and placebo; therefore, PoC was not established. The proportion of patients with adverse events (AEs, BI 1358894 overall vs placebo: 77.9% vs 75.0%) and serious AEs (SAEs; 10.3% vs 8.6%) was comparable between treatments. The proportion of patients with an SAE of suicidal ideation was 4.2% (BI 1358894 overall) and 6.3% (placebo).

Although the primary endpoint was not met, BI 1358894 was well tolerated with no increase in self-harm or suicidality. Further studies may explore more targeted populations and alternative outcome assessments.
