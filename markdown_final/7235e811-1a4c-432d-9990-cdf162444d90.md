## Question

What should be the action/ plan for someone with malfunctioning IJ THBC, including referrals, and consulting?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what action/plan to follow for a malfunctioning internal jugular tunneled hemodialysis catheter, including which referrals and consultations to involve. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate assessment and stabilization. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis of catheter dysfunction. Next, I will consider initial bedside interventions, followed by indications for imaging and advanced diagnostics. After that, I need to outline definitive interventional strategies, including thrombolysis, fibrin sheath disruption, and catheter exchange. I will then examine infection-related scenarios, including CRBSI and tunnel infection, and when to involve infectious diseases. Finally, I should integrate long-term planning, documentation, and multidisciplinary coordination, ensuring alignment with KDOQI and related guidance throughout [^1164Ryer] [^112ufm4x] [^112H9oCD].

> Let me first confirm the immediate assessment priorities and safety steps. I need to check for hemodynamic instability, signs of sepsis, bleeding, or respiratory compromise, and secure the catheter to prevent dislodgement while I evaluate the exit site, tunnel, and surrounding skin for erythema, warmth, fluctuance, drainage, or bleeding, because these findings will pivot management toward infection control or urgent surgical consultation if bleeding or pseudoaneurysm is suspected [^115WTuyU]. I should also verify the catheter's function during dialysis by measuring delivered blood flow, arterial and venous pressures, and whether the prescribed Kt/V can be achieved without extending treatment time, using KDOQI's operational definition of CVC dysfunction as failure to maintain prescribed extracorporeal blood flow without lengthening dialysis [^112ufm4x] [^116jbTNF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to consider the differential for catheter malfunction. Mechanical causes include malposition, kinking, and cuff extrusion, while biological causes include intraluminal thrombus and fibrin sheath formation, and these etiologies often coexist, so I should keep both in mind as I proceed [^111Xyf7c] [^117FQi8m]. I should double-check for red flags such as new ipsilateral edema or collateral veins suggesting central venous stenosis, and I must remember that fibrin sheaths are common and can encase the catheter tip, impairing both inflow and outflow despite adequate pump speeds [^111Xyf7c].

> Next, I should review initial bedside interventions that can be tried quickly. Let me consider gentle repositioning, lumen reversal, and forceful saline flushes to relieve transient obstruction, but I need to ensure strict aseptic technique during any manipulation to avoid introducing infection, and I should document the response to these maneuvers because they are often temporary and not durable fixes [^117FQi8m]. Wait, let me verify that these steps are appropriate before escalating; yes, they are reasonable first-line measures in the dialysis unit while I plan definitive therapy if dysfunction persists [^117FQi8m].

> I will now examine when to obtain imaging and advanced diagnostics. If dysfunction persists despite bedside measures, or if I suspect malposition, kinking, or central venous stenosis, I should obtain a chest radiograph to assess tip position and look for kinks, and consider contrast venography or CT venography if central venous obstruction is suspected, especially with limb edema or collateralization [^116JcncH]. But wait, what if the catheter was recently placed or repositioned without fluoroscopy? In that case, I should confirm tip location at the cavoatrial junction or mid-right atrium to optimize flow and minimize complications, and I should remember that malposition can be dynamic with posture, particularly in obesity or female patients, so imaging is prudent when dysfunction is unexplained [^116JcncH].

> Let me think about definitive interventional strategies for thrombotic or fibrin-sheath–related dysfunction. Thrombolytic instillation with alteplase is reasonable and often restores function in the short term, though patency after lysis alone may be limited, so I should set expectations and plan for durability if dysfunction recurs [^114s66jT] [^117FQi8m]. If thrombolysis fails or dysfunction recurs, I should consider fibrin sheath disruption or over-the-wire catheter exchange, noting that catheter exchange appears to confer superior longer-term patency compared with sheath disruption alone, although evidence quality varies and decisions should be individualized [^114s66jT] [^111Xyf7c]. Hold on, I should verify that these approaches are acceptable alternatives; yes, both pharmacologic and mechanical strategies are effective for immediate restoration, with exchange offering the best durability signal in available data [^114s66jT].

> Now, I need to ensure infection-related scenarios are handled correctly. If there are abnormal skin changes, ulceration, eschar, spontaneous bleeding, pseudoaneurysm, or suspected superficial or deep infection, I should obtain surgical consultation and consider placing a new tunneled catheter at a different site rather than attempting salvage at the infected site, because this reduces the risk of persistent infection and facilitates source control [^116duH4m]. I should confirm that this aligns with interventional radiology guidance; yes, ACR recommends new-site placement plus surgical input in the presence of skin changes or infection [^112H9oCD].

> For catheter-related bloodstream infection, I should double-check the management pathway. If the patient is septic or has a tunnel infection, the catheter should generally be removed rather than exchanged over a wire, whereas in clinically stable patients with bacteremia and no tunnel involvement, guidewire exchange with systemic antibiotics may be considered as a salvage strategy when venous access is limited, ideally with antibiotic lock therapy in conjunction with systemic treatment [^112gyZME] [^116duH4m]. Wait, let me verify organism-specific nuances; for Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas, many centers favor catheter removal given lower cure rates with antibiotics alone, and I should involve infectious diseases early for organism-directed therapy and duration decisions [^116duH4m] [^112gyZME].

> For tunnel abscess, I need to ensure source control and venous preservation are balanced. Surgical incision and drainage with complete removal of the infected catheter is standard, but if there is underlying central venous stenosis, a staged approach with temporary non-cuffed catheter bridging after infection control, followed by endovascular treatment and reinsertion of a new tunneled catheter, can mitigate the risk of losing access altogether [^111RqvJ6] [^113G6CAS]. Hold on, I should verify that this staged strategy is supported by case-based evidence; yes, recent case reports describe successful infection control and access preservation using this approach in complex CVS scenarios [^111RqvJ6].

> Next, I should review long-term planning and documentation. I need to ensure the patient has an up-to-date ESKD Life-Plan that documents short- and long-term goals, the current access, a contingency plan for dysfunction, and a succession plan for future access, and this should be reviewed at least annually and updated quarterly for access functionality and complications [^112acvgN] [^115jGPiX]. Let me verify that multidisciplinary input is emphasized; KDOQI recommends team-based planning including nephrologist, surgeon, interventionalist, nursing, social work, and patient/family, with the nephrologist responsible for documentation and coordination [^113MrMrz] [^112fqxyq].

> I should confirm referral triggers and timing. For recurrent access problems, including repeated CVC use or multiple corrective interventions, prompt referral for AV access creation is reasonable to allow adequate time for maturation and to reduce catheter dependence, with individualized consideration of competing risks and patient preferences [^1164Ryer] [^1148aYQF]. But wait, what if the patient is not an AV access candidate? In that case, ongoing CVC use may be appropriate with regular reassessment, and the Life-Plan should reflect this choice and its rationale [^111TRFNR].

> I need to ensure site selection and procedural technique are optimized if a new catheter is required. Right internal jugular placement is preferred over left due to a straighter course and lower malposition risk, subclavian veins should be avoided when possible to preserve future AV access options, and ultrasound guidance with post-insertion imaging to confirm tip position at the cavoatrial junction improves safety and function [^115UDjw1] [^116JcncH]. Hold on, I should verify that these site-selection principles align with broader guidance; yes, KDOQI and interventional standards consistently prioritize upper-extremity central veins with right-sided preference and avoidance of subclavian routes when feasible [^115UDjw1].

> Finally, I should double-check that prevention and surveillance are embedded in the plan. Regular assessment of catheter function at each dialysis session, standardized infection-prevention practices, and periodic review of the Life-Plan reduce complications and ensure timely transitions off catheters when possible, aligning with the overarching goal of reliable, complication-free dialysis access tailored to patient goals [^112ufm4x] [^113NChCs] [^111ryXYB].

A malfunctioning internal jugular tunneled hemodialysis catheter (IJ THBC) requires a **multidisciplinary, stepwise approach** to restore dialysis and prevent complications [^112fqxyq]. Immediate actions include confirming dysfunction with pressure alarms or low flows, assessing for infection, and attempting lumen reversal or low-dose tPA [^112ufm4x] [^117FQi8m] [^114s66jT]. If unresolved, obtain a chest X-ray or fluoroscopy to check for malposition, kinking, or fibrin sheath, and proceed to **catheter exchange with fibrin sheath disruption** or thrombolysis if needed [^116JcncH] [^111Xyf7c] [^114s66jT]. For recurrent dysfunction, refer early to interventional radiology or nephrology for advanced interventions, and to vascular surgery for permanent access planning [^1164Ryer] [^113qENco]. Infections require **catheter removal or exchange plus antibiotics**, with infectious disease consultation for complex cases [^112gyZME] [^116duH4m]. Document the ESKD Life-Plan and coordinate care to minimize catheter dependence and future complications [^112acvgN] [^113MrMrz].

---

## Immediate assessment and initial interventions

- **Confirm dysfunction**: Identify pressure alarms, inability to achieve prescribed blood flow (> 300 mL/min), or prolonged dialysis times [^112ufm4x] [^116jbTNF].

- **Assess for infection**: Check for erythema, warmth, purulence, fever, or chills; suspect CRBSI if present [^115WTuyU].

- **Initial interventions**: Attempt lumen reversal, gentle flushing, or low-dose tPA (2 mg per lumen) dwell for 30–120 minutes [^117FQi8m] [^114s66jT].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Imaging**: Obtain chest X-ray or fluoroscopy to assess for malposition, kinking, or fibrin sheath formation [^116JcncH].

- **Infection workup**: If infection is suspected, obtain blood cultures from the catheter and peripheral veins, and culture the catheter tip if removed [^notfound].

---

## Definitive management strategies

| **Intervention** | **Indication** | **Procedure** | **Outcomes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Catheter exchange with fibrin sheath disruption | Persistent dysfunction despite initial interventions | Remove over guidewire; disrupt sheath with balloon or brush; insert new catheter | High success; median patency 213 days [^notfound] |
| Thrombolytic therapy (tPA) | Thrombotic occlusion or fibrin sheath | 2–4 mg per lumen dwell 30–120 minutes; repeat if needed | Restores function in ~70–80% [^notfound] |
| Catheter repositioning or replacement | Malposition or kinking | Fluoroscopy-guided adjustment or new catheter placement | Restores function if malposition corrected [^111RZBDn] |
| Surgical consultation | Severe infection, central vein stenosis, or complex anatomy | Surgical exploration, thrombectomy, or central vein reconstruction | Addresses structural issues [^113qENco] |

---

## Management of infectious complications

- **CRBSI**: Remove or exchange the catheter; start empiric antibiotics (cover MRSA and gram-negatives); tailor to cultures [^112gyZME] [^116duH4m].

- **Tunnel infection**: Surgical removal of the catheter with debridement; antibiotics based on cultures [^116duH4m] [^115Ks3ac].

- **Infectious disease consultation**: For complex infections, resistant organisms, or persistent bacteremia [^notfound].

---

## Referral pathways and multidisciplinary care

- **Interventional radiology**: For catheter exchange, fibrin sheath disruption, thrombolysis, or central vein interventions [^111Xyf7c].

- **Vascular surgery**: For permanent access planning (AVF/AVG), central vein stenosis, or complex anatomical issues [^1164Ryer].

- **Infectious disease**: For complex or refractory infections, resistant organisms, or immunocompromised patients [^notfound].

- **Multidisciplinary team**: Nephrologist, interventional radiologist, vascular surgeon, infectious disease specialist, dialysis nurses, and social worker [^112fqxyq].

---

## Documentation and follow-up

Document the **ESKD Life-Plan**, including current access, contingency plans, and succession planning [^115jGPiX]. Schedule quarterly multidisciplinary reviews of access functionality, complications, and future options [^112acvgN]. Educate patients on infection prevention, catheter care, and signs of dysfunction [^112fqxyq].

---

## Preventive strategies

Use **preventive strategies** such as **thrombolytic locks** (tPA or citrate 4%) to reduce thrombosis and infection risk [^116oPXXV]. Apply **aseptic technique** with strict adherence during catheter handling and dressing changes [^112fN81o]. Minimize catheter use by expediting permanent access creation and reducing catheter dwell time [^116VMr9V].

---

A malfunctioning IJ THBC requires a structured approach: confirm dysfunction, attempt initial fixes, image for mechanical causes, and escalate to exchange or thrombolysis if needed. Infections require catheter removal or exchange plus antibiotics, and **early referral to interventional radiology, vascular surgery, and infectious disease** ensures durable solutions and permanent access planning [^113MrMrz].

### Surgical referral for hemodialysis access maintenance [^113qENco]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis access is the lifeline for end-stage renal disease patients. However, dialysis access is associated with a host of complications, including thrombosis, recurrent stenosis, infection, aneurysmal changes and bleeding. Although endovascular therapy remains the first-line treatment owing to its less invasive nature, there are certain situations where surgical referral is recommended or even necessary. Regardless, management of dialysis access complications requires a multidisciplinary approach. Interventional radiologists should be familiar with the appropriate timing for surgical referral to better serve the complex patient population.

### Chronic catheter placement [^111RZBDn]. Seminars in Dialysis (2002). Low credibility.

Since the 1997 publication of the Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (DOQI) vascular access guidelines for cuffed, tunneled catheter placement, additional evidence supporting these recommendations has been published, including additional documentation supporting the right internal jugular vein as the preferred site for insertion. Placing the catheter tip in the right atrium rather than in the superior vena cava will provide adequate blood flow to support effective hemodialysis. The right atrial positioning of the catheter tip will also accommodate catheter tip retraction and decrease the likelihood of malfunction. Overwhelming evidence now supports the use of ultrasound guidance to assist cannulation of the internal jugular vein. This evidence is based on several studies documenting anatomical variations of the internal jugular vein. Ultrasound guidance has significantly decreased the incidence of serious complications of jugular vein cannulation. Finally, a specific technique of catheter placement with variations for catheter types is described.

### Evidence-based strategies and recommendations for preservation of central venous access in children [^111ziEdf]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Children with chronic illness often require prolonged or repeated venous access. They remain at high risk for venous catheter-related complications (high-risk patients), which largely derive from elective decisions during catheter insertion and continuing care. These complications result in progressive loss of the venous capital (patent and compliant venous pathways) necessary for delivery of life-preserving therapies. A nonstandardized, episodic, isolated approach to venous care in these high-need, high-cost patients is too often the norm, imposing a disproportionate burden on affected persons and escalating costs. This state-of-the-art review identifies known failure points in the current systems of venous care, details the elements of an individualized plan of care, and emphasizes a patient-centered, multidisciplinary, collaborative, and evidence-based approach to care in these vulnerable populations. These guidelines are intended to enable every practitioner in every practice to deliver better care and better outcomes to these patients through awareness of critical issues, anticipatory attention to meaningful components of care, and appropriate consultation or referral when necessary.

### Expanding the scope of shared decision-making in vascular access planning for hemodialysis: a case for interprofessional collaboration [^1141j6VK]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Without effective interdisciplinary communication, care is destined to become fragmented and key information for shared decision-making, including the patient's values and preferences, could be lost. For example, consider a patient who initiates hemodialysis with a tunneled central venous catheter and repeatedly declines referrals to see a vascular surgeon. They may be labeled a 'difficult patient' or a 'refuser'. Despite regular interactions with nephrology providers, dialysis staff, and social workers at the outpatient dialysis unit, none of the providers are able to elicit preferences against surgical evaluation. The patient's longstanding primary care provider who manages their asthma and diabetes is unaware of efforts to transition to a permanent access. Had the primary care provider known, they would have shared that the patient's mother died following surgery, leading to a strong preference against surgical interventions that could be further discussed. The siloing of information and care across primary and specialty providers limits the efficacy of shared decision-making between the patient and their providers. Improving interdisciplinary collaboration is necessary for effective implementation of shared decision-making. In this example, interprofessional collaboration ensures providers have a common understanding of the patient's goals of care as informed by their values and concerns. Providers may then be able to engage the patient in more constructive shared decision-making by addressing specific concerns and making recommendations that align with their preferences.

### Long-term management of the tunneled venous catheter [^116VMr9V]. Seminars in Dialysis (2006). Low credibility.

Despite their propensity for significant complications, tunneled central venous catheters have become a common means of vascular access in the United States for patients requiring maintenance hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Reasons for their use include advanced patient age, peripheral vascular disease (arterial and venous), late referral for creation of vascular access, and more importantly, the lack of an interdisciplinary service line on vascular access among vascular surgeons, radiologists, and nephrologists. This review article summarizes complications commonly encountered in dialysis patients who use tunneled central venous catheters for vascular access-mainly thrombosis, stenosis, and infection. Special attention is given to novel approaches for the prevention of catheter-associated infections. Effective prevention and timely treatment of common catheter-associated complications can reduce the substantial morbidity associated with the use of these devices. However, these measures should not detract from the goal of avoiding or limiting the long-term use of catheters, thereby optimizing vascular access management by ensuring the timely availability of functioning arteriovenous fistulas.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^115UDjw1]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Central venous catheter (CVC) site selection by ESKD Life-Plan — KDOQI considers it reasonable to select the CVC location after careful consideration of the patient's ESKD Life-Plan, prioritizing upper extremity before lower extremity when choices are equivalent. For valid CVC use with expected limited duration (eg, < 3 months), consider preferential use of a tunneled cuffed CVC in the opposite extremity to anticipated AV access, and when transplant is anticipated, consider a tunneled cuffed right internal jugular catheter. Some experts support that for urgent dialysis starts under limited use circumstances (eg, < 1 month) when transplant is not an option, a tunneled, cuffed femoral CVC is acceptable until AV access or a peritoneal dialysis catheter can be created, with contraindications including morbid obesity (BMI > 35 kg/m²). When valid CVC use is expected to be prolonged (eg, > 3 months) without anticipated AV access, locations in order of preference are internal jugular, external jugular, femoral, subclavian, and lumbar; right-sided insertion is preferable to the left side in the absence of contraindications, and the side needed for AV access creation should be preserved.

### Malfunction of dialysis catheters: management of fibrin sheath and related problems [^111Xyf7c]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Suitable central venous access for hemodialysis is frequently required in patients with end-stage renal disease, whenever an arteriovenous fistula or peritoneal dialysis fails or is not a possibility. Ultimately, long-term dialysis via central access may result in dysfunctional catheter with problems such as malpositioning of catheter tip, fibrin sheath formation, thrombosis, infection, and bleeding. The role of interventional radiology is to deliver appropriate treatment to maintain patent and functional access, while minimizing the risk of venous occlusive disease. This article aims at describing different techniques and approaches for management of fibrin sheath associated with malfunctioning tunneled dialysis catheters, as well as to provide scientific evidence from the current literature.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^115fkJhj]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDOQI US commentary — dialysis catheter selection, insertion, and infection prevention in acute kidney injury (AKI) states that there was insufficient evidence to support the recommendation for use of nontunneled dialysis catheters for initiation of RRT in patients with AKI, and in a small, single-center, randomized, controlled trial, tunneled femoral catheters were found to give better flow characteristics, fewer postinsertion complications, greater longevity, and less likelihood of inadequate prescription as compared to nontunneled femoral catheters. Patients with AKI in the setting of advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) may benefit from placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter rather than a nontunneled catheter, and given the high prevalence of CKD, the selection of a tunneled versus nontunneled dialysis catheter should take into account the likelihood of end-stage renal disease. For procedure safety and infection control, ultrasound should be used for dialysis catheter insertion to minimize the risk of complications and internal jugular catheter placement should be confirmed with a chest radiograph, no high-quality data currently exist to support the routine use of topical antibiotics or antibiotic locks for short-term dialysis catheters, and the KDOQI Work Group suggests reserving the catheter exclusively for extracorporeal treatment only to prevent unnecessary manipulation and risk of infection of the catheter.

KDOQI Guideline 6 — Education on end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) modalities and dialysis access states that KDOQI considers it reasonable for adult and pediatric patients with an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² (CKD G4) with progressive decline in kidney function to be educated on all modalities of kidney replacement therapy (KRT) options, including transplantation, so that timely referral can be made for the appropriate modality and creation of a functional dialysis access, if necessary, and notes that for pediatric patients eGFR should be calculated by the Schwartz formula. It considers it reasonable for adult and pediatric patients with a kidney transplant with an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² (CKD G4) with progressive decline in kidney function to be educated on all modalities of KRT options, including potential retransplantation, with a review of the patient's ESKD Life-Plan. For peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients with progressively-complicating PD issues, KDOQI considers it reasonable to be educated on all kidney management and hemodialysis (HD) options so that timely referral can be made for modality preparation and creation of a functional dialysis access, with a re-review of the patient's ESKD Life-Plan. KDOQI considers it reasonable and important to ensure that the predetermined dialysis access is usable when the patient is ready to initiate planned dialysis (for example, an arteriovenous [AV] access is mature and ready for cannulation for HD). KDOQI considers it reasonable that in patients who have unplanned or urgent dialysis starts with a central venous catheter (CVC), the ESKD Life-Plan is established with a dialysis access plan within 30 days of dialysis start.

### Treatment of dialysis catheter infections in 2004 [^116duH4m]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2006). Low credibility.

Hemodialysis catheter associated infections are a major source of morbidity and mortality in end stage renal disease patients. There is disagreement about the management of catheter infections, particularly concerning the removal of potentially infected tunneled dialysis catheters. A dialysis catheter should generally be removed when an infection involves a temporary hemodialysis catheter, a septic patient, a patient with a tunnel tract infection, or a patient with evidence of a metastatic infectious complication. In treating stable patients with clinically mild catheter associated bacteremia, parenteral antibiotics alone have a low success rate in eliminating the infection. Antibiotic locks are an emerging strategy for treating these patients, but at present higher rates of success and lower costs are achieved by exchanging the catheter over a guidewire. Antibiotic lock solutions, antibiotic coated catheters, and totally implantable dialysis access systems may play a large role in prevention of catheter associated infections in the future; however, further randomized controlled trials of these strategies are needed. Future efforts should concentrate on limiting the use of traditional tunneled cuffed hemodialysis catheters by early referral to vascular surgery for the creation of an arterio-venous fistula.

### Tunneled central venous catheter exchange: techniques to improve prevention of air embolism [^113DYzd3]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2015). Low credibility.

Malfunctioning tunneled hemodialysis central venous catheters (CVCs), because of thrombotic or infectious complications, are frequently exchanged. During the CVC exchanging procedure, there are several possible technical complications, as in first insertion, including air embolism. Prevention remains the key to the management of air embolism. Herein, we emphasize the technical tricks capable of reducing the risk of air embolism in long-term CVC exchange. In particular, adoption of a 5 to 10 degrees Trendelenburg position, direct puncture of the previous CVC venous lumen for guide-wire insertion, as opposed to guide-wire introduction after cutting the CVC, a light manual compression of the internal jugular vein venotomy site after catheter removal. The Valsalva maneuvre in collaborating patients, valved introducers, and correction of hypovolemia are also useful precautions. Principles of air embolism diagnosis and treatment are also outlined in the article.

### Tunneled hemodialysis central venous catheters prevalence and bloodstream infection rates in Northern Italy: a survey of the "East lombardy nephrological network" [^116beCbq]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Tunneled central venous catheter (tCVCs) is a vascular access frequently employed in hemodialysis patients. Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) are potentially life-threatening complications.

Methods

We performed a retrospective survey regarding tCVCs prevalence as well as the CRBSI incidence and management within five hospitals in the Brescia province belonging to the "East Lombardy Nephrological Network"; this study was based upon 18 queries regarding the years 2020 and 2021.

Results

The data collected refer to an overall hemodialysis population of 736 patients in 2020 and 745 patients in 2021. The prevalence of tCVCs was respectively 22.1% and 24.2% with the initial placement being performed with fluoroscopy support in 80% of the centers. CRBSI incidence was respectively 0.88 and 0.77 episodes per 1000days of tCVC use. When the CRBI was caused by Staphylococcus Aureus (SA) or Pseudomonas, differently from the recommendation of the KDOQI guidelines, the removal or the substitution of the tCVC did not occur immediately at the time of the diagnosis of the infection but only when the specific antibiotic therapy failed. A nose swab aimed at identifying SA carriers was performed in 60% of centers. The policy regarding the referral to other specialists (infectious disease specialist and microbiologist) was heterogenous across the centers according to their specific logistics.

Conclusions

This retrospective survey performed by the "East Lombardy Nephrological Network" within the Brescia province describes the prevalence of tCVCs use as well as the incidence and management of CRBSIs in the hemodialysis patients of this area. The clinical impact of the differences in terms of clinical approach detected compared to the KDOQI guidelines will need to be clarified ideally in prospective studies.

### Precurved non-tunnelled catheters for haemodialysis are comparable in terms of infections and malfunction as compared to tunnelled catheters: a retrospective cohort study [^115Wip6p]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients on maintenance haemodialysis require a reliable vascular access. Ideally, every haemodialysis patient should have a sufficiently matured arteriovenous fistula at the start of haemodialysis. However, maturation failure occurs in roughly one in three patients, while others have no suitable vessels to create a durable arteriovenous access due to pre-existing vascular pathology. In addition, some patients develop a rapidly progressive kidney disease, which precludes timely planning for an arteriovenous access. For these reasons, 68% of patients in Europe initialize dialysis using a central venous catheter (CVC) for vascular access. The use of CVCs among prevalent haemodialysis patients was 32% in 2009.

A CVC has several disadvantages, with the risk of infection and catheter malfunction being the main challenges. Current guidelines recommend to remove the CVC in almost all catheter-related infections. Furthermore, a CVC with catheter malfunction has to be removed eventually in most cases. – This is an important issue for patients dependent on a CVC for haemodialysis. Therefore, several recommendations are made to prevent loss of CVC. For example, the European Renal Best Practice guideline states that non-tunnelled central venous catheters (NTCVCs) should be avoided as much as possible, since the risk of infection compared to tunnelled central venous catheters (TCVCs) is even higher. A possible explanation for this could be the lack of a cuff to act as a barrier against invasion of bacteria from the exit site into the systemic circulation. The literature on this subject, however, is of older age. With the present-day hygiene measurements and the introduction of precurved NTCVCs inserted in the low jugular position, it is a subject of discussion whether these recommendations still hold true.

In this study, the primary objective was to assess whether precurved NTCVCs are comparable to TCVCs in terms of a combined endpoint of infection and catheter malfunction. Furthermore, we aimed to assess whether precurved NTCVCs are superior to straight NTCVCs for these adverse outcomes.

### Acute dialysis catheters [^114sDpRz]. Seminars in Dialysis (2002). Low credibility.

Acute dialysis catheters are non-cuffed, non-tunnelled catheters used for immediate vascular access. They are primarily used for acute renal failure in bed-bound patients and for short-term use in patients with malfunction of permanent access. Long-term use of acute catheters is not recommended, but does occur with acceptable infection rates in dialysis centers where tunnelled, cuffed catheters are not available. Most acute catheters are made of polyurethane, but silicone catheters are now available with larger lumen sizes capable of delivering blood flow rates over 300 ml/min. Acute catheters should be inserted in the internal jugular or femoral vein under ultrasound guidance to minimize complications. Subclavian catheters cause stenosis, thrombosis, and perforation of vessels. Intermittent catheter malfunction still occurs, particularly for left-sided internal jugular catheters and catheters placed in women. Blood flow may improve with lumen reversal, intraluminal t-PA, or guidewire exchange. Limiting duration of use and dressing catheter exit sites with dry gauze and antiseptic ointments can prevent catheter-related infections.

### Hemodialysis tunneled central venous catheters: five-year outcome analysis [^116sDAMF]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Tunneled central venous catheters (tCVCs) are considered inferior to arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and grafts in all nephrology guidelines. However, they are being increasingly used as hemodialysis vascular access. The purpose of this study was to document the natural history of tCVCs and determine the rate and type of catheter replacement.

Methods

This was a prospective study of 141 patients who underwent hemodialysis with tCVCs between January 2008 and December 2012. The patients used 154 tCVCs. Standard protocols about management of tCVCs, according to European Renal Best Practice, were well established. All catheters were inserted in the internal jugular vein. Criteria for catheter removal were persistent bloodstream infection, detection of an outbreak of catheter-related bloodstream (CRBS) infections, or catheter dysfunction. Event rates were calculated per 1,000 catheter days; tCVC cumulative survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis.

Results

Catheter replacement occurred in 15 patients (0.29 per 1,000 days); catheter dysfunction was the main cause of replacement (0.18 per 1,000 days), typically within 12 months of surgical insertion. A total of 53 CRBS events in 36 patients were identified (0.82 per 1,000 days); 17 organisms, most commonly Gram-positive pathogens, were isolated; 87% of CVC infections were treated by systemic antibiotics associated with lock therapy. tCVC cumulative survival was 91% at 1 year, 88% at 2 years and 85% at 4 years.

Conclusions

Our data show a high survival rate of tCVCs in hemodialysis patients, with low incidence of catheter dysfunction and CRBS events. These data justify tCVC use for hemodialysis vascular access, also as first choice, especially in patients with exhausted peripheral access and limited life expectancy.

### Tunnelled catheters for the haemodialysis patient [^113CvyHQ]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Haemodialysis depends upon the establishment of a durable means of vascular access. Although the creation of a successful arterio-venous Fistulae (AVF) is the ideal, this is not always possible or practical. Tunnelled catheters play an important role as an interim/bridge technique for emergency access or while an AVF matures, but may be associated with significant morbidity. The aim of this review is to highlight recent evidence based developments in tunnelled catheters, including methods of placement, complications and possible management strategies.

### Management of some uncommon but significant complications of the tunneled cuffed catheter for hemodialysis [^113HkJPi]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2025). Medium credibility.

Although use of the autogenous arteriovenous fistula is the first choice for vascular access for hemodialysis, the tunneled cuffed catheter (TCC) remains an important alternative method that is applied widely in maintenance hemodialysis for patients with end-stage renal disease. In addition to common complications, such as thrombosis, infection, formation of a fibrin sheath, or central vein stenosis, TCC dysfunction, such as kinks, cuff detachment, or mechanical destruction, can be easily overlooked. The reasons for these clinical problems are multifactorial and include the insertion handling, presence of diabetes mellitus, catheter type, malnutrition, and the patient's body habitus. This minireview describes our experience with TCC and the current literature on managing TCC dysfunction.

### Radiologically placed tunneled internal jugular catheters in the management of chronic hemodialysis and long-term infusion therapies in the pediatric population [^116gyGGn]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the long-term outcomes of radiologically inserted dual-lumen hemodialysis and infusion catheters in pediatric patients.

Materials and Methods

The authors retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of 114 tunneled internal jugular catheters in 71 consecutive pediatric patients between March 2003 and May 2006. Forty hemodialysis catheters were placed in 23 patients (11 girls, 12 boys), and 74 infusion catheters were placed in 48 patients (14 girls, 34 boys). The mean patient age was 11.2 years (range, 1–16 years) in the hemodialysis group and 7.86 years (range, 4 months to 16 years) in the infusion group.

Results

The technical success rate was 100%. The mean duration of catheter use was 84 days (range, 5–730 days) in the hemodialysis group and 58 days (range, 3–206 days) in the infusion group. Nine hemodialysis (22%) and 29 infusion (39%) catheters were electively removed. The most common reasons for catheter removal were malfunction (22%) in the hemodialysis group and completion of therapy (39%) in the infusion group. Revisions were performed at a rate of 0.6 and 0.4 per 100 catheters days in the hemodialysis and infusion groups, respectively. Total infection rates were 0.15 and 0.38 episodes per 100 catheter days in hemodialysis and infusion catheters, respectively. Mean primary device service intervals were 86 and 60 days for hemodialysis and infusion catheters, respectively, with total access site service intervals of 140 and 71 days.

Conclusion

Radiologically placed tunneled internal jugular catheters appear to be safe and effective, with very low complication rates for both hemodialysis and long-term infusion therapies. Higher infection rates were seen in patients with cancer.

### Placement of tunnelled haemodialysis catheters-interventional standard [^113QjbFu]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

While the native arteriovenous fistula remains the first choice in vascular access for most haemodialysis patients, tunnelled haemodialysis catheters (tHDCs) continue to be an option in selected patients. Since timely access to vascular surgery-due to delayed referral or resource limitations-is not always possible, nephrologists have to become more actively involved in planning, creation and monitoring of vascular access. Moreover, this approach could also strengthen patient-centred care in nephrology. This article reviews the current standard in tHDC creation, patient selection and strategies to mitigate the risk of infectious complications and catheter thrombosis. Presentation of novel developments in catheter placement with ultrasound-guided or electrocardiogram-guided positioning, their benefits and possible disadvantages emphasizes the complexity of vascular access planning. We offer an approach for the choice of insertion method, depending on selected side and existing resources and focus on the necessity and required resources of 'interventional nephrology' training programs.

### Investigation of risk factors for tunneled hemodialysis catheters dysfunction: competing risk analysis of a tertiary center data [^1118W26U]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Suitable vascular access is the main concern in chronic hemodialysis patients. Tunneled central venous catheters (CVC) is a flexible tube with prolonged vascular access providing for the management of intravenous medication treatments, fluids, or total parenteral nutrition, repeated blood sampling, and hemodialysis (HD). CVCs are used as temporary access to the vascular until permanent access to the vascular (arteriovenous fistula [AV F] or arteriovenous graft [AVG]) can be placed. Approximately 80% of newly hemodialysis patients require a CVC because they do not have suitable AFV to use or they have not had permanent access placed before dialysis initiation.

Identification and prevention of CVCs complications in hemodialysis patients (Common complications such as catheter infection and thrombosis) are serious to improving patient care. CVC's main complications include infection, catheter dysfunction, and central vein obstruction (CVO). Infection associated with hemodialysis catheters is the most serious complication that may cause significant morbidity and mortality, systemic complications, hospitalizations, and considerable costs to the healthcare system. Catheter dysfunction is defined as the lack of ability of a central venous catheter to: (1) doing a single dialysis period without causing recurrent pressure alarms or (2) generate hand over a mean dialysis blood flow of > 300 ml/min on two sequential dialysis periods or deliver a Kt/V of 1.2 in 4 hours or less. Catheter dysfunction may be caused due thrombosis, fibrin sheath obstruction and mechanical complications. Central vein obstruction (CVO) is identified in patients with > 70% stenosis of a central vein by contrast venography, or upper limb edema on the same side, and having a history of a central venous catheter. The incidence rate of CVCs complications is very wide because it can be determined by the definition of complications, patient population, units of measurement, duration of catheterization and follow-up, catheter location, and diagnostic methods. The US Renal Data System delivers guidelines for coding complications of the catheter in hemodialysis patients.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline on vascular access for haemodialysis [^117FQi8m]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

A proportion of catheters may develop complications over time, of which the most common are dysfunction (poor flow) and infection. As with AV access, much of the literature on catheter complications is limited by small study populations and short term outcomes, leaving many knowledge gaps, so that an evidence-based consensus is not possible for all aspects of management. Since the optimal approach is not always clear, pragmatic shared decisions should be made, taking into account clinical risk, likely treatment outcome and patient preference.

Catheter dysfunction

Tunnelled dialysis catheter dysfunction is a common problem, usually defined as inability of the catheter to deliver a blood flow of at least 300 ml/min in adult patients. Dysfunction from the time of insertion is generally due to poor positioning or kinking (rare following fluoroscopic guided insertion) and usually identified and corrected soon after insertion, through manipulation or repositioning. A catheter which previously functioned well but then delivers poor flow is considered to have late dysfunction, and this is may be caused by thrombus or fibrin, either within the catheter lumen or around the tip, though the distinction is in most cases not important, and imaging is not necessary. Fibrin forms around the external surface of most catheters, like a sheath, sometimes extending beyond the catheter tip.

If flows become problematic during haemodialysis, then repositioning, saline flushes or reversing the catheter lumens may provide a temporary solution, allowing completion of the session. However, these solutions do not address the cause of poor flow and are rarely durable - further treatment options include thrombolytic agents and mechanical measures (removing fibrin, usually at the same time as replacing the catheter). Thrombolytic therapy is immediately available in the dialysis unit, and is usually attempted initially, as it is often able to restore function quickly allowing dialysis to continue without too much interruption.

### Strategies to prevent hemodialysis catheter dysfunction [^116oPXXV]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Millions of patients with kidney failure rely on hemodialysis central venous catheters (CVCs) for their life-sustaining dialysis treatments. CVC dysfunction necessitates removal of up to 20% of CVCs and is an important problem for patients with kidney failure. Thrombosis and fibrin sheath formation are the most common mechanisms of CVC dysfunction beyond the first week after insertion. Factors such as female sex, left-sided CVC placement, and prior CVC dysfunction are associated with a higher risk of dysfunction. Patient-specific factors contribute substantially to variation in the number of CVC dysfunction events. Weekly thrombolytic locks have been shown to improve CVC blood flow rates, prevent infection, and reduce dysfunction requiring removal. However, routine administration may not be cost-effective in hemodialysis units with low infection rates, and targeted use among patients with established CVC dysfunction has not been studied. Concentrated heparin lock (e.g., 5000 versus 1000 international unit/ml) has been associated with lower requirements for therapeutic CVC thrombolysis but greater systemic bleeding risks and costs. Citrate 4% was noninferior to standard heparin locks to prevent thrombosis, may cause less bleeding, and is less costly in some countries. Tunneled CVCs with a symmetrical tip have been associated with a lower risk of CVC dysfunction compared with those with a step tip. Multifaceted CVC care interventions can reduce the incidence of dysfunctional CVCs by 33% compared with usual care. Future research to identify patients at high risk of CVC dysfunction will inform individualized vascular access plans, targeted use of preventive strategies, and enrollment criteria for future clinical trials.

KDOQI suggests that low-dose aspirin may be used to maintain tunneled CVC patency in patients with low bleeding risk (Conditional Recommendation, Low Quality of Evidence). CVC refers to tunneled hemodialysis CVCs unless otherwise specified.

### Managing the complications of long-term tunneled dialysis catheters [^115xdmam]. Seminars in Dialysis (2003). Low credibility.

The Kidney Disease Outcomes and Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) guidelines call for a significant increase in the use of natural vein fistulas. Long-term tunneled dialysis catheters (LTTDCs) will have an important role in facilitating the maturation of natural vein fistulas. LTTDCs also functions as the access of last resort in patients who refuse or have exhausted other forms of permanent vascular access. This article, which is based on the authors' experience as interventional nephrologists, discusses factors influencing catheter function. In addition, the article reviews common complications associated with dialysis catheter insertion, including immediate, short-term, and long-term complications. The topics reviewed include stenoses, thrombus formation, fibrin sheath formation, infections, and vascular ingrowth. Suggestions for management are also discussed.

Appropriate uses include awaiting live-donor kidney transplant with an established surgical date (< 90 days), very limited life expectancy (eg, ≤ 6–12 months), clinical conditions that would worsen with AV access (eg, HF with EF < 15%), and patient choice after informed consent (eg, competent, ≥ 85-year-old).

### Mapping national variation in hemodialysis central venous catheter management: a UK-wide survey [^111UrTjG]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2025). Medium credibility.

Background/Objective

Both the UK Kidney Association (UKKA) and Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) have limited guidance on the insertion and removal of HD central venous catheter (CVC) lines. Anecdotally there are variations to clinical practice across the UK. While some Trusts maintain local guidelines, standardized national protocols are lacking. We aimed to evaluate current practices related to HD CVC insertion and removal within UK renal units to identify variations in practice.

Method

An online questionnaire on the local protocol and practice surrounding temporary and tunneled HD line insertions and removals was used.

Result

120 responses were obtained from all (71) the main renal units according to UKKA, over the nine-month data collection period. Duplicated responses from the same renal center were removed and responses from senior nephrologists prioritized. 42 (59%) of the centers analyzed stated to have an interventional nephrology service. In 70 (99%) and 55 (77%) of centers, renal registrar and consultants insert temporary dialysis lines respectively. Temporary dialysis lines are most often removed by the ward nurses (69%) and the dialysis nurse (42%). Renal staff commonly insert both inpatient and outpatient right internal jugular and femoral tunneled dialysis lines. The remainder of the lines are most frequently done by the interventional radiology team. Among the centers, the average maximum number of days which temporary femoral and internal jugular dialysis lines are protocoled to remain in place is 7 and 14days respectively.

Conclusion

This study provides the most comprehensive assessment to date of HD CVC management practices across the UK, revealing considerable variability in procedural protocols, infection prevention measures, line dwell times, and post-insertion care. The findings highlight a need for national, evidence-based guidelines. Sharing these results within the renal community may inform future consensus building and policy development.

### The Society for Vascular Surgery: clinical practice guidelines for the surgical placement and maintenance of arteriovenous hemodialysis access [^1173LBD1]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2008). Medium credibility.

Arteriovenous access early thrombosis — causes and revision decisions emphasize that in a way, early thrombosis represents the more extreme form of failure to mature, with Insufficient arterial inflow, poor venous outflow, and anastomotic stenoses as the most common reasons and additional contributors including surgical technical errors, intrinsic coagulation state, drops in systemic blood pressure, and poor cardiac output. Management must be individualized because surgical re-exploration of the access may or may not be worthwhile; it may make more sense to evaluate alternative sites with a view toward placing a new access, whereas tunnel compression or graft kinking would require prompt urgent exploration. Revision options span from a simple thrombectomy to creation of completely new proximal anastomoses, and thrombectomy alone would not be expected to result in long-term access patency if the stenosis is not addressed.

### An unusual case of iatrogenic central venous injury [^112EDhuK]. Seminars in Dialysis (2023). Medium credibility.

Central venous catheter (CVC) provides ready vascular access and is widely used for the performance of hemodialysis. The use of CVC is associated with many complications and one life-threatening complication is central venous injury. We describe an unusual case of central venous injury in a 69-year-old lady with a poorly functioning left internal jugular vein catheter, which was in situ at the time of attempting insertion of a replacement right internal jugular catheter. The management included initial stabilization, urgent hemodialysis, imaging, and an endovascular approach to mitigate the iatrogenic venous injury. The case highlights many learning points. The operator needs to be vigilant for anatomical abnormalities like stenosis in patients who have had previous CVC. In those with central venous perforation, the CVC should be left in situ till a definitive management plan is formulated. An endovascular approach, when feasible, is a minimally invasive effective management strategy.

### Interventions for treating central venous haemodialysis catheter malfunction [^114s66jT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Adequate haemodialysis (HD) in people with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is reliant upon establishment of vascular access, which may consist of arteriovenous fistula, arteriovenous graft, or central venous catheters (CVC). Although discouraged due to high rates of infectious and thrombotic complications as well as technical issues that limit their life span, CVC have the significant advantage of being immediately usable and are the only means of vascular access in a significant number of patients. Previous studies have established the role of thrombolytic agents (TLA) in the prevention of catheter malfunction. Systematic review of different thrombolytic agents has also identified their utility in restoration of catheter patency following catheter malfunction. To date the use and efficacy of fibrin sheath stripping and catheter exchange have not been evaluated against thrombolytic agents.

Objectives

This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of TLA, preparations, doses and administration as well as fibrin-sheath stripping, over-the-wire catheter exchange or any other intervention proposed for management of tunnelled CVC malfunction in patients with ESKD on HD.

We included all studies conducted in people with ESKD who rely on tunnelled CVC for either initiation or maintenance of HD access and who require restoration of catheter patency following late-onset catheter malfunction and evaluated the role of TLA, fibrin sheath stripping or over-the-wire catheter exchange to restore catheter function. The primary outcome was be restoration of line patency defined as ≥ 300 mL/min or adequate to complete a HD session or as defined by the study authors. Secondary outcomes included dialysis adequacy and adverse outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed retrieved studies to determine which studies satisfy the inclusion criteria and carried out data extraction. Included studies were assessed for risk of bias. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using GRADE.

Main Results

Our search strategy identified 8 studies (580 participants) as eligible for inclusion in this review. Interventions included: thrombolytic therapy versus placebo (1 study); low versus high dose thrombolytic therapy (1); alteplase versus urokinase (1); short versus long thrombolytic dwell (1); thrombolytic therapy versus percutaneous fibrin sheath stripping (1); fibrin sheath stripping versus over-the-wire catheter exchange (1); and over-the-wire catheter exchange versus exchange with and without angioplasty sheath disruption (1). No two studies compared the same interventions. Most studies had a high risk of bias due to poor study design, broad inclusion criteria, low patient numbers and industry involvement. Based on low certainty evidence, thrombolytic therapy may restore catheter function when compared to placebo (149 participants: RR 4.05, 95% CI 1.42 to 11.56) but there is no data available to suggest an optimal dose or administration method. The certainty of this evidence is reduced due to the fact that it is based on only a single study with wide confidence limits, high risk of bias and imprecision in the estimates of adverse events (149 participants: RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.38 to 10.73). Based on the available evidence, physical disruption of a fibrin sheath using interventional radiology techniques appears to be equally efficacious as the use of a pharmaceutical thrombolytic agent for the immediate management of dysfunctional catheters (57 participants: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.07). Catheter patency is poor following use of thrombolytic agents with studies reporting median catheter survival rates of 14 to 42 days and was reported to improve significantly by fibrin sheath stripping or catheter exchange (37 participants: MD -27.70 days, 95% CI -51.00 to -4.40). Catheter exchange was reported to be superior to sheath disruption with respect to catheter survival (30 participants: MD 213.00 days, 95% CI 205.70 to 220.30). There is insufficient evidence to suggest any specific intervention is superior in terms of ensuring either dialysis adequacy or reduced risk of adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

Thrombolysis, fibrin sheath disruption and over-the-wire catheter exchange are effective and appropriate therapies for immediately restoring catheter patency in dysfunctional cuffed and tunnelled HD catheters. On current data there is no evidence to support physical intervention over the use of pharmaceutical agents in the acute setting. Pharmacological interventions appear to have a bridging role and long-term catheter survival may be improved by fibrin sheath disruption and is probably superior following catheter exchange. There is no evidence favouring any of these approaches with respect to dialysis adequacy or risk of adverse events. The current review is limited by the small number of available studies with limited numbers of patients enrolled. Most of the studies included in this review were judged to have a high risk of bias and were potentially influenced by pharmaceutical industry involvement. Further research is required to adequately address the question of the most efficacious and clinically appropriate technique for HD catheter dysfunction.

### Different management methods for tunnel abscess in tunneled cuffed catheters with catheter-related bloodstream infections and central venous stenosis: two case reports [^114SYWca]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The prolonged lifespan of hemodialysis patients, combined with limited vascular access options and comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, immune disorders, and advanced age, has rendered the creation of native arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) or prosthetic grafts increasingly challenging. Consequently, TCCs have emerged as a critical alternative for vascular access. However, TCC-related complications, including TIs and CRBSIs, remain significant clinical concerns. Untreated or inadequately managed TIs may progress to severe systemic complications such as sepsis or septic shock, while also causing irreversible damage to vascular access pathways. Although current guidelines advocate TCC removal in cases of complex infection to control the infectious focus, indiscriminate catheter extraction risks exacerbating CVS or central venous occlusion (CVO), thereby complicating subsequent reinsertion attempts and increasing the likelihood of failure.

This study analyzes two cases of complex TCC-associated tunnel infections with concurrent CVS to propose a staged management protocol integrating infection control, temporary transition to NCCs, and endovascular intervention. This approach aims to mitigate risks associated with TCC reinsertion while improving procedural success rates.

Despite recommendations by various national guidelines advocating arteriovenous fistulae as the access of choice in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD), the use of central venous catheters (CVCs) remains widespread among both incident and prevalent HD patients. Unfortunately, long-term use of CVCs is fraught with complications, which are a major cause of morbidity and death in this patient population. Complications include a high rate of infections, as well as thrombus and sheath-related mechanical dysfunction. This review addresses prevention and management of noninfectious catheter-related dysfunction.

### Budd-Chiari syndrome: an unusual complication of an internal jugular tunneled dialysis catheter [^113KQkjo]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2023). Medium credibility.

Budd-Chiari syndrome due to the tip of an internal jugular tunneled dialysis catheter malposition in inferior vena cava or hepatic vein is a rare complication. We aimed to present our experience and compare it with the previous reports to highlight the clinical features and the optimal management. A 57-year-old female with history of ANCAp vasculitis, treated by hemodialysis in the last 2years on a right internal jugular vein tunneled catheter was admitted for pain in the right upper quadrant. A subacute Budd-Chiari syndrome due to catheter malposition was diagnosed. The catheter was removed, and a new tunneled hemodialysis line was inserted in the right internal jugular vein with the tip at the junction of right atrium with superior vena cava. Anticoagulation with apixaban 2.5mg twice daily was started after catheter replacement and the patient was discharged. At 1month follow-up the patient had no symptoms, and the ultrasound revealed the absence of the thrombus in the inferior vena cava. Imagining monitoring for malposition after insertion or in a clinical context suggestive for Budd-Chiari syndrome is essential for early diagnosis and treatment. In our case, anticoagulation with apixaban and prompt catheter replacement resulted in Budd-Chiari syndrome resolution.

### Different management methods for tunnel abscess in tunneled cuffed catheters with catheter-related bloodstream infections and central venous stenosis: two case reports [^113G6CAS]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

Case 1

A 67-year-old female presented on February 4, 2023, with a 4-day history of chills and fever during hemodialysis via a right internal jugular vein TCC. The patient was diagnosed with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ANCA-associated vasculitis in February 2016, at which time a 14.5Fr-36 cm Palindrome catheter (Covidien LLC, Mansfield, MA, USA) was initially implanted for hemodialysis. In December 2018, she was hospitalized for progressive facial and neck swelling over 6 months, diagnosed with SVC stenosis. Under digital subtraction angiography (DSA), balloon angioplasty was performed, followed by placement of a 13.5 mm×6 cm Fluency covered stent (Bard Medical, New Jersey, USA) in the SVC. A new TCC (14.5Fr-36 cm Palindrome catheter) was reinserted through the stent into the right atrium. Postoperatively, the facial and neck edema resolved, and the TCC functioned adequately.

In June 2021, she was readmitted with an 8-day history of fever and 4 days of hypotension, diagnosed with septic shock, bacteremia, and CRBSI. The right internal jugular TCC was removed, and antimicrobial therapy was initiated. After 12 days of anti-infection treatment, the infection was brought under control, during this period, right femoral vein NCC dialysis was used. Ultrasonography confirmed occlusion of the right internal jugular vein, prompting TCC reinsertion via the right brachiocephalic vein under DSA guidance.

On February 4, 2023, the patient was hospitalized again for tunnel infection and CRBSI involving the TCC.

On admission, physical examination revealed a 6 cm × 4 cm abscess along the right brachiocephalic vein TCC tunnel, characterized by localized erythema, warmth, tenderness, and fluctuance (Figure 1 A). Based on clinical history and examination, the patient was diagnosed with sepsis, TCC-related bloodstream infection, and TCC tunnel infection. Immediate management included incision and drainage of the abscess and removal of the infected TCC. Microbiological cultures of peripheral blood, catheter blood, catheter tip, and pus all identified Staphylococcus aureus as the causative pathogen.

Case 2

A 71-year-old female presented on March 20, 2023, with a 2-day history of chills and fever during hemodialysis via a right internal jugular vein TCC that had been in place for 5 years. The patient was diagnosed with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetic nephropathy in July 2018. In August 2018, a 14.5Fr-36 cm Palindrome catheter (Covidien LLC, Mansfield, MA, USA) was implanted in the right internal jugular vein to initiate regular hemodialysis. The patient was admitted for treatment due to a catheter tunnel abscess and CRBSI.

On admission, physical examination revealed a 6 cm × 5 cm abscess at the TCC tunnel site in the right internal jugular vein, characterized by localized erythema, warmth, tenderness, and fluctuance (Figure 4 A). Based on clinical history and examination, the patient was diagnosed with sepsis, CRBSI, and TCC tunnel infection.CTA identified stenosis of the SVC (Figure 4 C, D).

Given the risk of exacerbating SVC stenosis or occlusion with TCC removal (as observed in the prior case), which could complicate future catheter reinsertion, a modified strategy was employed. Since the tunnel infection spared the venous entry site, the infected TCC was removed and replaced in situ with a NCC over a guidewire to preserve access(Figure 4 B). The procedural steps were as follows:

Sterilization and draping of the TCC entry site. Catheter separation and guidewire insertion: The TCC was dissected at the venous entry, and a guidewire was advanced through the existing intravascular lumen.TCC removal and NCC placement: The indwelling TCC segment was extracted, and an NCC was inserted over the guidewire.

Cuff dissection and debridement: The TCC cuff was excised, and the abscess cavity was surgically debrided. Microbiological cultures of peripheral blood, catheter blood, catheter tip, and pus all isolated Staphylococcus aureus as the causative pathogen. Following infection control, the NCC was later exchanged for a new TCC.

### Precurved non-tunnelled catheters for haemodialysis are comparable in terms of infections and malfunction as compared to tunnelled catheters: a retrospective cohort study [^113x8xMo]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study shows that TCVCs and precurved NTCVCs are comparable in terms of reaching the combined endpoint of catheter-related infections and catheter malfunction. This is an important observation because the most recent Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guideline recommends to use a TCVC in case a CVC for haemodialysis is needed for more than 1 week. This guideline is of older age (2006), and the use of precurved catheters is not yet mentioned in this guideline. In previous observational studies, TCVCs were repeatedly associated with lower risk of infections compared to NTCVCs. The NTCVCs in these studies were all straight CVCs. In our study, we show that straight NTCVCs have a higher risk of infections and catheter malfunction compared to precurved NTCVCs. This can explain the advantage of TCVCs over NTCVCs in the previous literature. Randomized controlled trials comparing TCVCs with precurved NTCVCs are lacking. In line with our current study, Weijmer et al.showed in an observational trial in 2008 that precurved jugular NTCVCs had a lower risk of infection and less catheter malfunction than straight jugular NTCVCs. To our knowledge, this is the only study to compare these catheters.

### Common errors in temporary hemodialysis catheter insertion [^113WQSuC]. Seminars in Dialysis (2019). Medium credibility.

Non-tunneled hemodialysis catheter (NTHC) insertion is an essential skill for nephrology practice and remains a requirement of training. However, improper insertion technique can increase the risk of potentially fatal infectious and mechanical complications. Evidence-based strategies can reduce the rates of such complications and should be integrated into practice and training. Ultrasound (US) guidance should routinely be used for NTHC insertion at the femoral and internal jugular sites (with avoidance of the subclavian site). Nephrologists should receive proper training in the use of US for line insertion. With respect to other aspects of the procedure, proper insertion technique readily prevents guidewire-induced arrhythmias. In addition, adherence to infection-control guidelines results in a sustainable reduction in bloodstream infections. All these aspects of NTHC insertion may be best taught and evaluated through a program that includes simulation-based mastery learning (SBML) training. As a separate issue, nephrologists (and intensivists) should be aware that a dysfunctional catheter should be replaced at a new site rather than being changed over a guidewire. This review of common errors related to NTHC insertion seeks to highlight evidence-based approaches to practice and training.

### Risk factors of hemodialysis catheter dysfunction in patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy: a retrospective study [^113f11fD]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this retrospective study, less prolonged levels of PT and slightly prolonged aPTT were identified as risk factors for catheter dysfunction during the first 48 h after initiation of CRRT. In terms of requirement of re-catheterization to maintain CRRT, venous access site was associated with the increased risk of re-catheterization. Initial catheterization in the left jugular vein or femoral vein as venous access sites were more likely to require re-catheterization compared to the right internal jugular vein.

Previous studies of risk factors associated with catheter dysfunction during RRT have focused on the vascular access site with conflicting reports with respect to relative risk of dysfunction between catheters in the femoral and the internal jugular vein. The internal jugular vein had been considered as the optimal site of vascular access for RRT with lower incidence of catheter dysfunction and risk of catheter-related infection. However, since the CATHEDIA study, a multicenter randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing intermittent hemodialysis or CRRT, there have been reports of similar risk of infection, catheter dysfunction, and dialysis performance between femoral and right jugular vein catheterization. Recent guidelines recommend both femoral and right jugular veins as the initial site for vascular access in the setting of critical care, while discouraging the use of left jugular and subclavian veins. In clinical practice, femoral vein is preferred for CRRT especially for sicker and lighter patients, as it enables faster and more successful vascular access.

Type, length, and the location of tip of catheter have also been shown to be associated with the risk of catheter dysfunction. The non-tunneled, non-cuffed temporary catheter is recommended for critically ill patient as the catheterization procedure at bedside is straightforward and does not require fluoroscopic guidance. However, non-tunneled catheters are associated with higher rates of dialysis interruption, lower venous and arterial access pressure, higher incidence of re-catheterization, and decreased filter life during CRRT. As for the length of the catheter, catheters placed in the femoral vein are usually longer as it is associated with less catheter dysfunction. The catheter tip location is also widely recognized to be related to catheter dysfunction, with positioning it in the right atrium or inferior vena cava known to reduce the risk of dysfunction. In this study, however, there was no significant association between the catheter tip location and catheter dysfunction (Table 2). We suggested that catheter dysfunction in the early period following CRRT initiation may be primarily influenced by factors such as vascular access or laboratory variables, rather than the catheter tip location.

### Placement issues of hemodialysis catheters with pre-existing central lines and catheters [^113XSQRw]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

It has been a widely accepted practice that a previous placed pacemaker, automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillators, or central line can be a contraindication to placing a hemodialysis catheter in the ipsilateral jugular vein. Fear of dislodging pacing wires, tunneling close to the battery site or causing venous obstruction has been a concern for surgeons and interventionalists alike. We suggest that this phobia may be unfounded.

Methods

A retrospective review was conducted of patients in whom hemodialysis catheters were placed over a period of 10years. For each hemodialysis catheter that was placed, perioperative chest X-ray performed was used to evaluate for pre-existing pacemakers and central lines. The position and laterality of placement of the hemodialysis catheter along with presence of arteriovenous fistula with functional capacity for access were noted.

Results

A total of 600 hemodialysis catheters were placed in patients over the period of 10years. The mean age of the patients was 73.6 ± 12years with a median age of 76years. We found 20 pacemakers or automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillators and 19 central lines on the same side of the neck as the hemodialysis catheter that was placed in the ipsilateral jugular vein. No patient exhibited malfunction or dislodgment of the central line, the pacemaker, or automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator or evidence of upper extremity venous obstruction based upon signs symptoms or duplex exams.

Conclusion

Based on our experience, we suggest that placement of hemodialysis catheter in the internal jugular vein ipsilateral to the pre-existing catheter/leads is safe and spares the contralateral limb for arteriovenous fistula creation.

### Catheter management in hemodialysis patients: delivering adequate flow [^111Kcd2q]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Over 330,000 individuals in the United States depend on hemodialysis (HD), the majority as a result of end-stage renal disease. Sustainable vascular access can be achieved through arteriovenous fistulas, arteriovenous grafts, or tunneled catheters. Tunneled dialysis catheters (TDCs) often remain in use for months or even years, long beyond their initial intended use as a bridging device. Research efforts are focused on identifying strategies to prevent/minimize the risk of the most common catheter-related complications: thrombotic occlusion and infection. Thrombotic occlusion of TDCs prevents adequate dialysis but can be managed successfully through thrombolytic agents to restore/improve blood flow in the majority of patients, allowing immediate HD delivery and prolonging usability of the TDC. Occasionally, catheter exchange with fibrin sheath disruption is needed to preserve the site. Surface-treated catheters could improve the morbidity and mortality associated with HD delivery via an indwelling catheter, but results from studies have been disappointing to date. We review the etiology of catheter-based access failure and the monitoring and interventional steps that should be taken to maintain the patency and safety of catheters for HD. Wherever possible we note the areas in which there is scant data where further randomized clinical trials are needed.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^116JcncH]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

CVC tip position, malposition, and troubleshooting — postinsertion imaging should be considered to avoid malpositioning, and proper location for the CVC tip is at the mid right atrium to avoid vessel and right atrial trauma and consequent complications. Complications were documented in 1% of right internal jugular vein placements via ultrasound guidance in a retrospective single-center study where 75% of CVCs were placed by trainees, and in a prospective study 1.4% of right internal jugular vein CVCs were malpositioned when placed by an anesthesiologist using anatomic landmarks without image guidance. Factors associated with tunneled CVC tip malpositioning include change in position from supine to upright, which may be accentuated in obese and female patients, and consistent with the 2006 KDOQI guideline, it is reasonable to consider imaging for correct CVC location when catheter dysfunction persists that is unresponsive to conservative maneuvers and tPA administration.

### Guidelines for the prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections: recommendations relevant to interventional radiology for venous catheter placement and maintenance [^112gyZME]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Replacement of central venous catheters (CVCs) — evidence summary indicates that routine scheduled replacement does not lower CRBSI and clarifies circumstances for guide wire exchange and dialysis access. Midline catheters were in place for a median of 7 days, but for as long as 49 days. Two trials assessed changing a catheter every 7 days versus as needed, including one with 112 surgical ICU patients and another with only subclavian hemodialysis catheters, and in both studies no difference in CRBSI was observed between scheduled every‑7‑day replacement and as‑needed replacement. A metaanalysis of 12 randomized, controlled trials failed to demonstrate any reduction of CRBSI rates through routine replacement of CVCs by guide wire exchange compared with as‑needed replacement, and routine replacement of CVCs is not necessary for catheters that are functioning without evidence of causing local or systemic complications. Exchange of temporary catheters over a guide wire in the presence of bacteremia is not an acceptable replacement strategy, whereas in selected patients with tunneled hemodialysis catheters and bacteremia, exchange over a guide wire with antibiotic therapy is an alternative as a salvage strategy in patients with limited venous access. If temporary access is needed for dialysis, a tunneled cuffed catheter is preferable to a nontunneled catheter, even in the ICU setting, if the catheter is expected to stay in place for more than 3 weeks.

### The Society for Vascular Surgery: clinical practice guidelines for the surgical placement and maintenance of arteriovenous hemodialysis access [^114CCc5Y]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Recognizing the impact of the decision making by the dialysis access surgeon on the successful placement of autogenous arteriovenous hemodialysis access, the Society for Vascular Surgery assembled a multispecialty panel to develop practice guidelines in arteriovenous access placement and maintenance with the aim of maximizing the percentage and functionality of autogenous arteriovenous accesses that are placed. The Society commissioned the Knowledge and Encounter Research Unit of the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota, to systematically review the available evidence in three main areas provided by the panel: timing of referral to access surgeons, type of access placed, and effectiveness of surveillance. The panel then formulated practice guidelines in seven areas: timing of referral to the access surgeon, operative strategies to maximize the placement of autogenous arteriovenous accesses, first choice for the autogenous access, choice of arteriovenous access when a patient is not a suitable candidate for a forearm autogenous access, the role of monitoring and surveillance in arteriovenous access management, conversion of a prosthetic arteriovenous access to a secondary autogenous arteriovenous access, and management of the nonfunctional or failed arteriovenous access. For each of the guidelines, the panel stated the recommendation or suggestion, discussed the evidence or opinion upon which the recommendation or suggestion was made, detailed the values and preferences that influenced the group's decision in formulating the relevant guideline, and discussed technical remarks related to the particular guideline. In addition, detailed information is provided on various configurations of autogenous and prosthetic accesses and technical tips related to their placement.

### Fistula eligibility: a work in progress [^115HXJt8]. Seminars in Dialysis (2014). Low credibility.

Effective hemodialysis requires a reliable vascular access. Clinical practice guidelines strongly recommend the fistula as the preferred option followed by arteriovenous (AV) grafts, with central venous catheters being least preferred. Recently, there has been a growing awareness of the limitations of the fistula, its high rate of primary failure and that a fistula may not be appropriate for all patients initiating or on hemodialysis. However, determinates for fistula eligibility have not been clearly defined. The creation and use of a fistula requires the complex integration of patient, biological, and surgical factors, none of which can be easily predicted or planned. There have been several successful initiatives over the last decade addressing patient suitability for AV access, but none have validated defined criteria for fistula eligibility. We discuss these initiatives by addressing: 1) process of care, 2) radiological and nonradiological tests and procedures, and 3) alternative surgical approaches. Careful clinical judgment, appropriate vascular access assessment and placement, and an individualized approach to the risks and benefits will optimize patient health outcomes while minimizing prolonged catheter dependence among hemodialysis patients.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^112fN81o]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Rationale/Background — hemodialysis central venous catheters (CVCs) versus arteriovenous (AV) access — notes Hemodialysis CVCs, when compared with AV access, are associated with a 2- to 3 fold higher risk of infection-related hospitalization and increased costs due to catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI). Contamination of the external and internal CVC surface through both the extraluminal and intraluminal pathways involves the transfer of organisms during CVC manipulation such as during dressing changes or connection and disconnection of the CVC, with organisms transferred from health providers' or patients' hands, the patient's skin, or surrounding clothing to the exit site/tunnel or to external or internal surfaces of CVC hubs or caps. As such, some guidelines have recommended minimal manipulation of the CVC, limiting access of HD vascular access to personnel who are adequately trained, and need for regular re-training.

### Tunneled femoral dialysis catheter: practical pointers [^114mFm7X]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2023). Medium credibility.

One of the most challenging aspects of providing end-stage kidney disease care is to achieve adequate long-term access to the bloodstream to support hemodialysis (HD) therapy. Although upper extremity arteriovenous fistula remains the vascular access of choice for patients on HD, complications such as central venous stenosis, access thrombosis, or exhaustion of suitable access sites in the upper extremity, ultimately result in pursuing vascular access creation in the lower extremity. The current review focuses on the indications, contraindications, and clinically relevant practical procedural tips to successfully place a tunneled femoral dialysis catheter. The review highlights some of the prevailing misconceptions regarding femoral catheter placement practices.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^112prhv3]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

KDOQI vascular access — Special discussions, implementation considerations, and future research emphasize correct handling and standardized definitions for catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI). The Work Group discussed the importance of good CVC connections and their contributory role in CRBSI when not done properly and states that CVCs should be accessed and manipulated only by personnel trained and experienced in hemodialysis CVC care. Implementation considerations highlight standardized use of CRBSI definitions among dialysis providers to ensure consistent reporting and allow comparisons, and future research priorities include validating CRBSI diagnostic criteria and further validation studies including exit site and tunnel infections in HD patients.

### Different management methods for tunnel abscess in tunneled cuffed catheters with catheter-related bloodstream infections and central venous stenosis: two case reports [^111RqvJ6]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Tunneled cuffed catheters (TCCs) are critical vascular access tools for hemodialysis patients, but they are associated with complications such as tunnel infections (TIs) and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs). Current guidelines recommend removing infected TCCs, but this can exacerbate central venous stenosis (CVS) and complicate subsequent catheter reinsertion. This case series proposes a staged management protocol for complex TCC tunnel abscess infections complicated by CVS.

Case Presentation

We present two cases of complex TCC tunnel abscess infections with concurrent CVS. In case 1, a 67-year-old female with ANCA-associated vasculitis had a TCC tunnel abscess and CRBSI. After TCC removal, CT angiography(CTA) revealed occlusion of the right internal jugular vein and right brachiocephalic vein, along with in-stent stenosis of the superior vena cava. Endovascular interventions, including balloon angioplasty, facilitated successful TCC reinsertion. In case 2, a 71-year-old female with diabetic nephropathy underwent a staged strategy: the infected TCC was removed and replaced with a non-cuffed catheter (NCC) in situ. After infection control, balloon angioplasty resolved CVS, and a new TCC was reinserted. Both patients achieved infection control and preserved functional vascular access.

Conclusions

Both patients achieved infection control and preserved functional vascular access. However, Case 1 required technically demanding multistep endovascular procedures with elevated procedural risks, while Case 2 simplified reinsertion through NCC bridging. A staged management protocol (infection control → NCC transition → endovascular salvage) effectively addresses complex TCC infections with concurrent CVS, mitigates post-removal vascular injury, and enhances reinsertion success. Larger cohort studies are warranted to validate the efficacy and long-term safety of this approach.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^113CSkrB]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Guideline 21. Catheter dysfunction — implementation considerations state that "The KDOQI Work Group offers this definition because it allows for intrapatient comparisons and respects differences in definitions of dialysis adequacy used by various studies, institutions, and jurisdictions". It further notes, "It allows for the flexibility required when considering various HD prescriptions according to type, duration, and frequencies of the dialysis regimen". Operationally, "HD units may want to consider establishing local definitions of CVC dysfunction that incorporate their prescription goals to meet adequacy targets (thereby being consistent with KDOQI definitions) and documenting episode(s) of CVC dysfunction at a predetermined frequency or interval to allow for trending and appropriate intervention".

### Optimal timing for secondary arteriovenous fistula creation: devastating effects of delaying conversion [^114VH3oG]. Seminars in Dialysis (2006). Low credibility.

A chronic hemodialysis patient was referred to interventional nephrology for evaluation of arteriovenous access dysfunction. The patient had been receiving hemodialysis using a left forearm brachiobasilic loop graft for the past 3 years. Physical examination revealed a hyperpulsatile graft. Angiography documented a critical stenosis at the vein-graft anastomosis and a well-developed basilic vein from the elbow to the axillary region. Central veins were patent all the way to the right atrium. All attempts to navigate the wire across the stenosis failed. The patient was educated and counseled regarding the possibility of surgical creation of a secondary arteriovenous fistula (AVF). The images obtained were shared and discussed with the surgeon. A plan to create a secondary AVF using the basilic vein in the arm was made. A few months later the patient was referred to interventional nephrology, this time for thrombectomy of the same left arm loop graft. Thrombectomy could not be performed and a right internal jugular tunneled catheter was inserted. The patient again was referred to the surgeon for AVF creation. Six weeks later the patient was seen in the interventional laboratory for removal of the right internal jugular tunneled catheter. It was noted that instead of a fistula, the patient had received a right forearm brachiocephalic loop graft. Devastating consequences, such as the lost opportunity to create a fistula, insertion of a tunneled dialysis catheter, arteriovenous graft placement, exhaustion of available sites for fistula creation, and exposure to increased morbidity and mortality associated with grafts and catheters, can result if the opportunity to create a secondary AVF is not availed in a timely manner. This concept must be understood by every member of the vascular access team.

### Insertion of tunneled hemodialysis catheters without fluoroscopy [^115PaNwC]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The tunneled cuffed catheter (TCC) is used as a bridge access for hemodialysis. Few prospective studies have been designed to evaluate conversion from non-tunneled to TCC without the use of fluoroscopy when performed by nephrologists.

Methods

We performed an observational prospective cohort in incident patients receiving hemodialysis through a non-tunneled right jugular vein catheter.

Results

130 procedures were performed in 122 patients (51 ± 18 years). The success rate was 100%. There was a total of 26,546 catheter days. Ninety-one of the 130 catheters were removed during the study period. Life table analysis revealed primary patency rates of 92%, 82%, and 68% at 30, 60, and 120 days, respectively. Infection requiring catheter removal occurred at a frequency of 0.09 per 100 catheter days. Catheter malfunction requiring intervention occurred at a rate of 0.03 per 100 catheter days. Hypertension and duration of existing non-tunneled catheter of less than 2 weeks were independently associated with better TCC survival.

Conclusion

The conversion from non-tunneled to TCC performed by nephrologists and without fluoroscopy may be safe by using the internal right jugular vein. The ideal time to do this procedure is within less than 2 weeks of existing non-tunneled catheter.

### A roundish dark spot in the upper cava vein [^115T6Sbi]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2025). Medium credibility.

To the Editor

A 69-year-old Caucasian woman presented to our Nephrology department with malfunction of her left-sided tunneled jugular venous hemodialysis catheter. She had been undergoing hemodialysis once a week. Her medical history includes chronic heart and renal failure, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, goiter, and recurrent urinary tract infections. Initially, a temporary catheter was used due to volume overload and abnormal lab results, which was later replaced by a long-term catheter.

Four months prior, the long-term catheter was inserted in the left jugular vein using Seldinger's technique, under B-mode ultrasound guidance. Chest X-rays post-placement confirmed correct positioning in the superior caval vein, but the catheter malfunctioned over time. Upon presentation, the patient was stable, with normal vital signs and mild inflammation on the catheter exit site in the left sub-clavicular area.

Laboratory results showed elevated uric acid, BUN, and creatinine, normal hemoglobin, white blood cells, platelets, lipids, potassium, and INR, mildly elevated glucose, and slightly reduced iron levels (Table 1, lab exams).

### Hemodialysis catheter breakage in an infant [^114GcDA1]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2023). Medium credibility.

A 3-month-old male infant was admitted to our unit due to acute decompensation of chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology. Further investigation led to the diagnosis of primary hyperoxaluria type 1. As the patient did not recover, hemodialysis was initiated with a non-tunneled femoral catheter. A tunneled Hickman catheter was placed in the internal jugular vein. The patient experienced moderate intradialytic exit-site bleeding and catheter malfunction, which initially responded to pressure and postural changes. During the third session, the patient suffered cardiopulmonary arrest. After stabilization, a chest hematoma was identified. Fluoroscopy revealed a catheter breakage. Despite initial stabilization, the patient developed septic shock due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and died several days later. Hemodialysis is sometimes necessary in children under 24months with chronic kidney disease. Vascular access is a major challenge in these patients due to lack of appropriate catheter sizes and high complication rates. Hemodialysis catheter fracture is an uncommon complication, and diagnosis can be difficult when the breakage involves the subcutaneous segment. Persistent intradialytic bleeding and mechanical malfunction should raise suspicion of this complication and should elicit catheter revision under fluoroscopy. Without prompt diagnosis, catheter breakage may have fatal consequences, as in our case.

### Differences in training and practice in tunnelled haemodialysis catheter removal: a survey of nephrology trainees across United Kingdom [^115credJ]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Guidance on TDC removal

Even though this procedure poses significant problems with rare but major complications, there are no specific easy to find national or international guidelines on TDC removal. The literature appears to be focusing on insertion, maintenance and management of dysfunction or infections. UK Kidney Association (UKKA) published a guideline in April 2023 on "vascular access for haemodialysis". This includes some suggestions on catheter insertion and care but none on removal. Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) published their own vascular access guideline in April 2019. Again, this guideline includes recommendations on the insertion technique, timing of TDC removal but makes no suggestions on how to remove TDCs. Finally, American Society of Diagnostic and Interventional Nephrology (ASDIN) provides no freely available guidelines on TDC removal either.

### An ISHLT consensus document for prevention and management strategies for mechanical circulatory support infection [^112yFocS]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2017). Medium credibility.

Allergy — Preoperative infection-prevention steps for mechanical circulatory support (MCS) implantation include clarifying antimicrobial allergies and specific line, catheter, and hygiene measures. We recommend clarifying the accuracy and significance of all reported anti-microbial allergies, and consultation with an allergy specialist may be useful. Recommendations include: femoral line placement should be avoided if possible; tunneled catheters are preferred for prolonged use; all vascular access sites should be carefully evaluated on a daily basis; lines should be examined for signs of infection and exchanged if necessary as part of a pre-VAD decontamination strategy; catheters with evidence of infection should be removed and replaced using a strict sterile technique; exchange over a wire is strongly discouraged unless in special circumstances; indwelling urinary catheter placement should be done only if indicated and removed as soon as possible; MRSA screening should be considered with mupirocin and chlorhexidine used in those colonized; screening for other resistant bacteria should be based on local epidemiologic patterns; before surgery, the patient should shower or bathe with soap or antiseptic agent at least the night before operation; dental evaluation before MCS implantation is recommended and septic foci should be dealt with before MCS implant; review antibiotic allergies and obtain specialist assessment as necessary.
