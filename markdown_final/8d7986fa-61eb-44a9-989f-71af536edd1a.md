## Question

what are the problems with olanzapine lai that makes it not popular

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why olanzapine long‑acting injectable (LAI) remains unpopular despite proven efficacy, and specifically what practical, clinical, or regulatory problems limit its use among clinicians. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether efficacy is truly adequate so we can rule that out as the primary barrier. Then, I should review logistical limitations, especially any mandated monitoring requirements after injection. Next, I will examine the adverse effect profile of the LAI relative to oral olanzapine and any label-based cautions that sway prescribers toward alternatives. After that, I need to check the evidence base and guideline positioning in key populations like bipolar I disorder. Finally, I will consider comparative practicality versus competing LAIs and general infrastructure constraints that might amplify any unique burdens of olanzapine LAI [^113fLXcJ] [^1145vPWj] [^112CQr4t] [^1124XbHA].

> Let me first confirm that lack of efficacy is not the issue, because if efficacy were inferior, it could alone explain low uptake; the 8‑week randomized trial in acutely ill schizophrenia showed that multiple dosing regimens of olanzapine LAI significantly improved PANSS total scores versus placebo, and contemporary meta-analytic synthesis shows that SGA LAIs, including olanzapine, reduce overall symptoms more than placebo, with side-effect patterns similar to oral formulations, so the core antipsychotic effect appears intact [^113fLXcJ] [^1145vPWj].

> Hold on, I should verify the most frequently cited practical barrier; the literature explicitly calls out olanzapine LAI's post‑injection delirium/sedation syndrome risk necessitating a mandatory 3‑hour observation after every injection, which imposes a concrete workflow disruption for clinics and patients and is repeatedly described as a significant barrier to prescribing and to conducting further research, and this burden stacks atop the general infrastructure needs of LAIs that already require trained staff, appropriate sites, and reliable attendance, all of which are harder to guarantee in resource‑limited or high-throughput settings [^112CQr4t] [^114hNxb6].

> Next, I will examine the safety and tolerability context; LAI olanzapine inherits the oral formulation's metabolic liabilities, and recent RCT meta-analysis confirms that LAI side-effect profiles mirror those of the matching oral agents, while the FDA labeling for olanzapine injection underscores elevations in cholesterol, prolactin, and hepatic enzymes with explicit counseling that these long‑term risks may lead clinicians and patients to consider other drugs first, and serious postmarketing events related to metabolism and systemic reactions have also been reported, which together dampen enthusiasm when alternatives with more favorable metabolic profiles exist [^1145vPWj] [^11238qxM] [^115zJSeg].

> Wait, let me verify my own wording about prolactin so I don't overstate it; I initially implied a pronounced prolactin signal similar to risperidone, but I should correct that to say elevations have been observed with olanzapine in FDA labeling without asserting a comparative magnitude versus other SGAs, and the key clinical deterrent here remains the well‑characterized metabolic burden that is unchanged by the LAI route, which is the more decisive issue for many prescribers weighing long‑term risks [^11238qxM] [^1145vPWj].

> I will now examine the evidence base in bipolar I disorder because limited indication‑specific data can reduce guideline endorsement and prescriber confidence; a systematic review in 2018 found no randomized trials of olanzapine LAI for bipolar‑I maintenance while identifying trials for risperidone and aripiprazole LAIs, and current VA/DoD bipolar disorder guidelines explicitly suggest risperidone LAI as a maintenance option but do not list olanzapine LAI, so clinicians face both an evidence gap and a lack of guideline support in this key population, which further reduces the incentive to navigate the 3‑hour observation barrier off‑label [^112CQr4t] [^1124XbHA].

> Let me consider comparative practicality next; aripiprazole and paliperidone LAIs, widely used without a mandated 3‑hour post‑injection observation, show favorable real‑world effectiveness with lower hospitalization and discontinuation versus first‑generation depot comparators, and even though that dataset does not directly include olanzapine LAI, the practice trend naturally tilts toward LAIs that are easier to administer and have stronger, guideline‑aligned outcome data in the target populations, making olanzapine LAI comparatively less attractive in routine care [^1166QaBQ] [^1124XbHA].

> But wait, what if someone argues that olanzapine LAI is among the most efficacious agents for relapse prevention, so shouldn't that override practical hurdles; I should double‑check relapse prevention datasets, which indeed suggest excellent relapse prevention signals for olanzapine LAI in schizophrenia cohorts, yet even with that efficacy, the requirement for prolonged observation after each dose and the unchanged metabolic risk often tip the real‑world risk‑benefit and workflow calculus toward other LAIs with fewer logistical frictions, especially when multiple agents demonstrate robust relapse prevention benefits at pragmatic doses [^113o5CVg] [^114ycFPA].

> Next, I should review general LAI infrastructure issues to ensure I am not over‑attributing the problem to a single factor; LAIs in general require clinic-based administration, staffing, and reliable attendance, and the post‑COVID variability in access further complicated adoption, but for olanzapine LAI those global barriers are magnified by the unique 3‑hour monitoring requirement, which becomes the bottleneck that many outpatient programs cannot sustainably absorb at scale [^114hNxb6] [^112CQr4t].

> Let me synthesize and ensure internal consistency; efficacy is adequate, but the dominant deterrent is the mandatory 3‑hour post‑injection observation due to post‑injection syndrome, compounded by an adverse metabolic profile indistinguishable from oral olanzapine with FDA labeling that nudges clinicians to consider alternatives, a paucity of bipolar‑I RCTs that limits guideline endorsement in that population, and readily available competitor LAIs that avoid observation and have stronger practical and guideline footprints, so the cumulative effect is a prescriber preference cascade away from olanzapine LAI in everyday practice [^112CQr4t] [^11238qxM] [^1124XbHA] [^1166QaBQ].

---

Olanzapine LAI has limited uptake due to the mandatory 3-hour post-injection observation for post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome (PDSS) [^112CQr4t], which is logistically burdensome and costly [^114hNxb6]. It also carries a high metabolic risk (weight gain, diabetes, dyslipidemia) [^112y8GBn] and causes sedation, reducing tolerability compared with other LAIs. Together with limited real-world experience and availability, these issues lead clinicians to favor alternatives such as paliperidone or aripiprazole LAIs.

---

## Mandatory post-injection observation

- **PDSS risk**: Olanzapine LAI uniquely requires a 3-hour post-injection observation [^112CQr4t] due to PDSS, a rare but serious event with profound sedation, delirium, and cardiorespiratory depression [^113dKtyf].

- **Logistical burden**: This observation need increases clinic time, staffing, and costs, reducing feasibility in routine care [^112CQr4t] [^114hNxb6].

- **Patient acceptance**: The prolonged observation is inconvenient and stigmatizing, lowering acceptance and adherence.

---

## Metabolic and sedation side effects

- **Metabolic risk**: Olanzapine LAI has high rates of weight gain, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, similar to oral olanzapine and higher than many other LAIs [^112y8GBn] [^114cByiF].

- **Sedation**: Significant sedation and somnolence further limit tolerability and daily functioning [^113dKtyf].

- **Comparative tolerability**: These side effects make olanzapine LAI less attractive than alternatives like paliperidone or aripiprazole LAIs [^115B6ZsM].

---

## Limited clinical experience and availability

Limited experience with olanzapine LAI compared with other LAIs leads to **clinician uncertainty and reluctance**. Availability is also more restricted, as the formulation is **less widely accessible**, further limiting use.

---

## Summary of barriers to olanzapine LAI use

| **Barrier** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Mandatory observation | 3-hour post-injection observation for PDSS [^112CQr4t] |
| Metabolic side effects | High risk of weight gain; diabetes; dyslipidemia [^112y8GBn] |
| Sedation | Significant sedation and somnolence [^113dKtyf] |
| Limited experience | Less clinician experience and familiarity [^115B6ZsM] |
| Availability | Limited availability compared to other LAIs |

---

Olanzapine LAI's limited use is driven by the **3-hour observation requirement**, the high burden of metabolic effects and sedation, and limited clinician experience and availability, making other LAIs more practical and acceptable.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of 15 antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia: A multiple-treatments meta-analysis [^112y8GBn]. Lancet (2013). Low credibility.

The question of which antipsychotic drug should be preferred for the treatment of schizophrenia is controversial, and conventional pairwise meta-analyses cannot provide a hierarchy based on the randomized evidence. We aimed to integrate the available evidence to create hierarchies of the comparative efficacy, risk of all-cause discontinuation, and major side effects of antipsychotic drugs.

- **Methods**: We conducted a Bayesian-framework, multiple-treatments meta-analysis (which uses both direct and indirect comparisons) of randomized controlled trials to compare 15 antipsychotic drugs and placebo in the acute treatment of schizophrenia. We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's specialized register, Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov for reports published up to Sept. 1, 2012. Search results were supplemented by reports from the US Food and Drug Administration website and by data requested from pharmaceutical companies. Blinded, randomized controlled trials of patients with schizophrenia or related disorders were eligible. We excluded trials done in patients with predominant negative symptoms, concomitant medical illness, or treatment resistance, and those done in stable patients. Data for seven outcomes were independently extracted by two reviewers. The primary outcome was efficacy, as measured by mean overall change in symptoms. We also examined all-cause discontinuation, weight gain, extrapyramidal side effects, prolactin increase, QTc prolongation, and sedation.

Further studies, particularly high‐quality active‐controlled studies, are warranted for conclusive evidence. There are four SGA LAIs (aripiprazole LAI, olanzapine LAI, paliperidone LAI, and risperidone LAI) on the market, but only studies involving risperidone LAI and aripiprazole LAI were found. Further research on SGA LAIs, preferably comparing with active control and in a more pragmatic, real‐world setting, will add significant evidence base in this area. Data on aripiprazole LAI are limited due to there being only a single RCT and lack of any active control studies. Further research comparing aripiprazole LAI with active control is warranted. Research on paliperidone LAIs and olanzapine LAI also merits consideration. However, olanzapine LAI has some significant logistical issues due to the post-injection syndrome and thus requiring patients to be observed for 3 hours post-injection. This may be a significant barrier to prescribing as well as any future research.

### An 8-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of olanzapine long-acting injection in acutely ill patients with schizophrenia [^113fLXcJ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). High credibility.

To examine the efficacy and tolerability of a new injectable formulation of olanzapine, olanzapine long-acting injection (LAI), relative to placebo for the treatment of acutely ill patients with schizophrenia, an 8-week, double-blind study was conducted from June 2004 to April 2005. Patients with DSM-IV or DSM-IV-TR schizophrenia were randomly assigned to receive 210 mg/2 weeks, 300 mg/2 weeks, or 405 mg/4 weeks of olanzapine LAI or placebo/2 weeks. No oral antipsychotic supplementation was permitted. The primary efficacy measure was the mean baseline-to-end point change in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score.

Mean baseline-to-end point decreases in PANSS total scores were significantly greater for all olanzapine LAI regimens relative to placebo (all p values ≤ .046). Additionally, improvements in PANSS total scores of ≥ 7% of baseline (23.6–35.4% vs. 12.4%, p ≤ .046) were significantly greater for olanzapine LAI compared to placebo.

### Olanzapine [^11238qxM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Elevated cholesterol, prolactin, and hepatic aminotransferase levels have been observed. Patients should be counseled about the potential long-term risks associated with olanzapine for injection and advised that these risks may lead them to consider other drugs first. The safety and effectiveness of olanzapine for injection in patients under 13 years of age have not been established [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

- **Need for comprehensive treatment program in pediatric patients**: Olanzapine for injection is indicated as an integral part of a total treatment program for pediatric patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, which may include other measures such as psychological, educational, and social interventions. The effectiveness and safety of olanzapine for injection have not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age. Atypical antipsychotics are not intended for use in pediatric patients who exhibit symptoms secondary to environmental factors and/or other primary psychiatric disorders. Appropriate educational placement is essential, and psychosocial intervention is often helpful. The decision to prescribe atypical antipsychotic medication will depend upon the healthcare provider's assessment of the chronicity and severity of the patient's symptoms.

### Using long-acting injectable antipsychotics to enhance the potential for recovery in schizophrenia [^113S7WXM]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

The goals of schizophrenia treatment are to control symptoms, prevent relapse, and improve functioning and quality of life. For many patients, these goals are not being met. This report highlights information provided by experts on the reasons for, impact of, and means to reduce relapse in patients with schizophrenia; on patient-centered and patient-reported assessment; on the benefits and risks of medication options, including long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics; and on psychosocial interventions that may improve adherence and help prevent relapse in individuals living with schizophrenia.

Modifiable risk factors for poor outcomes in patients with schizophrenia include longer duration of untreated illness, comorbid substance abuse, early nonresponse to an antipsychotic, and the number of relapses related to nonadherence. Recommendations include:

- **Adopting a patient-centered approach**: Incorporate the use of patient-reported outcome measures.
- **Selecting medications based on balanced risk-benefit assessment**: Consider focusing on addressing symptoms for which the agents were superior to placebo and/or active controls.
- **Considering LAIs as an alternative to oral medications**: They offer benefits such as reliable drug delivery, uncovering nonadherence and pseudo-resistance, and reduced relapse risk and mortality.
- **Implementing psychosocial interventions**: Proven effective in improving adherence and overall outcomes.

### An assessment of emergent tardive dyskinesia and existing dyskinesia in patients receiving long-acting, injectable risperidone: results from a long-term study [^113YVnwk]. Schizophrenia Research (2005). Low credibility.

Treatment-emergent tardive dyskinesia (TD) can be a serious side effect of antipsychotic treatment. Atypical antipsychotics are associated with a lower risk for TD than conventional agents. A long-acting atypical antipsychotic, with more stable and lower peak blood levels than an oral formulation, may provide differential benefits regarding side effects, including movement disorders. This analysis assessed TD by defined research criteria in patients receiving long-acting, injectable risperidone.

- **Methods**: Clinically stable subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder participated in a 50-week, open-label trial of long-acting, injectable risperidone. TD was studied using defined research criteria [Schooler, N.R. Kane, J.M., 1982. Research diagnosis for tardive dyskinesia. Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 39, 486–487; American Psychiatric Association, 2000. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth ed. American Psychiatric Association, Washington, DC]. The severity of dyskinesia and other movement disorders was rated by the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS).

- **Results**: ESRS dyskinesia data were available for 662 patients. Five out of 530 subjects without dyskinesia at baseline (0.94%) met the predefined criteria for emergent persistent TD during therapy. Based on either exposure to study medication or Kaplan-Meier analysis, the 1-year rate was 1.19%. Among the 132 subjects with dyskinesia at baseline, the mean score on the ESRS physician's exam for dyskinesia improved significantly at endpoint (-2.77; P < 0.0001).

### Long-acting injectable antipsychotics: An underutilized treatment option [^113d8ohM]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

In this issue, Kane and colleagues report on the efficacy of aripiprazole long-acting injection (LAI) in the treatment of an acute episode of schizophrenia. At 10 weeks of treatment, both psychopathology and functioning were improved in patients treated with aripiprazole compared to placebo, with an acceptable tolerability and safety profile. The outcomes suggest that aripiprazole long-acting is a viable treatment option for patients experiencing an acute episode of schizophrenia.

### Early use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in bipolar disorder type I: An expert consensus [^116vU7Wf]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Course specifiers are extensions to a diagnosis that further clarify the course, severity, or special features of the disorder. Increasing evidence suggests that the concept of predominant polarity, a proposed course specifier for bipolar disorder, may have clinical relevance for the management of bipolar disorder. This approach is closer to real-world clinical practice and more pragmatic than the nosologically complex differentiation between bipolar subtypes such as BP-I and bipolar disorder type II (BP-II). For optimal outcomes, bipolar disorder requires an individualized, long-term, patient care management plan and an integrative approach that includes maintenance treatment, adjunctive psychosocial therapies, diligent monitoring for any treatment-emergent complications, and promotion of a healthy lifestyle, including stress management.

Accurate and timely diagnosis, prompt implementation of effective therapies, and medication adherence remain some of the key challenges and unmet needs in the management of bipolar disorder. Non-adherence to treatment is associated with significantly increased risks of recurrence, relapse, hospitalization, and suicide attempts, along with higher overall treatment costs. The estimated direct and indirect costs of bipolar disorder, including BP-I, in the United States alone are more than $195 billion annually. However, the greatest societal cost associated with bipolar disorder relates to significant loss of life due to suicide, followed by cardiovascular disease and other physical comorbidities. Furthermore, bipolar disorder can cause progressive burdens on individuals and healthcare systems.

### Sustained improvement of clinical outcome with risperidone long-acting injectable in psychotic patients previously treated with olanzapine [^1145NgLB]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2005). Low credibility.

The efficacy and tolerability of risperidone long-acting injectable were investigated in patients with schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders who had previously been symptomatically stable on olanzapine treatment. Patients received risperidone long-acting injectable, 25 mg, via intramuscular injection every 2 weeks; the dose could be increased to 37.5 or 50 mg if necessary. Patients were transferred directly from their previous medication to risperidone long-acting injectable without a run-in period of oral risperidone treatment. Of the 192 patients recruited, 134 (70%) completed the study.

The principal reasons for discontinuation included withdrawal of consent (8%), adverse events (6%), insufficient response (5%), and non-compliance (4%). Risperidone long-acting injectable produced a significant improvement (p = 0.0001) in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores, from 74.2 ± 21.3 at baseline to 65.8 ± 21.4 at endpoint. There were also significant reductions in PANSS subscales, including positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and general psychopharmacology, and Marder factor scores.

The Clinical Global Impression increased significantly from baseline to endpoint (p = 0.0001), as reflected by the increase in the proportion of patients rated as 'not ill' or 'borderline ill', from 10% at baseline to 21% at endpoint. Risperidone long-acting injectable was also associated with significant improvements in the Global Assessment of Function, patient satisfaction with treatment, and quality of life, as measured on the SF-36 scale.

Movement disorders were assessed using the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale (results not provided).

### Choosing an optimal antipsychotic dose for relapse prevention [^113o5CVg]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2022). Low credibility.

What should be done when some patients become unstable or have frequent relapses? Since inappropriate dosing can substantially influence drug efficacy, comparison of drug efficacy should only compare doses in the more efficacious range. The Tiihonen group lists the drug and dose combinations that are most efficacious at preventing relapse in their Table 1. As a crude approximation, we average the mean hazard ratio (HR) of the three most efficacious doses, finding that the drugs which best prevented relapse were the following: olanzapine LAI, clozapine, and risperidone LAI. All the other three LAIs and oral olanzapine had an average HR of 0.40. The other oral drugs had an average HR of 0.67. Since depot drugs are frequently used in patients who have frequent relapses and are suspected of noncompliance, and clozapine is used for treatment-resistant patients, the favorable results observed occur despite the likely bias. These suggest that when a patient seems unstable or has had frequent relapses, the clinician should avoid ultra-high doses and consider switching to an LAI or to a different oral medication such as clozapine.

### Antipsychotic-induced metabolic effects in the female rat: direct comparison between long-acting injections of risperidone and olanzapine [^113ZQUmU]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2015). Low credibility.

Several antipsychotics have well-known adverse metabolic effects. Studies uncovering molecular mechanisms of such drugs in patients are challenging due to high dropout rates, previous use of antipsychotics, and restricted availability of biological samples. Rat experiments, where previously unexposed animals are treated with antipsychotics, allow for direct comparison of different drugs but have been hampered by the short half-life of antipsychotics in rodents. The use of long-acting formulations of antipsychotics could significantly increase the value of rodent models in the molecular characterization of therapeutic and adverse effects of these agents. However, as long-acting formulations have rarely been used in rodents, there is a need to characterize the basic metabolic phenotype of different antipsychotics.

Using long-acting olanzapine injections as a positive control, the metabolic effects of intramuscular long-acting risperidone in female rats were investigated for the first time. Like olanzapine, risperidone induced rapid, significant hyperphagia and weight gain, with a concomitant increase in several plasma lipid species. Both drugs also induced weight-independent upregulation of several genes encoding enzymes involved in lipogenesis, but this activation was not confirmed at the protein level. Our findings shed light on the role of drug administration, drug dose, and nutritional status in the development of rodent models for adverse metabolic effects of antipsychotic agents.

### Assessment of strategies for switching patients from olanzapine to risperidone: A randomized, open-label, rater-blinded study [^1146rjBE]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The incidence of study discontinuation due to adverse events was highest in the gradual 1 group (15% versus 5% in each of the other groups). It is unclear why a lower rate of discontinuation was not observed in the gradual 1 group, with more gradual discontinuation of olanzapine, than in the abrupt group, particularly as this strategy of brief overlap in treatments may be the most commonly used in clinical practice. The incidence of discontinuation due to withdrawal of consent was 0 in the gradual 2 group and 8% and 10% in the abrupt and gradual 1 groups, respectively.

Anxiety/depression and positive and total symptoms were improved when switching these patients from olanzapine to risperidone. The overall findings suggest that all three tested strategies of switching to risperidone would be reasonable approaches in patient care. However, the small group sample sizes make it hard to draw conclusions about individual strategies, especially when a consistent trend is not observed with increasingly gradual discontinuation of prior treatment. Thus, the apparent better efficacy and retention observed in the gradual 2 group is of uncertain significance. Further studies may be necessary to determine whether these apparent subtle differences between switch strategies persist over time and with a larger sample.

Our study was limited by its open-label design, although possible bias was mitigated by the fact that raters were blind to the switch strategy. Phase 1 of the study was also limited by its short duration, such that long-term effects of switching were not assessed. Further studies are warranted to explore these factors.

### Olanzapine - relapse prevention following mania [^112kG4mP]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

This review describes the pharmacological characteristics of olanzapine (ZYPREXA), outlines the European licensed indications, and examines four peer-reviewed, randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trials investigating the efficacy of olanzapine as maintenance therapy in patients with bipolar I disorder. These studies range in duration from 47 to 78 weeks and support the view that olanzapine is an effective and well-tolerated pharmacological therapy for relapse prevention in bipolar disorder. Evidence is presented that olanzapine is effective in preventing relapse following an index manic or a mixed episode with or without psychotic features and in patients with a history of rapid cycling. The safety and tolerability of the medicine are also examined, focusing on weight gain and metabolic issues.

### Olanzapine [^111aTxET]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

If ongoing olanzapine therapy is clinically indicated, oral olanzapine may be initiated in a range of 5 to 20 mg/day as soon as clinically appropriate.

- **Intramuscular dosing in special populations**: A dose of 5 mg/injection should be considered for geriatric patients or when other clinical factors warrant. A lower dose of 2.5 mg/injection should be considered for patients who otherwise might be debilitated, predisposed to hypotensive reactions, or more pharmacodynamically sensitive to olanzapine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Administration of olanzapine for injection**: Olanzapine for injection is intended for intramuscular use only. Do not administer intravenously or subcutaneously. Inject slowly, deep into the muscle mass. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

- **Directions for preparation of olanzapine for injection with sterile water for injection**: Dissolve the contents of the vial using 2.1 mL of sterile water for injection to provide a solution containing approximately 5 mg/mL of olanzapine. The resulting solution should appear clear and yellow. Olanzapine for injection reconstituted with sterile water for injection should be used immediately (within 1 hour) after reconstitution. Discard any unused portion.

### Assessment of strategies for switching patients from olanzapine to risperidone: a randomized, open-label, rater-blinded study [^116PzN6g]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The 6-week, open-label, rater-blinded study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of three strategies for switching patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder from olanzapine to risperidone. The reason for switching treatments in these patients was the lack of an adequate clinical response to olanzapine, a body mass index (BMI) of more than 26 kg/m², or glucose dysregulation.

Patients were randomly assigned to one of three strategies for switching from olanzapine to risperidone: abrupt, gradual 1 (1 week), or gradual 2 (2 weeks), as described below. Dose adjustments were made in an open-label fashion; however, all psychiatric assessments were performed by raters blinded to study group assignment. The trial was conducted in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association).

Patients were recruited at 19 sites in the United States. Participants included men and women aged 18 to 65 years with a DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Both outpatients and stable chronic inpatients could be included. All patients were required to have received a stable dose of olanzapine for at least 30 days before randomization and to have had no acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms within the preceding 3 months.

### Zyprexa intramuscular [^113ymj6Q]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Oral olanzapine should be administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals, generally beginning with 5 to 10 mg initially, with a target dose of 10 mg/day within several days. Further dosage adjustments, if indicated, should generally occur at intervals of not less than one week, as steady state for olanzapine would not be achieved for approximately one week in the typical patient. When dosage adjustments are necessary, dose increments or decrements of 5 mg once daily are recommended.

Efficacy in schizophrenia was demonstrated in a dose range of 10 to 15 mg/day in clinical trials. However, doses above 10 mg/day were not demonstrated to be more efficacious than the 10 mg/day dose. An increase to a dose greater than the target dose of 10 mg/day (i.e. to a dose of 15 mg/day or greater) is recommended only after clinical assessment. Olanzapine is not indicated for use in doses above 20 mg/day.

- **Dosing in special populations**: The recommended starting dose is 5 mg in patients who are debilitated, have a predisposition to hypotensive reactions, otherwise exhibit a combination of factors that may result in slower metabolism of olanzapine (e.g. nonsmoking female patients aged 65 years or older), or who may be more pharmacodynamically sensitive to olanzapine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. When indicated, dose escalation should be performed with caution in these patients.

### Long-acting injectable versus oral antipsychotics for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia: A systematic review and comparative meta-analysis of randomised, cohort, and pre-post studies [^111LgTQt]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

Evidence of the comparative benefits of long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) versus oral antipsychotics for schizophrenia has been inconsistent across study designs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the comparative benefits of LAIs versus oral antipsychotics in three study designs to inform clinical decision-making.

- **Methods**: We conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis comparing LAIs versus oral antipsychotics for schizophrenia, covering three study designs: randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and pre-post studies. Our literature search was without language restrictions and included databases such as MEDLINE, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Embase, for studies published from database inception until the last search on March 13, 2020. We also searched for unpublished studies.

### The expert consensus guideline series. Optimizing pharmacologic treatment of psychotic disorders. Introduction: Methods, commentary, and summary [^1131NKx4]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

A growing number of atypical antipsychotics are available for clinicians to choose from in the treatment of psychotic disorders. However, important questions regarding medication selection, dosing and dose equivalence, and the management of inadequate response, compliance problems, and relapse have not been adequately addressed by clinical trials. To aid clinical decision-making, a consensus survey of expert opinion on the pharmacologic treatment of psychotic disorders was undertaken to address questions not definitively answered in the research literature.

- **Method**: Based on a literature review, a written survey with 60 questions and 994 options was developed. Approximately half of the options were scored using a modified version of the RAND 9-point scale for rating the appropriateness of medical decisions. For the other options, experts were asked to write in answers (e.g. average doses) or check a box to indicate their preferred answer.

The survey was sent to 50 national experts on the pharmacologic treatment of psychotic disorders, 47 (94%) of whom completed it. In analyzing the responses to items rated on the 9-point scale, consensus on each option was defined as a non-random distribution of scores by a chi-square "goodness-of-fit" test. A categorical rank (first line/preferred choice, second line/alternate choice, third line/usually inappropriate) was assigned to each option based on the 95% confidence interval around the mean rating. Guideline tables indicating preferred treatment strategies were developed for key clinical situations.

### The use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in schizophrenia: Evaluating the evidence [^115B6ZsM]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) are among the most effective treatments in psychiatry, yet they remain underutilized in clinical practice. Although LAIs are typically used to maintain treatment adherence in patients with chronic schizophrenia, recent research has suggested that they may also provide an effective treatment strategy for patients with early-phase or first-episode disease. In October 2015, a group of eight experts on the management of schizophrenia and LAIs met to evaluate the evidence surrounding the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of LAIs and to develop practical recommendations regarding the clinical use, education, and unmet needs related to LAIs.

Participants were also asked to rate the importance of several patient characteristics when choosing an LAI versus an oral antipsychotic, from the perspectives of four different stakeholder groups: patients, health care professionals, families, and payers. The evidence review demonstrated that LAIs are superior to placebo for acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia and, in general, appear to be similar to one another in terms of schizophrenia relapse prevention. Study design impacts the demonstrated efficacy of LAIs versus oral antipsychotics, but recent database and randomized controlled studies favor the use of LAIs in early-phase schizophrenia patients.

LAIs vary considerably in their propensity to cause certain adverse effects, including weight gain, metabolic effects, extrapyramidal symptoms, and prolactin elevation, and these differences can be used to help guide LAI selection.

### Towards the development of a longer-acting injectable contraceptive: Past research and current trends [^111nFLbW]. Contraception (2015). Low credibility.

A longer-acting injectable contraceptive that lasts for 6 months would be a valuable addition to the contraceptive method mix and ideal for women who are interested in spacing births and/or uncertain about their future reproductive plans. Here, we review past applications of drug delivery technologies to injectable contraceptives as well as recent advancements in sustained drug delivery technologies that hold promise for the development of a new longer-acting injectable contraceptive product.

- **Study design**: A global landscape analysis was conducted. Promising sustained drug delivery technologies and research opportunities were established with experts in the fields of contraception and drug delivery to identify new approaches in developing a longer-acting injectable contraceptive product.

- **Results**: The landscape analysis confirmed that a number of existing polymer systems, such as poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid and poly(epsilon-caprolactone), remain promising candidates for application to a longer-acting injectable product. Novel polymers and materials also hold promise for achieving longer release profiles and/or having other advantages over existing polymer systems, but products using these materials could potentially have longer roads to regulatory approval. Additionally, recent advancements in the manufacturing process of microspheres may benefit the development of a longer-acting injectable contraceptive.

- **Conclusion**: The design of any new injectable product must take into account the limitations of injectable contraceptives and address these adequately.

### Second-generation antipsychotic long-acting injections in bipolar disorder: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Pi2F1]. Bipolar disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Another difference between the two meta-analyses was the completeness of the search. In addition to the databases searched by Kishi et al. (Medline, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, Clinicaltrials.gov), we also searched LiLACS (to cover literature from Latin America and the Caribbean which may not have been covered elsewhere), EMBASE, and CINAHL (to cover allied health professional literature). Furthermore, we contacted manufacturers of SGA LAIs for further published or unpublished studies, which were lacking in the previous meta-analysis.

Both meta-analyses show that placebo and active control were better than LAI regarding prolactin-related adverse effects. However, the risk ratio of prolactin-related adverse events in this meta-analysis is twice that in Kishi et al. (RR = 5.75 in this meta-analysis vs. 2.66 in Kishi et al.) in active control studies. This is even more interesting as active control studies in Kishi et al. contained a study comparing FGA LAI (namely flupentixol decanoate), which is known to cause more prolactin-related adverse effects than SGA LAIs in general. This difference between the two meta-analyses is likely due to the inclusion of the study by Macfadden et al. into the active control group by Kishi et al.

Another significant difference between the two meta-analyses is in their conclusion. The main conclusion from Kishi et al. was that "Long-acting injectable antipsychotics appear beneficial for relapse prevention in patients with rapid cycling". Although we found a similar result in our subgroup analysis, this was not the main question or the primary focus.

### Clinical application of aripiprazole monohydrate long-acting injectables for the treatment of bipolar type I disorder: A consensus panel report [^111JLPeh]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Bipolar I disorder (BP-I) is a severe and chronic psychiatric condition characterized by episodes of mania and depression that significantly impact quality of life and functioning. Early recurrence, high relapse rates, and poor adherence to daily oral medications complicate long-term management and increase the risk of hospitalization and suicide. Long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) offer a potential solution to these challenges by promoting sustained medication delivery and efficacy, reducing pharmacokinetic variability, and improving treatment adherence. Among available LAIs, aripiprazole is the only partial dopamine D₂ receptor agonist, which may contribute to its favorable tolerability and mood-stabilizing properties.

Despite the robust evidence for the efficacy and tolerability of aripiprazole monohydrate LAIs in patients with BP-I, this agent remains underutilized in this population. Misperceptions about efficacy and tolerability, coupled with systemic and prescriber-level barriers, have limited broader clinical adoption. To address these issues, a round table panel of experts in psychopharmacology, the clinical treatment of bipolar disorder, and antipsychotic prescribing was convened. They evaluated the clinical rationale for earlier use of aripiprazole monohydrate LAIs in BP-I and identified key challenges limiting its use. This article summarizes their consensus on the pharmacological distinctiveness, practical advantages, and potential of aripiprazole monohydrate LAIs in improving long-term outcomes in individuals with BP-I.

### SPL drug information for olanzapine [^1145SA2z]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of olanzapine PO (also known as Zyprexa, Zyprexa Zydis, Zyprexa) in pregnant patients during the first and second trimesters, it should be used only if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. There is evidence of fetal harm in animals. It is recommended to enroll patients in a dedicated pregnancy outcome monitoring registry. Olanzapine PO is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This classification indicates that the drug, due to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, although these effects do not include malformations and may be reversible.

### Are weight gain and metabolic side effects of atypical antipsychotics dose dependent? A literature review [^114cByiF]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Numerous publications have provided evidence for clinically important metabolic adverse effects of antipsychotics, but there is no systematic evaluation as to whether weight gain and other metabolic changes are dose dependent.

- **Objective**: This review of the available literature aimed to explore a possible relationship between the dosage of second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) and the degree of metabolic side effects.

- **Data sources**: A literature review was conducted in three steps:
	1. Articles published between 1975 and 2004 were identified based on the bibliography of an extensive review of the metabolic effects of SGAs.
	2. Articles published between 2004 and 2008 were identified by a PubMed search with the keywords weight gain, metabolic, glucose, insulin, and lipid AND dose combined with amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, and ziprasidone.
	3. A hand search was conducted based on the bibliography of the identified articles.

- **Study selection and data extraction**: All studies that provided information on metabolic side effects in different dose ranges were selected. Data extraction was carried out independently by two observers.

- **Data synthesis**: Preliminary evidence suggests a dose-response relationship between clozapine and olanzapine serum concentrations and metabolic outcomes, although the association between administered daily dose and metabolic outcomes is not clear. Data are controversial with regard to risperidone, and no study has yet assessed risperidone serum concentrations in association with metabolic outcomes.

### Early use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in bipolar disorder type I: An expert consensus [^114hNxb6]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

The requirement for additional resources and infrastructure for LAI use, compared to oral medications, can be a key accessibility barrier. Traditionally, healthcare facilities (i.e. clinics and hospitals) with staff experienced in caring for patients with psychiatric disorders have been required to administer LAIs. Such facilities should exist within manageable distances of the patient and be open at convenient times. Adequate staffing levels are also critical. In regions where these needs are not being met, especially in lower-resourced settings, the likelihood of non-attendance is increased.

While home visits to administer injections may represent an alternative approach, these can also be limited by low staffing levels or other barriers. Pharmacists have increasingly been employed to deliver LAIs, which represents an important advancement in access because pharmacies are among the most ubiquitous and accessible healthcare settings.

The post-COVID-19 healthcare landscape may also be a barrier to clinicians adopting new treatment strategies. The administration of LAIs was suspended in some areas during the COVID-19 pandemic because it was considered an "elective" procedure. The suspension prompted the American Psychiatric Association to issue specific COVID-19 pandemic guidance on the administration of LAIs, encouraging clinics, hospitals, and other medical facilities to include the ongoing use of LAIs for patients with high-risk chronic illness as a necessary procedure, noting that treatment withdrawal…

### Early use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in bipolar disorder type I: An expert consensus [^112AMi1b]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). High credibility.

This consensus discussed the benefits of long-acting injectables (LAIs) in the management of bipolar disorder type I (BP-I), particularly during early disease stages. It identified barriers to overcome while providing potential solutions to aid key stakeholders in making informed treatment decisions. The main consensus recommendations were as follows:

- **Consensus recommendation 1**: It is important to move away from the preconceived notion that LAIs can be used only for patients with the most severe BP-I. Communication of potential early benefits is key to avoid perpetuating stigmatization of patients.

- **Consensus recommendation 2**: If antipsychotic therapy is included in the pharmacologic treatment plan, LAIs should be initiated as early as possible in the disease course, ideally at the first manic episode, to aid in improving long-term outcomes.

- **Consensus recommendation 3**: A collaborative focus on the direct involvement of all stakeholders in the decision-making process should support a more positive patient experience, better care quality, and improved health outcomes (e.g. reduced relapse and hospitalization, and reduced burden on healthcare systems).

- **Consensus recommendation 4**: With careful outcome tracking and a systematic approach to medication changes, logical and strategic combination pharmacotherapy can be designed to minimize unnecessary exposure to redundant, ineffective, or otherwise superfluous psychotropic agents.

- **Consensus recommendation 5**: The generation of additional evidence for the use of LAIs early in the disease course is crucial to further validate this approach and enhance treatment protocols.

### Olanzapine [^112xQ8HL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Adverse reactions associated with discontinuation of treatment in short-term, placebo-controlled trials reveal several insights:

- **Schizophrenia**: Overall, there was no difference in the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions (5% for oral olanzapine vs. 6% for placebo). However, discontinuations due to increases in ALT were considered to be drug-related (2% for oral olanzapine vs. 0% for placebo).

- **Bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) monotherapy**: There was no difference in the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions (2% for oral olanzapine vs. 2% for placebo).

- **Agitation**: Overall, there was no difference in the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions (0.4% for intramuscular olanzapine for injection vs. 0% for placebo).

Additionally, adverse reactions associated with discontinuation of treatment in short-term combination trials highlighted specific findings:

- **Bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes), olanzapine as adjunct to lithium or valproate**: In a study of patients who were already tolerating either lithium or valproate as monotherapy, discontinuation rates due to adverse reactions were 11% for the combination of oral olanzapine with lithium or valproate, compared to 2% for patients who remained on lithium or valproate monotherapy. Discontinuations with the combination of oral olanzapine and lithium or valproate that occurred in more than one patient were somnolence (3%), weight gain (1%), and peripheral edema (1%).

### Efficacy and safety of long-acting risperidone in stable patients with schizoaffective disorder [^113erUjX]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2004). Low credibility.

The treatment of schizoaffective disorder is often complicated by the variety of symptoms that contribute to its pathology. Data from a large study (n = 725), which included schizoaffective patients to assess the effect of long-acting risperidone, are presented.

- **Method**: A multicenter, open-label study enrolled non-acute, clinically stable patients with schizoaffective disorder (n = 110). Patients on a stable dose of antipsychotic for at least 4 weeks at study entry were switched to long-acting risperidone every 2 weeks for 50 weeks.

- **Results**: Mean Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores (± S.E.) improved significantly (p < 0.001) at each measured time point, including endpoint (-9.0 ± 1.6), compared with baseline. Significant reductions were observed on mean PANSS cluster scores for both anxiety/depression (-1.3 ± 0.4, p < 0.001) and uncontrolled hostility/excitement (-0.7 ± 0.3, p < 0.05). In addition, scores improved significantly for positive symptoms (-2.2 ± 0.5, p < 0.001), negative symptoms (-3.1 ± 0.5, p < 0.001), and disorganized thoughts (-1.7 ± 0.4, p < 0.001). The overall subjective score of movement disorders was low at baseline (3.6 ± 4.1) and had significantly decreased at endpoint (2.75; p < 0.05). Patients were previously treated with antipsychotics for 398 ± 790 days before being switched to long-acting risperidone.

- **Limitations**: Although this was a 50-week study, which included over 100 patients with schizoaffective disorder, limitations include the open-label design and that it was not designed specifically to assess patients with this disorder.

### A comprehensive guide to long-acting injectable antipsychotics for primary care clinicians [^111kLs59]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2024). High credibility.

We propose a paper that provides education on commonly used long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) to enhance primary care-based mental health interventions in patients with severe mental illnesses (SMIs) such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorders. With the expanding interface of primary care and psychiatry across all healthcare settings, it has become increasingly important for primary care clinicians to have a broader understanding of common psychiatric treatments, including LAIs.

Long-acting injectable antipsychotics have been shown to significantly improve treatment adherence, prevent disease progression, enhance treatment response, decrease readmission rates, and reduce social impairment.

- **Evidence-based indications and guidelines**: We discuss the evidence-based indications and guidelines for the use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics.

- **Overview of SMI treatment with LAIs**: We provide an overview of the treatment of SMI with LAIs, mainly focusing on the most commonly used long-acting injectable antipsychotics. This includes:
	- **Advantages and disadvantages**: We outline the advantages and disadvantages of each.
	- **Clinical pearls**: Important clinical pearls are provided for ease of practical application.

Equipped with increased familiarity and understanding of these essential therapies, primary care clinicians can better facilitate early engagement with psychiatric care, promote more widespread use, and thus significantly improve the wellbeing and quality of life of patients with severe mental illness.

### Second-generation antipsychotic long-acting injections in bipolar disorder: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^116gd7sA]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Non-adherence is a significant problem in bipolar disorder. Second-generation antipsychotics (SGA) long-acting injections (LAIs) may improve adherence and prevent relapses in bipolar disorder; however, the evidence is limited and conflicting. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SGA LAIs in bipolar disorder.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) lasting six months or longer was conducted to investigate the safety and efficacy of SGA LAIs for bipolar disorder. We searched Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, PsycINFO, and LiLACS up to October 2016, and also contacted the manufacturers of SGA LAIs. The primary efficacy and safety outcomes were relapse rate and all-cause discontinuation, respectively.

A total of seven RCTs (n = 1192) were included. SGA LAIs showed superiority over placebo for study-defined relapse rate (RR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.49–0.68, P < 0.00001) and all-cause discontinuation (RR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.64–0.82, P < 0.00001). However, no significant difference was found between SGA LAIs and oral active control for relapse rate (RR = 0.92, P = 0.79) and all-cause discontinuation (RR = 1.2, P = 0.31).

- **Secondary outcomes**: SGA LAIs performed better than placebo in relapse to mania/hypomania, young mania rating scales (YMRS), clinical global impression-severity (CGI-S), and Montgomery-Åsberg depression rating scale (MADRS). No significant difference was found between SGA LAIs and oral active control regarding relapse to mania/hypomania, YMRS, CGI-S, and extrapyramidal side effects (EPSE).

### Should we be prescribing fluphenazine long-acting injectable formulation [^113an4p7]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Clinicians receiving patients on fluphenazine LAI should be conscious of the data as outlined above, as well as the risks and benefits of switching antipsychotics. Patient education about the available options and shared decision-making will be key to determining whether a change of antipsychotic formulation aligns with the patient's values. Note that even if second-generation antipsychotic medications are not an option due to resource constraints, there is not a clear cost superiority of fluphenazine LAI over haloperidol LAI. In addition, haloperidol LAI can be given at longer intervals, reducing system costs and staff burden. The risk of destabilization when switching medications in a stable patient should be considered as well as discussed with the patient; some patients may prefer to stay with the medication they are familiar with. One study specifically noted that patients whose psychosis had been stabilized with fluphenazine LAI were less likely to be switched to a second-generation antipsychotic than other similar patients. A last consideration is the lack of robust, tested protocols for switching between long-acting injectable formulations; the switching strategy should be guided by balancing the severity of the patient's psychotic episodes with the general side effect burden.

### Optimal doses of specific antipsychotics for relapse prevention in a nationwide cohort of patients with schizophrenia [^114ycFPA]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2022). Low credibility.

The superior outcome for olanzapine LAI was observed at 1.4–1.6 DDDs/day. Sensitivity analysis, stratified on the basis of age, schizoaffective diagnosis, and first-episode status, was well in line with the primary analysis. In the first-episode cohort, the results on high-dose perhenazine (aHR = 6.12, 95% CI = 1.17–32.03), risperidone (aHR = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.46–2.73), and olanzapine LAI (aHR = 0.05, 95% CI = 0.01–0.16) were even more extreme than in the primary analysis.

### Olanzapine [^115zJSeg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of olanzapine for injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is difficult to reliably estimate their frequency or evaluate a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Adverse reactions reported since market introduction that were temporally (but not necessarily causally) related to olanzapine therapy include the following:

- **Allergic reactions**: Reactions such as anaphylactoid reaction, angioedema, pruritus or urticaria.
- **Liver and metabolic issues**: Cholestatic or mixed liver injury, diabetic coma, and diabetic ketoacidosis.
- **Discontinuation reactions**: Symptoms including diaphoresis, nausea, or vomiting.
- **Drug reactions**: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and hepatitis.
- **Other significant reactions**: Jaundice, neutropenia, pancreatitis, priapism, rash, restless legs syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, salivary hypersecretion, venous thromboembolic events (including pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis), fecal incontinence, and somnambulism.
- **Other observations**: Stuttering, which was only studied in oral and long-acting injection (LAI) formulations, and random cholesterol levels of ≥ 240 mg/dL and random triglyceride levels of ≥ 1000 mg/dL have also been reported.

### Risk of withdrawal of consent for treatment with long-acting injectable versus oral antipsychotics: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111pAAV6]. Schizophrenia Research (2021). High credibility.

Despite the clinical importance of antipsychotic long-acting injections (LAIs) in the treatment of schizophrenia, their use may be limited by patients' reluctance to accept the injections. No studies at the time of writing have investigated whether patients are more likely to withdraw their consent to treatment with LAIs than to treatment with oral antipsychotics (OAPs). Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the risk of withdrawal of consent between the two routes of administration.

- **Methods**: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and CINAHL were systematically searched. RCTs with open-label or rater-masked design that compared LAIs with OAPs were selected. Data on study discontinuation due to withdrawal of consent and/or loss to follow-up were extracted.

- **Results**: A total of 16 studies (4815 patients) that met the study eligibility criteria were included in the meta-analysis. There was no significant difference between the LAI and OAP groups in the risk of cessation of treatment because of withdrawal of consent. Similarly, there was no significant difference in the risk of study discontinuation because of withdrawal of consent plus loss to follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: These findings were unexpected and suggest that patients may not be more hesitant to continue LAIs than OAPs after consenting to or receiving treatment. Nevertheless, patients should be provided detailed explanations about the use of LAIs and a support system that encourages them to continue treatment.

### Early use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in bipolar disorder type I: An expert consensus [^112ufPqE]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

For several decades, lithium has been, and remains, the "gold standard" first-line treatment for patients living with BP-I, followed by other oral medications such as olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone orally disintegrating tablet. Despite declining prescription rates during the past decade due to the adverse-event and toxicity burden, lithium is used because of its effectiveness in both BP-I and BP-II, including for the prevention of suicidal behavior. In recent years, long-acting injectables (LAIs) such as aripiprazole and risperidone have emerged as potential maintenance treatment options for patients living with BP-I, including early in the course of the illness. At present, aripiprazole and risperidone are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration; however, the use of LAIs for bipolar disorder is currently off-label in Europe according to European Medicines Agency recommendations. Compared to oral antipsychotics that are shorter acting and must be taken more frequently, LAIs are designed to provide relief of symptoms by slowly releasing the drug over an extended period (weeks to months). Studies in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder suggest that LAIs may provide additional benefits over oral antipsychotics by reducing the rates of re-hospitalization and risk of relapse, improving overall quality of life, and improving adherence to treatment. However, LAIs are not routinely offered to patients living with BP-I, for reasons that will be explored in this expert consensus report.

The main objectives of this article are to highlight the potential benefits of LAIs in the management of BP-I.

### Long-acting risperidone and oral antipsychotics in unstable schizophrenia [^113CHif8]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Long-acting injectable risperidone, a second-generation antipsychotic agent, may improve adherence to treatment and outcomes in schizophrenia, but it has not been tested in a long-term randomized trial involving patients with unstable disease.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned patients in the Veterans Affairs (VA) system who had schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and who had been hospitalized within the previous 2 years or were at imminent risk for hospitalization to receive 25 to 50 mg of long-acting injectable risperidone every two weeks or a psychiatrist's choice of an oral antipsychotic. All patients were followed for up to 2 years. The primary endpoint was hospitalization in a VA or non-VA psychiatric hospital. Symptoms, quality of life, and functioning were assessed in blinded videoconference interviews.

- **Results**: Of 369 participants, 40% were hospitalized at randomization, 55% were hospitalized within the previous 2 years, and 5% were at risk for hospitalization. The rate of hospitalization after randomization was not significantly lower among patients who received long-acting injectable risperidone than among those who received oral antipsychotics (39% after 10.8 months vs. 45% after 11.3 months; hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.63 to 1.20). Psychiatric symptoms, quality of life, scores on the Personal and Social Performance scale of global functioning, and neurologic side effects were not significantly improved with long-acting injectable risperidone compared with control treatments.

### Assessment of strategies for switching patients from olanzapine to risperidone: A randomized, open-label, rater-blinded study [^115fJW7h]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

In clinical practice, physicians often need to change the antipsychotic medications they prescribe to patients due to an inadequate response or the presence of unacceptable or unsafe side effects. However, there is a lack of consensus in the field regarding the optimal switching strategy for antipsychotics, particularly concerning the speed at which the dose of the previous antipsychotic should be reduced. This paper assesses the short-term results of strategies for discontinuing olanzapine when initiating risperidone.

- **Methods**: In a 6-week, randomized, open-label, rater-blinded study, patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, who were on a stable drug dose for more than 30 days at entry and were intolerant of or exhibiting a suboptimal symptom response to more than 30 days of olanzapine treatment, were randomly assigned to the following switch strategies:
	- **Abrupt strategy**: Olanzapine was discontinued at risperidone initiation.
	- **Gradual 1 strategy**: Olanzapine was given at 50% of the entry dose for 1 week after risperidone initiation and then discontinued.
	- **Gradual 2 strategy**: Olanzapine was given at 100% entry dose for 1 week, then at 50% in the second week, and then discontinued.

- **Results**: The study enrolled 123 patients on stable doses of olanzapine. Their mean age was 40.3 years, and the mean (± standard deviation (SD)) baseline Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score was 75.6 ± 11.5. All-cause treatment discontinuation was lowest (12%).

### Zyprexa intramuscular [^114VfUXb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2016). Low credibility.

Oral olanzapine should be administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals, generally beginning with 5 to 10 mg initially, with a target dose of 10 mg/day within several days. Further dosage adjustments, if indicated, should generally occur at intervals of not less than one week, since a steady state for olanzapine would not be achieved for approximately one week in the typical patient. When dosage adjustments are necessary, dose increments or decrements of 5 mg QD are recommended.

Efficacy in schizophrenia was demonstrated in a dose range of 10 to 15 mg/day in clinical trials. However, doses above 10 mg/day were not demonstrated to be more efficacious than the 10 mg/day dose. An increase to a dose greater than the target dose of 10 mg/day (i.e. to a dose of 15 mg/day or greater) is recommended only after clinical assessment. Olanzapine is not indicated for use in doses above 20 mg/day.

The recommended starting dose is 5 mg in patients who are debilitated, who have a predisposition to hypotensive reactions, who otherwise exhibit a combination of factors that may result in slower metabolism of olanzapine (e.g. nonsmoking female patients ≥ 65 years of age), or who may be more pharmacodynamically sensitive to olanzapine. When indicated, dose escalation should be performed with caution in these patients.

### Olanzapine [^113dKtyf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Olanzapine should be used with particular caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (such as a history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions that predispose patients to hypotension. These conditions include dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications, where the occurrence of syncope, hypotension, and/or bradycardia might put the patient at increased medical risk.

Caution is necessary in patients who receive treatment with other drugs that can induce hypotension, bradycardia, or respiratory or central nervous system depression. Concomitant administration of intramuscular olanzapine and parenteral benzodiazepine is not recommended due to the potential for excessive sedation and cardiorespiratory depression.

- **Falls**: Olanzapine may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, and motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for those on long-term antipsychotic therapy.

- **Leukopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis**:

	- **Class effect**: In clinical trial and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia have been reported that are temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including olanzapine for injection. Agranulocytosis has also been reported.

### Early use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in bipolar disorder type I: An expert consensus [^116Z9sec]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). High credibility.

Four-year prospective data from the Systematic Treatment Optimization Program have shown that best practices — such as safe and effective maintenance treatment regimens, psychoeducation, cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, family-focused therapy, and peer-support and stress-management programs — in the treatment of first-episode mania in patients living with bipolar disorder type I (BP-I) resulted in remission and recovery. Additionally, while recurrence was common, minimizing recurrence within the first year through risk-factor modification (e.g. reducing anxiety, stress, and comorbid alcohol/substance abuse) may alter the course of the disease. Therefore, timely intervention with long-acting injectables (LAIs) represents a critical opportunity for healthcare professionals (HCPs) to engage in shared decision-making with the patient and their supporters, helping them make informed decisions about treatments and setting the wheels in motion for positive long-term outcomes, including the prevention of key disease concerns such as relapse.

LAIs have shown better efficacy in preventing mania than depression in patients living with bipolar disorder; therefore, LAIs may be a useful first-line treatment for patients with a manic predominant polarity but should probably not be recommended to patients who have a depressive predominant polarity. Given that many patients living with bipolar disorder have a clear tendency toward one pole or another, there is a need for longitudinal course specifiers to help HCPs better understand the course of the disorder.

### Use and discontinuation rates of long-acting injectable antipsychotics between race/ethnicity in older adults using Medicaid databases [^116YaVLh]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Low credibility.

Several factors can impact adherence in chronic disorders. Specifically, a lack of health insurance, cost of treatment, polypharmacy, multiple comorbidities, and functional decline may influence adherence among older adults. In addition, disease severity and progression can potentially play a significant role in treatment adherence. Non-adherence can result in lower efficacy and can lead to various complications, including greater healthcare costs, relapse, and rehospitalization. For example, a study assessing medication adherence in patients (50–75 years of age) with severe mental illness found nonadherence was associated with lack of medication supervision, decreased community functioning, negative attitudes toward medication, and decreased medication management. A systematic review stated an increased risk of relapse, hospitalizations, and suicide as a result of poor medication adherence in patients with schizophrenia. Overall, the studies concluded novel methods are needed to improve medication adherence in mental health.

Long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics were created to potentially address non-adherence in patients with schizophrenia. Historically, LAI antipsychotics traditionally consisted of two LAI first-generation antipsychotics (i.e. fluphenazine decanoate and haloperidol decanoate). After a few decades, LAI second-generation antipsychotics have become available. These agents range in formulation type (e.g. aripiprazole lauroxil vs. aripiprazole monohydrate), time between injections (e.g. 2 vs. 4 weeks), side effect profile, initiation (e.g. need for or…

Regarding the medical management for schizophrenia, particularly in relation to long-acting injectable antipsychotics, the WHO 2023 guidelines recommend considering offering a long-acting injectable antipsychotic, such as fluphenazine, haloperidol, paliperidone, risperidone, or zuclopenthixol. These are suggested as alternatives to oral antipsychotics for adult patients with psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia, who require long-term treatment. It is crucial to carefully balance the effectiveness, side effects, and individual preference when making this decision.

### SPL drug information for olanzapine [^115z5xUx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

For the use of olanzapine PO (also known as Zyprexa, Zyprexa Zydis, Zyprexa) in pregnant patients during the third trimester, it should be administered only if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. There is evidence of fetal harm in humans. Patients should be enrolled in a dedicated pregnancy outcome monitoring registry. Neonates should be monitored for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms. Olanzapine PO, classified under category C in the Australian categorization system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy, due to its pharmacological effects, has caused or is suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate. These effects may occur without causing malformations and may be reversible.

### Identifying profiles of patients with bipolar I disorder who would benefit from maintenance therapy with a long-acting injectable antipsychotic [^113v2DRg]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

People with bipolar I disorder experience an illness course marked by potentially disastrous manic episodes, disabling depressive episodes, and functional impairment. A frequent obstacle to wellness in these individuals is nonadherence to treatment. Long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics have the potential to address nonadherence and thereby increase patients' chances at sustained recovery and normal psychosocial functioning. LAI formulations of two second-generation antipsychotics — aripiprazole monohydrate and risperidone — have received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder in adult patients.

In a recent roundtable meeting, a panel of four experts discussed the use of these medications in bipolar I disorder. This Academic Highlights summarizes their discussion, which included the impact of functional impairment, the potential benefits of employing an LAI antipsychotic at earlier stages of bipolar illness, and the characteristics of patients who may be good candidates for treatment with an LAI antipsychotic.

### Second-generation antipsychotic long-acting injections in bipolar disorder: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^1173rAPu]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

The following search strategy was employed to ensure all relevant studies assessing SGA LAIs in bipolar disorder were captured. Data were independently extracted, analyzed, verified, and quality assessed. PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, LiLACS, and others were searched for studies published between January 2000 and October 2016 since SGA LAIs only came to the market after 2000. There were no language restrictions. Any relevant studies mentioned in those identified studies were searched manually by scoping the listed references. Manufacturers of SGA LAIs were contacted for any ongoing or unpublished studies. The initial search was carried out in April 2016 and rerun in October 2016, which resulted in 30 more studies being identified.

The search strategy consisted of the following three domains:

- **Disease**: Bipolar*, mood disorder*, mania*, manic‐depression*, hypomania*
- **Treatment**: Antipsychotic*, neuroleptic*, psychotropic*, atypical*, second generation antipsychotic*, SGA*, aripiprazole, olanzapine, paliperidone, risperidone
- **Formulation**: Depot*, long‐acting inject*, LAI*, prolonged release inject*, sustained release inject*

The process of identifying, screening of studies, and inclusion or exclusion of those studies is shown in the PRISMA flow diagram below (see Figure 1).

2.3 Screening, data extraction, and analysis

ARP screened titles of all retrieved studies. During title screening, we excluded only definitely non-relevant studies.

### Association between discontinuation due to withdrawal of consent and use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics: A meta-analysis of randomized trials for schizophrenia [^113iDbbk]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2021). Low credibility.

We investigated the association between discontinuation due to withdrawal of consent (DWC) in schizophrenia trials and the use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAI-APs). In two categorical meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials, we compared DWC: individual and pooled LAI-APs vs. (1) placebo and (2) oral antipsychotics (OAPs). We also conducted a single-group meta-analysis to calculate the average DWC and a meta-regression analysis to examine the association between the results of the meta-analyses and factors related to study design, treatment, and patients.

We identified 52 studies (total adult patients = 18,675, LAI-APs = 12,613, placebo = 2,083, and OAPs = 3,979; median study duration = 32 weeks). DWC was higher for LAI-aripiprazole than for the placebo [risk ratio (95% confidence interval) = 1.70 (1.23–2.39)]. Neither pooled nor individual LAI-APs differed from the placebo for fluphenazine, olanzapine, paliperidone, and risperidone, or from the OAPs for aripiprazole, fluphenazine, haloperidol, olanzapine, paliperidone, risperidone, and zuclopenthixol.

The average DWC of each LAI-AP was as follows: LAI-aripiprazole = 10.98%, LAI-fluphenazine = 7.65%, LAI-flupenthixol = 3.33%, LAI-haloperidol = 6.71%, LAI-olanzapine = 10.50%, LAI-paliperidone = 10.38%, LAI-perphenazine = 7.06%, LAI-risperidone = 10.39%, LAI-zuclopenthixol = 4.45%, pooled LAI-APs = 9.88%, and placebo = 11.17%.

Meta-regression analysis demonstrated that publication year (β = 0.02), percentage of males (β = 0.02), and mean age (β = 0.05) were associated with an average DWC for pooled.

### Comparative effectiveness of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia in Japan [^1166QaBQ]. Schizophrenia Research (2023). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of different long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) including aripiprazole, paliperidone, risperidone, and fluphenazine/haloperidol in patients with schizophrenia in Japan.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using two administrative claims databases. The study population included outpatients with schizophrenia who initiated LAIs between May 1, 2015, and November 30, 2019. We directly compared the risk of psychiatric hospitalization and LAI discontinuation among the LAIs based on hazard ratios (HRs) using Cox proportional hazards regression models.

- **Results**: The numbers of eligible patients who initiated aripiprazole, paliperidone, risperidone, and fluphenazine/haloperidol were 303, 124, 73, and 123, respectively. Regarding psychiatric hospitalization, aripiprazole and paliperidone were associated with a significantly lower risk compared to fluphenazine/haloperidol (HR of aripiprazole: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.28–0.78; HR of paliperidone: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.28–0.89); HR of risperidone showed the same trend as aripiprazole and paliperidone. Regarding LAI discontinuation, aripiprazole and paliperidone were associated with a significantly lower risk of LAI discontinuation compared to fluphenazine/haloperidol (HR of aripiprazole: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.35–0.80; HR of paliperidone: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.35–0.92). Aripiprazole was also associated with a significantly lower risk compared to risperidone (HR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.32–0.98).

Our study suggests that aripiprazole and paliperidone are superior to fluphenazine/haloperidol in reducing the risk of psychiatric hospitalization and LAI discontinuation among patients with schizophrenia in Japan.

### Mortality risk associated with long-acting injectable antipsychotics: A systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials [^116XXR5D]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2016). High credibility.

Long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics (LAI-APs) offer several advantages over oral medications, yet deaths reported in Japan during the early post-marketing phase vigilance period have raised safety concerns. We conducted a series of meta-analyses to assess whether LAI-APs affect the mortality of patients with schizophrenia. Three categorical meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were performed to compare all-cause death (primary outcome) and death due to suicide:

- **Individual and pooled LAI-APs vs. placebo**: The risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. In a subgroup meta-analysis of only short-duration RCTs (≤ 13 weeks), pooled LAI-APs exhibited a trend toward lower incidence of all-cause death than placebo (RR = 0.29, P = 0.08). Neither pooled nor individual LAI-APs (aripiprazole, fluphenazine, olanzapine, paliperidone, and risperidone) differed from the placebo regarding the incidences of all-cause death (pooled LAI-APs: RR = 0.64, P = 0.37) and death due to suicide (pooled LAI-APs: RR = 0.98, P = 0.98).

- **Individual and pooled LAI-APs vs. oral antipsychotics (OAPs)**: Pooled LAI-APs (aripiprazole, fluphenazine, haloperidol, olanzapine, paliperidone, risperidone, and zuclopenthixol) did not differ from pooled OAPs concerning all-cause death (pooled LAI-APs: RR = 0.71, P = 0.30) and death due to suicide.

- **Head-to-head comparisons of LAI-APs**: 52 RCTs (53 comparisons; total participants = 17,416, LAI-APs = 11,360, OAP = 3,910, and placebo = 2,146) were identified. The mean study duration was 28.9 weeks for LAI-APs vs. placebo and 64.5 weeks for LAI-APs vs. OAPs.

In summary, the analysis found no significant difference in mortality risk between LAI-APs and both placebo and oral antipsychotics in terms of all-cause death and death due to suicide.

### Association of antipsychotic formulations with sudden cardiac death in patients with schizophrenia: A nationwide population-based case-control study [^112B8YEf]. Psychiatry Research (2024). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to clarify the association between various antipsychotic formulations — oral daily antipsychotics (OAPs), long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs), and their combination — and the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). We conducted a nationwide population-based case-control study using data from 2011 to 2020 from the National Health Insurance Research Database and multiple-cause-of-death data from Taiwan. The study included patients with a new diagnosis of schizophrenia who were followed for SCD occurrence until 2020. Cases and controls were frequency-matched at a 1:4 ratio by age, sex, and year of new schizophrenia diagnosis.

Compared with the use of OAP monotherapy, the use of LAI and OAP combination (OR = 1.91) and LAI monotherapy (OR = 1.45) were associated with an increased risk of SCD. Additionally, cardiovascular comorbidities (adjusted OR = 11.15) were identified as a significant risk factor for SCD. This study revealed the following hierarchy of SCD risk associated with antipsychotic formulations (listed from lowest to highest risk): nonuse of antipsychotics, OAP monotherapy, LAI monotherapy, and their combination. These findings underscore the importance of assessing cardiovascular disease history before LAIs are prescribed to patients with schizophrenia and indicate that physicians should avoid prescribing combined antipsychotics when using LAIs.

### Long-acting injectable second-generation antipsychotics vs placebo and their oral formulations in acute schizophrenia: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled-trials [^1145vPWj]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2024). High credibility.

Long-acting injectable antipsychotic drugs (LAIs) are mainly used for relapse prevention but could also be advantageous for acutely ill patients with schizophrenia.

- **Study design**: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled-trials (RCTs) comparing the second-generation long-acting injectable antipsychotics (SGA-LAIs) olanzapine, risperidone, paliperidone, and aripiprazole with placebo or their oral counterparts in acutely ill patients with schizophrenia. We analyzed 23 efficacy and tolerability outcomes, with the primary outcome being overall symptoms of schizophrenia. The results were obtained through random effects, pairwise meta-analyses, and subgroup tests. The study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool version 1.

- **Study results**: Sixty-six studies with 16,457 participants were included in the analysis. Eleven studies compared second-generation long-acting injectable antipsychotics (SGA-LAIs) with a placebo, 54 compared second-generation oral antipsychotics (SGA-orals) with a placebo, and one compared an SGA-LAI (aripiprazole) with its oral formulation. All four SGA-LAIs reduced overall symptoms more than placebo, with mean standardized differences of -0.66 (95% CI: -0.90; -0.43) for olanzapine, -0.64 (-0.80; -0.48) for aripiprazole, -0.62 (-0.76; -0.48) for risperidone, and -0.42 (-0.53; -0.31) for paliperidone. The side-effect profiles of the LAIs corresponded to the patterns known from the oral formulations. In subgroup tests compared to placebo, some side effects were less pronounced under LAIs.
