## Question

What kind of gastritis can be caused by a severe burn

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what kind of gastritis can be caused by a severe burn. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the question refers to thermal injury versus caustic ingestion. Then, I should verify the classic eponym and pathophysiology for burn-associated gastric injury. Next, I will review the characteristic endoscopic and histologic features and the time course. After that, I should consider risk factors and severity thresholds. Finally, I will synthesize the terminology and briefly note management implications to ensure the answer is clinically complete and reference-aligned.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Wait, let me verify that we are not conflating thermal burns with caustic ingestion, because both can injure the stomach but have different mechanisms and nomenclature. The question specifies a severe burn, which in clinical usage typically means thermal injury to skin and soft tissues rather than chemical ingestion, so I should focus on thermal burn–associated gastric injury rather than corrosive gastritis from acids or alkalis, which is a different entity with different management pathways [^116SoZQR] [^111nS4Q2].

> I will now examine the classic eponym. Hold on, I should verify the correct term. The gastric injury associated with severe thermal burns is classically termed Curling ulcer or Curling's ulcer, historically described as acute duodenal ulceration after burns, but often encompassing diffuse erosive gastritis and duodenitis in the same pathophysiologic spectrum of stress-related mucosal disease in critically ill burn patients [^116SoZQR] [^1169tto5].

> Next, I should review the pathophysiology. Let me think about the hemodynamic and inflammatory mechanisms. Severe burns trigger a systemic stress response with distributive shock, catecholamine surge, mesenteric vasoconstriction, and splanchnic hypoperfusion, leading to ischemia–reperfusion injury of the gastroduodenal mucosa; this ischemic mechanism, rather than acid hypersecretion, is the principal driver of stress-related mucosal disease in burns, with impaired mucosal defenses compounding injury [^1145jTRB] [^111t9eu7] [^111ELRti].

> I need to check the characteristic endoscopic and histologic features. Endoscopically, this manifests as diffuse superficial erosions and hemorrhagic gastritis with mucosal friability, often involving the stomach and duodenum, consistent with stress-related mucosal disease; histologically, there is epithelial injury, hemorrhage, and acute inflammatory infiltrate without the chronicity or specific infectious features seen in H. pylori gastritis, aligning with an acute erosive/hemorrhagic gastropathy pattern rather than chronic gastritis [^116SoZQR] [^1158cJVG] [^112Sxdzg].

> Let me consider the time course and severity thresholds. I should double-check how quickly these lesions appear after burn injury. Erosive changes can occur within 12 hours of severe burns, and clinically significant duodenal ulceration and bleeding are most consistently observed in patients with burns exceeding roughly 35–38% total body surface area, reinforcing that the risk scales with burn severity and systemic physiologic derangement [^116SoZQR] [^112sMz11].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about terminology. I initially thought to call this simply "stress gastritis", but I should confirm the preferred nomenclature in the burn context. The eponym Curling ulcer/Curling's ulcer remains the most specific and historically accurate label for burn-associated gastroduodenal injury, while "stress-related mucosal disease" or "acute erosive/hemorrhagic gastritis" accurately describe the pathologic pattern; importantly, this is distinct from H. pylori–associated chronic gastritis and from caustic (corrosive) gastritis due to chemical ingestion, which has different mechanisms and management [^116SoZQR] [^1169tto5] [^111aJCbW] [^111nS4Q2].

> I should confirm risk modifiers and associated factors. Let me verify whether coexisting critical illness features amplify risk. Shock, vasopressor use, coagulopathy, and large burn size further increase the likelihood of stress ulceration and bleeding, whereas early enteral nutrition appears protective by improving splanchnic perfusion and mucosal integrity, which is particularly relevant in burn care protocols [^114wLaMT] [^112czymZ].

> But wait, what if the question is being asked in the context of prophylaxis decisions. I need to ensure I briefly note management implications without overextending. Severe burns are a recognized indication for stress ulcer prophylaxis in the ICU, with acid suppression commonly used, though contemporary practice emphasizes risk stratification and de-escalation when risk abates; enteral nutrition, when feasible, supports mucosal protection and may reduce bleeding risk in this population [^112sMz11] [^112czymZ] [^111xaey7].

> In summary, I should confirm the final terminology. The gastritis caused by a severe burn is best termed Curling ulcer or Curling's ulcer, reflecting acute stress-related mucosal injury with diffuse erosive/hemorrhagic gastritis and often duodenal involvement, driven by splanchnic ischemia–reperfusion and systemic stress physiology in major thermal injury [^116SoZQR] [^1169tto5] [^1145jTRB].

---

Severe burns cause **stress-related mucosal disease (SRMD)** [^112sMz11], also known as Curling's ulcer or acute erosive/hemorrhagic gastritis [^1169tto5]. This is a diffuse, superficial mucosal injury driven by splanchnic hypoperfusion, ischemia-reperfusion, and systemic inflammatory cytokines [^111t9eu7], with **risk rising with burns > 35% TBSA** [^112sMz11], shock, sepsis, and coagulopathy [^114wLaMT]. Clinically, it presents with upper GI bleeding, hematemesis, melena, and abdominal pain; endoscopy shows multiple shallow erosions and hemorrhagic gastritis [^112Sxdzg]. Management centers on aggressive resuscitation, early enteral nutrition [^112czymZ], and acid suppression with PPIs or H2RAs [^115jE4uY]; complications include bleeding, perforation, and strictures [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiology

The pathophysiology of stress-related gastritis in severe burns is multifactorial, involving **splanchnic hypoperfusion**, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and systemic inflammatory response:

- **Splanchnic hypoperfusion**: Severe burns trigger a hypermetabolic state with increased sympathetic activity, causing vasoconstriction and reduced gastric mucosal blood flow, leading to ischemia and mucosal injury [^111ELRti].

- **Ischemia-reperfusion injury**: Restoration of blood flow generates reactive oxygen species, causing oxidative stress and further mucosal damage [^111ELRti].

- **Systemic inflammatory response**: Cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6) and other mediators increase mucosal permeability and promote erosion and ulceration [^1161TTKi].

---

## Clinical features

Stress-related gastritis in severe burns typically presents with the following **clinical features**:

- **Upper gastrointestinal bleeding**: Hematemesis (vomiting blood) and melena (black, tarry stools) are common manifestations [^notfound].

- **Abdominal pain**: Patients may experience epigastric discomfort or pain due to mucosal injury [^notfound].

- **Asymptomatic course**: In some cases, stress gastritis may be asymptomatic and detected only during endoscopic evaluation [^notfound].

---

## Endoscopic findings

Endoscopy is the **gold standard** for diagnosing stress-related gastritis. Typical endoscopic findings include:

- **Multiple shallow erosions**: Superficial mucosal lesions scattered throughout the stomach, particularly in the antrum and body [^112Sxdzg].

- **Hemorrhagic gastritis**: Diffuse mucosal bleeding, petechiae, and ecchymoses [^notfound].

- **Absence of discrete ulcers**: Unlike peptic ulcer disease, stress gastritis typically lacks well-defined, deep ulcers [^112Sxdzg].

---

## Risk factors

Several factors increase the risk of stress-related gastritis in severe burns:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Burn size | Larger burns (> 35% total body surface area) significantly increase risk [^112sMz11] |
| Shock and hypoperfusion | Hemodynamic instability and shock exacerbate mucosal ischemia [^114wLaMT] |
| Sepsis | Systemic infection increases mucosal injury risk [^112sMz11] |
| Coagulopathy | Impaired clotting mechanisms increase bleeding risk [^114wLaMT] |
| Mechanical ventilation | Prolonged ventilation is associated with increased risk [^111xaey7] |

---

## Management strategies

Effective management of stress-related gastritis in severe burns requires a **multidisciplinary approach**:

- **Aggressive fluid resuscitation**: Early and adequate fluid resuscitation to restore mucosal blood flow and prevent ischemic injury [^112dAzZS].

- **Early enteral nutrition**: Initiating enteral feeding within 24–48 hours post-burn improves mucosal blood flow and reduces the risk of stress gastritis [^115jE4uY].

- **Acid suppression therapy**: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) are recommended to reduce gastric acid secretion and prevent further mucosal injury [^1142tGa3].

- **Endoscopic intervention**: In cases of active bleeding, endoscopic hemostasis techniques such as epinephrine injection, bipolar electrocoagulation, or clips may be required [^notfound].

---

## Complications

If left untreated or inadequately managed, stress-related gastritis in severe burns can lead to **significant complications**:

- **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: Can result in anemia, hemodynamic instability, and shock [^111ELRti].

- **Perforation**: Rare but life-threatening complication requiring surgical intervention [^112Sxdzg].

- **Strictures**: Chronic mucosal injury may lead to gastric outlet obstruction due to stricture formation [^113oAaD4].

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis of stress-related gastritis in severe burns depends on burn severity, promptness of management, and presence of complications. With **early detection and appropriate management**, the prognosis is generally favorable. However, delayed recognition or inadequate treatment can lead to significant morbidity and mortality [^112sMz11].

---

Severe burns can cause **stress-related mucosal disease (SRMD)**, also known as Curling's ulcer or acute erosive/hemorrhagic gastritis. This condition results from **splanchnic hypoperfusion**, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and systemic inflammatory response. Early recognition, aggressive resuscitation, early enteral nutrition, and **acid suppression therapy** are essential to prevent complications and improve outcomes [^116SoZQR] [^1169tto5] [^111ELRti] [^112dAzZS] [^111nSBxe].

Bleeding from superficial gastric erosions was described for the first time in 1898 by Dieulafoy. 1 Since then, our understanding of this condition has increased but little. One of the confusing aspects of this condition is that of semantics. This phenomenon has been variously called "acute erosive gastritis, " "acute hemorrhagic gastritis, " "Curling's ulcer, " "Cushing's ulcer, " "acute peptic ulcer, " and "stress ulcer". Moreover, because there usually is a break in the continuity of the mucosa, often it is labeled "gastric ulcer, bleeding. " Also, physicians tend to attribute radiologically negative gastrointestinal bleeding to "peptic ulceration. " As a result, the incidence of this condition is not well known. For instance, in 1964 Sullivan et al2 wrote that hemorrhagic gastritis is ". relatively uncommon as a cause of major gastrointestinal bleeding.

Gastritis, although a common diagnosis used by clinicians and pathologists in most parts of the world, is not well understood, especially its pathophysiology. Two major forms are recognized. 1 Type A gastritis, which involves the fundus, is associated with pernicious anemia, antibodies to parietal cells, and autoimmune conditions of other organs. Type B gastritis, which is much more common, appears to mainly affect the antrum, autoimmune phenomena are absent, and it has been considered idiopathic. Patients with peptic ulcer disease almost invariably also have type B gastritis, but the relationship of these two entities has not been satisfactorily resolved. 2, 3. See also p

Omeprazole can have other serious side effects. See "What are the possible side effects of omeprazole delayed-release capsules?"

What are omeprazole delayed-release capsules?

Omeprazole delayed-release capsules is a prescription medicine called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Omeprazole delayed-release capsules reduces the amount of acid in your stomach. Omeprazole delayed-release capsules are used in adults:

for up to 8 weeks for the healing of duodenal ulcers. The duodenal area is the area where food passes when it leaves the stomach.

with certain antibiotics to treat an infection caused by bacteria called H. pylori. Sometimes H. pylori bacteria can cause duodenal ulcers. The infection needs to be treated to prevent the ulcers from coming back.

for up to 8 weeks for healing stomach ulcers.

for up to 4 weeks to treat heartburn and other symptoms that happen with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

GERD happens when acid in your stomach backs up into the tube (esophagus) that connects your mouth to your stomach. This may cause a burning feeling in your chest or throat, sour taste, or burping.

for up to 8 weeks to heal acid-related damage to the lining of the esophagus (called erosive esophagitis or EE). If needed, your doctor may decide to prescribe another 4 weeks of omeprazole delayed-release capsules.

### Collagenous gastritis: clinical features, histologic correlates and unanswered questions [^116ZkSeX]. Histopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Collagenous gastritis (CG) is a rare disorder characterized by prominent subepithelial collagen deposition, usually exceeding 10 μm, in association with inflammatory changes in the gastric mucosa. It was first described in 1989, and its prevalence is estimated to be 13 per 100,000 upper gastrointestinal endoscopies.CG is considered part of the broader spectrum of collagenous gastroenteropathies, which includes conditions like collagenous sprue and collagenous colitis. The literature typically categorizes CG into paediatric and adult forms based on the age of presentation. Despite its initial description over four decades ago, the pathogenesis of CG remains incompletely understood. Standardized pathological criteria, classification systems and evidence‐based treatment guidelines are lacking, and the overall prognosis remains uncertain. This comprehensive review aims to provide a clearer understanding of CG by synthesizing the available clinical and pathological data, while also highlighting the existing knowledge gaps in the literature.

### Treatment outcomes of burn injury and its associated factor among children in sub-saharan Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Gvkad]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A burn is defined as any injury to the skin or other tissue. It happens when some or all of the cells in the skin or other tissues are damaged by hot liquids (scalds), hot solids (contact burns), flames (flame burns), radiation, radioactivity, electricity, friction, or chemical interaction.

Superficial partial-thickness burns: These burns form blisters within 24 h between the epidermis and dermis. They are painful, red, weepy, and blanch with pressure. Deep partial-thickness burns: These burns extend into the deeper dermis, damaging hair follicles and glandular tissue. Full-thickness burns: These burns destroy all dermal layers and often injure the underlying subcutaneous tissue. The burn eschar, made up of dead and denatured dermis, usually remains intact. Fourth-degree burns: These severe burns extend through the skin into the underlying soft tissue, potentially involving muscle and/or bone, and are life-threatening.

Burns are a prominent cause of unintentional injury, mortality, and disability. In addition to being a personal disaster for the victim, severe burns are a medical concern and financial burden on national health systems.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), burn injuries cause around 300,000 deaths each year. These injuries were classified as the second leading cause of accidental death among African children under the age of five. Burn-related injuries kill an estimated 18,000 to 30,000 children under the age of 18 in Sub-Saharan Africa each year.

In addition to causing significant mortality, millions of non-fatal cases frequently result in permanent impairments and disfigurements.

Children's burns have significant differences compared to those of adults, which can lead to more severe and even fatal consequences. These injuries can result in acute life-threatening complications such as fluid loss, airway blockage, renal failure, and superinfection, as well as chronic complications like severe disfigurement, disability, and psychological trauma. In addition, burns account for the longest length of stay (LOS) of any pediatric hospital admission injury. Treating pediatric burns is a demanding and difficult process that can be exceedingly expensive, even in well-equipped and sophisticated burn centers.

### Gastrointestinal insufficiency is a risk factor for severely burned patients: a case-control study among 185 victims in kunshan explosion [^1161TTKi]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

On August 2nd, 2014, a large-scaled explosion accident of aluminum dust occurred in Kunshan factory, Jiangsu Province, China (hereinafter referred as Kunshan explosion), which brought about massive casualties including 185 burn patients. In response to the very patients from Kunshan explosion, medical staff had conducted a long period of follow-up visit for each burn patient. In previous studies, researchers had concluded the multi-disciplinary medical and nursing management for those severe burn patients, and correspondingly analyzed several prognosis-related factors, such as serum procalcitonin. There's a lack of systemic analysis towards the reasons for burn patients' death in post-explosion follow-up visits. Although some research demonstrated the potential cause of death like weakened immunomodulation and lowered platelet concentration, the comprehensive correlations between burn patients' clinical characteristics haven't been illustrated. Thus, more specific lethal clinical characteristics should be revealed in burn patients, and the interaction network of these lethal clinical characteristics should be further explored.

Burn injuries were a prevalent form of trauma, for which approximately 6 million individuals worldwide sought medical care annually. Gastrointestinal (GI) insufficiency, as one of the most hazardous burn injuries, referred to a syndrome of GI tract disorders in general, which mainly led to the dysfunction of food digestion and absorption of nutrients, water, electrocytes etc. In the case of the severe burn, patients failed to maintain the integrity of GI barrier, namely the loss of the tight junction between the epithelial cells at a micro-level, induced by ischemia, stress, proinflammatory cytokines and endotoxin. A 10-year retrospective observational study showed GI insufficiency was discovered in 45.4% severe-burn patients, which also accounted for 88.2% of deceased patients within 90 days. However, few studies were conducted with a large scale to elucidate the impact of GI insufficiency upon burn patients' survival from the cohort of Kunshan explosion. Even the conventional evaluation tool for post-burn patients, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), didn't take GI insufficiency into consideration. Additionally, it remained unclear that how GI insufficiency interacted with other clinical characteristics in burn patients. And the hypothesis was proposed that GI insufficiency functioned as a risk factor for severely burned patients.

### Gastrointestinal insufficiency is a risk factor for severely burned patients: a case-control study among 185 victims in kunshan explosion [^113sYpfX]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Next, we will discuss the result of subgroup analysis and uncover the association between other clinical characteristics and GI insufficiency (Fig. 5). GI bleeding and organ dysfunction were both regarded as patient's sign during hospitalization. Although the criterion to assess GI insufficiency seemed controversial, doctors had summarized a few items: abdominal distension, stress ulcer, alteration of intestinal microbiota and enteric infection. Stress ulcer was literally one of GI bleeding due to erosive gastric mucosa. Therefore, GI bleeding was expected to be an index to make a judgement of burn patients' GI insufficiency, and the volume of blood loss would reflect patients' burning severity and prognosis. Interestingly, our study also demonstrated the result that none of severely burned patients without GI insufficiency had the sign of GI bleeding. Meanwhile, amounts of research had discovered multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) occurred in burn patients frequently, which exerted crucial impact upon patients' duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay and survival. That's because in burn injuries of one organ, remaining organ systems would be affected by bioactive substances, like catecholamine, cortisol, glucagon, and cytokines. Researchers found there was an association between intestinal damage following severe burn and the development of MODS. However, traditional evaluation of MODS, SOFA doesn't contain GI function sub-score. Fortunately, recent research proposed a gastroenterology dysfunction score (GIDS) additive to SOFA to predict patients' mortality, in which biomarkers like l-citrulline and intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) demonstrated to be predictors for GI function. Although l-citrulline and I-FABP were found to correlate with the diseases like short bowel syndrome or necrotizing enterocolitis, they were still not clinically applied for GI examination in China. At the same time, GIDS provided an insight into the contribution of GI insufficiency to MODS. In response to the theories above, doctors had proposed multiple essential strategies to lower burn patients' mortality, especially for those with GI insufficiency, which were comprehensive fluid resuscitation, staged food ingestion and selective GI decontamination.

### Attenuation of internal organ damages by exogenously administered epidermal growth factor (EGF) in burned rodents [^117299Ew]. Burns (2002). Low credibility.

Major burns are associated with multiple internal organ damages, including necrosis of the gastrointestinal mucosa. Failure of the intestinal barrier is a serious complication in burned patients. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a mitogenic polypeptide that stimulates wound repair and affords protection to the gastric mucosa. We examined whether a single systemic intervention with EGF prevents organ systems damages, following full-thickness scalds (25–30%) in rodents. Animals were randomly assigned to receive an intraperitoneal injection of EGF (30 microg/kg in mice, 10 microg/kg in rats) or saline solution, 30 min prior thermal injury in mice or after the cutaneous injury in rats. General clinical condition and mortality during 24h were recorded. Animals were autopsied and histopathological and histomorphometric studies were conducted. Mice treated with EGF exhibited a milder clinical evolution and acute lethality was significantly reduced as compared to saline counterparts (P < 0.01). Histopathological and morphometric analysis showed that EGF significantly reduced intestinal necrosis and contributed to preserve jejunoileal architecture in mice (P < 0.05) and rats (P < 0.01). The onset of renal hemorrhagic foci was significantly reduced in EGF-treated groups (P < 0.01). Lung damages appeared attenuated in EGF-treated animals. These data indicate the salutary effects of EGF by attenuating internal complications associated to thermal injuries. Further studies are warranted to fully elucidate the usefulness of this therapy.

### Stress ulcer prophylaxis in intensive care unit patients receiving enteral nutrition: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112dAzZS]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Over the past decades, stress-related bleeding has become extremely uncommon in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Apart from pharmacologic approaches for stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP), advances in the care of critically ill patients, such as optimal fluid resuscitation to maintain hemodynamic stability and thus improve splanchnic perfusion, and early provision of enteral nutrition (EN), may contribute to this observation. Although recommended only in patients on mechanical ventilation or coagulopathy, patients with traumatic brain injury or major burns, or those with ≥ 2 risk factors, SUP is still being used in nearly 90% of ICU patients, despite lack of an accepted indication in the majority. Furthermore, SUP is often continued in these patients until clinical improvement, or even after transfer to the general ward. However, SUP is not without risks. The extensive use of SUP has been demonstrated to be associated with a higher rate of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) due to loss of the protective bacteriostatic effect of gastric acid. Meanwhile, concomitant treatment of SUP and broad-spectrum antibiotics has also contributed to higher risks of Clostridium difficile infection. Thus, selection of potentially high-risk patients who may benefit from SUP while avoiding unnecessary use in others is important.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^116TDxwN]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Comment

H. pylori eradication always confers a benefit by halting progression of gastric mucosal damage, reducing the reservoir of infected individuals and reducing or preventing H. pylori -associated diseases. The maximum benefit of eradication for an individual is obtained if eradication is done while the H. pylori -induced mucosal damage has not progressed beyond the non-atrophic stage. This population is found in countries where gastric cancer is still prevalent and is concentrated in the younger generation. H. pylori eradication of adolescents and young adults has an additional advantage of reducing or preventing transmission of the infection to their children.

As noted above (Section 3), the risk for development of gastric cancer correlates with the extent and severity of atrophic gastritis. It is impossible to define the risk for an individual based on age. Cancer risk in any population relates to the rate of progression of gastric mucosal damage, which is high in populations at high risk of cancer and low in H. pylori -infected populations with a low cancer risk. Thus, while it is possible to identify an average age at which the transition from non-atrophic to atrophic phenotype occurs for any population, one should expect that any age group will contain individuals with a wide range of damage, ranging from uninfected (normal) to advanced atrophy. This emphasises the need for risk stratification based on objective parameters including a validated histological staging system rather than on age, to identify whether one eradication treatment is needed or whether the patient might require surveillance.

### Gastric mucosal defense and cytoprotection: bench to bedside [^111t9eu7]. Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

The gastric mucosa maintains structural integrity and function despite continuous exposure to noxious factors, including 0.1 mol/L HCl and pepsin, that are capable of digesting tissue. Under normal conditions, mucosal integrity is maintained by defense mechanisms, which include preepithelial factors (mucus-bicarbonate-phospholipid "barrier"), an epithelial "barrier" (surface epithelial cells connected by tight junctions and generating bicarbonate, mucus, phospholipids, trefoil peptides, prostaglandins (PGs), and heat shock proteins), continuous cell renewal accomplished by proliferation of progenitor cells (regulated by growth factors, PGE(2) and survivin), continuous blood flow through mucosal microvessels, an endothelial "barrier", sensory innervation, and generation of PGs and nitric oxide. Mucosal injury may occur when noxious factors "overwhelm" an intact mucosal defense or when the mucosal defense is impaired. We review basic components of gastric mucosal defense and discuss conditions in which mucosal injury is directly related to impairment in mucosal defense, focusing on disorders with important clinical sequelae: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-associated injury, which is primarily related to inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)-mediated PG synthesis, and stress-related mucosal disease (SRMD), which occurs with local ischemia. The annual incidence of NSAID-associated upper gastrointestinal (GI) complications such as bleeding is approximately 1%-1.5%; and reductions in these complications have been demonstrated with misoprostol, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (only documented in high-risk patients), and COX-2 selective inhibitors. Clinically significant bleeding from SRMD is relatively uncommon with modern intensive care. Pharmacologic therapy with antisecretory drugs may be used in high-risk patients (eg, mechanical ventilation ≥ 48 hours), although the absolute risk reduction is small, and a decrease in mortality is not documented.

Comment

The categorisation of H. pylori gastritis according to gastritis subsites together with the assessment of gastritis severity allows prediction of an individual's risk of developing severe gastroduodenal complications and, in particular, gastric cancer.

Depending on the gastric subsites involved, gastric function and, in particular, gastric acid secretion may be profoundly affected, resulting in gastric acid hypersecretion, hyposecretion or even achlorhydria.

Subsite characterisation of gastritis is also critically important for identifying those patients who remain at high risk after H. pylori eradication and thus are candidates for regular endoscopic and histological follow-up. Patients with severe atrophic gastritis (with or without intestinal metaplasia) in the corpus or with severe corpus predominant gastritis are those at highest risk for progression to gastric cancer of the intestinal typeand for diffuse-type gastric cancer. In diffuse-type gastric cancer the prevalence of antral atrophic gastritis is almost identical to that seen in the intestinal type but is slightly less with corpus atrophic gastritis than with intestinal type gastric cancer.

CQ4. Is it necessary to categorise gastritis according to histology (severity) and/or endoscopy?

Statement 4

It is advisable to categorise gastritis according to histology, because the risk of development of gastric cancer in H. pylori gastritis varies according to the extent and severity of inflammation and atrophy.

Grade of recommendation: strong

Evidence level: high

Consensus level: 100%

### Gastric devascularization in a neonate with massive upper GI bleeding: a case report and literature review [^112KCrUk]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, massive UGI bleeding in neonates is a rare but life-threatening condition. Hematemesis and/or melena accompanied by hemodynamic instability should raise a suspicion of UGI bleeding. Stress gastritis and ulcers are common causes. If the patient's status is stable after blood transfusion, early endoscopic assessment might be an option for accurate diagnosis and precise management. In cases with uncontrolled bleeding, surgery remains a vital option for the management of massive UGI bleeding in neonates. However, prospective randomized clinical studies are needed.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^112Jv52y]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Worldwide the most common cause of chronic gastritis is infection with H. pylori. H. pylori causes progressive damage to the gastric mucosa and is now accepted as playing a causative role in a number of important diseases, including duodenal ulcer disease, gastric ulcer disease, gastric adenocarcinoma and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Indeed, H. pylori –induced gastritis is considered as the most important risk factor for peptic ulcer and its complications as well as for gastric cancer.

The current International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10), issued in 1989 by the International Conference for the Tenth Revision of the ICD was endorsed by WHO at the 43rd general assembly in 1990 and has been used for disease statistics since 1994 among member countries of WHO. In the ICD-10, all the digestive diseases are classified under K code with different two-digit numbers. However, H. pylori was not integrated into gastritis classification in the gastritis section (K29) of ICD-10, even though H. pylori gastritis is the predominant type of gastritis and clinically by far the most relevant because of its predisposing role of severe gastroduodenal complications. Moreover, the current ICD-10 classification of gastritis is not organised according to aetiology but is merely a mixture of phenotype and aetiology and also includes duodenitis (box 1). Therefore, a revision of the gastritis and duodenitis classification based on all the possible aetiologies was proposed after the working group meeting for the ICD-11 revision held in Tokyo in 2010 and submitted as the ICD11 β foundation component. However, in the ICD11 β foundation classification (box 2), the original plan was changed. In an attempt to gather broader opinions on the rationale of the new classification system originally proposed to ICD-11, we devoted one section to this important issue at this meeting.

### Corrosive gastritis: an extreme outcome [^111KK61A]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Caustic substances, whether acid or alkali, cause a wide range of injuries to the digestive tract, from mild hyperaemia to extensive necrosis and perforation. We report the case of 40-year-old woman who presented 6 weeks after intentional ingestion of hydrochloric acid with abdominal pain and haematemesis. Gastroscopy showed a necrosed and ulcerated stomach with pyloric stricture. The third attempt at dilatation of the stricture caused perforation of the lesser curvature of the stomach requiring laparoscopic gastroduodenostomy. The approach to corrosive ingestion and its subsequent management is discussed.

### Helicobacter pylori in intensive care: why we should be interested [^114EHp48]. Intensive Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori is estimated to infect over 50% of the world's population, the majority of whom are asymptomatic. Although most research to date has focused on local gastroduodenal disease manifestations, the potential impact of H. pylori infection and the associated chronic active inflammation on systemic disease processes is now being explored. This review addresses three aspects of emerging importance regarding H. pylori in intensive care medicine: acute gastric stress ulceration, nosocomial infection, and the potential modulatory effect on the systemic stress response. The role of H. pylori in acute stress ulceration remains uncertain, but it is unlikely to have the same major aetiological role as in peptic ulcer disease. The pathogenesis of both acute stress ulceration and H. pylori gastritis suggest overlapping mechanisms of gastric mucosal damage and H. pylori may augment stress ulceration incidence and severity. Nosocomial infection of both staff and patients with H. pylori has been suggested by serological studies, and increased H. pylori infection has been reported in intensive care staff. This has significant short- and long-term health implications and also raises questions regarding the efficacy and implementation of routine infection control precautions in intensive care. Finally, H. pylori infection has been linked with the pathogenesis of many extra-intestinal diseases, but the evidence is weak and the relationship between H. pylori and systemic diseases remains controversial. However, the potential for H. pylori to modulate systemic disease processes, particularly the systemic stress response in critical illness, is both theoretically plausible and therapeutically tantalising and requires further investigation.

### Detecting genetic predisposition for complicated clinical outcomes after burn injury [^113nfXBz]. Burns (2006). Low credibility.

Sepsis, septic shock and organ failure are common among patients with moderate to severe burns. The inability of demographic and clinical factors to identify patients at high risk for such complications suggests that genetic variation may influence clinical outcome. Moreover, the genetic predisposition to death from infection has been estimated to be greater than for cardiovascular disease or cancer. While it is widely accepted that genetic factors influence many complex disease processes, controversy has emerged regarding the most appropriate methods for detection and even the validity of many published allelic associations. This article will review the few studies of genetic predisposition that have been conducted in the setting of burn injury, then discuss some of the obstacles and potential approaches for the discovery of additional allelic associations.

### Gastroduodenal mucosal defense: an integrated protective response [^117Ffm3Q]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

The mechanisms by which the gastroduodenal mucosa maintains viability and normal functioning despite its intensely caustic environment have puzzled clinicians and investigators alike for at least 150 years. Protective mechanisms have been divided into three main categories: preepithelial (mucus and bicarbonate secretion), epithelial (cellular buffering, mucosal architecture and permeability), and postepithelial mechanisms (mucosal blood flow). Within each category are many other factors that bear on the ability of the mucosa to withstand constant changes of luminal pH. We will summarize some of the recent findings that pertain to the nature and regulation of these defense mechanisms in the context of a historical overview. Therapeutic implications of these findings will also be presented in the discussion of novel antiinflammatory compounds designed to upregulate simultaneously several defensive mechanisms, with the expectation that gastroduodenal damage will be minimized.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^112jXaxU]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Comment

Gastric erosions are defined as superficial mucosal breaks with a diameter of < 3 mm or < 5 mm. This small size makes it less likely to confound erosions with peptic ulcers which, by definition, penetrate the muscularis mucosae.

Gastric erosions can be detected in the context of H. pylori infection but are more frequently caused by intake of mucosal damaging drugs — in particular, aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Furthermore, several different morphological forms were noted after eradication of H. pylori as (a) flat, (b) raised, (c) haemorrhagic and (d) appearing as bleeding spots with localisation in the antrum in the absence of drugs, possibly owing to hyperacidity after eradication therapy.

From a clinical perspective, the most relevant aspect of erosions is that patients taking NSAIDs and having numerous erosions in the stomach are at increased risk of developing ulcers subsequently.

Few studies on the clinical significance or natural history of gastric or duodenal erosions have been reported. Thus, it is important to conduct a prospective research in which erosions in the stomach and duodenum are separately reported in conjunction with the category of gastritis, which is needed to better understand the natural history of gastric erosions and their potential to progress to ulceration and bleeding. Validated scores for reporting erosions for research purposes should be used.

Omeprazole can have other serious side effects. See "What are the possible side effects of omeprazole?"

What are omeprazole delayed-release capsules?

Omeprazole delayed-release capsules is a prescription medicine called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Omeprazole delayed-release capsules reduces the amount of acid in your stomach. Omeprazole delayed-release capsules are used in adults:

for up to 8 weeks for the healing of duodenal ulcers. The duodenal area is the area where food passes when it leaves the stomach.
with certain antibiotics to treat an infection caused by bacteria called H. pylori. Sometimes H. pylori bacteria can cause duodenal ulcers. The infection needs to be treated to prevent the ulcers from coming back.
for up to 8 weeks for healing stomach ulcers
for up to 4 weeks to treat heartburn and other symptoms that happen with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD happens when acid in your stomach backs up into the tube (esophagus) that connects your mouth to your stomach. This may cause a burning feeling in your chest or throat, sour taste, or burping.

### Incidence of gastric cancer among patients with gastric precancerous lesions: observational cohort study in a low risk Western population [^114kiD9T]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In Sweden, despite the absence of an official guideline, gastroscopy was usually undertaken for upper abdominal symptoms (for example, dyspepsia, pain), gastrointestinal bleeding, suspected reflux (severe heart burn), unexplained iron deficiency anaemia, or malabsorption/unexplained weight loss. This practice is similar to that of other Western countriesbut can vary by calendar year, age of the patient, and healthcare level. During the studied period there were no widespread and generally accepted guidelines for taking biopsy samples, so the procedure may have differed by time but always included sampling from visible abnormalities. Our observed incidence rates predict that within 20 years after gastroscopy, gastric cancer will develop in approximately 1 in 256 people with normal mucosa, 1 in 85 with gastritis, 1 in 50 with atrophic gastritis, 1 in 39 with intestinal metaplasia, and 1 in 19 with dysplasia. The increased incidence was stable throughout the follow-up period, and the gaps between cumulative incidence curves grew continuously. Interestingly, if repeated biopsy showed a change — upward or (more noteworthy) downward in the Correa's cascade — compared with the initial grouping, this seemed to have prognostic significance.

Comparison to other studies

To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest follow-up study to date among patients with gastric precancerous mucosal lesions — both for sample size and length of follow-up. The structure of Swedish healthcare essentially enabled us to include all patients with gastric biopsy. Multiple precise linkages to largely complete high quality national registers — using the national registration numbers as unique identifiers — permitted complete follow-up for cancer outcomes as well as for censoring events. The findings for atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia are principally in agreement with those in another similar large scale follow-up study from Hollandand thus should be generalisable at least to patients undergoing endoscopy in north western Europe. The incidence that we observed among patients with dysplasia, however, was only a fraction of that reported in the Dutch study.

### Phase III, randomised, double-blind, multicentre study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vonoprazan compared with lansoprazole in Asian patients with erosive oesophagitis [^114YxYfk]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

GORD is characterised by symptoms such as heart burn and acid regurgitation resulting from the reflux of gastric contents into the oesophagus. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of approximately 100 studies examining gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms reported a pooled prevalence of 13.3% worldwide, 17.1% in Europe, 15.4% in North America, 10.0% in Asia and 2.5% in China. Patients with GORD are categorised as having non-erosive reflux disease or erosive oesophagitis (EO), which are the two main phenotypes. Using endoscopic examination, EO is graded by the severity of the mucosal injury, also referred to as mucosal breaks according to the Los Angeles (LA) classification system, which ranges from grade A (mild) to grade D (severe).

### Gastrointestinal insufficiency is a risk factor for severely burned patients: a case-control study among 185 victims in kunshan explosion [^115KcTVz]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

As for mechanisms behind GI insufficiency to the mortality, researchers had already revealed that nutrition defect, pathogen contamination and ischemia established the connection between GI insufficiency and death. Initially, GI tract served as the primary site for food digestion and nutrition ingestion, which would be severely impaired in burn patients suffering GI insufficiency accompanied by electrocyte and fluid loss. Nutrition defects gave rise to the compromise of immune system and delay of wound healing due to the shrinkage of protein synthesis, which exposed host in an infection-prone circumstance and further aggravated further by imbalance of electrocyte and fluid. Moreover, intestinal barrier, consisting of microbiota and mucosa, not only played a vital role in determining the translocation of bacteria, but also closely associated with immune cells to modulate the host enteric defense. In severe burn injury, bioactive factors like proinflammatory cytokines and endotoxins could precipitate the dysfunction of intestinal barrier through numerous signaling pathways. Meanwhile, mesenteric ischemia was another lethal factor of GI insufficiency, which interrupted the blood supply to intestine and progressed to life-threatening intestinal necrosis.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the gastrointestinal tract. mechanisms of protection and healing: current knowledge and future research [^115Jf1R3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The resistance of the gastric mucosa to injury is attributable to a series of factors collectively known as "mucosal defense". Many components of mucosal defense are regulated by prostaglandins and nitric oxide (NO). Thus, inhibition of the production of these mediators predisposes the stomach to injury. Administration of these agents, as synthetic prostaglandins or NO donors, can restore mucosal defense and thereby prevent damage induced by several irritants. Repair of gastric ulcers is also influenced by NO and prostaglandins. Furthermore, a variety of growth factors appear to play critical roles in stimulating the formation of granulation tissue (the "foundation" for repair), the formation of new blood vessels, and the proliferation of epithelial cells. Better understanding of the factors that regulate ulcer healing should provide clues for the development of drugs that can produce better "quality" healing of ulcers.

### The emerging role of GLP-1 agonists in burn care: what Do we know? [^1179DrCh]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists mimic the action of GLP-1, a hormone that regulates blood glucose levels via stimulation of insulin release and inhibition of glucagon secretion. After the burn, the current literature suggests that the use of GLP-1 agonists results in less insulin dependence with similar glucose control and hypoglycemic events to patients receiving a basal-bolus insulin regimen. Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists may also promote wound healing through various mechanisms including angiogenesis and improved keratinocyte migration. Despite the potential benefits, GLP-1 agonists reduce gastrointestinal motility which impacts their widespread adoption in burn care. This dysmotility can result in inadequate nutrition delivery, unintentional weight loss, and is a potential aspiration risk. The net impact of these medications on patients with burns is unclear. Given their potential to demonstrate the safety, efficacy, and optimal dosing of various GLP-1 agonists in acute burn management.

### AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis: expert review [^114ZiGgB]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Management of coexisting conditions in atrophic gastritis — iron deficiency and autoimmune comorbidity guidance is provided. Iron deficiency is common "with some series reporting in up to 50% of patients with corpus-predominant AG", and it "often presents much earlier than the manifestation of B-12 deficiency". Accordingly, "Providers should therefore evaluate for iron and vitamin B-12 deficiency in patients with AG, especially if corpus-predominant; likewise, in patients with unexplained iron or vitamin B-12 deficiency, AG should be considered in the differential diagnosis and appropriate diagnostic evaluation pursued (BPA 11)". There is "an established association between AIG and other autoimmune diseases, especially autoimmune thyroid disease", and "Screening for autoimmune thyroid disease should be considered in patients diagnosed with AIG". Providers "should also have a low threshold to evaluate for other associated autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes mellitus and Addison's disease, if the clinical picture is consistent (BPA 12)". The conclusions emphasize that "Providers should recognize AG as an important, albeit frequently underdiagnosed, condition", and that "Patients with severe AG should be considered for endoscopic surveillance… and may require additional management considerations… particularly iron and vitamin B-12 deficiencies".

### Stress ulcer, gastritis, and gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis in critically ill pediatric patients: a systematic review [^112iqmFn]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify and evaluate the quality of evidence supporting prophylactic use of treatments for stress ulcers and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Stress ulcers, erosions of the stomach and duodenum, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding are well-known complications of critical illness in children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit.

Data Sources

Studies were identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PUBMED; LILACS; Scirus. We also scanned bibliographies of relevant studies.

Study Selection

This systematic review of randomized controlled trials assessed the effects of drugs for stress-related ulcers, gastritis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding in critically ill children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two reviewers independently extracted the relevant data. Most randomized controlled trials were judged as having unclear risk of bias. When pooling two randomized controlled trials, treatment was significantly more effective in preventing upper gastrointestinal bleeding (macroscopic or important bleeding) compared with no treatment (two studies = 300 participants; relative risk, 0.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.19–0.91; I = 12%). Meta-analysis of two studies found no significant difference in death rates among groups (two randomized controlled trials = 132 participants; relative risk, 1.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–2.79; I = 4%). The rate of pneumonia was not significantly different when comparing treatment and no treatment in one study. When comparing ranitidine with no treatment, significant differences were found in the proportion of mechanically ventilated children with normal gastric mucosal endoscopic findings by histologic specimens (one randomized controlled trial = 48 participants; relative risk, 3.53; 95% confidence interval, 1.34–9.29). No significant differences were found when comparing different drugs (omeprazole, ranitidine, sucralfate, famotidine, amalgate), doses, or regimens for main outcomes (deaths, endoscopic findings of erosion or ulcers, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, or pneumonia).

Conclusions

Although pooled data of two studies suggested that critically ill pediatric patients may benefit from receiving prophylactic treatment to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding, we found that high-quality evidence to guide clinical practice is still limited.

### Characteristics of immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated gastritis: report from a major tertiary care center [^111SiHre]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Endoscopy and Histology

On review of endoscopy reports, common findings were erythema 22 (88%), edema 13 (52%), and friability 12 (48%). Other features described were erosions 9 (36%), signs of bleeding 8 (32%), ulcerations 5 (20%), granularity 5 (20%), and atrophy 1 (4%). Inflammatory findings were reported to be focal in 9 (36%) patients.

Histology slides for 14 patients were re-reviewed by a specialist gastrointestinal pathologist. Thirteen (92.9%) cases showed signs of mucosal injury. Individual details of the clinical characteristics of the 13 patients are presented in Table 4 and their histology is presented in Table 5. The overall pattern of injury was described as chronic gastritis with or without activity in 5 (5%), reactive gastropathy in 4 (28%), focally enhanced gastritis in 2 (14%), lymphocytic gastritis (7%), and acute gastritis in 1 (7%) patient (Fig. 1). Biopsy reports for three other patients where slides were not available for re-examination were suggestive of chronic active gastritis. Of the 14 available slides that were re-examined, the severity of inflammation was described as mild in 4 (28.6%) and severe in 2 (14.3%) patients. Excluding the lymphocytic gastritis case, intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) were present in 4 additional cases (28%) of patients. It was mostly present in a patchy distribution in the deeper glands and noted in the background of other patterns of injury described (reactive gastropathy, acute gastritis, focally enhanced gastritis, and chronic gastritis). Another prominent feature often seen was apoptosis, present in 7/14 (50%) cases. Lamina propria inflammation seen in 11/14 (78.6%) patients was mainly composed of plasma cells and was described as mild (n = 5, 35.7%), moderate (n = 5, 35.7%), and severe (n = 1, 7.1%). Lymphoid aggregates were present in only 2 (14.3%) patients. Rare eosinophils were identified in the lamina propria of 7 (50%) cases as well. Frank ulceration was noted in a single case on a biopsy where the endoscopy had revealed moderate inflammation and atrophic mucosa with erythema. No specimens had morphologic evidence of viral inclusions.

### Efficacy and safety of proton pump inhibitors for stress ulcer prophylaxis in critically ill patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^115jE4uY]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Our meta-analysis used broad eligibility criteria to enhance the generalizability of the results. Despite including a wide spectrum of critically ill patients, there was no significant heterogeneity across trials for these outcomes. Our findings suggest that PPIs are effective in preventing stress ulcer bleeding without increasing the risk of pneumonia or mortality. Nonetheless, several factors suggest cautious interpretation of these results. The quality of evidence was moderate for most outcomes; this is primarily related to risk of bias. Nine trials did not employ proper blinding of healthcare providers or outcome assessors (Additional file 1: Table S6), which may have inflated the observed treatment effect of PPIs. Furthermore, a subgroup analysis based on risk of bias (low vs. high or unclear) suggested a larger treatment effect in trials of lower quality, although the test for interaction was not significant. The outcome definitions varied across studies, which may have affected the estimate of effect.

Other factors, such as enteral nutrition, may modify the efficacy of prophylactic PPIs and H2RAs. One small RCT in critically ill patients with burns showed that enteral nutrition increased gastric blood flow. No RCTs exclusively examined the effect of enteral feeding on bleeding from stress ulcers. Whether enteral feeding modifies the effect of PPIs on the risk of bleeding or pneumonia remains uncertain.

Prior meta-analyses examined the effect of PPIs compared to H2RAs for stress ulcer prophylaxis. Our meta-analysis included more trials than other meta-analyses on this topic (19 trials enrolling 2117 patients), improving the precision of our findings. We obtained additional missing data from the authors of the original trial reports to inform the analyses, and conducted subgroup analyses to assess the robustness of the findings. Using the GRADE approach to assess our confidence in the estimates of treatment effect, the certainty of evidence was moderate for clinically important and overt upper GI bleeding, and mortality outcomes, while it was low for pneumonia and ICU length of stay outcomes. We also adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^117KnGjN]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Comment

H. pylori gastritis is an infectious disease and leads to chronic active gastritis of varying severity in virtually all infected subjects.

There is a significant variability in the interindividual expressions of gastric mucosal structural damage and accordingly the associated physiological perturbations also vary. H. pylori gastritis may remain clinically unapparent or evolve into severe complications. The rate of progression is unpredictable. The most severe clinical expression is gastric cancer, which is often incurable by the time of diagnosis.

Cure of H. pylori infection leads to healing of the inflamed gastric mucosa, which may return to normal. H. pylori eradication may improve or resolve dyspeptic symptoms and usually cures PUD. H. pylori gastritis is a disease which can be cured and thus prevent severe complications. If H. pylori gastritis has progressed to more severe forms of gastritis, including atrophic gastritis with or without intestinal metaplasia, or severe corpus predominant gastritis, the risk of gastric cancer is increased and eradication of the infection at this stage needs to be integrated with a follow-up strategy.

### Ulcer and gastritis [^114w3tNr]. Endoscopy (2001). Low credibility.

Recent progress in the area of ulcer and gastritis is still dominated by findings and reports on Helicobacter pylori and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which in turn are the two major causes of peptic ulcers. Although the prevalence of H. pylori is declining in most developed countries, it is still contributing to a significant proportion of peptic ulcers globally. The interrelationship of H. pylori gastritis in patients with gastroesophageal reflux has become more apparent. H. pylori-induced gastric body gastritis is associated with reduced acid production, and thus with reduced reflux and esophagitis. The controversies regarding the interactions between H. pylori and NSAIDs have still not been settled. With the availability of the new COX-2-specific inhibitors, the current scenario of NSAID-related gastroduodenal complications will certainly change. Short-term usage of these agents has significantly reduced the incidence of endoscopic ulcers, but the benefits in terms of clinical outcomes, such as bleeding or perforation, remain to be determined. This review summarizes the recent literature on peptic ulcer and gastritis.

### Prevalence and factors associated with inappropriate continuation of stress ulcer prophylaxis at discharge [^111xaey7]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Stress ulcers, as the name indicates, are upper gastrointestinal (GI) ulcers caused in response to stress in critically ill persons, especially those who are hospitalised. Bleeding from stress ulcers can increase morbidity and mortality further in this group of patients. Thus, stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) was introduced. The agents often used as SUP are histamine 2 receptor blockers (H2 blockers) and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). The most common indications for SUP in the intensive care unit (ICU) include bleeding diathesis, use of mechanical ventilation, history of peptic ulcer or GI bleeding within the past year, traumatic brain injury or burn injury, among others, as described in Box 1. There are no established safe criteria to discontinue SUP. Most experts consider discontinuing SUP after discharge from the ICU, as they are no longer critically ill unless risk factors prevail. This consensus is based on the rationale that the baseline risk of GI bleeding is low in non-critically ill hospitalised patients. However, SUP initiated in the ICU often continues during the hospital stay and discharge. Prior studies found that 27–39% of patients were inappropriately continued on PPI upon discharge. Though they are considered relatively safe medications, interactions along with healthcare costs add to unnecessary burdens. Given this background, with a future goal to reduce the inappropriate continuation of SUP as long term, our team decided to estimate the prevalence of inappropriate continuation of SUP at discharge in addition to identifying the risk factors associated with its continuation.

### Gastric feedings effectively prophylax against upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in burn patients [^116Bc2it]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2011). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of gastric feeding in prevention of upper gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage. A retrospective chart review of 50 consecutive burn intensive care unit patients with admission dates from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2007, was conducted. Five of 50 patients (10%) developed GI hemorrhage. Three men of 36 developed a GI hemorrhage (8%) compared with 2 of 14 women (14%). Patients who developed hemorrhage had a higher abbreviated burn severity index score of 11 compared with the control group of 9 and having a higher mortality rate of 80% compared with controls of 27%. Those patients who developed abdominal compartment syndrome were more likely to develop GI hemorrhage (40% rate compared with 4% in patients who did not develop abdominal compartment syndrome). Of 13 patients who were not tolerating their tube feed at some point during treatment, 4 developed hemorrhage (31%), whereas only 1 patient who was tolerating his or her tube feed developed hemorrhage (3%). Three of 19 (16%) patients on proton pump inhibitor prophylaxis developed a GI hemorrhage compared with 2 of 31 (6%) of patients who were not undergoing prophylaxis. Because of the potential side effects of proton pump inhibitor prophylaxis, the authors believe that when tolerated, gastric feedings should be the standard prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Acid suppression therapy may only be necessary for patients who are not tolerating their tube feeds, have other abdominal pathologies, or with a previous history of peptic ulcer disease.

### Acute duodenitis and duodenal ulceration after burns… [^116SoZQR]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The clinical and pathological characteristics of Curling ulcer were defined by early and serial endoscopic examinations of the duodenum in 37 burned patients. Duodenal disease was present in 27 patients and occurred only in patients with burns involving more than 38% of the total body surface. Erosive "duodenitis" could occur within 12 hours after injury and was usually associated with acute gastric disease. Isolated duodenitis occurred only in patients with pancreatitis. Contrast roentgenograms did not reliably show the superficial mucosal disease. Duodenal ulcerations were present in 12 patients and developed on a background of diffuse superficial mucosal injury. Other complications in the patient's postburn course influenced disease progression. Hemorrhage occurred in six patients with duodenal disease, usually originating from a posterior duodenal ulcer. Uncomplicated ulcers invariably healed within five weeks after diagnosis.

### Pathophysiology of the upper gastrointestinal tract in the critically ill patient: rationale for the therapeutic benefits of acid suppression [^111ELRti]. Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Gastric mucosal damage occurs in critically ill patients in intensive care units and develops in the setting of severe physiologic stress. Within 24 hrs of admission to the intensive care unit, 75% to 100% of critically ill patients demonstrate evidence of stress-related mucosal disease. Stress ulcers present a risk of clinically important bleeding, which is associated with alterations in physiology, such as hypotension or tachycardia, or results in anemia or the need for transfusion. Clinically important bleeding occurs in approximately 1% to 4% of critically ill patients. The pathophysiology of stress-related mucosal disease is complex. Major factors responsible for stress ulcer are decreased blood flow, mucosal ischemia, and hypoperfusion and reperfusion injury. Acid-suppressive regimens that elevate the intragastric pH and maintain the pH over time have the potential to prevent stress-related mucosal disease. Intragastric pH studies have demonstrated that, whereas a pH of > 4 may be adequate to prevent stress ulceration, a pH of > 6 may be necessary to maintain clotting in patients at risk of rebleeding from peptic ulcer. Studies comparing the ability of intravenous administrations of histamine-2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors to raise and maintain intragastric pH suggest that, although both can raise the pH to > 4, proton pump inhibitors are much more likely to maintain this pH. Unlike histamine-2-receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors can elevate and maintain the intragastric pH at > 6. This is relevant for patients in the intensive care unit at risk for rebleeding from peptic ulcers after hemostasis.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on management of gastric intestinal metaplasia [^113bNiFp]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on atrophic gastritis:

- **Definition**: Atrophic gastritis is defined as a chronic inflammation leading to the loss of gastric glands, which can occur with or without metaplasia.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of atrophic gastritis involves an immune response directed towards the parietal cells and intrinsic factor of the gastric body and fundus. This leads to hypochlorhydria, hypergastrinemia, and inadequate production of the intrinsic factor, which in turn results in the reduction of essential substances like hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of atrophic gastritis worldwide is estimated at 25%, and the risk is 2.4 times higher in H. pylori-positive individuals.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for atrophic gastritis include H. pylori infection, autoimmune disorders, and long-term use of PPIs. It is also frequently found in association with other autoimmune diseases, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis and T1DM.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, atrophic gastritis can be asymptomatic or present with vague gastrointestinal symptoms. Complications such as pernicious anemia or gastric cancer can occur due to the condition's impact on the stomach's secretion of essential substances.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of atrophic gastritis is influenced by the extent and severity of gland loss and the underlying cause. It can progress to gastric cancer, especially in patients with advanced stages of gastritis.

### Comment on "Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2008" by dellinger et al [^116SqNPZ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Secondly, the strong recommendation in favor of the use of stress ulcer prophylaxis is not, in our view, in line with currently available evidence. This recommendation is, like that in the guidelines of 2004, still mainly based on ancient studies performed in the 1980s, a meta-analysis from 1991, and a large trial in 1998 without a control arm. However, the most recent meta-analysis shows no reduction of clinical important bleeding – but is somehow completely ignored. Whether the results of these older trials are applicable nowadays is questionable, since the incidence of stress ulcer-related bleeding has significantly decreased over recent decades due to improved ICU treatment. This definitely affects the balance between the benefit of prevention of gastro-intestinal bleeding and the increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia due to higher stomach pH. Several recent trials show comparable rates of bleeding and endoscopic evidence of stress-related injury between treatment and placebo groups. These results are pathophysiologically plausible, since stress ulcers are caused not by increased secretion of gastric acid, but by splanchnic hypoperfusion. Unfortunately, many recent trials only compare H2 blockers with proton pump inhibitors, without a placebo group. Altogether, according to the most recent meta-analysis and the more recent trials, a strong recommendation not to use stress ulcer prophylaxis would be more appropriate.

Thirdly, we disagree with the strength of the recommendation to reduce blood glucose levels in patients with severe sepsis. On the current evidence, this should be at most a weak recommendation. The beneficial effect of intensive insulin therapy has been demonstrated only in surgical patients, not in septic patients. The benefit versus harm balance of intensive insulin therapy may be quite different for patients with severe sepsis than for the investigated surgical patients. It is not unreasonable to assume that septic patients may be more at risk for hypoglycemia, because sepsis may be associated with a deficiency of counterregulatory hormones. In the study of medical patients by van den Berghe, as well as the VISEP study and the Glucontrol study, the risk of hypoglycemia was substantially increased, and hypoglycemia was an independent risk factor for mortality. None of these studies followed up the patients with hypoglycemia for neurocognitive impairment. Furthermore, the target glucose level of < 150 mg/dl recommended in the guidelines is based solely on expert opinion and is not supported by data from any trial. Therefore, the beneficial effect, the harmlessness, and the target glucose level of intensive insulin therapy remain to be demonstrated in septic patients.

### The impact of blood type O on major outcomes in patients with severe burns [^11737dNA]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

ABO blood type has been reported to be a predictor of poor prognosis in critically ill patients. Here, we aim to correlate different blood types with clinical outcomes in patients with severe burns. We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study by enrolling patients with severe burn injuries (≥ 40% TBSA) between January 2012 and December 2017. Baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared between disparate ABO blood types (type O vs non-O type). Multivariate logistic and linear regression analyses were performed to identify an association between ABO blood type and clinical outcomes, including in-hospital mortality, the development of acute kidney injury (AKI), and hospital or ICU length of stay. A total of 141 patients were finally enrolled in the current study. Mortality was significantly higher in patients with type O blood compared with those of other blood types. The development of AKI was significantly higher in patients with blood type O vs non-O blood type (P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that blood type O was independently associated with in-hospital mortality and AKI occurrence after adjusting for other potential confounders. Our findings indicated the blood type O was an independent risk factor of both increased mortality and the development of AKI postburn. More prudent and specific treatments are required in treating these patients to avoid poor prognosis.

### Gastric mucosal necrosis caused by ingestion of crystalline sodium chloride: a case report [^116HguSK]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute sodium chloride (NaCl) poisoning is a life-threatening condition primarily known to cause systemic hypernatremia. However, the local gastrointestinal effects of ingesting a large mass of crystalline NaCl are not well-documented. This case illustrates that crystalline NaCl can cause a severe corrosive injury pattern akin to that of classic caustic agents. We present a 42-year-old woman with abdominal pain and hematemesis after ingesting 200 g of crystalline NaCl in a suicide attempt. She had hypernatremia (155 mmol/L) and hyperosmolality (serum osmolality 324 mOsm/kg). An upper endoscopy revealed severe corrosive gastritis with mucosal necrosis and exudates, concentrated in the gastric antrum, with relative sparing of the esophagus and duodenum. The patient was managed supportively with intravenous fluids and a proton pump inhibitor, and her gastric lesions showed healing with significant scarring on a follow-up endoscopy. In conclusion, massive NaCl ingestion can cause severe, localized corrosive gastritis, in addition to systemic hypernatremia. The physical form of NaCl (solid crystals) is a critical determinant of injury. Clinicians should maintain a high suspicion for severe gastrointestinal chemical injury.

### Prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in stress-induced gastric mucosal injury [^112zPDtg]. Intensive Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the role of Helicobacter pylori infection in critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit in the formation of gastric and duodenal mucosal injury in these patients.

Design and Setting

Prospective cohort analysis in an 18-bed mixed medical and surgical closed format ICU in a teaching hospital.

Patients

Fifty consecutive patients admitted to the intensive care unit for emergency reasons and requiring mechanical ventilation were included.

Interventions

H. pylori infection was detected by the laser-assisted ratio analyzer [13C]urea breath test (UBT). Gastric and duodenal mucosal lesions were assessed by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and classified as minor (up to five erosions or submucosal hemorrhages) or major (more than five erosions or submucosal hemorrhages) mucosal injury.

Measurements and Main Results

Six patients were not eligible because the UBT could not be processed. Of the 44 eligible patients 22 were H. pylori positive by UBT and 22 H. pylori negative. Either minor or major gastric mucosal injury was found on endoscopy in 66%. Of the 29 patients with minor mucosal injury 10 (34.5%) were infected with H. pylori as indicated by positive LARA 13C-UBT. In contrast, of the 15 patients with major mucosal injury 12 (80%) were infected with H. pylori (p = 0.004). H. pylori was the only risk factor significantly associated with major mucosal injury in a multiple regression analysis (p = 0.019).

Conclusion

The severity of gastric and duodenal mucosal injury in critically ill patients during mechanical ventilation is significantly correlated with the presence of H. pylori infection.

### Burn injury [^1145jTRB]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

Burn injuries are under-appreciated injuries that are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Burn injuries, particularly severe burns, are accompanied by an immune and inflammatory response, metabolic changes and distributive shock that can be challenging to manage and can lead to multiple organ failure. Of great importance is that the injury affects not only the physical health, but also the mental health and quality of life of the patient. Accordingly, patients with burn injury cannot be considered recovered when the wounds have healed; instead, burn injury leads to long-term profound alterations that must be addressed to optimize quality of life. Burn care providers are, therefore, faced with a plethora of challenges including acute and critical care management, long-term care and rehabilitation. The aim of this Primer is not only to give an overview and update about burn care, but also to raise awareness of the ongoing challenges and stigmata associated with burn injuries.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^115TunbB]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

For decades endoscopic 'gastritis', gastric erosions and even histological findings of gastric inflammation have failed to attract much attention from clinicians as the majority of patients with these findings remain asymptomatic. Although gastritis is often used to describe dyspeptic symptoms, the presence of such symptoms correlates poorly with histological or endoscopic gastritis. Although the term 'gastritis' is still used as a concept to explain dyspeptic symptoms, gastritis as a term refers to gastric inflammation, often accompanying structural mucosal changes. This gastric inflammation (gastritis) has long been associated with peptic ulcer, gastric cancer and pernicious anaemia, but the cause or causes of gastritis remain poorly understood. The discovery that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) was a cause of gastritisfocused attention on the aetiology, natural history and prognosis of gastritis.

### Intra-abdominal infections survival guide: a position statement by the global alliance for infections in surgery [^112Sxdzg]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute diverticulitis begins with inspissation and inflammation of colonic diverticuli, which may cause local ischemia and progress to colonic micro- or macro-perforation. It may be classified according to the extent of inflammation and related complications that it induces, ranging from mild uncomplicated episodes to major complications (e.g. abscess or peritonitis). In Western societies, most diverticula are found in the sigmoid and left colon, whereas diverticula of the right colon are more common in Asian populations.

Gastroduodenal ulcer perforations have decreased recently, owing to the widespread prescribing of proton pump inhibitors (and over-the-counter availability), a decreasing incidence of Helicobacter pylori infection in Western countries, and effective multi-drug therapy when diagnosed in the non-acute setting. However, perforated gastroduodenal ulcer disease is still a common emergency condition worldwide and is associated with high mortality if not treated promptly. The main causal factors include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, systemic corticosteroids, tobacco smoking, H. pylori infection, and high-sodium diets, all of which are associated with gastric acid hypersecretion. The above-mentioned medications also disrupt the gastric mucus barrier and mucosal H + efflux pumps. Most community-onset gastroduodenal perforations are sterile if source control is achieved within the first 24 h after perforation, with antibacterial therapy for invasive infection (as opposed to prophylaxis) only necessary thereafter. The most common microbial isolate after gastroduodenal perforation is Candida spp. which is usually a contaminant from the esophago-gastric microbiome that does not require antifungal therapy. By contrast, stress-related gastric mucosal injury (stress "ulceration",) now rare even among critically ill patients in intensive care units (ICUs), is caused by gastric ischemia/reperfusion injury. Characterized by diffuse erosive gastritis rather than discrete ulcers, stress gastritis is more likely to result in upper GI hemorrhage than gangrene or perforation.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — definitions, recognition, and biopsy approach in atrophic gastritis: Atrophic gastritis is defined as "the loss of gastric glands, with or without metaplasia, in the setting of chronic inflammation mainly due to Helicobacter pylori infection or autoimmunity", and "the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis should be confirmed by histopathology". Providers should be aware that "the presence of intestinal metaplasia on gastric histology almost invariably implies the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis", and "there should be a coordinated effort between gastroenterologists and pathologists to improve the consistency of documenting the extent and severity of atrophic gastritis, particularly if marked atrophy is present". Providers should recognize typical endoscopic features "which include pale appearance of gastric mucosa, increased visibility of vasculature due to thinning of the gastric mucosa, and loss of gastric folds, and, if with concomitant intestinal metaplasia, light blue crests and white opaque fields", and because these changes "are often subtle, techniques to optimize evaluation of the gastric mucosa should be performed". When endoscopic features are present, providers "should assess the extent endoscopically and obtain biopsies from the body and antrum/incisura… placed in separately labeled jars", and "targeted biopsies should additionally be obtained from any other mucosal abnormalities". In patients with histology compatible with autoimmune gastritis, providers "should consider checking antiparietal cell antibodies and antiintrinsic factor antibodies to assist with the diagnosis" and "should also evaluate for anemia due to vitamin B-12 and iron deficiencies".

### Burn leads to long-term elevated admissions to hospital for gastrointestinal disease in a west Australian population based study [^117T4iAk]. Burns (2017). Low credibility.

Background

While the most obvious impact of burn is on the skin, systemic responses also occur after burn, including intestinal inflammation. The objective of this study was to assess if burns are associated with increased long-term admissions for gastrointestinal diseases.

Methods

A population-based longitudinal study using linked hospital morbidity and death data from Western Australia was undertaken of adults aged at least 15 years when hospitalized for a first burn (n = 20,561) in 1980–2012. A frequency matched non-injury comparison cohort was randomly selected from Western Australia's birth registrations and electoral roll (n = 80,960). Crude admission rates and summed days in hospital for digestive diseases were calculated. Negative binomial and Cox proportional hazards regression modeling were used to generate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and hazard ratios (HR), respectively.

Results

After adjustment for demographic factors and pre-existing health status, the burn cohort had 1.54 times (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.47–1.62) as many admissions and almost three times the number of days in hospital with a digestive system diagnosis (IRR, 95% CI: 2.90, 2.60–3.25) than the uninjured cohort. Significantly elevated adjusted post-burn incident rates were identified, with the risk decreasing with increasing time: in the first month (HR, 95% CI: 3.02, 1.89–4.82), from one month to five years (HR, 95% CI: 1.42, 1.31–1.54), and from five to twenty years after burn (HR, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.06–1.20).

Conclusions

Findings of increased hospital admission rates and prolonged length of hospital stay for gastrointestinal diseases in the burn cohort provide evidence to support that burns have effects that persist long after the initial injury.

### Risk factors for gastric mucosa lesion in critically ill patients undergoing endoscopy for percutaneous gastrostomy: a case-control study [^1142tGa3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Epidemiological data indicate that gastric ulceration is present in 5–10% of the population, with the annual incidence of 0.1–0.19%. Lack of prevention of gastric ulcer may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding. The standard treatment to prevent stress ulcers in the intensive care unit (ICU) is the use of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or histamine H 2 receptor antagonist (H 2 RA). Proton pump inhibitors are first choice anti-ulcer medications for patients treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. They are also used to prevent bleeding from peptic ulcers. The standard dose of pantoprazole is 40 mg once a day. Pharmacological gastric ulcer prophylaxis with PPI is commonly prescribed in patients hospitalized in ICUs, however it is associated with increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia and C. difficile colitis. Pharmacological stress ulcer prophylaxis should be used in patients in whom major risk factors of stress ulcer are present: mechanical ventilation, coagulopathy, traumatic brain injury, major burn. Patients without these risk factors, who receive enteral nutrition, may benefit from discontinuing pharmacological stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is a procedure performed in patients requiring long-term enteral nutrition, who cannot be fed orally due to swallowing disorders, head and neck tumors, or other chronic conditions. It is an artificial access route to the stomach created for internal nutrition. The patient is anesthetized locally or generally for this procedure and a gastrostomy tube is inserted through the skin of the abdominal wall into the lumen of the stomach. It is a safe and effective way of providing required alimentation. PEG significantly improves patient's quality of life by eliminating the need for nasogastric (NG) tube. It is safe in patients with dysphagia, following stroke or other cerebrovascular diseases. The risk of aspiration pneumonia and gastroesophageal reflux is lower when patients are fed via PEG compared to NG tube.

There are many studies reporting gastrointestinal bleeding in the ICU patients. Studies reporting gastroscopic images in the ICU patients are limited. Standard evaluation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa during gastroscopy preceding PEG implantation allows for an objective assessment of abnormalities and their severity.

The aim of the study was to assess the current prevalence and risk factors for gastric mucosa lesion in the ICU patients receiving standard pharmacological stress ulcer prophylaxis undergoing endoscopy for PEG implantation.

Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence. Renal and liver disease. There are no adjustments in LT4 dosing that are required in cases of cirrhosis or renal failure. Nephrotic syndrome, with its large urinary protein losses that include the thyroid hormone transport proteins TBG, transthyretine and albumin, can be a cause of increased LT4 requirements due to excessive urinary thyroid hormone losses. Cardiac disease. Thyroid hormone therapy, with its inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart, is a potential cause of angina in patients with severe CAD. This is the reason for starting patients with low doses of LT4, and increasing the dose slowly, while monitoring for the development of angina or other cardiac symptoms such as tachyarrhythmias.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^114hUZC5]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Comment

Although the ICD-10 has been updated regularly to accommodate new diseases and concepts, WHO recognised the necessity of overall systematic changes in the ICD and decided to revise the current ICD-10 to ICD-11 in 2007. As the intermediate process for this revision, the ICD11 β version was formulated with input from various scientific advisory groups. This version was open to the public so that opinions from various interest groups and a broader range of medical specialists could be reflected before compiling the ICD-11. ICD11 β foundation component consists of the core of the ICD-11 classification from which mortality and morbidity classifications will derive. However, it remains a draft and can be changed from time to time before finalisation of ICD-11 (for more details, please visit).

In the ICD11 β foundation component of the gastritis section, classification of gastritis was principally based on aetiological factors with consideration of their specific pathophysiological principles (box 2). Accordingly, H. pylori gastritis is categorised as a specific nosological entity.

The assessment of gastritis based on histopathological criteria was completely changed after recognition of H. pylori as the most common cause of chronic gastritis. The Sydney System was developed as a consequence and has been integrated into clinical practice. The Sydney classification of gastritis combined histological parameters of activity, chronicity, atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, topographical distribution and aetiopathogenic information for reporting the pathology of gastritis in endoscopic biopsies.

As described above, classification of gastritis in the foundation component of ICD11 β version is principally based on causative factors, in order to cover the three most important and best defined categories of gastritis — namely, (a) H. pylori -induced, (b) drug-induced and (c) autoimmune gastritis. A specific diagnosis among these different categories of gastritis is required to direct specific management and treatment strategies. The diagnosis of H. pylori -induced gastritis has major implications for life-long healthcare. H. pylori gastritis may cause dyspeptic symptomsand result in gastroduodenal pathologies, including peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and gastric cancer. The recognised role of H. pylori as a carcinogen makes eradication of H. pylori infection the preferred strategy for the prevention of gastric cancer. There is more to learn about aetiologies other than H. pylori in gastritis and this is dealt with as ' H. pylori -negative or idiopathic gastritis'.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^115YAUbr]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Comment

H. pylori is a major human pathogen that causes chronic and progressive gastric mucosal damage and is aetiologically related to peptic ulcer, gastric cancer and gastric atrophy. It is also closely associated with gastric MALT lymphoma, dyspepsia, hyperplastic gastric polyps and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. H. pylori -positive individuals are also the major reservoir for transmission of the infection.

The decision to eradicate a chronic infection in a society should be based on quantitative data regarding the outcome of untreated infections. H. pylori causes a chronic infection, similar, for example, to asymptomatic syphilis or tuberculosis, and the final outcome for any individual cannot be predicted. H. pylori infection differs from many other chronic infectious diseases because it is always transmissible, thus putting others at risk. Because the gastric damage is progressive, the lack of an obvious clinical manifestation at diagnosis has no predictive value for life-time risk to an individual patient, their family or to the community. Benefits of H. pylori eradication for an individual depend in part on the degree and extent of damage that has already occurred and the reversibility of that damage. Potential benefits of eradication include stopping the progression of mucosal damage, stabilisation or reduction in risk of developing gastric cancer, resolution of mucosal inflammation, stabilisation or improvement of gastric mucosal function, return of the normal mechanisms governing acid secretion, cure of H. pylori -related PUD, reduction in risk of gastrointestinal complications of NSAID therapy and prevention of future development of H. pylori -related peptic ulcer.

For society, the benefits include reduction of the reservoir of infected individuals capable of transmitting the infection to others, and avoidance of the costs associated with diagnosis, management and outcomes of H. pylori -related diseases that are prevented. Thus, H. pylori -infected patients should be offered eradication therapy unless there are competing considerations such as comorbidities, re-infection rates in their communities, competing health priorities of society and financial cost. It has to be remembered, however, that there are concerns about the negative impact of eradication therapies on human health, such as increase in allergy or obesity and perturbation of microbiota.

CQ18. What is the optimal timing for H. pylori eradication in asymptomatic subjects?

Statement 18

The maximum benefit of H. pylori eradication is obtained if it is done while the mucosal damage is still non-atrophic.

Grade of recommendation: strong

Evidence level: high

Consensus level: 100%

### Common occurrence of atrophic gastritis in an ageing non-hospitalised population: an autopsy study [^116w6JHS]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection usually induces acute gastritis with an active inflammation that lasts a few weeks and subsequent chronic inflammation which may become lifelong. Not all patients with H. pylori infections develop chronic gastritis. It is estimated that 20% of acute cases of H. pylori gastritis are self-limiting, most likely due to a combination of bacterial strain diversity, host genetics and environmental factors. Helicobacter pylori infection tends to appear first in the antrum, developing antrum-predominant chronic gastritis, then spread to the corpus, leading to pan-gastritis. During the acute phase, a histological evaluation of gastric mucosa shows an infiltration of neutrophils. When the infection becomes persistent, neutrophils and other polymorphonuclear leukocytes are gradually replaced by mononuclear inflammatory cells. This stage is referred to as chronic gastritis. As the infection progresses, mononuclear cells form organised lymphoid follicles and the inflammation usually becomes less intense. Atrophic gastritis represents the end stage of this inflammatory sequence, with the process from chronic gastritis to chronic gastritis with atrophic changes (atrophic gastritis) advancing gradually over decades, usually while the patient remains asymptomatic. Heartburn and regurgitation are present in ~24% and 12% of the patients, respectively.

### Turn over the new leaf of the treatment in peptic ulcer bleeding: a review of the literature [^111fZfrD]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A peptic ulcer is a mucosal break with a size over 5 mm that forms in the lining of the stomach or the duodenum. Many kinds of etiologies can result in peptic ulcer disease. Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the two major causes of peptic ulcers. Other uncommon etiologies for peptic ulcers are named Hp-negative, NSAID-negative ulcers, including gastrinoma (Zollinger–Ellison syndrome), gastric malignancy (adenocarcinoma and lymphoma), Crohn disease, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, viral infections, Behcet disease, acute stress, and mucosal ischemia.

Gastric acid, bicarbonate, and digestive enzymes compose the gastric environment with a dynamic pH value between 1.5 and 3. In normal conditions, protective mechanisms of the stomach can protect and repair the gastric mucosa. When an imbalance between gastric acid and mucosal protection occurs, such as gastric acid hypersecretion and impaired duodenal bicarbonate secretion, it may result in peptic ulcer disease. Hp infection can disrupt the protective mucous layer, causing gastritis and impair the mucosa healing. Hp-induced antral inflammation can also increase basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion.NSAIDs inhibit mucosal prostaglandin synthesis, which can reduce the mucosa blood flow, the integrity of the mucosal barrier, and the amount of bicarbonate.

Common symptoms of peptic ulcers include epigastric pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting, and in severe cases, bleeding or perforation of the stomach or duodenum. The most common complication of peptic ulcers in emergency departments is bleeding, approximately 100–170 per 100,000 worldwide. Peptic ulcer bleeding is a serious medical condition causing hematemesis, melena (tarry stool), or hematochezia. Patients without timely treatment can progress into anemia, hypovolemic shock, multiorgan failure, or even death. The mortality rate of peptic ulcer bleeding is approximately 5%–12%. Therefore, clinicians have been dedicated to developing the most effective treatment for peptic ulcer bleeding for decades.

### Ulcers and gastritis [^114VDMWq]. Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

This article reviews recently published literature regarding ulcers and gastritis. Although endoscopy is the most useful procedure for diagnosis in the upper gastrointestinal tract, complications do occur, and procedure-related costs are significant. The appropriate indication for endoscopy has recently been debated. Helicobacter pylori is known to be an important pathogen involved in gastric and duodenal inflammation. Peptic ulcer disease and severe gastric mucosal injury are caused by virulent strains, and many reports have focused on CagA. Follow-up studies on surveillance endoscopy in patients with peptic ulcer or gastritis report that patients with atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia are at significantly higher risk for gastric cancer. H. pylori eradication sometimes causes gastroduodenal erosion and reflux esophagitis, and the mechanisms involved have been revealed. Proton-pump inhibitors are useful in the treatment of ulcers caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), reflux esophagitis, and for preventing rebleeding after endoscopic hemostasis, but the effect of long-term acid suppression on the gastric mucosa is still a matter of debate. H. pylori infection and NSAID intake are both risk factors for peptic ulcer disease, and are important aspects in this field.

Endoscopy Findings

Similar to the majority of CG patients experiencing at least one symptom, most patients also show some form of gastric abnormality on endoscopy, with only 10% showing normal endoscopy. The most common endoscopic finding is gastric mucosal nodularity, seen in more than half of patients, with a significant minority by contrast showing mucosal atrophy. Descriptions of the nodularity by endoscopists can vary, with appearances resembling polypoid lesions, prominent rugae or oedematous mucosa. Less common findings include friability, erythema, erosion and ulceration, scarring and, in rare cases, haemorrhage. A representative case demonstrating these findings is shown in Figure 1. Although nodularity/polypoid mucosa are endoscopic abnormalities that warrant biopsy and microscopic examination, it is the biopsy of the area in between the nodules that has a higher diagnostic yield, as the collagen bands frequently only appear in between the nodules.

Figure 1
A 60‐year‐old underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy for evaluation of abdominal pain. Endoscopy revealed diffusely nodular lesions in gastric body/fundic mucosa (A), associated with mucosal friability and haemorrhage (B) and sparing of antral mucosa (C). Histologic evaluation demonstrated an atrophic pattern of collagenous gastritis in the body/fundic mucosa (D, H&E, 100×).

Among the subset of reviewed cases with delineated endoscopic findings, the abnormalities are most commonly observed diffusely across the stomach, followed by a gastric corpus‐predominant pattern and then an antrum‐predominant pattern. In one cohort of 40 patients, 71% of patients exhibited a corpus‐predominant involvement and 12.5% antrum‐predominant involvement. Another large cohort of 31 patients reported 70% of patients having both corpus and antrum involvement. Some CG patients showed unrelated endoscopic findings such as fundic gland polyps and hiatal hernia. Beyond the stomach, the duodenum is frequently involved endoscopically in CG, often presenting as nodularity, or inflammation.

### Gastroduodenal mucosal defense: coordination by a network of messengers and mediators [^116REM8a]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Gastroduodenal mucosal defense is composed of structural features of the mucosa, cellular monitors of pending or actual injury, and a web of effector cells that protect the mucosa from damage and govern its recovery from injury. By virtue of these systems, the gastroduodenal mucosa can cope with the harmful ingredients of ingested food and the potentially deleterious effects of gastric acid and pepsin. It is increasingly appreciated that a network of chemical messengers coordinates the alarm, defensive, and healing mechanisms. This article highlights some of the advances from the past year that have furthered our understanding of the regulatory systems that govern gastroduodenal mucosal homeostasis. Particular emphasis is given to control of the mucous and epithelial phospholipid barriers, the mucosal microcirculation, and the epithelial, neural, immune, and inflammatory mediators of the mucosal repair mechanisms.

### Role of vitamin dcombined to alginates in preventing acid and oxidative injury in cultured gastric epithelial cells [^111v4pRi]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The impact of gastric diseases (for example chronic gastritis, duodenal and gastric ulceration, adenocarcinoma and gastric MALT lymphoma) on human health is a worldwide problem in modern society. For example in the USA, studies have reported gastrointestinal illness rates in the range of 0.5–2 episodes/year/person and incidence of 5–100 episodes/1000/week according to seasons and age. The number of episodes of gastrointestinal illnesses is similar in both 40-year-old studies and in recent ones. Human stomach is extremely vulnerable to various attacks; trauma can cause erosion and mucosal epithelium damage which lead to gastrointestinal tract bleeding and/or ulcer perforation and finally worsen the original disease. The gastrointestinal epithelium is a fundamental barrier protecting the gastrointestinal mucosa from damage against the outside environment. The cytoprotective functions against damage may be accomplished in the early phase of epithelial repair known as restitution, which is the ability of epithelial cells to spread and migrate across the basement membrane to repair the damage. This event is the basis of repair of mucosae after injury and is an important element to grant continuity over broad areas within hours. This reparative event occurs rapidly. The damage to gastric mucosa deriving from stress ulcer has been shown in in vivo models to be possibly repaired within 24 h. Gastric acid (HCl) secreted from gastric parietal cells has been reported to determine gastric mucosal injuries such as peptic ulcer and to induce gastropathy. A prolonged exposition to strong acidic environment causes coagulation necrosis resulting from the desiccating action of the acid on proteins in exposed tissues. A mild gastritis condition is often associated with overindulgence in food and alcohol or stress and each episode causes more lasting damage, eventually resulting in cellular injury which in turn causes inflammation. Consequent inflammation produces free radicals which in turn create even more tissue destruction eventually injuring DNA and potentially leading to stomach cancer, which is one of the most lethal malignancies known so far. In addition, HCl enhances the process of lipid peroxidation in gastric mucosa; the dissipation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential thus induces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by mitochondria causing lipid peroxidation. ROS, including H 2 O 2, are a major cause of cellular oxidative damage and they play a critical role in the pathogenesis of gastric disorders. Under physiological conditions, gastric epithelium is exposed to high levels of ROS, derived from physical, chemical, or microbiological agents existing in gastric lumen, far higher than in other tissues or biological fluids. Accumulation of intracellular ROS is caused by incomplete reduction of oxygen and this imbalance leads to oxidative stress. H 2 O 2 is a stable, small and uncharged molecule, that freely diffuses through cell membranes. An excessive level of H 2 O 2 causes apoptosis, necrosis, and other oxidative damages. When the lower esophageal sphincter is weak, the acid unnaturally moves up into the esophagus, causing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), whose cardinal symptom is heartburn, mainly occurring postprandially.

### Beyond Helicobacter: dealing with other variants of gastritis-an algorithmic approach [^117TF7Fo]. Histopathology (2021). Medium credibility.

In daily practice, the presence of inflammation in gastric biopsies prompts a mental algorithm, an early question being whether the lesion present is Helicobacter-associated. If Helicobacter organisms are not found, then there is a further algorithm, governed by the predominant type of inflammatory cells present, and the presence of other features such as intraepithelial lymphocytosis, a subepithelial collagen band, granulomas, coexisting chronic inflammation, focality, and superimposed reactive changes including erosions and ulcers. Each of these generates its own differential diagnosis. If no inflammation is present, then the two major changes specifically looked for are the changes associated with hypergastrinaemia, by far the most common cause of which is treatment with proton pump inhibitors, and reactive changes. These may be present with and without accompanying inflammation, and, when the epithelial changes dominate, the term gastropathy is preferred. In this article, we present an approach to non-Helicobacter inflammation and gastropathies.

Splanchnic ischaemia is an important problem in patients with large burns. This reports the case of an 11-year-old boy with 70% full-thickness TBSA burns who sustained multiple episodes of severe gastrointestinal haemorrhage due to both extensive ischaemic enterocolitis and severe gastric ulceration which required surgical intervention on several occasions. Causative mechanisms of splanchnic ischaemia in this patient including increased mesenteric vascular resistance, abdominal compartment syndrome and enteric feeding, are considered.

Collagenous gastritis is a distinctive disorder characterized by thickening of the subepithelial collagen layer in the gastric mucosa. Although this entity was recognized in 1989, its etiology, pathogenesis, and clinicopathologic features remain poorly understood because of its rarity. An unusual case of collagenous gastritis was observed in a 37-year-old man who presented with profound weight loss, a feature that has not previously been emphasized.

### Pathology of non-infective gastritis [^1158cJVG]. Histopathology (2007). Low credibility.

The discovery of Helicobacter pylori and its intimate role in the development of the most common form of chronic gastritis has elicited a much-needed interest in non-neoplastic gastric pathology. This has been paralleled by an increase in upper endoscopic examinations, which allow recognition of novel patterns and distribution of mucosal injury. Numerous attempts at classification have been made, most based on the acuteness or chronicity of gastric mucosal injury. In this review, we will not offer a new classification but present a detailed description of the major clinicopathological entities, based either on the salient morphological features or the underlying aetiologies, i.e. iatrogenic, autoimmune, vascular or idiopathic.

### Gastric acid and digestive physiology [^111pdyCv]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The primary function of the stomach is to prepare food for digestion and absorption by the intestine. Acid production is the unique and central component of the stomach's contribution to the digestive process. Acid bathes the food bolus while stored in the stomach, facilitating digestion. An intact defense against mucosal damage by the stomach's acid is essential to avoid ulceration. This article focuses on the physiology of gastric acid production, the stomach's defense mechanisms against acid injury, and the most common challenges to the gastric defenses. A brief description of the stomach's nonacid digestive capabilities is included.

### Phase III, randomised, double-blind, multicentre study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vonoprazan compared with lansoprazole in Asian patients with erosive oesophagitis [^117NrKDT]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Participants

Eligible patients had endoscopically confirmed EO (LA classification grades A–D) within 14 days of randomisation (treated as outpatients or temporarily admitted) and aged ≥ 18 years. Key exclusion criteria were prior exposure to vonoprazan or lansoprazole within 84 days of the observation phase, or exposure to vonoprazan at any time in a previous clinical trial or as a therapeutic agent; hypersensitivity or allergy to vonoprazan, its excipients or to PPIs; significant history of central nervous system, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, metabolic, GI, urological, endocrine or haematological disease; presence of comorbidities or medical or surgical history that could affect the oesophagus; acute upper GI bleeding or gastric or duodenal ulcer within 30 days of the observation phase; history of or treatment for malignancy within 5 years of visit 1; and creatinine > 2 mg/dL (> 177 μmol/L), or alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or total bilirubin greater than the upper limit of normal at the start of the observation phase.

Study endpoints and assessments

The primary efficacy endpoint was EO healing rate at 8 weeks. The secondary efficacy endpoints were EO healing rates at 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. Endoscopy was performed at the start of the screening period and at weeks 2, 4 and 8 (or on early termination) under fasted conditions and classified in terms of LA classification grades (A–D or no mucosal breaks (grade O)). EO healing was defined as 'no mucosal breaks'. During the 8-week treatment period, healed EO was confirmed from any endoscopy test performed at visit 3, 4 or 6. During the 2-week treatment period, healed EO was confirmed at visit 3 and during the 4-week treatment period at visit 3 or 4.

Additional efficacy endpoints included the subjective symptoms of EO as recorded in patient diaries (eg, heart burn, gastric acid regurgitation), HRQoL over 8 weeks and the percentage of days without rescue medication during treatment. Safety endpoints included adverse events (AEs), laboratory test values, ECG, vital signs, serum gastrin values and pepsinogen I/II values. AEs and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities V.18.0.

### Esophageal emergencies: WSES guidelines [^111nS4Q2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

What are the possible etiologies and how do they affect the clinical presentation and the therapeutic options?

Strong acids and alkalis are responsible for most severe caustic injuries to the gastrointestinal tract. Identification of the nature, the physical form, and the quantity of the ingested agent as well as the accidental-voluntary ingestion pattern are the cornerstones for emergency management of corrosive injuries (Grade 2A). Contacting Poison Control Centers to evaluate systemic toxicity of the ingested agents is recommended (Grade 2B). In case of massive ingestion, both acids and alkalis may induce extensive necrosis of the gastrointestinal tract. Oxidants (bleach) usually cause mild injuries but severe damage requiring emergency resection has been occasionally reported. Ingestion of ammonia results in superficial hemorrhagic gastritis which may progress during the first 24–48 h and requires specific surveillance. The quantity of ingested corrosive agent is related to the accidental/voluntary pattern of ingestion; this is the most important prognostic factor although reliable information is usually lacking. The physical form of the ingested substance is another major determinant of the damage pattern to the gastrointestinal tract. Solids produce maximum damage to the mouth and the pharynx, while liquids transit rapidly and induce burns of the esophagus and the stomach; concomitant vapor aspiration (ammonia, formaldehyde) may cause airway burns. Caregivers should be aware that specific corrosives may also cause severe systemic effects such as hypocalcemia (phosphoric, hydrofluoric acids), hyponatremia (strong acids/alkalis), hypokalemia, and acidosis.

What are the appropriate biochemical and imaging investigations?

Initial laboratory evaluation of caustic injuries should include CBC, serum concentrations of sodium, potassium, chlorine, magnesium, calcium, urea creatinine, liver tests (bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase), pH and serum lactate, blood alcohol levels, and measurement of β-HCG in young women (Grade 2A). Laboratory and imaging findings have an important role in identifying patients with transmural necrosis who might benefit from emergency surgical treatment. As initial normal laboratory values do not rule out transmural necrosis, kinetics of laboratory data is useful in patient monitoring and management. Abnormal values such as severe acidosis (low pH, high blood lactate levels), deranged liver function tests, leukocytosis, elevated CRP level, renal failure, and thrombocytopenia are predictive of transmural necrosis and poor outcomes.

### A reappraisal of the pathophysiology of Cushing ulcer: a narrative review [^117CUadN]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

In 1932, Harvey Cushing described peptic ulceration secondary to raised intracranial pressure and attributed this to vagal overactivity, causing excess gastric acid secretion. Cushing ulcer remains a cause of morbidity in patients, albeit one that is preventable. This narrative review evaluates the evidence pertaining to the pathophysiology of neurogenic peptic ulceration. Review of the literature suggests that the pathophysiology of Cushing ulcer may extend beyond vagal mechanisms for several reasons: (1) clinical and experimental studies have shown only a modest increase in gastric acid secretion in head-injured patients; (2) increased vagal tone is found in only a minority of cases of intracranial hypertension, most of which are related to catastrophic, nonsurvivable brain injury; (3) direct stimulation of the vagus nerve does not cause peptic ulceration, and; (4) Cushing ulcer can occur after acute ischemic stroke, but only a minority of strokes are associated with raised intracranial pressure and/or increased vagal tone. The 2005 Nobel Prize in Medicine honored the discovery that bacteria play key roles in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer disease. Brain injury results in widespread changes in the gut microbiome in addition to gastrointestinal inflammation, including systemic upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. Alternations in the gut microbiome in patients with severe traumatic brain injury include colonization with commensal flora associated with peptic ulceration. The brain-gut-microbiome axis integrates the central nervous system, the enteric nervous system, and the immune system. Following the review of the literature, we propose a novel hypothesis that neurogenic peptic ulcer may be associated with alterations in the gut microbiome, resulting in gastrointestinal inflammation leading to ulceration.

### Outcomes of patients with traumatic brain injury after stress ulcer prophylaxis: a retrospective multicenter study [^1149nQXj]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Given the low incidence of CSGIBs observed in this study, SUP benefits may be questionable, especially among severely injured patients. These results support prior research indicating a higher incidence of pneumonia in patients receiving prophylaxis, consistent with this study's observations. Considering that almost all pneumonia cases occurred in mechanically ventilated patients receiving prophylaxis, it is difficult to solely attribute pneumonia development to prophylaxis. Determining associations with pneumonia across studies is also challenging due to discrepancies in pneumonia definitions, contributing to result heterogeneity. A comprehensive meta-analysis by Wang et al revealed an increased pneumonia risk with both H2RAs and PPIs in critically ill adults, while other trials and reviews found no significant differences in pneumonia rates by prophylaxis type. Nevertheless, this underscores the need for cautious administration of SUP in critically ill patients. Differences in other complications by prophylaxis treatment were not significantly different between groups. Additionally, it is important to note that no deaths or other complications were observed among patients with CSGIBs. While previous studies on CSGIB mortality risk have produced conflicting results, with some suggesting increased mortality rates from bleeds, others, including Harhay et al, suggest that the majority of upper GI bleeds in this context are non-fatal and do not significantly impact mortality, but that caution should be taken when administering SUP in patients with high illness severity. These findings underscore the significance of a balanced approach when making prophylaxis decisions in clinical practice.

This study had several limitations. First, the retrospective nature of the study limits its generalizability to trauma centers with different patient populations. Nevertheless, the inclusion of six level I trauma centers balances this limitation. Second, with the strict definition of CSGIB used in this study it is possible that patients with lower grade GI bleeds were missed. Regardless, endoscopy remains the gold standard for diagnosing stress gastropathy-related GI bleeding in critical illness. Third, we were unable to confirm the specific qualifiers for the NTDS definition of VAP and we did not collect if the reason for the pneumonia was early aspiration. Fourth, there was no differentiation between intravenous or oral route of administration for SUP. Fifth, the risk of skipped doses was not assessed. Lastly, due to limitations with data collection, enteral feeding in the study was defined as any adult diet ordered or any amount of tube feeding administered. This definition was non-specific and may have included patients who were not receiving adequate enteral nutrition to provide gut prophylaxis.

### Practical approach to the pathologic diagnosis of gastritis [^112oALwp]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Context

Most types of gastritis can be diagnosed on hematoxylin-eosin stains. The most common type of chronic gastritis is Helicobacter pylori gastritis. Reactive or chemical gastropathy, which is often associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use or bile reflux, is common in most practices. The diagnosis of atrophic gastritis can be challenging if few biopsy samples are available and if the location of the biopsies in the stomach is not known, such as when random biopsies are sampled in one jar. If the biopsy site is not known, immunohistochemical stains, such as a combination of synaptophysin and gastrin, are useful in establishing the biopsy location.

Objective

To demonstrate a practical approach to achieving a pathologic diagnosis of gastritis by evaluating a limited number of features in mucosal biopsies.

Data Source

In this article, we present several representative gastric biopsy cases from a gastrointestinal pathology practice to demonstrate the practical application of basic histopathologic methods for the diagnosis of gastritis.

Conclusions

Limited ancillary tests are usually required for a diagnosis of gastritis. In some cases, special stains, such as acid-fast stains, and immunohistochemical stains, such as for H pylori and viruses, can be useful. Helicobacter pylori immunohistochemical stains can particularly contribute (1) when moderate to severe, chronic gastritis or active gastritis is present but no Helicobacter organisms are identified upon hematoxylin-eosin stain; (2) when extensive intestinal metaplasia is present; and (3) in follow-up biopsies, after antibiotic treatment for H pylori.

### Stress prophylaxis in intensive care unit patients and the role of enteral nutrition [^111nSBxe]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Use of acid-suppressive therapy (AST) to prevent stress gastropathy in the intensive care unit has grown rapidly over the past 20 years. The primary indications for such use of AST include need for mechanical ventilation, overt gastrointestinal bleeding, severe burn, and head trauma. Despite this limited list of indications, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) often are overprescribed for purposes of stress prophylaxis. Decreased mucosal blood flow with subsequent tissue ischemia is thought to be the mechanism responsible for stress-induced gastropathy. Subsequent activation of inflammatory and vasoconstrictive mediators determines the severity of the gastropathy. Numerous basic science studies suggest that enteral nutrition (EN) can improve mucosal blood flow and reverse the generation of these inflammatory mediators. Clinical studies evaluating the effectiveness of EN vs acid-suppressive medications, however, have shown variable results (and there are no randomized controlled trials to date). In hypersecretory states (such as head trauma and burns), AST should be given, even in patients who are tolerating EN. In the absence of a hypersecretory state, pharmacologic AST may be avoided or discontinued in patients who are tolerating EN. Stress prophylaxis medications also should be discontinued in patients who do not have a clear indication for their use. Overt bleeding in a patient receiving EN for stress prophylaxis should prompt the initiation of a PPI. Randomized controlled studies investigating the efficacy of EN for stress ulcer prophylaxis are needed. Protocols should be developed to alert healthcare teams to consider discontinuation of AST, especially when tolerance of EN is achieved.

### Ulcers and gastritis [^113RCzZX]. Endoscopy (2004). Low credibility.

Significant advances continue to be made in the area of gastritis and ulcer disease. Studies to identify the most appropriate use of capsule endoscopy have now confirmed that it is superior to other methods for identifying small-bowel mucosal pathology and sites of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. It has increasingly been recognized that the complications of ulcer disease are secondary to the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and to interactions between NSAIDs and Helicobacter pylori. Effective prophylaxis for NSAID ulcers in H. pylori-negative individuals continues to be a challenge, as it has become clear that conclusions from studies focusing on "endoscopic ulcers" in patients whose H. pylori status was unknown provided a false sense of security. The concept of multifocal atrophic gastritis has been challenged. The precursor lesion to gastric cancer now appears to be a sheet of pseudopyloric metaplasia advancing into the gastric body with islands of intestinal metaplasia embedded within it. Multifactorial models such as those proposed for understanding periodontal disease, including the organism, environmental factors, and host factors, appear particularly applicable to understanding the pathogenesis of H. pylori-associated gastric cancer.

### Risk factors for stress-related upper gastrointestinal bleeding: more than a gut feeling [^114wLaMT]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

With so many analyses, what should clinicians conclude are risk factors (or not risk factors) for stress-related UGIB? First and foremost, patients must be critically ill. Studies consistently demonstrate the risk of UGIB increases with greater baseline severity of illness. Although all patients in the REVISE study required invasive intubation, mechanical ventilation alone does not appear to be an independent risk factor in other assessments. Instead, the reason for or the extent of ventilatory support may contribute to the characterization of critical illness. Shock and the use of vasopressors are consistently found to be associated with UGIB, likely because they indicate some degree of mesenteric ischemia. Impaired clotting function from coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and possibly the use of platelet inhibitor medications or chronic liver disease hastens UGIB. Acute kidney injury or the need for renal replacement therapy may signify ischemia or contribute to clotting dysfunction, both posing risk for UGIB. Also important to clinicians are parameters that do not appear associated with UGIB and should not be considered risks for UGIB. These include the use of corticosteroids, therapeutic anticoagulation, and admission type (surgery vs. medical vs. trauma). Last, enteral nutrition, either by physiological mechanisms or as a surrogate marker of a functioning gastrointestinal tract, reduces the risk of UGIB.

Although the average duration of stress ulcer prophylaxis in controlled studies is 3–5 days, practice assessments frequently demonstrate much longer therapies. Moreover, about one-third of patients are unnecessarily discharged from the hospital on acid suppressants, potentially putting them at risk for adverse events or drug interactions. So, although defining risks for UGIB is essential to the appropriate initiation of therapy, my gut feeling is that knowing when a factor no longer poses risk may be even more important so that therapy can be safely discontinued.

### Outcomes of patients with traumatic brain injury after stress ulcer prophylaxis: a retrospective multicenter study [^1139Vc5Q]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and other neurological trauma are at heightened risk for developing gastric stress ulcers during their hospital stay because of increased intracranial pressure and overstimulation of the vagus nerve, which can cause excess production of gastric acid as well as general hypoperfusion of the gut due to the stress of critical illness. Stress ulcers are considered a severe complication among critically ill patients and are associated with increased risk for in-hospital complications, such as clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeds (CSGIBs), pneumonia, and mortality. To prevent stress ulcers from developing, pharmacologic stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) is commonly administered to critically ill and high-risk patients, initiated at either hospital arrival or on admittance to the intensive care unit (ICU). Commonly used SUP options include histamine 2 blockers, also called H2 receptor antagonists or H2RAs, which increase gastric pH and are the most commonly used prophylaxis methods; proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which inhibit acid secretion; and antacids. However, there are conflicting reports on selecting the appropriate patient population to receive SUP, as well as which prophylaxis method is preferable in both reducing the risk of stress ulcers and minimizing adverse events. Current guidelines for administration of SUP from the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma include TBI, multitrauma, and ICU patients with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 15. A meta-analysis of 63 randomized controlled trials reported that H2RAs decrease the incidence of overt and CSGIB better than antacids in critically ill patients, yet patients receiving H2RAs had a higher incidence of pneumonia, as well as higher mortality, compared with sucralfate. The PEPTIC trial compared PPIs and H2RAs in critically ill patients, and there was no difference in all-cause mortality, but possibly lower rates of CSGIBs with PPIs. In separate studies, patients on PPIs had higher rates of in-hospital pneumonia than those on H2RAs and antacids. A review published in 2020 suggested that PPIs may lead to increased risk of death, over that posed by ulcer-related gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, among the subgroup of patients with high-severity trauma or illness.

### Burns: pathophysiology of systemic complications and current management [^116QWagE]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

In recent years, advances have been made in the overall understanding of burn injury. Basic science studies have slowly begun to uncover the complex mechanisms involved in the systemic response to burn. Clinical trials are still largely limited to the assessment of managing and treating burn injuries. Thus, treatment advancements have come in part through observation of physicians in the clinical setting. Translation of results from basic science studies to improved clinical therapies for treatment of burn victims has been modest, and increased numbers of clinical trials of novel therapeutic approaches for burn should be a priority in the years ahead.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^112sMz11]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Critically ill patients are at increased risk of developing stress-related mucosal disease and subsequent stress-ulcer bleeding as a result of both their underlying disease and therapeutic interventions. There are some well-established strong, independent risk factors for stress-related mucosal disease, respiratory failure and coagulopathy being the most relevant ones, with an OR of 15.6 and 4.3, respectively. Other important factors include acute renal or hepatic failure, sepsis, hypotension, severe head or spinal cord injury, thermal injury involving more than 35% of the body surface area, acute lung injury, major surgery (lasting more than 4 hours), and history of GI bleeding.

Although no single study or meta-analysis has reported a decrease in the overall mortality related to SUP, guidelines from the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists and Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommend routine prophylaxis with acid suppressive therapy for high-risk patients. The rationale for this recommendation relies on the finding that important GI bleeding is strongly associated with prolonged ICU stay and increased mortality. Indeed, three large meta-analyses found that the risk of bleeding in ICU is reduced by some 60% in patients receiving SUP compared with those treated with placebo or no prophylaxis. Therefore, SUP has become the standard of care in the ICU, sometimes irrespective of the presence of risk factors. The benefit of SUP using real-world data is, however, not easy to estimate because of the lack of a control group.

### Corrosive ingestion in adults [^113oAaD4]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Ingestion of a corrosive substance can produce severe injury to the gastrointestinal tract and can even result in death. The degree and extent of damage depends on several factors like the type of substance, the morphologic form of the agent, the quantity, and the intent. In the acute stage, perforation and necrosis may occur. Long-term complications include stricture formation in the esophagus, antral stenosis and the development of esophageal carcinoma. Endoscopy should be attempted and can be safely performed in most cases to assess the extent of damage. Procedure-related perforation is rare. Stricture formation is more common in patients with second and third degree burns. Corticosteroids may help prevent stricture formation. Esophageal carcinoma may develop beginning 30 to 40 years after the time of injury.

Collagenous gastritis, collagenous sprue, and collagenous colitis share striking histologic similarities and occur together in some patients. They also share some drug and disease associations. Pediatric cases of collagenous gastritis, however, lack most of these associations. The etiologies of the collagenous gastroenteritides are not known, so it is not clear whether they are similar because they share pathogeneses, or because they indicate a common histologic response to varying injuries. The features, disease and drug associations, and the inquiries into the pathogenesis of these disorders are reviewed.

Imaging

Imaging studies are not commonly used in the diagnosis of CG. Among reviewed cases, fewer than a quarter of patients underwent some form of imaging, generally as part of a broader evaluation for generalized abdominal symptoms. Accordingly, conventional imaging modalities such as abdominal CT and X‐ray were most often employed to assess abdominal pain, diarrhoea or constipation, or constitutional symptoms including weight loss and failure to thrive. In one patient, an abdominal X‐ray performed for acute abdominal pain revealed subdiaphragmatic free air, suggestive of gastrointestinal perforation. Other imaging techniques including barium radiography, CT enterography and MRI, by contrast, were performed in a smaller subset of patients, often as part of a targeted gastrointestinal workup, for symptoms such as dysphagia, or in the context of gastric cancer surveillance.

When performed, barium radiography and endoscopic ultrasound were the most likely to demonstrate abnormalities attributable to CG. Barium studies may show a mosaic‐like gastric mucosal pattern, while ultrasonography may reveal gastric mucosal thickening, findings that could be contributory to the final diagnosis. However, neither barium studies nor endoscopic ultrasound are sufficiently sensitive or specific to reliably exclude CG.CT and MRI demonstrate even lower diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, rarely identifying abnormalities attributable to CG when performed.

### Update on the pathologic approach to the diagnosis of gastritis, gastric atrophy, and Helicobacter pylori and its sequelae [^115eMBZS]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Biopsy sampling of the gastric mucosa at diagnostic endoscopy provides information that cannot be obtained otherwise. The most common indication for gastric biopsy is the need to know whether the patient is infected with Helicobacter pylori or not and whether the stomach is gastritic or not. Microscopic examination of gastric biopsy specimens gives, in addition to H. pylori status, information about the grade, extent, and topography of gastritis- and atrophy-related alterations in the gastric mucosa. This information provides further possibilities for the assessment of risk and likelihood of various gastric disorders. The presence of atrophy (loss of mucosal glands) results in failures in secretory functions of the corresponding mucosa and leads to errors in the homeostasis of normal gastric physiology. The grade of atrophy of the corpus mucosa linearly correlates with peak and maximal output of acid. The presence of advanced (moderate or severe) corpus atrophy indicates an extremely hypochlorhydric or achlorhydric stomach in which, for example, ordinary peptic ulcer is unlikely or impossible in spite of a possible H. pylori infection. Some well characterized and common topographic phenotypes of H. pylori gastritis and atrophic gastritis can be delineated as follows: Predominance or restriction of the H. pylori-related inflammation in antrum, in association with a nonatrophic corpus mucosa — of which phenotype is the most common — and with an increased risk of peptic ulcer disease, duodenal ulcer in particular ("duodenal ulcer phenotype" of gastritis); the presence of atrophic gastritis in corpus of the stomach ("corpus predominant gastritis"), which indicates a low risk of peptic ulcer and a reduction in the capacity of the patient to secrete acid; the occurrence of advanced atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia multifocally in the stomach (advanced "multifocal atrophic gastritis"), which are features of a gastritis type and which also indicate a low acid secretion capacity and an increased risk of gastric neoplasias ("gastric cancer phenotype of gastritis"), suggesting a need for a careful exclusion of concomitant presence of small focal neoplastic or dysplastic lesions; and the presence of normal and healthy gastric mucosa, which indicates an extremely low risk of both peptic ulcer disease or gastric cancer and, therefore, is a finding of high clinical relevance. The presence of duodenal or gastric ulcer in conjunction with normal, healthy gastric mucosa suggests either aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs to be the most likely cause of the ulcer.

### Inflammation reduction pack [^114uEKJ7]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

The US trial indicated that ranitidine 150 mg twice daily significantly reduced the frequency of heartburn attacks and severity of heartburn pain within 1 to 2 weeks after starting therapy. The improvement was maintained throughout the 6-week trial period. Moreover, patient response rates demonstrated that the effect on heartburn extends through both the day and night time periods.

In 2 additional US multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-week trials, ranitidine 150 mg twice daily was shown to provide relief of heartburn pain within 24 hours of initiating therapy and a reduction in the frequency of severity of heartburn.

Erosive Esophagitis:

In 2 multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 12-week trials performed in the United States, ranitidine 150 mg 4 times daily was significantly more effective than placebo in healing endoscopically diagnosed erosive esophagitis and in relieving associated heartburn. The erosive esophagitis healing rates were as follows:

No additional benefit in healing of esophagitis or in relief of heartburn was seen with a ranitidine dose of 300 mg 4 times daily.

Maintenance of Healing of Erosive Esophagitis:

In 2 multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 48-week trials conducted in patients whose erosive esophagitis had been previously healed, ranitidine 150 mg twice daily was significantly more effective than placebo in maintaining healing of erosive esophagitis.

### Pathogenesis of Helicobacter pylori infection [^112FL3CM]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infects over half of the world population. Infection with the bacterium causes gastritis and peptic ulcer disease and is associated with the development of gastric cancers. However, only a small proportion of individuals develop these complications of infection. Therefore, identification of both host and bacterial factors that mediate disease is an intense area of current research interest. This review highlights recent advances in understanding of the mechanisms underlying disease pathophysiology following infection with H. pylori.

### Chronic gastritis… [^112XSzFX]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Gastroscopy with multiple biopsies shows that in severe chronic gastritis the mucosal pattern is distorted by irregular distribution of the gastric glands, increased numbers of mucus-secreting cells, and inflammatory infiltration of the stroma. The pattern of symptoms and failure to respond to antacids also distinguish chronic gastritis from the typical peptic ulcer. Ninety-two patients with chronic gastritis were treated with bed rest, sedatives, gastric suction, meals planned not to exceed the patient's critical volume, and a combination of aluminum hydroxide gel with oxethazaine hydrochloride, a topical anesthetic. While the severe forms of chronic gastritis were refractory to this treatment, the moderate and mild forms proved amenable, and the combination of antacid and anesthetic afforded relief from pain for periods up to six hours after each dose. Medication was continued for six days to 18 months without evidence of significant side-effects.
