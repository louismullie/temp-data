## Question

initial treatment for MDS

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about initial treatment for myelodysplastic syndromes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial diagnostic and risk-stratification workup. Then, I should classify patients into lower- versus higher-risk categories and confirm how IPSS-R and IPSS-M influence that split. Next, I will outline initial management for lower-risk MDS, including ESAs, luspatercept, lenalidomide, and when to use hypomethylating agents. After that, I will detail initial management for higher-risk MDS, emphasizing hypomethylating agents, transplant evaluation, and bridging strategies. Finally, I should integrate supportive care, special populations, and a concise decision algorithm, while double-checking key thresholds and guideline nuances throughout.

> Let me first confirm the foundational steps in the initial evaluation, because treatment hinges on accurate diagnosis and risk assignment. I need to ensure a full blood count with differential, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy with cytogenetics, and comprehensive molecular testing are obtained, and that pathology coordinates a unified report integrating morphology, cytogenetics, and molecular results; this is standard in NCCN and contemporary practice statements and directly informs therapy selection and prognostication [^1155wvz4]. Hold on, I should verify prognostic scoring: IPSS-R is preferred for initial risk stratification, with IPSS-M considered where available to refine risk, and I must remember that IPSS-R intermediate-risk patients with a score ≤ 3.5 are often managed as lower risk, whereas those with > 3.5 are managed as higher risk, which materially changes first-line choices [^112uNk1f] [^1175vYqN] [^1156Lhyc].

> Next, I should review how to categorize patients into lower- versus higher-risk groups, since this drives goals of care and treatment intensity. Lower-risk MDS generally includes IPSS low/intermediate-1, IPSS-R very low/low/intermediate ≤ 3.5, and WPSS very low/low/intermediate, where the therapeutic aim is hematologic improvement and quality-of-life gains; higher-risk MDS includes IPSS intermediate-2/high, IPSS-R intermediate > 3.5/high/very high, and WPSS high/very high, where altering natural history and prolonging survival are paramount, and transplant evaluation is urgent when appropriate [^1112gXvA] [^1168bYSn]. Wait, let me verify the intermediate-risk nuance again: yes, IPSS-R intermediate ≤ 3.5 behaves more like lower risk clinically, whereas > 3.5 behaves like higher risk, and this distinction should be explicitly documented in the plan [^1175vYqN] [^1156Lhyc].

> I will now examine initial management for lower-risk MDS, starting with symptomatic anemia, because that is the most common driver of therapy. ESAs such as epoetin alfa or darbepoetin are appropriate first-line for anemia in lower-risk MDS without del(5q), with better responses expected when serum EPO is ≤ 500 mU/mL and especially ≤ 200 mU/mL; typical targets are hemoglobin 10–12 g/dL, and I should avoid exceeding 12 g/dL to mitigate thrombotic risk, with reassessment for response after about 3–4 months and discontinuation if no benefit is seen [^115pQKMa] [^1163iz8z] [^115sx7pF] [^112Z2LuN] [^115uJyQK]. Hold on, I should verify the role of G-CSF: adding G-CSF can improve ESA response in selected patients, but it should be used judiciously and not as a blanket strategy [^115uJyQK].

> For patients with ring sideroblasts or SF3B1 mutation, I need to check whether luspatercept should displace ESAs as first-line. The COMMANDS phase III trial demonstrated superiority of luspatercept over ESA in ESA-naïve, lower-risk MDS with anemia, achieving higher transfusion independence and hemoglobin improvements; thus, luspatercept is a preferred option in this molecular phenotype, and I should consider it earlier in sequence rather than only after ESA failure in appropriate patients [^115p8GZC]. But wait, what if the patient is transfusion-independent and ESA-naïve? The ELEMENT-MDS trial is exploring luspatercept versus epoetin to prevent transfusion dependence in that exact population, which may further shift practice if positive, so I should keep an eye on those data and discuss trial options when suitable [^115p8GZC].

> Now, for del(5q) lower-risk MDS, I should confirm lenalidomide's role. Lenalidomide is a category 1 preferred regimen for symptomatic anemia in del(5q) MDS, with typical dosing of 10 mg/day for 21 of 28 days or continuously, and responses often include durable transfusion independence; I need to monitor for cytopenias, adjust dosing if ANC < 500/µL or platelets < 50,000/µL, and remember that monosomy 7 is an exception where management should follow higher-risk pathways rather than lenalidomide-first strategies [^116wHi45]. I should double-check safety signals: exposure to lenalidomide has been associated with emergence of TP53-mutated clones, so molecular surveillance and careful selection are prudent, and nonresponders should be re-evaluated with marrow and molecular testing rather than persisting indefinitely [^116wHi45] [^1156Lhyc].

> If ESAs or luspatercept fail, or if anemia is severe and symptomatic, I need to consider hypomethylating agents even in lower-risk disease, recognizing they are not curative but can improve cytopenias and delay progression in selected patients; azacitidine 75 mg/m² SC for 7 days every 28 days is standard, with continuation beyond first response to deepen remissions, and decitabine or decitabine/cedazuridine are acceptable alternatives per guideline-supported practice [^115syP2B] [^11193M2G]. Hold on, I should verify duration expectations: responses often accrue after 6 cycles, and many patients require up to 12 cycles to reach best response, so I must counsel on persistence and schedule reassessment accordingly [^115syP2B].

> Turning to higher-risk MDS, I should confirm that hypomethylating agents are the standard first-line for patients ineligible for transplant and serve as a bridge for transplant-eligible patients. Azacitidine or decitabine are appropriate, with azacitidine supported by randomized data showing improved survival and delayed leukemic transformation versus supportive care; typical azacitidine dosing is 75 mg/m² SC for 7 days every 28 days, with at least 6 cycles recommended and continuation until progression or intolerance, as responses can deepen over time [^112CwKnS] [^115syP2B] [^113CETbw]. Wait, let me verify schedule nuances: while 5-day regimens have been studied, survival benefit has been demonstrated with the 7-day schedule, so I should preferentially use the 7-day regimen unless there is a compelling reason otherwise [^115syP2B].

> Concurrently, I need to ensure early allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation evaluation for all eligible higher-risk patients, because HCT is the only potentially curative modality. Eligibility hinges on age, performance status, comorbidities, donor availability, and patient preference; many centers consider patients up to approximately 70–75 years if fit, and retrospective data suggest pretransplant cytoreduction with HMAs or induction chemotherapy does not necessarily impact post-transplant outcomes, supporting individualized bridging strategies while avoiding delays to transplant [^113B35xZ] [^116gKGs9] [^112awzPU]. Hold on, I should verify that HMAs are not a substitute for transplant in eligible patients; they are a bridge or an alternative when transplant is not feasible, and this distinction should be explicit in counseling [^113B35xZ].

> For patients who fail or are intolerant of HMAs, I need to acknowledge the grim prognosis and prioritize clinical trials. Median survival after HMA failure is often under 6 months in higher-risk disease, and there is no universally accepted standard beyond investigational therapies; thus, early referral to centers with trial access is critical, and I should discuss goals of care, including palliative options, transparently [^112MXSs7] [^112qHB3E]. Let me reconsider whether any approved agents salvage HMA failure reliably; current evidence does not support a single standard in this space, reinforcing the trial imperative [^112MXSs7].

> Supportive care is universal across risk groups, and I should confirm best practices. Red cell transfusions are given to maintain symptom control, with iron chelation considered after roughly 20–50 transfusions or ferritin > 1,000 ng/mL in transfusion-dependent patients; G-CSF can be used selectively for recurrent infections in neutropenia; and antimicrobial prophylaxis is indicated post-transplant while on immunosuppression, with antifungal and antiviral strategies tailored to risk and local epidemiology [^112Z2LuN] [^112UaoL4]. I need to ensure transfusion thresholds and chelation triggers are individualized to comorbidity burden and transfusion pace, and that we monitor for iron overload complications over time [^112Z2LuN].

> Special populations require tailored algorithms, so I should double-check pediatric and young adult considerations. In children and adolescents, inherited bone marrow failure syndromes and germline predispositions are common, and HCT is generally the treatment of choice with myeloablative regimens, ideally before progression; thus, early transplant center referral and genetic counseling are essential parts of initial management [^112usrLk] [^116rXXjp]. For older adults with comorbidities, I should avoid over-aggressive therapy and align choices with performance status and patient goals, often favoring HMA monotherapy or even best supportive care when risks outweigh benefits [^1126Fqcn].

> I should also address hereditary myeloid malignancy predisposition syndromes in adults, because they change transplant planning and donor selection. Recognition of these syndromes prompts familial screening, modified conditioning strategies, and early HCT center involvement due to higher treatment-related toxicity and prolonged aplasia risks; this should be considered during the initial workup when clinical clues or family history suggest heritable risk [^116rQ2Dy]. Wait, let me verify that this affects donor choice and conditioning; yes, guidelines advise specialized donor evaluation and consideration of tailored regimens in this setting [^116rQ2Dy].

> Monitoring and reassessment must be built into the plan from the outset. I need to ensure periodic CBCs every 3–6 months for stable patients, earlier and more frequent checks during active therapy or changing counts, and periodic marrow reassessment if there is nonresponse, progression, or clinical change; molecular testing may be repeated to detect evolution or to guide subsequent lines of therapy, especially after HMA failure or suspected progression [^114DFwjj] [^1156Lhyc]. Hold on, I should verify that this cadence aligns with risk; yes, NCCN supports risk-adapted monitoring intervals at clinician discretion, with closer surveillance in higher-risk disease [^114DFwjj].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision algorithm to ensure internal consistency. First, confirm MDS diagnosis and complete risk stratification with IPSS-R and, when available, IPSS-M; then, classify into lower- versus higher-risk groups using IPSS-R thresholds and clinical judgment; for lower-risk, prioritize symptom-directed therapy beginning with ESAs or luspatercept based on sEPO and ring sideroblast/SF3B1 status, add lenalidomide for del(5q), escalate to HMAs if refractory or high transfusion burden; for higher-risk, initiate HMA promptly, evaluate for HCT early, bridge to transplant when feasible, and pivot to clinical trials upon HMA failure; throughout, deliver supportive care and schedule risk-adapted monitoring with reassessment at key milestones [^1112gXvA] [^113B35xZ] [^115syP2B] [^1156Lhyc]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost omitted the reminder that IPSS-R intermediate ≤ 3.5 is managed as lower risk; I should explicitly restate that to avoid misclassification and overtreatment [^1175vYqN].

> Finally, I need to ensure the patient-specific modifiers are transparently documented and discussed. Age, performance status, comorbidities, transfusion dependence, molecular mutations such as TP53, SF3B1, and del(5q), and patient preferences all shape the sequence and intensity of therapy; shared decision-making is essential, and where evidence is limited, clinical trial enrollment should be offered as a therapeutic and scientific opportunity, particularly in HMA-refractory settings [^111YsTEU] [^1126Fqcn] [^112MXSs7]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with contemporary guidance emphasizing personalized, risk-adapted care; yes, major guidelines consistently anchor therapy to these factors and endorse trial participation when standard options are inadequate [^111YsTEU] [^1126Fqcn].

Initial treatment for MDS is **risk-adapted**: use ESAs for lower-risk anemia [^1163iz8z], lenalidomide for del(5q) [^116wHi45], and hypomethylating agents (azacitidine/decitabine) for higher-risk disease [^113CETbw] [^1126Fqcn]. All patients need **supportive care** (transfusions, infection prophylaxis, iron chelation) [^1112gXvA] [^112Z2LuN], and allogeneic stem cell transplantation should be considered early for eligible higher-risk patients [^111gh1s8] [^113B35xZ]. Therapy is individualized by age, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^111YsTEU].

---

## Risk stratification and treatment goals

MDS is classified by **IPSS-R** [^1112gXvA] into lower- and higher-risk categories, which guide therapy [^111YsTEU]. Lower-risk MDS aims for **hematologic improvement** and quality of life [^1112gXvA], whereas higher-risk MDS aims to **alter disease course** and prolong survival [^111r4yym].

---

## Initial treatment for lower-risk MDS

### Symptomatic anemia management

- **Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs)**: first-line for symptomatic anemia in lower-risk MDS without del(5q); target hemoglobin 10–12 g/dL [^115pQKMa] [^1163iz8z].
- **Predictors of ESA response**: low baseline erythropoietin (< 500 mU/mL), low transfusion burden, and low marrow blasts [^115uJyQK].
- **Alternative agents**: luspatercept for anemia with ring sideroblasts or SF3B1 mutation; imetelstat for ESA-refractory anemia [^1113EkBS].

---

### Del(5q) myelodysplastic syndrome

Lenalidomide is **first-line** for del(5q) with symptomatic anemia; 10 mg/day for 21 of 28 days, assess response in 2–4 months [^116wHi45]. It reduces transfusion needs and improves quality of life [^117KJ6ys].

---

### Thrombocytopenia and neutropenia management

Thrombopoietin receptor agonists (romiplostim, eltrombopag) can be considered for **severe thrombocytopenia** [^115sx7pF]. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (**G-CSF**) is used for recurrent infections in neutropenia [^112UaoL4].

---

## Initial treatment for higher-risk MDS

### Hypomethylating agents (HMAs)

- **Azacitidine and decitabine**: standard first-line for higher-risk MDS; azacitidine 75 mg/m² SC/IV for 7 days every 28 days for at least 6 cycles [^115syP2B].
- **Clinical benefits**: improved survival, delayed AML transformation, and hematologic improvement [^112CwKnS].
- **Alternative schedules**: 5-day regimens exist, but survival benefit is established with 7-day azacitidine [^115syP2B].

---

### Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)

HSCT is the **only curative therapy** and should be considered early for eligible higher-risk patients [^116gKGs9]. Eligibility depends on age, performance status, comorbidities, donor availability, and patient preference [^113B35xZ].

---

## Supportive care for all patients

Supportive care is **essential** for all patients and includes:

- **Transfusions**: red cells and platelets as needed [^112Z2LuN].
- **Infection prophylaxis**: antifungal, antiviral, and antibacterial per risk [^notfound].
- **Iron chelation**: for transfusion burden to prevent iron overload [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing treatment selection

Treatment is individualized by **age, comorbidities, performance status, cytogenetics, molecular mutations, and patient preferences** [^111YsTEU] [^1126Fqcn].

---

## Monitoring and response assessment

Regular monitoring includes **CBCs, marrow exams, and molecular testing** to assess response and detect progression [^114DFwjj] [^117WfpGb]. Responses include hematologic improvement, complete/partial remission, and stable disease [^1153gQPu].

---

## Emerging therapies and clinical trials

Several **new agents** are in development, including:

- **BCL-2 inhibitors**: venetoclax (particularly with HMAs) [^115NRtY5].
- **IDH inhibitors**: for IDH-mutated MDS [^111dbRgw].
- **TP53-targeted therapies**: for TP53-mutated MDS [^notfound].

Clinical trials are encouraged, especially for **HMA-refractory disease** [^112MXSs7].

---

Initial MDS treatment is **risk-adapted**: ESAs and lenalidomide for lower-risk disease, and HMAs with early HSCT evaluation for higher-risk disease, with supportive care for all and therapy tailored to patient factors [^1112gXvA].

### Current therapeutic approaches for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes [^114B1GpJ]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous spectrum of disorders requiring selective therapy based on patients' specific clinical features, predominantly their prognostic subgroups, age and performance status. Guidelines for management of patients with MDS have been generated by a number of national panels. This review focuses on evidence-based data supporting therapeutic approaches, which have also been recommended by the US National Comprehensive Cancer Network MDS Panel, with discussion of accessibility of recommended drugs in the US and in other countries. For lower risk disease (International Prognostic Scoring System Low and Intermediate-1) therapy is aimed at haematological improvement whereas for higher risk disease (Intermediate-2 and High) treatment focuses on altering disease natural history. Recent information regarding additional clinical and biological features has provided useful parameters for assessing disease prognosis that aid risk-based management decisions. The rationale for use of low versus high intensity therapies with these agents, including allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, is discussed in detail.

### Current challenges and unmet medical needs in myelodysplastic syndromes [^115kGsmx]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) represent a heterogeneous group of myeloid neoplasms that are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, variable cytopenias, and a risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia. Most patients with MDS are affected by anemia and anemia-related symptoms, which negatively impact their quality of life. While many patients with MDS have lower-risk disease and are managed by existing treatments, there currently is no clear standard of care for many patients. For patients with higher-risk disease, the treatment priority is changing the natural history of the disease by delaying disease progression to acute myeloid leukemia and improving overall survival. However, existing treatments for MDS are generally not curative and many patients experience relapse or resistance to first-line treatment. Thus, there remains an unmet need for new, more effective but tolerable strategies to manage MDS. Recent advances in molecular diagnostics have improved our understanding of the pathogenesis of MDS, and it is becoming clear that the diverse nature of genetic abnormalities that drive MDS demands a complex and personalized treatment approach. This review will discuss some of the challenges related to the current MDS treatment landscape, as well as new approaches currently in development.

### Established and novel agents for myelodysplastic syndromes [^1134V4Bq]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2014). Low credibility.

The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are the most commonly diagnosed myeloid malignancy, with > 15 000 new cases identified in the United States yearly. Prognostic scoring systems supplant a formal staging approach and, in general, divide patients into those with lower-risk and those with higher-risk MDS. Although treatment goals for patients with lower-risk disease focus on minimizing transfusions and optimizing quality of life, in higher-risk MDS, the goal is to delay transformation to acute leukemia and to prolong survival. In lower-risk patients, isolated cytopenias are treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents or growth factors such as thrombopoietin mimetics. For patients with the del(5q) cytogenetic abnormality or those who fail these initial approaches, lenalidomide may be tried, as can experimental agents. Lower-risk patients with multiple cytopenias may be treated with immunosuppressive drugs or low-dose hypomethylating agents. For patients with higher-risk disease, hypomethylating agents are the preferred initial treatment approach, with evaluation for hematopoietic cell transplantation at diagnosis. Several novel agents are being developed for MDS patients who have failed hypomethylating drugs.

### Considerations for drug development in myelodysplastic syndromes [^116NQnyn]. Clinical Cancer Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) have historically been challenging diseases for drug development due to their biology, preclinical modeling, and the affected patient population. In April 2022, the FDA convened a panel of regulators and academic experts in MDS to discuss approaches to improve MDS drug development. The panel reviewed challenges in MDS clinical trial design and endpoints and outlined considerations for future trial design in MDS to facilitate drug development to meaningfully meet patient needs. Challenges for defining clinical benefit in patients with MDS include cumbersome response criteria, standardized transfusion thresholds, and application and validation of patient reported outcome instruments. Clinical trials should reflect the biology of disease evolution, the advanced age of patients with MDS, and how patients are treated in real-world settings to maximize the likelihood of identifying active drugs. In patients with lower-risk disease, response criteria for anemic patients should be based on baseline transfusion dependency, improvement in symptoms, and quality of life. For higher-risk patients with MDS, trials should include guidance to prevent dose reductions or delays that could limit efficacy, specify minimal durations of treatment (in the absence of toxicity or progression), and have endpoints focused on overall survival and durable responses. MDS trials should be designed from the outset to allow the practicable application of new therapies in this high-needs population, with drugs that can be administered and tolerated in community settings, and with endpoints that meaningfully improve patients' lives over existing therapies.

### How we treat higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes [^111gh1s8]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

Higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are defined by patients who fall into higher-risk group categories in the original or revised International Prognostic Scoring System. Survival for these patients is dismal, and treatment should be initiated rapidly. Standard therapies include the hypomethylating agents azacitidine and decitabine, which should be administered for a minimum of 6 cycles, and continued for as long as a patient is responding. Once a drug fails in one of these patients, further treatment options are limited, median survival is < 6 months, and consideration should be given to clinical trials. Higher-risk eligible patients should be offered consultation to discuss hematopoietic stem cell transplantation close to the time of diagnosis, depending on patient goals of therapy, with consideration given to proceeding to transplantation soon after an optimal donor is located. In the interim period before transplantation, hypomethylating agent therapy, induction chemotherapy, or enrollment in a clinical trial should be considered to prevent disease progression, although the optimal pretransplantation therapy is unknown.

### Consensus proposal for revised international working group 2023 response criteria for higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes [^117WfpGb]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes/myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) are associated with variable clinical presentations and outcomes. The initial response criteria developed by the International Working Group (IWG) in 2000 have been used in clinical practice, clinical trials, regulatory reviews, and drug labels. Although the IWG criteria were revised in 2006 and 2018 (the latter focusing on lower-risk disease), limitations persist in their application to higher-risk MDS (HR-MDS) and their ability to fully capture the clinical benefits of novel investigational drugs or serve as valid surrogates for longer-term clinical end points (eg, overall survival). Further, issues related to the ambiguity and practicality of some criteria lead to variability in interpretation and interobserver inconsistency in reporting results from the same sets of data. Thus, we convened an international panel of 36 MDS experts and used an established modified Delphi process to develop consensus recommendations for updated response criteria that would be more reflective of patient-centered and clinically relevant outcomes in HR-MDS. Among others, the IWG 2023 criteria include changes in the hemoglobin threshold for complete remission (CR), the introduction of CR with limited count recovery and CR with partial hematologic recovery as provisional response criteria, the elimination of marrow CR, and specific recommendations for the standardization of time-to-event end points and the derivation and reporting of responses. The updated criteria should lead to a better correlation between patient-centered outcomes and clinical trial results in an era of multiple emerging new agents with novel mechanisms of action.

### Therapeutic approaches for the management of higher risk myelodysplastic syndromes [^111r4yym]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2023). Medium credibility.

The heterogeneous nature of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) demands a risk-adapted therapeutic approach, and higher risk MDS, characterized by an increased risk of transformation into acute myeloid leukemia and inferior survival, is typically defined based on an integrated assessment of cytopenias, bone marrow blast percentage, and cytogenetic findings using the revised International Prognostic Scoring System. Incorporating mutational data could further refine the risk assessment and identify those with higher-than-expected disease risk. The principal therapeutic goal in this disease subset is to modify the natural history and prolong survival. Allogeneic stem cell transplant, the only potentially curative treatment, should be offered to eligible patients. Hypomethylating agents are the only approved treatment with unsatisfactory response rates and duration, and patients who failed prior hypomethylating agents unfortunately have dismal outcomes with urgent need of novel therapeutic agents. In this review, we provide the therapeutic landscape in higher risk MDS based on the current evidence and discuss the investigational treatment options under development.

### Update on the therapy for myelodysplastic syndrome [^114KWjgE]. American Journal of Hematology (2009). Low credibility.

The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a diverse group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by cytopenias. Patients have a risk of developing acute leukemia though most succumb to complications of low blood counts. Over the past decade many novel treatments have been developed and investigation of new agents is ongoing. In this article, we discuss the classification and prognostic systems that are used in MDS, the agents available for treatment of MDS as well as review supportive and palliative care options for patients who are not candidates for, or opt against, newer treatment strategies.

### Management of patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes [^1112bQ59]. Blood Cancer Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis with abnormal blood cell development (dysplasia) leading to cytopenias and an increased risk for progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Patients with MDS can generally be classified as lower- (LR-MDS) or higher-risk (HR-MDS). As treatment goals for patients with LR-MDS and those with HR-MDS differ significantly, appropriate diagnosis, classification, and follow-up are critical for correct disease management. In this review, we focus on the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment options, as well as the prediction of the disease course and monitoring of treatment response in patients with LR-MDS. We discuss how next-generation sequencing, increasing knowledge on mechanisms of MDS pathogenesis, and novel therapies may change the current treatment landscape in LR-MDS and why structured assessments of responses, toxicities, and patient-reported outcomes should be incorporated into routine clinical practice.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary myelodysplastic syndromes in adults: recommendations from the European LeukemiaNet [^115pntGu]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

Within the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) work package of the European LeukemiaNet, an Expert Panel was selected according to the framework elements of the National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Program. A systematic review of the literature was performed that included indexed original papers, indexed reviews and educational papers, and abstracts of conference proceedings. Guidelines were developed on the basis of a list of patient- and therapy-oriented questions, and recommendations were formulated and ranked according to the supporting level of evidence. MDSs should be classified according to the 2008 World Health Organization criteria. An accurate risk assessment requires the evaluation of not only disease-related factors but also of those related to extrahematologic comorbidity. The assessment of individual risk enables the identification of fit patients with a poor prognosis who are candidates for up-front intensive treatments, primarily allogeneic stem cell transplantation. A high proportion of MDS patients are not eligible for potentially curative treatment because of advanced age and/or clinically relevant comorbidities and poor performance status. In these patients, the therapeutic intervention is aimed at preventing cytopenia-related morbidity and preserving quality of life. A number of new agents are being developed for which the available evidence is not sufficient to recommend routine use. The inclusion of patients into prospective clinical trials is strongly recommended.

### Practical recommendations for hypomethylating agent therapy of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes [^1149dZEs]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Clinicians commonly administer one or the other of the two hypomethylating agents currently approved in the United States — azacitidine or decitabine — to patients with aggressive forms of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). However, there continues to be uncertainty about the optimal choice of agent, the best initial dose and treatment schedule, the role of hypomethylating agents in patients with more indolent disease, the most appropriate management of treatment-associated adverse events, and the most desirable approach to maintain responses. The evidence base supporting clinical decisions around these questions varies widely in depth and quality. This article discusses practical considerations for clinicians who use hypomethylating agents to treat patients with MDS.

### Myelodysplastic syndromes: therapy and outlook [^1124TXeV]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a diverse group of hematopoietic disorders characterized by dysplasia, peripheral cytopenias, and risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia and death. In patients who are ineligible for potentially curative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), approved therapies such as lenalidomide, azacitidine, and decitabine are available for those who previously would have received supportive care alone. Each treatment can achieve hematologic improvement and enhance quality of life. Azacitidine is the only treatment to show a significant survival advantage in patients with higher-risk MDS compared with conventional care regimens. The treatment panorama has been further enhanced with immunosuppressive agents, growth factor support, and biologic response modifiers. Initial treatment decisions are based around HSCT eligibility and when best supportive care becomes insufficient. Transfusion dependence is associated with adverse outcomes and is an indication for possible treatment escalation.

### Myelodysplastic syndromes. contemporary biologic concepts and emerging diagnostic approaches [^114Ltdgi]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are an enigmatic group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Typically, MDS evolves from an early phase of accelerated apoptosis resulting in ineffective hematopoiesis to a later phase of increasing proliferation with maturation arrest. Afflicted patients experience a deteriorating course characterized by peripheral cytopenia(s) with consequent infection and hemorrhage and, in some cases, progression to acute leukemia. The classification of MDS has been a matter of some controversy, perhaps allied to our largely unsatisfactory insights into the pathobiology of the disease. Recently, however, new concepts have emerged to explain the etiology and pathogenesis of MDS that invoke a model for step-wise genetic progression with modulation by the immune system and the marrow microenvironment. From these insights into its cellular and molecular pathogenesis have emerged new strategies for both diagnosis and treatment. With the implementation of these strategies, it is anticipated that a more rational and objective approach to the diagnosis and classification of MDS may be achieved, affording the use of more effective targeted therapy.

### Treatment of lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes [^111fRMiJ]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Recent phase III trials in lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes

Historically, the treatment of lower-risk MDS was predominantly supportive, focusing on managing symptoms rather than altering the disease trajectory. The implementation of the IPSS-R and IPSS-M, combined with insights gained from the COMMANDS, MEDALIST, and IMerge trials, has dramatically changed this perspective. Results from the three trials are described below and summarized in Table 1. There is now a robust framework for a more proactive and targeted approach to treatment, which not only addresses symptoms and immediate complications but also aims to modify the underlying disease processes.

The integration of advanced risk stratification tools with new therapeutic options enables a more precise, personalized treatment regimen, potentially extending survival and improving QoL for patients with lower-risk MDS. As research continues to unveil the complexities of MDS pathophysiology and genetics, these strategies are likely to become even more refined, marking a new era in the management of a historically challenging group of disorders.

### An international consortium proposal of uniform response criteria for myelodysplastic / myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS / MPN) in adults [^112AmUHP]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are hematologically diverse stem cell malignancies sharing phenotypic features of both myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms. There are currently no standard treatment recommendations for most adult patients with MDS/MPN. To optimize efforts to improve the management and disease outcomes, it is essential to identify meaningful clinical and biologic end points and standardized response criteria for clinical trials. The dual dysplastic and proliferative features in these stem cell malignancies define their uniqueness and challenges. We propose response assessment guidelines to harmonize future clinical trials with the principal objective of establishing suitable treatment algorithms. An international panel comprising laboratory and clinical experts in MDS/MPN was established involving 3 independent academic MDS/MPN workshops (March 2013, December 2013, and June 2014). These recommendations are the result of this collaborative project sponsored by the MDS Foundation.

### In MDS, is higher risk higher reward? [^111sSitW]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS) are defined by the original or revised International Prognostic Scoring System and specific genetic features. Treatment of HR-MDS is challenging. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the only curative approach, is feasible in a minority of fit or intermediate fitness patients aged < 70 to 75 years who are willing to face the risks of the procedure. Response to azacitidine and decitabine, the only approved drugs for HR-MDS and considered the standard of care, is partial and transient in most patients. The development of novel more personalized and efficient drugs is an unmet medical need. During the last decade, there have been substantial advances in understanding the multiple molecular, cellular, and immunological disturbances involved in the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndrome. As a result, a number of clinical and translational studies of new more focused treatment approaches for HR-MDS patients are underway. In contrast to acute myeloid leukemia, they have not resulted in any new drug approval. This review addresses the benefits and limitations of current treatment alternatives, offers a practical individualized treatment approach, and summarizes the clinical trials in progress for HR-MDS.

### Treatment of high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes [^115UdN77]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is considered to be a heterogeneous myeloid malignancy with a common origin in the hematopoietic stem cell compartment and is generally divided into lower- and higher-risk forms. While the treatment goals for lower-risk MDS are to decrease transfusion requirements and transformation into acute leukemia, the major aims for higher-risk MDS are to prolong survival and ultimately cure the patient. Although novel agents such as luspatercept and imetelstat have recently been approved as new treatment options for lower-risk MDS, hypomethylating agents currently remain the only approved non-transplant option for higher-risk MDS and are the standard of care for patients not eligible for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Combinations with other drugs as first-line treatment have to date not proven more efficacious than monotherapy in higher-risk MDS, and outcome after the failure of treatment with hypomethylating agents is poor. The only potential cure and standard of care for eligible patients is HSCT and even though the number of transplanted - especially older - MDS patients has increased over time due to better management and greater donor availability, the majority of MDS patients will not be eligible for this curative approach. Current challenges include decreasing the relapse risk, the main cause of HSCT failure. This review summarizes current knowledge on the options of transplant and non-transplant treatment approaches for these patients and demonstrate the unmet clinical need for more effective therapies.

Often unrecognized and underdiagnosed, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a rare group of cancers in which the bone marrow fails to produce sufficient healthy blood cells. Although patients with lower-risk MDS can live for > 5 years, those with high-risk disease that evolves into acute myeloid leukemia is associated with significantly lower overall survival. At the NCCN 2019 Annual Congress: Hematologic Malignancies, Dr. Rafael Bejar summarized current standard treatment options for patients with MDS and discussed the importance of genetic testing to identify mutations that may impact treatment. Finally, Dr. Bejar described emerging personalized treatment strategies for the management of this disease.

### Treatment of MDS [^114t68Vu]. Blood (2019). Medium credibility.

The heterogeneous nature of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) demands a complex and personalized variety of therapeutic approaches. Among them, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the only potentially curative option and is accessible to only a small number of fit patients. For the majority of patients with MDS, treatment strategies are nonintensive and risk-adapted (by the revised version of the International Prognostic Scoring System), ranging from iron chelation and growth factors to lenalidomide and hypomethylating agents. These approaches are noncurative and aimed instead at improving cytopenias and quality of life and delaying disease progression. These limitations underpin the need for more translational research-based clinical trials in well-defined subgroups of patients with MDS. Indeed, much progress has been made over the past decade in understanding the complex molecular mechanisms underlying MDS. Unfortunately, this has not yet translated into approval of novel treatment options. There is a particularly urgent medical need in patients failing current first-line therapies, such as with erythropoiesis-stimulating or hypomethylating agents. Nevertheless, actual developments are expected to pave the way for exciting novel therapeutic opportunities. This review provides an overview of the current therapeutic landscape in MDS focusing on recent advances in clinical and translational research.

### Report of an international working group to standardize response criteria for myelodysplastic syndromes [^1153gQPu]. Blood (2000). Low credibility.

Standardized criteria for assessing response are essential to ensure comparability among clinical trials for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). An international working group of experienced clinicians involved in the management of patients with MDS reviewed currently used response definitions and developed a uniform set of guidelines for future clinical trials in MDS. The MDS differ from many other hematologic malignancies in their chronicity and the morbidity and mortality caused by chronic cytopenias, often without disease progression to acute myeloid leukemia. Whereas response rates may be an important endpoint for phase 2 studies of new agents and may assist regulatory agencies in their evaluation and approval processes, an important goal of clinical trials in MDS should be to prolong patient survival. Therefore, these response criteria reflected 2 sets of goals in MDS: altering the natural history of the disease and alleviating disease-related complications with improved quality of life. It is anticipated that the recommendations presented will require modification as more is learned about the molecular biology and genetics of these disorders. Until then, it is hoped these guidelines will serve to improve communication among investigators and to ensure comparability among clinical trials. (Blood. 2000;96:3671–3674)

### Hematopoietic cell transplantation in the management of myelodysplastic syndrome: an evidence-based review from the American society for transplantation and cellular therapy committee on practice guidelines [^114x1eXc]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) — initial management emphasizes that nontransplantation approaches consistently were associated with improved life expectancy for patients with lower-risk disease and we currently recommend that allogeneic HCT not be routinely offered to patients with lower-risk MDS (low or int-1 by IPSS) as an initial treatment strategy (Grade B, Level 1+). Thus, most patients with lower-risk MDS who undergo HCT have a disease- or patient-related variable that the treating physician deems of high clinical concern, most patients should be treated with nontransplantation approaches and undergo HCT only if disease progresses to have higher-risk features or fails to improve with nontransplantation therapies, and there may be scenarios in which HCT is performed in IPSS lower-risk disease (eg, younger patients with transfusion-dependent disease despite best supportive care or those with multiple or adverse somatic mutations).

### Myelodysplastic syndrome: an update on diagnosis and therapy [^115F1HQM]. Current Oncology Reports (2008). Low credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a diverse group of disorders characterized by disorderly and ineffective hematopoiesis. Patients suffer morbidity from associated cytopenias that result in an increased risk of infection, transfusion-dependent anemia, and bleeding. Despite the variable risk of transformation to acute leukemia, the majority of deaths are due to bone marrow failure. No truly effective treatment exists for MDS, and therapy usually focuses on reducing or preventing complications of the disease. Identification of potential cellular and molecular targets, such as epigenetic modification, has led to novel therapeutic approaches in recent years. An increasing number of diagnostic markers, prognostic parameters, and therapeutic strategies are available and becoming widely accepted.

Functional assessments and integration into clinical trial end points

MDS is associated with impaired functioning and debilitating symptoms in patients compared with age-matched controls. Of particular relevance, many patients with cancer prioritize improvement in disease symptoms and functioning over merely extending their life span. Unfortunately, health-related QoL (HRQoL) is typically neglected in MDS clinical trials, often relegated to a secondary or exploratory outcome. Prospective, systematic, and comprehensive measurement of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in MDS clinical trials is recommended, including prespecified PROs. International guidelines and FDA guidance provide direction on the analysis of PRO data in randomized controlled trials. Recommendations include establishing a clear PRO research hypothesis, using appropriate statistical methods for data analysis, implementing methodologies for handling missing data, and using standardized terminology. Sample sizes should be statistically modeled with HRQoL end points in mind, even as secondary end points. Analyses should include assessments of minimally clinically important differences, and in cases in which these are not known, efforts should be made to investigate and define them. An international multidisciplinary working group has provided guidelines for using item libraries in PRO measurements in oncology, enabling standardized assessments of key HRQoL concepts relevant to the population. The initial HRQoL assessment should occur before treatment, and the subsequent timing of assessments should consider specific treatments and confounding variables such as blood transfusion and treatment schedules.

### Diagnosis and treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes: a review [^1126Fqcn]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS), formerly known as myelodysplastic syndromes, are clonal hematopoietic malignancies that cause morphologic bone marrow dysplasia along with anemia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia. MDS are associated with an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The yearly incidence of MDS is approximately 4 per 100 000 people in the United States and is higher among patients with advanced age.

Observations

MDS are characterized by reduced numbers of peripheral blood cells, an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia transformation, and reduced survival. The median age at diagnosis is approximately 70 years, and the yearly incidence rate increases to 25 per 100 000 in people aged 65 years and older. Risk factors associated with MDS include older age and prior exposures to toxins such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy. MDS are more common in men compared with women (with yearly incidence rates of approximately 5.4 vs 2.9 per 100 000). MDS typically has an insidious presentation, consisting of signs and symptoms associated with anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. MDS can be categorized into subtypes that are associated with lower or higher risk for acute myeloid leukemia transformation and that help with therapy selection. Patients with lower-risk MDS have a median survival of approximately 3 to 10 years, whereas patients with higher-risk disease have a median survival of less than 3 years. Therapy for lower-risk MDS is selected based on whether the primary clinical characteristic is anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia. Management focuses on treating symptoms and reducing the number of required transfusions in patients with low-risk disease. For patients with lower-risk MDS, erythropoiesis stimulating agents, such as recombinant humanized erythropoietin or the longer-acting erythropoietin, darbepoetin alfa, can improve anemia in 15% to 40% of patients for a median of 8 to 23 months. For those with higher-risk MDS, hypomethylating agents such as azacitidine, decitabine, or decitabine/cedazuridine are first-line therapy. Hematopoietic cell transplantation is considered for higher-risk patients and represents the only potential cure.

Conclusions and Relevance

MDS are diagnosed in approximately 4 per 100 000 people in the United States and are associated with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 37%. Treatments are tailored to the patient's disease characteristics and comorbidities and range from supportive care with or without erythropoiesis-stimulating agents for patients with low-risk MDS to hypomethylating agents, such as azacitidine or decitabine, for patients with higher-risk MDS. Hematopoietic cell transplantation is potentially curative and should be considered for patients with higher-risk MDS at the time of diagnosis.

Clinical implications of the pathogenesis

Understanding the complex pathogenesis of MDS is crucial for developing targeted therapies. With advances in genomic and epigenomic technologies, personalized medicine approaches are increasingly being applied to MDS treatment. These approaches aim to target specific mutations and pathways involved in an individual patient's disease, offering the promise of more effective and less toxic therapies, especially in lower-risk patients.

### Treatment of lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes [^113UWnNu]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) involve clonal hematopoiesis and cellular dysplasia, driven by genetic and epigenetic alterations. Spliceosome mutations and epigenetic dysregulation underscore the intricate pathogenesis of MDS. The bone marrow microenvironment, stromal dysfunction, chronic inflammation, and immune dysregulation contribute to disease progression. This complex pathogenesis underscores the necessity for targeted therapies, offering a personalized medicine approach, particularly in lower-risk patients. The development of risk scores such as the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), its revision (IPSS-R), and the incorporation of molecular genetics into the IPSS-M have refined the diagnostic and prognostic framework of MDS. These scoring systems facilitate tailored treatment strategies and better prognostication, especially for lower-risk MDS patients. The progression from IPSS to IPSS-R and now to IPSS-M epitomizes the shift towards personalized medicine in the management of MDS. In this review we discuss recent developments and positive phase III studies in lower-risk MDS. The review concludes by proposing a treatment algorithm for lower-risk MDS and highlighting ongoing trials in this heterogeneous population of patients.

### How to manage lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes [^112e2551]. Leukemia (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs), usually defined as having an International Prognostic Scoring System score of 1.0 or less, and/or < 5% myeloblasts, comprise the majority of newly diagnosed and established MDS patients and have a survival measured in years. Most will eventually require therapy for their disease, usually when MDS-related symptoms or transfusion requirements accelerate and outweigh potential drug-related toxicities. The decision of when to initiate therapy is far from straightforward. Erythropoiesis stimulating agents yield responses in up to 40% of appropriately selected patients, while disease-modifying drugs, including lenalidomide, azacitidine, decitabine and anti-thymocyte globulin, can evoke responses as high as 67% in patient subgroups. Newer therapies hold the promise of activity in patients who have failed standard regimens.

Monitoring for progression of MDS to AML

The progression of patients from MDS to AML is relatively common, and regular follow-up visits, including bone marrow evaluations with cytogenetic analysis, are necessary for all patients with MDS; frequency of follow-up depends on disease risk and choice of treatment. The time frame and frequency of monitoring for progression to AML depends on various factors but largely relies on the risk classification, including the molecular profile, of each patient and their response to treatment; studies have demonstrated that this risk can change over time. Patients who progress to AML after MDS are categorized as AML with myelodysplasia-related changes; these patients differ with regards to their response to standard induction chemotherapy compared to de novo disease.

### Development of a core outcome set for myelodysplastic syndromes-a Delphi study from the EUMDS registry group [^114VGam3]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment options for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) vary widely, depending on the natural disease course and patient-related factors. Comparison of treatment effectiveness is challenging as different endpoints have been included in clinical trials and outcome reporting. Our goal was to develop the first MDS core outcome set (MDS-COS) defining a minimum set of outcomes that should be reported in future clinical studies. We performed a comprehensive systematic literature review among MDS studies to extract patient- and/or clinically relevant outcomes. Clinical experts from the European LeukemiaNet MDS (EUMDS) identified 26 potential MDS core outcomes and participated in a three-round Delphi survey. After the first survey (56 experts), 15 outcomes met the inclusion criteria and one additional outcome was included. The second round (38 experts) resulted in six included outcomes. In the third round, a final check on plausibility and practicality of the six included outcomes and their definitions was performed. The final MDS-COS includes: health-related quality of life, treatment-related mortality, overall survival, performance status, safety, and haematological improvement. This newly developed MDS-COS represents the first minimum set of outcomes aiming to enhance comparability across future MDS studies and facilitate a better understanding of treatment effectiveness.

DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) monotherapy remains the standard of care therapy for higher-risk MDS. Despite the established role of DNMTi therapeutics in MDS, several trials and real-world registry analyses have failed to replicate the survival benefit initially described with azacitidine in the AZA-001 trial. To improve outcomes, multiple clinical trials have tested azacitidine (or DNMTi backbone) combination therapy approaches, but to date, none have improved overall survival (OS) compared with azacitidine monotherapy. Hence, establishing a DNMTi backbone combination therapy for the frontline treatment of MDS is the top priority that has been identified by the faculty.

NCCN myelodysplastic syndromes — therapeutic algorithm and risk stratification — All patients should receive relevant supportive care, after which patients with clinically significant cytopenia(s) are stratified into two major risk groups comprising lower-risk MDS (IPSS low, int-1; IPSS-R very low, low, intermediate; WPSS very low, low, intermediate) and higher-risk MDS (IPSS int-2, high; IPSS-R intermediate, high, very high; WPSS high, very high). Patients with IPSS-R intermediate risk may be treated as lower risk if their score is ≤ 3.5 versus higher risk if their score is > 3.5. Based on IWG response criteria, the major therapeutic aim for the lower-risk group would be hematologic improvement, whereas for the higher-risk group alteration of the natural history of disease is viewed as paramount. The algorithm outlines management of primary MDS only, and most patients with t-MDS have poorer prognoses than those with primary MDS and are generally managed as higher-risk disease.

### Management of patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes [^112JwkEt]. Blood Cancer Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and future directions

Management of patients with LR-MDS is increasingly nuanced, due to the heterogeneity of patient- and disease-based factors, and the expanding number of approved treatment options or combinations available. These patients will typically live with MDS for > 3 years, and decisions around therapy depend on the burden of disease, symptomatic complications, mutational profile, and overall goals of therapy. The most common cytopenia in LR-MDS is anemia, but its degree and clinical impact on potential comorbid conditions vary. Several therapies are currently available for the treatment of patients with anemia due to MDS, and more are being evaluated, making an optimal selection of therapies and the sequence of interventions, more relevant to patient management. Increasingly, the use of NGS has refined prognostication and sometimes offers targeted therapeutic options. In the future, mutational profiles may be incorporated into risk stratification schemes and treatment algorithms, resulting in a more targeted treatment approach.

Notably, over the last 20 years, the number of clinical trials initiated for LR-MDS treatments has remained limited. Furthermore, few agents are being developed specifically for MDS; many phase 1 trials investigate one drug for other cancers and may include MDS only as a subset of the study. Given the particularities around MDS management and response, such as the emergence of treatment-related cytopenias, exploration of novel therapeutics in MDS during early testing phases may be limited. To increase the number of potential treatment options and to maximize their chances for successful clinical development, factors, including the patient population characteristics, specific molecular targets and/or pathways involved in MDS pathology, and revision of relevant endpoints, need to be considered. Improvement and standardization of molecular response criteria and PRO assessments will be fundamental for the development of new, effective, and tolerable therapies for LR-MDS. Although there are more potential therapies available than before, the progress remains slow. That said, there are reasons for optimism; our increasing understanding of MDS-associated molecular pathways, and a more refined understanding of clinically meaningful trial endpoints, suggest tangible ways to achieve improved clinical outcomes in LR-MDS patients in the near future.

Risk scores for myelodysplastic syndromes

The diagnosis and prognostication of MDS have evolved significantly with the development of various scoring systems over the last decades, notably the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), its revision (IPSS-R), and the most recent update, the IPSS-Molecular (IPSS-M). Each of these scoring systems incorporates a range of clinical and laboratory features to classify patients into distinct risk categories, aiding in tailoring treatment strategies appropriately. This progression reflects a deeper understanding of the aforementioned biological complexity of MDS and has substantially impacted the management of lower-risk MDS.

Introduction of the International Prognostic Scoring System

Introduced in 1997, the original IPSS was a groundbreaking tool that allowed for a standardized assessment of prognosis in MDS patients based on three variables: the percentage of bone marrow blasts, karyotype, and cytopenias. Patients were classified into four risk groups (low, intermediate-1, intermediate-2, and high) which helped in guiding treatment decisions. The IPSS was primarily derived from untreated patients who were diagnosed with primary MDS, providing a baseline for the natural history of the disease.

For lower-risk MDS (low and intermediate-1 risk scores), the IPSS was instrumental in identifying patients who might benefit from supportive care or less intensive therapies, such as growth factor support or immunosuppressive treatment, instead of aggressive chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation. However, while effective, the IPSS had limitations in its ability to capture the full spectrum of genetic diversity and prognostic subtleties within MDS.

Transition to the revised International Prognostic Scoring System

The IPSS-R, introduced in 2012, was an advancement from the original system, offering refined risk stratification by incorporating additional cytogenetic abnormalities and more detailed gradations of marrow blasts and cytopenias. The IPSS-R divides patients into five risk categories (very low, low, intermediate, high, and very high) and uses a more comprehensive cytogenetic scoring system that better reflects the prognostic impact of specific chromosomal abnormalities. For patients with lower-risk MDS, the IPSS-R provided a more nuanced approach to prognosis and treatment. It allowed for the identification of patients within the low and very low-risk categories who might have an even more indolent disease course and could be managed with minimal intervention or watchful waiting. Moreover, it helped in recognizing those at the higher end of the lower-risk spectrum who might benefit from early therapeutic intervention to prevent disease progression.

### Myelodysplastic syndromes current treatment algorithm 2018 [^11193M2G]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) include a group of clonal myeloid neoplasms characterized by cytopenias due to ineffective hematopoiesis, abnormal blood and marrow cell morphology, and a risk of clonal evolution and progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Because outcomes for patients with MDS are heterogeneous, individual risk stratification using tools such as the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) is important in managing patients-including selecting candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT), the only potentially curative therapy for MDS. The IPSS-R can be supplemented by molecular genetic testing, since certain gene mutations such as TP53 influence risk independent of established clinicopathological variables. For lower risk patients with symptomatic anemia, treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) or lenalidomide (especially for those with deletion of chromosome 5q) can ameliorate symptoms. Some lower risk patients may be candidates for immunosuppressive therapy, thrombopoiesis-stimulating agents, or a DNA hypomethylating agent (HMA; azacitidine or decitabine). Among higher risk patients, transplant candidates should undergo ASCT as soon as possible, with HMAs useful as a bridge to transplant. Non-transplant candidates should initiate HMA therapy and continue if tolerated until disease progression. Supportive care with transfusions and antimicrobial drugs as needed remains important in all groups.

NCCN Myelodysplastic syndromes — erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) — ESAs such as epoetin alfa or the longer-acting darbepoetin, with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G‑CSF), have been evaluated for symptomatic anemia in MDS, with studies in lower-risk disease demonstrating erythroid response rates of 40% and 60% in initial trials. Clinical trial results in MDS suggest that overall response rates to darbepoetin are similar to or possibly higher than epoetin, with improved response rates potentially related to dosing of 150–300 mcg SC per week and enrollment of better-risk patients; features predictive of response include relatively low basal sEPO, low marrow blasts, and few prior RBC transfusions.

### Recent clinical and molecular advances for the classification of myelodysplastic neoplasms [^112uNk1f]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). Medium credibility.

Several major updates have recently occurred for the NCCN Guidelines for Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) based on a number of prominent articles that have particular clinical and biologic impact for the field. These changes, which have been included in the current iteration of the NCCN Guidelines (Version 1.2023), include the WHO 2022 classification of MDS as well as the ICC suggestions for same. In addition, the molecular underpinning of MDS has been greatly updated with the generation of the Molecular International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-M) and an improved understanding to the prognostic implications of mutated TP53 subtypes, which are additive to the revised IPSS (IPSS-R) for stratification and management of patients with MDS. This report emphasizes the major components of the relevant changes to serve as a guide for therapeutic decision-making for patients with MDS.

Ongoing trials and a look at future treatment options in lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes

ELEMENT-MDS

In the phase III COMMANDS study luspatercept significantly increased the number of ESA-naïve, lower-risk MDS patients achieving transfusion independence for 12 weeks or more, coupled with a hemoglobin increase of at least 1.5 g/dL, performing significantly better than ESA. However, its effectiveness in transfusion-independent, lower-risk MDS patients remains unexplored.

The ELEMENT-MDS study (NCT05949684), a phase III, randomized, multicenter trial, is underway to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of luspatercept versus epoetin alfa in preventing the progression to transfusion dependence in ESA-naïve, transfusion-independent adult patients with lower-risk MDS. The study targets enrolling 360 patients with anemia categorized as having very low-, low-, or intermediate-risk MDS according to the IPSS-R. Candidates are adults with a confirmed diagnosis of MDS, baseline serum erythropoietin levels of 500 U/L or less, and clinically significant anemia.

Eligible participants will be randomized equally to receive either luspatercept every 3 weeks starting at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg (with possible escalation to 1.75 mg/kg), or weekly epoetin alfa starting at a dose of 450 IU/kg (with a potential increase to 1,050 IU/kg). The primary measure of the study is to determine the proportion of patients becoming transfusion-dependent during any 16-week period within the initial 96 weeks of treatment. Secondary outcomes include duration of transfusion independence, time to first transfusion dependency, improvement in hemoglobin levels, and overall QoL. Safety assessments will focus on types and severity of adverse events, and their connections to the treatment as well as progression into AML. This ongoing research is pivotal in determining the potential of luspatercept as a viable alternative for lower-risk, non-transfusion-dependent MDS patients.

Therapeutic approaches for MDS

Treatment goals for patients with MDS are two-fold: improve peripheral blood values (i.e. increase hemoglobin levels and reduce bleeding and infections) and change the natural progression of the disease. The choice of therapy for newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory MDS depends on the individual patient's risk classification, fitness (including comorbidities), goals and preferences, caregiver and social support, and suitability for HCT. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) MDS Panel recommends stratifying patients with clinically significant cytopenia(s) into lower- and higher-risk groups. Lower-risk patients include those with IPSS low or INT-1 classification; IPSS-R very low, low, or intermediate classification up to 3.5 points; or WHO classification-based Prognostic Scoring System very low, low, or intermediate. Higher-risk patients are those classified as IPSS INT-2 or high; IPSS-R intermediate (> 3.5 points), high, or very high; or WHO classification-based Prognostic Scoring System high or very high. Patients with IPSS-R intermediate MDS can be managed as low- or high-risk MDS based on other prognostic factors (e.g. age, performance status, mutations, serum ferritin levels, and serum lactate dehydrogenase levels).

### Evidence-and consensus-based practice guidelines for the therapy of primary myelodysplastic syndromes. A statement from the Italian society of hematology [^116aWjpb]. Haematologica (2002). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Novel therapeutic agents and strategies have been introduced into the management of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in the last years. This has led to more treatment options and a better chance of long-term survival for MDS patients, but also to uncertainty regarding the optimal use and possible side effects of these treatments. The Italian Society of Hematology commissioned a project to develop guidelines for the therapy of MDS using evidence-based knowledge and consensus-formation techniques.

Design and Methods

An Advisory Council (AC) shaped the project around a series of key clinical questions, performed a systematic search for evidence and graded the available evidence according to the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN). A list of clinical questions was mailed to each of 10 senior hematologists composing the Expert Panel (EP): the panelists were asked to rank the most relevant questions, and to formulate answers to the questions according to the tables of evidence. A scenario phase followed, so as to reach a consensus on the three top ranked questions. The EP was asked to score patient profiles as appropriate or not appropriate for the therapeutic strategy under scrutiny, according to the RAND technique. Finally, from September 2001 to January 2002, four Consensus Conferences conducted according to the Nominal Group Technique were held in Milan, Italy. The overall goal of the conferences was to take a final decision upon the appropriateness of the uncertain scenarios and of the uncertain responses to the clinical questions.

Results

Evidence was judged sufficient for providing recommendations on the use of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, leukemia-like chemotherapy, autologous stem cell transplantation, low-dose chemotherapy, danazol, immunosuppressive therapy, hypomethylating agents and hematopoietic growth factors. Specific recommendations for supportive therapy, including iron chelation, were issued. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation was unanimously considered as the only curative treatment for MDS patients, and recommendations on its use were agreed based on patient's age, risk, clinical features and donor availability. AML-like chemotherapy was also considered a valuable therapeutic option for subsets of MDS patients. Autologous stem cell transplantation was recommended for patients who lack an HLA identical donor and have achieved complete remission with AML-like chemotherapy. Decitabine, recombinant human erythropoietin and immunosuppressive therapy were judged valuable therapeutic options for subsets of MDS patients whereas low-dose cytarabine was not. Specific therapeutic strategies for those subjects younger than 18 years or older than 75 years and the strategy of watchful waiting were decided by patient-oriented questions.

Interpretation and Conclusions

Using evidence and consensus, recommendations for the treatment of MDS were issued. Statements were graded according to the strength of the supporting evidence and uncertainty was explicitly declared.

To advance novel treatment strategies to impact the underlying pathophysiology of lower-risk MDS

In lower-risk MDS, the goal of treatment is to improve cytopenia, most commonly anemia. The standard of care remains supportive treatment with red blood cell transfusions, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, luspatercept, lenalidomide for certain subtypes of LR-MDS, and DNMTis. However, "lower-risk" MDS is a misconception: while temporary benefit can be derived, these approaches do not have a significant disease-modifying effect, and therefore responses are of limited durability. Future efforts should focus on attempting to reverse the underlying pathophysiology of MDS.

NCCN Myelodysplastic syndromes — hereditary myeloid malignancy predisposition syndromes recognition is clinically relevant for active therapeutic decisions, familial screening, and further investigations. Patients may require surveillance for disease-specific serious extra-hematopoietic complications and malignant clonal hematopoiesis evaluation. In the setting of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) consideration, specialized evaluations of a familial donor are warranted as well as potential use of a modified conditioning regimen. The recognition of a familial genetic disorder also allows for appropriate genetic counseling and follow-up of affected family members. Increased treatment-related toxicity and prolonged post-treatment aplasia have been observed in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with these hereditary syndromes; early referral to a transplant center and early HCT donor identification should be considered. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

To establish and systematically validate clinically meaningful response criteria for MDS therapy

The current response MDS criteria suffer from significant limitations. First, there is a clear inconsistency in how complete remission (CR) is defined for MDS based on the International Working Group 2006compared with the definition of CR for AML in the ELN 2017and ELN 2022criteria. While no hemoglobin threshold is used for CR in AML, for MDS, CR requires a hemoglobin value ≥ 11 g/Dl, which has not been validated. These differences in CR definition can lead to different outcomes depending on which definition is used. There is a need to develop and validate new response criteria for higher-risk MDS that capture meaningful clinical benefits, similar to the introduction of CR with partial hematological recovery in ELN 2022 AML criteria. Conversely, the elimination of responses with doubtful clinical benefits (eg, marrow CR without meaningful count recovery) should be considered.

Introduction

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are heterogeneous stem cell neoplasms that primarily affect the elderly population. The approach to treatment of MDS includes management of symptoms or cytopenias, and treatments to alter the natural history of the disease in order to prevent progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

Management is largely risk-adapted based on various prognostic scoring systems. The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) was introduced in 1997 and was an important standard to assess prognosis in patients with MDS at initial diagnosis. The IPSS divides patients into 4 risk categories: low, intermediate-1, intermediate-2, and high risk. Bone marrow (BM) blasts, karyotype and number of cytopenias are the only 3 variables comprising the IPSS. The Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) was introduced in 2012. This added a refined cytogenetic classification, degree of cytopenia, and improved BM blast percentage as categories, and introduced 5 subgroups of MDS: very low (VL) risk, low risk (LR), intermediate, high, and very high risk. Some other tools that have been developed and widely used for risk stratification include the Global MD Anderson Model, the lower risk MD Anderson model (LR-MDAS), and the WHO-based prognostic scoring system (WPSS).

In low-risk disease (LR MDS), the aim of therapy is to improve cytopenias in patients with anemia, neutropenia and/ or thrombocytopenia in order to improve quality of life and prevent complications from cytopenias in an attempt to prolong overall survival (OS). Cytopenia-related complications and exacerbation of co-existing comorbidities significantly affect the disease burden, and affect quality of life and OS in low-risk disease. The LR-MDAS model suggested that almost a third of the LR MDS patients stratified by the IPSS progress or die within a short time after diagnosis. It incorporated age, hemoglobin, severity of thrombocytopenia, karyotype, and BM blasts ≥ 4% as variables, and divided patients into 3 groups, upstaging 25% of LR MDS patients into the higher risk disease category.

### Development of a core outcome set for myelodysplastic syndromes-a Delphi study from the EUMDS registry group [^116yVAHo]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Medium credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are characterised by ineffective haematopoiesis, abnormal cell morphology and increased risk of leukaemic evolution. 1 Several treatment options are available, including supportive therapy, growth factors, disease‐modifying modalities, such as intensive antileukaemic chemotherapy and allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). 1, 2, 3 Standardised reporting of outcomes is therefore essential. In 2000, the International Working Group (IWG) developed standardised response criteria 4 for MDS, revised in 2006, 5 as an important step toward standardising outcome measurements. The IWG response criteria mainly focus on haematological improvement and criteria for altering the natural history of disease, such as remission, treatment failure, progression and survival. 4, 5 Since alleviation of symptoms represents a relevant goal in the treatment of patients with MDS, the inclusion of scores to assess health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) has been suggested in the original version of IWG. 4 However, the definition of endpoints in MDS is complex, resulting in heterogeneity of outcomes used across different studies.

Reporting bias has frequently been observed in haematological studies and in clinical trials performed on MDS patients, 6, 7 and comparison of treatment effectiveness is therefore challenging. 8, 9 For the evaluation of evidence‐based treatment effectiveness, the validity of evidence syntheses is an essential factor. The validity is severely limited by non‐standardised outcome reporting. Selective reporting of outcomes within studies can be so diverse that it may have major negative implications on treatment recommendations. 10 Additionally, quantitative evidence synthesis, such as meta‐analysis, indirect treatment comparison, or cost‐effectiveness analysis are required in most health technology assessments of recently introduced treatments. 11 Comparison of such assessments may become impossible if different outcome measures are used across studies. Standardised reporting increases the comparability and transparency of research, decreasing unnecessary or overlapping research, which may be regarded as unethical. 12, 13

To formulate unified diagnostic criteria for MDS

Recently the World Health Organization and the International Consensus Classification for myeloid neoplasms have published separate diagnostic criteria for AML and MDS. Several important differences between the 2 classifications exist, especially in how patients with 10% to 19% blasts are classified. There is a significant concern that having 2 separate classification systems could have a negative impact on clinical care and research and have the potential to create confusion among patients and providers, as well as in the design, conduct, and interpretation of clinical trials. The need to establish a unified consensus classification for MDS has been emphasized.

Childhood MDS treatment strategy — curative modality, regimen, and outcomes are described: There is a paucity of clinical trials due to the rarity and heterogeneity of MDS in children, and the primary goal of treatment is generally a cure rather than palliation. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only curative option in childhood MDS with 3-year disease-free survival rates of approximately 50%. Myeloablative therapy with busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and melphalan, followed by either matched family or matched unrelated donor allogeneic HCT, is the treatment of choice for children with MDS, while other treatments such as chemotherapy, growth factors, and immunosuppressive therapy (IST) have a limited role. Prognosis for untreated MDS depends on the rate of progression to AML, and the stage of the disease at the time of HCT strongly predicts outcome.

The sole curative therapy for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Here this therapeutic modality is reviewed and critically evaluated in the context of the evidence. Specific criteria were used for searching the published literature and for grading the quality and strength of the evidence and the strength of the recommendations. A panel of MDS experts comprising transplantation and nontransplantation physicians developed consensus treatment recommendations. This review summarizes the standard MDS indications for HCT and addresses areas of controversy. Recent prospective trials have confirmed that allogeneic HCT confers survival benefits in patients with advanced or high-risk MDS compared with nontransplantation approaches, and the use of HCT is increasing in older patients with good performance status. However, patients with high-risk cytogenetic or molecular mutations remain at high risk for relapse. It is unknown whether administration of novel therapies before or after transplantation may decrease the risk of disease relapse in selected populations. Ongoing and future studies will investigate revised approaches to disease risk stratification, patient selection, and post-transplantation approaches to optimize allogeneic HCT outcomes for patients with MDS.

### Diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes: the classic and the novel [^116NGEb8]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogenous group of clonal myeloid neoplasms originating in hematopoietic stem cells. They are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis resulting in dysplasia in hematopoietic cells, and are associated with peripheral blood (PB) cytopenias, especially anemia, and a propensity to leukemic transformation. The incidence of MDS increases with age and in the general population is approximately 5 cases per 100,000 people per year. The median age of onset is above the age of 70 years. Patients with MDS are classified using one of several scoring systems. Most patients are assigned to the lower-risk or higher-risk groups. While these classifications may assist in diagnosis, they mainly serve for prognostication and to direct management.

In this work, we focus on the diagnosis of MDS and emphasize some of the more modern modalities currently under study. The entities of MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) are beyond the scope of this paper.

As MDS encompasses a heterogeneous group of disorders, the diagnostic process is based on a combination of clinical and laboratory features and the exclusion of other diseases. As such, there is no single specific diagnostic test, and there are no definitive diagnostic criteria for MDS.

### Randomized controlled trial of azacitidine in patients with the myelodysplastic syndrome: a study of the cancer and leukemia group B [^112CwKnS]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

Patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) have high mortality from bone marrow failure or transformation to acute leukemia. Supportive care is standard therapy. We previously reported that azacitidine (Aza C) was active in patients with high-risk MDS.

Patients and Methods

A randomized controlled trial was undertaken in 191 patients with MDS to compare Aza C (75 mg/m²/d subcutaneously for 7 days every 28 days) with supportive care. MDS was defined by French-American-British criteria. New rigorous response criteria were applied. Both arms received transfusions and antibiotics as required. Patients in the supportive care arm whose disease worsened were permitted to cross over to Aza C.

Results

Responses occurred in 60% of patients on the Aza C arm (7% complete response, 16% partial response, 37% improved) compared with 5% (improved) receiving supportive care (P < .001). Median time to leukemic transformation or death was 21 months for Aza C versus 13 months for supportive care (P = 0.007). Transformation to acute myelogenous leukemia occurred as the first event in 15% of patients on the Aza C arm and in 38% receiving supportive care (P = 0.001). Eliminating the confounding effect of early cross-over to Aza C, a landmark analysis after 6 months showed median survival of an additional 18 months for Aza C and 11 months for supportive care (P = 0.03). Quality-of-life assessment found significant major advantages in physical function, symptoms, and psychological state for patients initially randomized to Aza C.

Conclusion

Aza C treatment results in significantly higher response rates, improved quality of life, reduced risk of leukemic transformation, and improved survival compared with supportive care. Aza C provides a new treatment option that is superior to supportive care for patients with the MDS subtypes and specific entry criteria treated in this study.

Refractory anaemia associated with excessive intramedullary erythroid apoptosis and dysplasia is a major feature of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Recombinant human erythropoietin (specifically, epoetin alfa [EPO]) has been used in the therapy of MDS for many years. Initially, the erythroid response rates were modest, as EPO was used in all subgroups of MDS patients without discretion. However, with increased sophistication in patient selection and response evaluation criteria, there has been a significant improvement in the response rates to EPO therapy. This review discusses the evolution of therapeutic strategies incorporating EPO for the treatment of MDS.

Scope and limitations of this review

While definitions and classifications of MDS until 2001 included chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, in the 2008 WHO classification this former MDS subtype was transferred to a novel entity of mixed MDS/MPN.MDS and MDS/MPN share several pathogenic features but also display important differences. Clinical trials that constitute the basis for therapeutic recommendations have often enrolled both MDS and MDS/MPN patients. In this review, we will focus on the current WHO diagnosis of MDS but discuss MDS/MPN when relevant for the context.

An area with relevance for MDS are variants of clonal hematopoiesis, defined as the presence of somatic myeloid mutations in the absence of diagnostic criteria for MDS or any other blood cancer. Clonal hematopoiesis will be discussed herein as a differential diagnosis of MDS.

The review focuses on adult MDS. However, knowledge about germline conditions potentially predisposing to MDS has vastly increased over these past years, leading baseline investigation of patients with potential MDS to include evaluation of potential germline conditions.

NCCN Myelodysplastic syndromes — Azacitidine (AzaC) dosing and treatment course: AzaC therapy is a recommended option for progressive MDS or relatively high-risk disease and is FDA-approved, generally administered at 75 mg/m²/day SC for 7 days every 28 days for at least six courses. Treatment may be extended or used as a bridging therapy, and continuation beyond first response may improve remission quality, with continued AzaC improving response category in 48% of responders. Most patients achieved first response by 6 cycles, but up to 12 cycles were required for the majority to attain best response; the median number of cycles from first response to best response was 3 to 3.5 cycles, and patients received a median of 8 additional cycles (range, 0–27 cycles) beyond first response. Alternative 5‑day schedules have been evaluated, including SC 5–2–2 and 5‑day regimens and an IV regimen of 75 mg/m²/day for 5 days every 28 days; although response rates with the 5-day regimens appeared similar to the 7‑day schedule, survival benefit with AzaC has only been demonstrated using the 7‑day schedule.

### Current treatment algorithm for the management of lower-risk MDS [^115sx7pF]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Lower risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), defined as MDS with a Revised International Prognostic Scoring System score ≤ 3.5 points, will remain a challenging entity in 2018. Supportive care continues to be the linchpin of treatment, although the options to reduce transfusion needs are broadening. To achieve red blood cell transfusion independence in non-del(5q) patients, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents remain a mainstay of therapy as long as endogenous erythropoietin levels are < 500 U/L (and preferably < 200 U/L). Experimental strategies for patients ineligible for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents or relapsing after gaining transfusion independence include immunosuppressive agents, transforming growth factor β inhibitors, and lenalidomide. All these alternatives have shown reasonable response rates in selected patient populations with lower risk MDS. Patients with del(5q) disease can derive long-term benefit from lenalidomide, and some patients remain transfusion free for extended periods even after discontinuation of the drug. In rare cases in which thrombocytopenia is the main clinical problem leading to clinically significant bleeding events, thrombopoietin receptor analogues may alleviate bleeding, increase platelet counts, and rarely lead to trilineage responses. It seems prudent to use these drugs only in patients with confirmed bone marrow blast counts < 5%. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is reasonable for patients with high molecular risk of progression and those failing several lines of treatment with signs of progression toward higher-risk MDS.

### Prognostic models in myelodysplastic syndromes [^111UibSJ]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2013). Low credibility.

Establishing the prognosis for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is a key element of their care. It helps patients understand the severity of their disease and set expectations for their future. For physicians, an accurate estimate of prognosis drives decisions about the timing and choice of therapeutic options to consider. The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) has been the standard tool for MDS risk stratification since it was released in 1997. It has been used to describe patients in pivotal clinical trials and is a key element of practice guidelines. Subsequent changes to the classification scheme for MDS and an underestimation of risk in some patients from the low and intermediate-1 categories have led to the development of several newer prognostic models. The most recent is the revised IPSS (IPSS-R), which addresses several of the perceived deficiencies of its predecessor. Despite their utility, none of the available prognostic systems incorporates disease-related molecular abnormalities such as somatic mutations. These lesions are present in the nearly all cases and many have been shown to improve upon existing prognostic models. However, the interpretation of somatic mutations can be challenging and it is not yet clear how best to combine them with clinical predictors of outcome. Here I review several prognostic scoring systems developed after the IPSS and describe the emerging use of molecular markers to refine risk stratification in the MDS patient population.

### Treatment options for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes after hypomethylating agent failure [^112qHB3E]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

The treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) has hinged primarily on supportive care (ie, blood transfusions, colony stimulating agents, iron chelation, etc.) and the US Food and Drug Administration-approved agents, including 5-azacytidine, deoxyazacytidine, and lenalidomide. For patients no longer benefitting from these agents, there is a paucity of effective therapies. The challenges at this time include our limited understanding of the mechanisms of resistance to these therapies and the variables employed to select next best therapies for patients based on: (1) their performance status and medical comorbidities; (2) the molecular feature(s) of their MDS; (3) the prior treatments they have received; and (4) the long-term goal(s)/possibilities for their future treatment (ie, transplant vs no transplant).

Overview

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are defined by ineffective hematopoiesis resulting in blood cytopenias, and clonal instability with a risk of clonal evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Patients with MDS collectively have a high symptom burden and are also at risk of death from complications of cytopenias and AML. The goals of therapy for patients with MDS are to reduce disease-associated symptoms and the risk of disease progression and death, thereby improving both quality and quantity of life –.

Because the median age at diagnosis of MDS is ~70 years, patients frequently have comorbid conditions that may influence outcomes and treatment approaches. For instance, patients with established cardiovascular or pulmonary disease tolerate anemia poorly, while those with germline HFE mutations associated with hereditary hemochromatosis may have an elevated risk of organ toxicity from iron overload with repeated red cell transfusions. Functional defects in neutrophils or platelets may result in an infection or bleeding risk that is disproportionate to the degree of cytopenias.

Three drugs have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in MDS-related indications: the orally administered immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide, and two parenterally administered nucleoside analogs that are DNA hypomethylating agents (HMA), azacitidine, and decitabine. In addition to these agents, there is extensive off-label use of the erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) epoetin and darbepoetin in MDS, which is supported by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines and therefore reimbursed by Medicare as a compendium use. No new drugs have been approved for MDS-related indications since decitabine's FDA approval in 2006, underscoring the importance of clinical trial enrollment; currently only a small proportion of patients with MDS are enrolled in prospective interventional studies.

Summary of current treatment options

A summary of current treatment options for patients with lower-risk and higher-risk MDS is provided in Fig. 1.

Erythropoiesis-stimulating and maturing agents (ESAs and EMAs)

ESAs, such as recombinant erythropoietin or darbepoetin, are a standard first-line therapy for anemia in patients with lower-risk MDS. These agents are recommended by the NCCN and European LeukemiaNet (ELN) for the management of symptomatic anemia in lower-risk MDS patients with a target hemoglobin range of 10–12 g/dl. The level of serum erythropoietin (sEPO) is a strong predictor of clinical response to ESAs; patients with lower-risk MDS with a sEPO level of < 100 U/l have a response rate of > 70%, whereas, for those patients with a sEPO level of > 500 U/l, the response rate is < 10%. A prospective, randomized, phase 3 study compared the outcomes of patients treated with erythropoietin with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor plus supportive care vs. supportive care alone in 118 anemic patients with lower-risk MDS. The response rates in the erythropoietin vs. supportive care alone arms were 36% vs. 10%, respectively, at the initial treatment step; response rate in the erythropoietin arm increased to 47% following step 4 therapy.

### Hypomethylating agents and other novel strategies in myelodysplastic syndromes [^112u6SZR]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Over the last decade, treatment approaches for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) have improved significantly. Treatment of MDS is tailored to the specific risk characteristics of the patient. In general, patients are divided into lower- and higher-risk categories. Without therapy, prognosis of patients with higher-risk MDS is poor, and treatments should be directed to improve survival. Prognosis of patients with lower-risk MDS is more heterogeneous, and therapies are usually directed to minimize transfusion needs and potentially to alter the natural course of the disease. Treatment options for patients with higher-risk MDS include hypomethylating agents (azacitidine and decitabine), intensive chemotherapy (ICT), and allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (alloSCT). The use of the hypomethylating agents has transformed the approach to this patient population, in particular older individuals, for whom ICT and alloSCT are not an option. In lower-risk MDS, treatment strategies are used sequentially and usually include observation in patients with low risk and no transfusion dependency, growth factors, and lenalidomide for patients with alteration of chromosome 5 and anemia. The use of hypomethylating agents is less understood in this group of patients. AlloSCT is usually reserved for patients with lower-risk MDS closer to the time of transformation. In this short review, we discuss treatment alternatives for patients with MDS and delineate some of the ongoing challenges, including the development of better front-line strategies for patients with higher-risk disease, the concept of altering the natural course of the disease in lower-risk MDS, and the development of new treatment approaches for patients who do not benefit from hypomethylating agents.

### Treatment of low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes [^116jh8VC]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

The majority of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients belong to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) and IPSS-revised (IPSS-R) lower-risk categories. Their precise diagnostics and prognostic stratification is often a challenge, but may ensure the optimization of therapy. The availability of diverse treatment options has significantly improved the quality of life and survival of this group of patients. Anemia is the most relevant cytopenia in terms of frequency and symptoms in lower-risk MDS, and may be treated successfully with erythropoietic stimulating agents, provided a careful selection is performed on the basis of IPSS-R, endogenous erythropoietin levels, and transfusion independence. Doses and duration of therapy of erythropoietic-stimulating agents (ESAs) are critical to determine efficacy. In case a patient fails ESA treatment, the available options may include lenalidomide (approved for del5q positive cases), hypomethylating agents, and a rather large number of experimental agents, whose clinical trials should be offered to a larger number of MDS patients. The choice for second-line treatment must take into account biologic, cytogenetic, and molecular-identified characteristics of individual patients, as well as frailty and comorbidities. Other cytopenias are less frequently presenting as isolated. Specific therapy for thrombocytopenia has been proposed in experimental clinical trials with thrombomimetic agents that have shown good efficacy, but raised some safety concern. Although neutropenia is targeted symptomatically with growth factor supportive care, the immunosuppressive treatments are indicated mainly for pancytopenic, hypoplastic lower-risk MDS; they are not widely used because of their toxicity, despite the fact that they may induce responses. Finally, hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the curative option also for lower-risk MDS and timing should be carefully evaluated, balancing toxicity and the possibility of survival advantage. Finally, even when considered suitable for lower-risk MDS, transplant application is limited to the rarer fit and younger MDS patient.

### Next-generation therapy for lower-risk MDS [^1113EkBS]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are malignant myeloid neoplasms characterized by ineffective clonal hematopoiesis leading to peripheral blood cytopenia and a variable risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. In lower-risk (LR) MDS, as defined by prognostic scoring systems recently updated with the addition of a mutation profile, therapeutic options aim to reduce cytopenia, mainly anemia. Although options for reducing the transfusion burden have recently been improved, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), lenalidomide, hypomethylating agents, and, more recently, luspatercept have shown efficacy in rarely more than 50% of patients with a duration of response often far inferior to the patient's life expectancy. Nevertheless, several new therapies are currently under investigation aiming at improving cytopenia in patients with LR-MDS, mostly by targeting different biological pathways. Targeting ligands of the transforming growth factor β pathway has led to the approval of luspatercept in LR-MDS with ring sideroblasts or SF3B1 mutation, potentially replacing first-line ESAs in this population. Here, we also discuss the evolving standard of care for the treatment of LR-MDS and explore some of the most promising next-generation agents under investigation.

### Myelodysplastic syndromes treatment (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^112Z2LuN]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment of MDS Therapies for myelodysplastic syndromes are initiated in patients with a shorter predicted survival or in patients with clinically significant cytopenias. The impact of most MDS therapies on survival remains unproven. Treatment options:

- Supportive care.
- Disease-modifying agents.
- Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Supportive Care The mainstay of treatment for MDS has traditionally been supportive care, particularly for patients with symptomatic cytopenias or who are at high risk of infection or bleeding. Transfusions are reserved for the treatment of active bleeding; many centers offer prophylactic platelet transfusions for patients with platelet counts lower than 10, 000/mm3. Anemia should be treated with red-cell transfusions to avoid symptoms. For more information, see Fatigue. 5, 6] Most studies discontinued ESAs in patients who failed to show hematologic improvement after 3 to 4 months of therapy.

Average response duration is approximately 2 years. The availability of the oral iron-chelating agent deferasirox has led to its widespread use in patients with MDS. While some consensus panels advocate prophylactic iron chelation in patients with ongoing transfusion needs and substantial transfusion history, the impact of iron chelation on survival and disease progression is unknown. Immunosuppressive therapy Antithymocyte globulin has shown activity in MDS patients in several small series. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute conducted a phase II trial including 25 MDS patients with less than 20% blasts. Of all the patients studied, 11 responded and became transfusion-independent after ATG. The role of cytoreductive therapy in reducing the blast percentage before HSCT remains uncertain. Outcomes may not be as good for patients with treatment-related MDS.

- There are different types of treatment for patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms.
- The following types of treatment are used:

- Watchful waiting
- Chemotherapy
- Other drug therapy
- Stem cell transplant
- Supportive care
- Targeted therapy
- New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
- Treatment for myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms may cause side effects.

The following types of treatment are used: Watchful waiting Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patient's condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change. It is sometimes used to treat chronic myelomonocytic leukemia in patients with no or mild symptoms. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body. Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug. For more information, see Drugs Approved for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms or Myelodysplastic Syndromes. Supportive care Supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment. Supportive care may include transfusion therapy or drug therapy, such as antibiotics to fight infection. Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells.
- **Tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy**: TKI therapy blocks signals that tumors need to grow. TKIs block the enzyme tyrosine kinase that causes stem cells to become more blood cells than the body needs.

### Myelodysplastic / myeloproliferative neoplasms treatment… [^115NRtY5]. NCI (2003). Low credibility.

Allogeneic stem cell transplant Patients with high-risk disease who are young enough and fit enough may undergo allogeneic SCT. This represents the only potential cure for CMML. Hypomethylating agents like azacitidine and decitabine are usually given prior to allogeneic SCT for cytoreduction or to ameliorate cytopenias. The overall response rates exceeded 60% for all patients who received azacitidine, but the data did not allow an assessment specifically for patients with CMML. Several phase II trials reported response rates of 30% to 60% for patients with CMML who received hypomethylating agents.

Azacitidine and decitabine may reverse cytopenias, cytoreduce elevated WBC counts, reduce splenic size, and improve clinical symptoms. 38] With a median follow-up of 11 months, the median OS was 20 months in patients who received hydroxyurea and 9 months in patients who received etoposide. Other regimens In a phase II trial, 13 hypomethylating agent–naive patients with high-risk CMML were treated with azacitidine or decitabine plus venetoclax. With a median follow-up of 14. 1 months, the overall response rate was 85%, including two with complete response and a median duration of response of
17. 9 months. Six of these patients underwent subsequent allogeneic SCT. A phase I/II study of 23 patients with mostly high-risk MDS and greater than 5% marrow blast cells involved 10 patients with CMML. All patients received azacitidine plus venetoclax.

With a median follow-up of 13. 2 months, the overall response rate was 87%.

For information about MPN, see Childhood Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Treatment and Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia Treatment. Clinical Presentation Patients with myelodysplastic neoplasms often present with signs of cytopenias, including pallor, infection, or bruising. The bone marrow is usually characterized by hypercellularity and dysplastic changes of 10% or more in one or more precursor lineages. Clonal evolution can eventually lead to the development of acute myeloid leukemia. The percentage of abnormal blasts is less than 20%, and they lack common AML recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities, inv, t, or. In 2016, SAMD9 was identified as the cause of the MIRAGE syndrome, which is associated with early-onset MDS with monosomy 7. Subsequently, variants in SAMD9L were identified in patients with ataxia pancytopenia syndrome. PML:: RARA gene fusions) defines disease that should be treated as AML and not MDS, regardless of blast percentage. The World Health Organization notes that whether this should also apply to other recurring genetic abnormalities remains controversial. GATA2, SAMD9, or SAMD9L are especially common in children with deletions of all or part of chromosome 7. Spontaneous remission of MDS in young children with SAMD9 or SAMD9L variants led to the discovery that somatic genetic rescue can lead to phenotypic correction.

Genomic characterization has also shown that primary MDS in children differs from adult MDS at the molecular level. For more information about MDS, see the Molecular Abnormalities section.
