## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why underlying conditions matter in medicine, including how to define them, how they alter risk, and how to apply that knowledge in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "underlying conditions" mean across clinical contexts. Then, I should verify how they modify risk for acute illnesses and chronic trajectories. Next, I will examine mechanistic pathways that explain these associations. After that, I should review how definitions and classifications shape recognition and management. Finally, I will synthesize practical clinical implications and acknowledge uncertainties and controversies, ensuring each step is supported by appropriate sources.

> Let me first confirm the construct of "underlying conditions". Clinically, this refers to pre-existing chronic diseases or vulnerabilities that alter baseline risk, prognosis, and treatment response; examples include cardiovascular disease, diabetes, COPD, chronic kidney disease, immunosuppression, and selected pregnancy-related states, among others, and their prevalence and impact vary by population and context [^114tsCLZ] [^113ucV56] [^117FoCFs].

> Wait, let me verify how these conditions modify acute risk, especially during infectious threats. Multiple large COVID-19 datasets show that patients with underlying conditions have markedly higher hospitalization and mortality, with deaths roughly 12-fold higher in those with reported comorbidities compared to those without, and hospitalizations about sixfold higher, underscoring the amplification of risk at the bedside and for public health planning [^1175guXX].

> I should confirm whether this extends beyond COVID-19. Indeed, in community-acquired pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease, the presence of COPD, diabetes, chronic heart disease, asthma, or smoking cumulatively increases risk, with relative risks rising steeply as the number of risk factors increases; for example, individuals with three or more risk factors have a roughly 9–16-fold higher risk of pneumococcal pneumonia across age strata, reinforcing the concept of cumulative vulnerability rather than isolated disease effects [^113j8UhB] [^115DmDAQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about chronic trajectories. I need to check how underlying conditions shape long-term outcomes. In heart failure, multimorbidity is common and independently worsens prognosis, hospitalization risk, and symptom burden; guideline-directed therapy must explicitly address comorbidities such as diabetes, CKD, anemia/iron deficiency, and lung disease to optimize outcomes, illustrating that "underlying conditions" are not merely co-travelers but active drivers of disease progression and decompensation [^112Ud1Ri].

> Let me consider mechanisms next. I will now examine how these associations arise biologically. Shared genetic architectures and immune-mediated pathways create pleiotropy and convergence on common inflammatory axes; for instance, hundreds of loci are shared across autoimmune diseases, and network medicine shows that diseases often reflect perturbations of interconnected molecular modules rather than isolated genes, explaining why comorbidity clusters and why targeting pathways can have cross-disease benefits [^112n15Lc] [^114UDdt3] [^112ikgf8].

> But wait, what if the environment is the key driver rather than genes alone. I should double-check the gene–environment interface. Complex diseases commonly arise from interactions between heritable variation and environmental exposures, with epigenetic plasticity mediating responses that can precipitate or perpetuate disease; this helps explain why risk is context-dependent and why modifying exposures and social determinants alters outcomes even when genetic risk is fixed [^114QvAiM] [^112sGapj].

> Next, I should review how definitions and classifications shape recognition and care. The shift from symptom-based labels to mechanistic definitions improves diagnostic precision and therapeutic targeting, yet many current disease constructs remain phenotype-based and heterogeneous, risking misclassification and fragmented care; harmonized, transparent definitions are essential for valid risk stratification and comparative effectiveness research, as highlighted by COVID-19 phenotype harmonization efforts and critiques of network medicine constrained by imprecise disease annotations [^111qm5Tz] [^1157tzjX] [^113B6z8k].

> Let me synthesize clinical implications, but I need to ensure they are actionable. First, risk stratification should integrate age, comorbidity count, and specific high-risk conditions rather than rely on single-disease checklists; for example, a 66–70-year-old man without comorbidity may carry higher background mortality than a 56–60-year-old woman with one condition, arguing for nuanced, individualized risk framing in policy and counseling [^111z3rfo]. Second, prevention and vaccination strategies should prioritize those with cumulative risk factors, as shown for pneumococcal disease and COVID-19, where targeted immunization and shielding policies meaningfully reduce severe outcomes in the multimorbid [^113j8UhB] [^113QZx3Z]. Third, management plans must explicitly address multimorbidity, simplify polypharmacy, and align with patient goals, recognizing that disease-centered silos can undertreat or overtreat patients with complex needs [^113ucV56] [^113dC36c].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also acknowledge uncertainties and controversies. Some argue that the traditional disease model is inadequate for modern multimorbidity and that care should pivot toward modifiable biological and nonbiological factors and patient-defined goals; others caution that abandoning disease constructs risks losing mechanistic traction and scientific coherence, so a balanced, integrative approach is prudent while evidence accrues [^113dC36c] [^112t64YU]. Additionally, penetrance, expressivity, and population ascertainment biases complicate the translation of genetic risk into clinical action, reinforcing the need for cautious, context-aware application of genomic risk tools alongside clinical judgment [^113UboNZ] [^115yNa2G].

> In summary, I need to ensure the core message is clear: underlying conditions matter because they amplify acute risk, accelerate chronic trajectories, and refract both diagnosis and treatment through the lens of shared mechanisms and cumulative vulnerability; recognizing, defining, and proactively managing these conditions — within a patient-centered, multimorbidity-aware framework — is central to modern clinical practice and public health strategy [^1175guXX] [^112Ud1Ri] [^113ucV56].

Because **underlying conditions** (chronic diseases, genetic predispositions, or environmental exposures) **alter baseline physiology** [^113ucV56], they increase susceptibility to complications, worsen outcomes, and shape treatment choices. They **modify disease risk** by impairing immune, cardiovascular, or metabolic function [^113j8UhB], and they **steer management** by dictating drug selection, dosing, and monitoring [^115Fgsr1]. Recognizing and treating underlying conditions is essential to reduce morbidity, improve prognosis, and personalize care [^113rXk4j].

---

## Physiological impact of underlying conditions

Underlying conditions **disrupt normal physiology**, increasing vulnerability to acute and chronic diseases [^112EBjeV]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Immune dysfunction**: Chronic diseases (e.g. diabetes, HIV) impair immune responses, increasing infection risk and severity [^113j8UhB].

- **Cardiovascular compromise**: Heart disease, hypertension, and atherosclerosis reduce perfusion, promoting ischemia, arrhythmias, and organ dysfunction [^1115VJ9j].

- **Metabolic derangements**: Obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome alter lipid and glucose metabolism, promoting inflammation and organ damage [^notfound].

- **Genetic predisposition**: Inherited variants (e.g. BRCA1, APOE) elevate risk for cancers, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders [^112EBjeV].

---

## Influence on disease susceptibility and severity

Underlying conditions **significantly increase susceptibility and severity** across diseases:

| **Disease category** | **Examples of underlying conditions** | **Impact on susceptibility and severity** |
|-|-|-|
| Infectious diseases | - Diabetes <br/> - COPD <br/> - Immunosuppression | Higher risk and severity of infections (e.g. COVID-19, pneumonia) [^1175guXX] [^114tsCLZ] |
| Cardiovascular diseases | - Hypertension <br/> - Hyperlipidemia <br/> - Diabetes | Increased risk of MI, stroke, heart failure [^112Ud1Ri] |
| Cancer | - Genetic mutations (e.g. BRCA) <br/> - Chronic inflammation | Higher incidence and worse prognosis [^notfound] |
| Autoimmune diseases | - Genetic predisposition <br/> - Environmental triggers | Increased risk and severity [^112n15Lc] |

---

## Modification of disease progression

Underlying conditions **alter disease trajectories** by accelerating progression, increasing complications, and worsening outcomes [^112Ud1Ri]. For example, diabetes accelerates diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease; chronic kidney disease worsens cardiovascular outcomes and mortality; and immunosuppression increases malignancy and infection risk [^notfound].

---

## Clinical management implications

Recognizing underlying conditions is **essential for management** because they influence treatment selection, dosing, and monitoring [^111gAjh5]. Management implications include:

- **Medication selection**: Comorbidities guide drug choice (e.g. beta-blockers in heart failure with hypertension) [^112Ud1Ri].

- **Dosing adjustments**: Renal or hepatic impairment requires dose modification [^notfound].

- **Monitoring strategies**: Comorbidities necessitate closer surveillance (e.g. ECGs in arrhythmias, renal function in nephrotoxic drugs) [^notfound].

- **Preventive measures**: Vaccination, lifestyle changes, and screening are tailored to comorbidities [^113j8UhB].

---

## Examples of underlying conditions influencing specific diseases

- **COVID-19**: Cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and COPD increase severity and mortality [^1175guXX] [^115tf1fP].

- **Heart failure**: Hypertension, diabetes, and CKD worsen prognosis and guide therapy [^112Ud1Ri].

- **Cancer**: BRCA mutations and chronic inflammation increase risk and affect treatment [^notfound].

- **Autoimmune diseases**: Genetic predisposition and environmental triggers shape risk and severity [^112n15Lc].

---

## Importance of identifying and addressing underlying conditions

Identifying and treating underlying conditions **improves outcomes** by reducing complications, enhancing quality of life, and prolonging survival [^116TrxnK]. Early detection enables timely intervention, while comprehensive management yields broad benefits. Personalized care that incorporates comorbidities and genetic factors optimizes treatment [^113rXk4j].

---

Underlying conditions **shape disease risk, progression, and management** by altering physiology and interacting with genetic and environmental factors [^112Ud1Ri]. Recognizing and addressing them is essential for reducing morbidity, improving prognosis, and enabling personalized, effective care [^112Ud1Ri].

### Disease, diagnosis or syndrome? [^1168263v]. Practical Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

The advance of medical semantics is, in general, towards causation. As knowledge increases, the common consequence is the re-definition of disease. This starts with symptoms then a disorder of structure or function, abnormalities of images, genetics or biochemistry, the ultimate aim being a specific aetiological mechanism which replaces broader descriptions. But medical terminology of diseases, diagnoses and syndromes is inherently imprecise. Careless nomenclature causes confused dialogue and communication. Symptoms of uncertain cause are commonly lumped together and given a new 'diagnostic' label which also may confuse and produce false concepts that stultify further thought and research. Such medicalisation of non-specific aggregations of symptoms should be avoided. The defining characteristics of diseases and diagnoses should be validated and agreed. The pragmatic diagnoses of 'symptom of unknown cause' or 'non-disease' are preferable to falsely labelling patients with obscure or non-existent diseases.

### Estimating excess 1-year mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic according to underlying conditions and age: a population-based cohort study [^114tsCLZ]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Implications of all the available evidence

Our models allow the estimation of overall (direct and indirect) effects on excess mortality of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time, we provide a model, a tool, and open-access data to individualise risk prediction across underlying conditions, which has clinical, public health, and research benefits for both the COVID-19 pandemic and post-pandemic contexts.

Physical distancing and other strategies focus on high-risk groups, with US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention specifying "older adults, and people who have serious chronic medical conditions such as heart disease, diabetes and lung disease". On March 16, 2020, the UK Government announced that particular subgroups are at high risk from COVID-19, and recommended stringent distancing measures, telling people how to stay away from others. On March 22, 2020, the Government announced that 1·5 million "extremely vulnerable" people in England with underlying conditions (including severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]) should "shield" for 12 weeks, but did not explain how these conditions were selected. The UK Government did not implement full suppression (during which only key workers are likely to be exposed) until March 23, 2020. Up to that date, people were still in close proximity in work and public places.

Here, we provide estimates of 1-year mortality by underlying conditions to understand the broader health impact of COVID-19. Our objectives were to provide the research and policy community and public with parameters (prevalence and background pre-COVID-19 1-year mortality risk by age and underlying conditions) to assist modelling; and to provide initial estimates of the excess COVID-19-related deaths over a 1-year period based on differing rates and relative levels of impact of infection. We define COVID-19-related mortality as both direct and indirect effects of the pandemic.

### The end of the disease era [^113dC36c]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The time has come to abandon disease as the focus of medical care. The changed spectrum of health, the complex interplay of biological and nonbiological factors, the aging population, and the interindividual variability in health priorities render medical care that is centered on the diagnosis and treatment of individual diseases at best out of date and at worst harmful. A primary focus on disease may inadvertently lead to undertreatment, overtreatment, or mistreatment. The numerous strategies that have evolved to address the limitations of the disease model, although laudable, are offered only to a select subset of persons and often further fragment care. Clinical decision making for all patients should be predicated on the attainment of individual goals and the identification and treatment of all modifiable biological and nonbiological factors, rather than solely on the diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of individual diseases. Anticipated arguments against a more integrated and individualized approach range from concerns about medicalization of life problems to "this is nothing new" and "resources would be better spent determining the underlying biological mechanisms". The perception that the disease model is "truth" rather than a previously useful model will be a barrier as well. Notwithstanding these barriers, medical care must evolve to meet the health care needs of patients in the 21st century.

### Properties of human disease genes and the role of genes linked to mendelian disorders in complex disease aetiology [^115yqViS]. Human Molecular Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Improving our understanding of genetic mutations and potential genetic risk factors directly causing, or contributing to, human diseases is at the core of modern medical genetics. In that context, evolutionary theory can be used to characterize the selective forces that have acted on the causal and susceptibility alleles underlying human genetic disorders. Complex disorders are common in the general population and result from the interaction of several susceptibility loci and environmental factors. In contrast, Mendelian disorders are typically rare and have predictable inheritance patterns as they usually result from a single causative mutation in a gene. However, heterogeneity and incomplete penetrance suggest that the classical distinction between Mendelian and complex diseases is not always absolute and that a continuum exists between the purely Mendelian and the most complex diseases. Although several unclear situations are found, since many genes harbour mutations that are unequivocally linked to particular Mendelian diseases, one can still define a set of genes linked to Mendelian diseases. Recent advances in medical research have resulted in large catalogues of mutations causing Mendelian hereditary disorders and of susceptibility loci contributing to complex diseases, such as those of the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database and the Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) Catalogue. This biomedical information, when coupled with the increasing public availability of whole genome sequences, can be used to elucidate the genetic architecture and natural history of human genetic diseases.

### Emerging infectious determinants of chronic diseases [^113UDvAN]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Evidence now confirms that noncommunicable chronic diseases can stem from infectious agents. Furthermore, at least 13 of 39 recently described infectious agents induce chronic syndromes. Identifying the relationships can affect health across populations, creating opportunities to reduce the impact of chronic disease by preventing or treating infection. As the concept is progressively accepted, advances in laboratory technology and epidemiology facilitate the detection of noncultivable, novel, and even recognized microbial origins. A spectrum of diverse pathogens and chronic syndromes emerges, with a range of pathways from exposure to chronic illness or disability. Complex systems of changing human behavioral traits superimposed on human, microbial, and environmental factors often determine risk for exposure and chronic outcome. Yet the strength of causal evidence varies widely, and detecting a microbe does not prove causality. Nevertheless, infectious agents likely determine more cancers, immune-mediated syndromes, neurodevelopmental disorders, and other chronic conditions than currently appreciated.

### The illness-disease dichotomy and the biological-clinical splitting of medicine [^112t64YU]. Medical Humanities (2021). Medium credibility.

In a recent paper, Sharpe and Greco (2019) argue that some clinical conditions, such as chronic fatigue syndrome (sometimes called myalgic encephalomyelitis), should be treated by altering the patient's experience and response to symptoms without necessarily searching for an underlying cause. As a result, we should allow for the existence of 'illnesses without (underlying) diseases'. Wilshire and Ward (2019) reply that this possibility requires unwarranted causal assumptions about the psychosocial origins of conditions not predicted by a disease model. In so doing, it is argued that Sharpe and Greco introduce epistemological and methodological problems with serious medical consequences, for example, patients feel guilt for seeking treatment for illnesses that only exist 'all in the mind', and medical researchers are discouraged from looking for more effective treatments of such conditions. We propose a view that integrates the insights of both papers. We abandon both the strict distinction between disease and illness and the naïve unidirectional account of causality that accompanies it. This, we claim, is a step towards overcoming the current harmful tendencies to conceptually separate (1) Symptom management and disease-modifying treatments. (2) Rehabilitative-palliative care and 'causal' curing. (3) Most importantly, biomedicine and clinical medicine, where the latter is currently at risk of losing its status as scientific.

### Is pregnancy a disease? A normative approach [^114crUhU]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

In this paper, we identify some key features of what makes something a disease, and consider whether these apply to pregnancy. We argue that there are some compelling grounds for regarding pregnancy as a disease. Like a disease, pregnancy affects the health of the pregnant person, causing a range of symptoms from discomfort to death. Like a disease, pregnancy can be treated medically. Like a disease, pregnancy is caused by a pathogen, an external organism invading the host's body. Like a disease, the risk of getting pregnant can be reduced by using prophylactic measures. We address the question of whether the 'normality' of pregnancy, its current necessity for human survival, or the value often attached to it are reasons to reject the view that pregnancy is a disease. We point out that applying theories of disease to the case of pregnancy, can in many cases illuminate inconsistencies and problems within these theories. Finally, we show that it is difficult to find one theory of disease that captures all paradigm cases of diseases, while convincingly excluding pregnancy. We conclude that there are both normative and pragmatic reasons to consider pregnancy a disease.

### Estimating excess 1-year mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic according to underlying conditions and age: a population-based cohort study [^111z3rfo]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

We show that by Public Health England criteria, at least 20% of the population falls within the high-risk mortality category for COVID-19: 13·7% based on age older than 70 years (an arbitrary cutoff) and a further 6·3% based on having one or more underlying conditions. We show how policy might consider age in combination with underlying conditions. For example, a man aged 66–70 years with no underlying conditions, who is not currently considered high risk, has a higher background 1-year mortality (1·07%) than that of a woman aged 56–60 years with one underlying condition (0·91%), who is considered high risk.

The underlying conditions that we report (cardiovascular diseases, COPD, and diabetes) are known to already be suboptimally managed before COVID-19, with missed opportunities for effective (secondary) preventive interventions common in many countries. With COVID-19 pressures, these practical actions for clinicians might not be addressed, and chronic disease management care might deteriorate. Primary and secondary health-care workers have an important role in optimising guideline-recommended management of underlying conditions to lower background risk, particularly if shielding or suppression measures are to be sustained over long periods — eg, 3 or more months. The prototype online risk calculator might be relevant for clinicians to prioritise such patients.

In England, 1·5 million individuals have been identified based on national health records as being extremely vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, on the basis of one of a wide range of factors (including pregnancy with serious heart disease, chemotherapy, solid organ transplants, and cystic fibrosis). These patients have been identified and are being individually supported (eg, with food parcels and medicine delivery) for the life-changing intervention of 12 weeks of shielding. Such policies, which require actionable knowledge across multiple diseases have few, if any, historical precedents; only countries with nationwide health-system data can implement such policies. The list was probably designed to identify patients who are most susceptible to infection or have a degree of immunosuppression, which cannot be quantified in a standardised way. The prognosis research strategy initiative has previously made recommendations for consistent approaches to understanding prognosis across multiple diseases and clinical specialties, the importance of which is highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Nature, nurture and human disease [^114QvAiM]. Nature (2003). Excellent credibility.

What has been learnt about individual human biology and common diseases 50 years on from the discovery of the structure of DNA? Unfortunately the double helix has not, so far, revealed as much as one would have hoped. The primary reason is an inability to determine how nurture fits into the DNA paradigm. We argue here that the environment exerts its influence at the DNA level and so will need to be understood before the underlying causal factors of common human diseases can be fully recognized.

### When do symptoms become a disease? [^111qm5Tz]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

When do symptoms become a disease? Are there rules or norms, currently or in the past, that tell us when a particular collection of largely symptom-based criteria has enough specificity, utility, or plausibility to justify the appellation disease? The history of numerous symptom-based diagnoses in use today suggests partial answers to these questions. The 19th-century shift to understanding ill health as a result of specific diseases, increasingly defined more by signs than symptoms, led to a loss of status for illnesses that possessed little clinical or laboratory specificity. Nevertheless, clinicians then and now have used symptom-based diagnoses. Some of these diagnoses owe their existence as specific diseases to the norms and practices of an older era much different from our own. Others have not only thrived but have resisted plausible redefinition done by using more "objective" criteria. Many strategies, such as response-to-treatment arguments, quantitative methods (for example, factor analysis), and consensus conferences, have been used to find or confer specificity in symptom-based diagnoses. These strategies are problematic and have generally been used after symptom-based diagnoses have been recognized and defined. These historical observations emphasize that although biological and clinical factors have set boundaries for which symptoms might plausibly be linked in a disease concept, social influences have largely determined which symptom clusters have become diseases.

### Estimating excess 1-year mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic according to underlying conditions and age: a population-based cohort study [^1157tzjX]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

We found that patients with conditions not on the vulnerable patient list may be at as high or greater mortality than those who are. For example, cardiovascular disease is not on the vulnerable patient list and has a 1-year mortality of 6%; we found that the 1-year mortality risk of people with two or more conditions was 11% — but multiple morbidities co-occurring in the same individual do not yet qualify as extremely vulnerable. A more systematic, transparent understanding is needed of which underlying conditions are important for policy and patients. Further research is required to identify the extent to which patients with other physical conditions, frailty, and mental health conditions as well as those experiencing social exclusion (eg, homeless people and intravenous drug users) might benefit from targeted interventions.

We have deposited definitions of underlying conditions relevant to COVID-19 in the HDR UK–CALIBER open online portal. It is important for reproducible research in COVID-19 that different research groups within and between countries use clinical information from electronic health records in consistent, transparent, and validated ways to define underlying conditions and the COVID-19 syndrome (electronic health record phenotypes). It has previously been shown that in defining one disease — asthma — research groups combine clinical data in more than 60 different ways to reach a definition. However, few efforts have been made to harmonise definitions of diseases across national electronic health records. To address the COVID-19 pandemic, international efforts are needed to harmonise definitions of underlying conditions and the clinical syndrome and progression of COVID-19 infection using routine clinical health records.

We share age-specific (5-year age bands) and sex-specific estimates of prevalence and 1-year mortality for each underlying condition. These population-based estimates might be relevant for other countries, particularly those in which population-based records are neither available nor accessible. As an illustration, we show estimates of excess deaths in different countries if the background (pre-COVID-19) mortality from England were applied. It is known, based on disease-specific registries, that mortality among people with underlying conditions differs between countries, but few studies using electronic health records compare outcomes across countries. In one study, the long-term mortality among patients who had survived a heart attack was broadly consistent across France, Sweden, the UK, and the United States, suggesting that our findings might have international relevance.

### Immune-mediated disease genetics: the shared basis of pathogenesis [^112n15Lc]. Trends in Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Recent genetic studies in multiple autoimmune and inflammatory diseases have identified hundreds of genomic loci harboring risk variants. These variants are shared between diseases at unexpectedly high rates, providing a molecular basis for the shared pathogenesis of immune-mediated disease. If properly used, these results could allow us to identify specific pathways underlying disease; explain disease heterogeneity by grouping patients by molecular causes rather than overall symptomatology; and develop more rational approaches to diagnosis and therapy targeting these molecular defects. Here we review the current state of play in the genetics of immune-mediated disease, evidence for this sharing and how this new knowledge can lead to medically actionable discoveries of pathobiology.

### Which individuals are at increased risk of pneumococcal disease and why? Impact of COPD, asthma, smoking, diabetes, and / or chronic heart disease on community-acquired pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease [^113j8UhB]. Thorax (2015). Low credibility.

Multiple risk factors

Multiple risk factors for pneumococcal disease are frequently observed in individuals > 65 years of age, with more than 60% having two or more underlying medical conditions. Multiple conditions have been shown to have a cumulative effect on the risk of CAP/IPD, as well as on the mortality associated with these diseases. The risk of pneumococcal disease (all-cause pneumonia, pneumococcal pneumonia and IPD) increases as the number of risk factors increases in different age groups (18–49, 50–64 and ≥ 65 years). Rates are particularly high in those with three or more conditions (eg, RR for pneumococcal pneumonia relative to healthy individuals: 16.5, 12.8 and 9.2, respectively).

### The origins of human disease: a short story on "where diseases come from" [^1153yRM9]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2006). Low credibility.

Most of public health is based on the working hypothesis that disease is caused by exposure to noxious factors in the external environment. While this approach has produced great successes in primary prevention, a general theory of the origins of human disease cannot be found in the textbooks of public health or epidemiology. This paper suggests that, in all its manifestations, disease is a reaction of the human organism to, and/or a failure to cope with, one or more unbalancing changes in its internal environment. These are caused by one or more unfavourable exchanges with the external environment and/or failures in the structural and functional design of the organism. In the final analysis, human disease is attributable to the dependence of organisms on a fundamentally hostile external environment and to unfortunate evolutionary legacies. While this sketch of a theory suggests that there will ultimately be some hard limits to primary prevention, it also helps in identifying possible new approaches to prevention, including interfering with disease mechanisms, and remedying human organisms' design failures.

### Laboratory perspectives in the development of polygenic risk scores for disease: a points to consider statement of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^115yNa2G]. Genetics in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

ACMG — Testing in the context of Mendelian conditions: If the PRS is being used within a joint prediction model for Mendelian disease risk, there are additional challenges in validating the use of these combined tests. The target populations for testing differ, as Mendelian testing is usually done in high-risk populations with significant family history and challenges exist with testing of healthy populations and should be given careful consideration keeping in mind the potential benefits and risks. The risk information conveyed by each test type differs; Mendelian variant curation frameworks rely on an understanding of disease mechanisms, PRS describes a statistical association, and high-risk does not indicate an underlying disease pathology, and PRS is solely considered screening information. There is no clear guidance on how these different types of risk information can be accurately combined or related to one another. The predicted phenotype of a PRS may not be appropriate for Mendelian diseases. When designing reports including both monogenic high-penetrance variants and PRS in a joint model, the potential effect on medical management must be considered, and many thresholds for prophylactic action or screening recommendations are dependent on lifetime or absolute risk of disease, which are traditionally dependent on well-established risks conferred by Mendelian conditions.

### Global burden of neuropathic pain [^1132qoy6]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

Global burden of disease studies measure the impact of disability and premature death resulting from specific diseases and injuries. Recently, these studies have highlighted the leading contribution of regional pain conditions (low back pain and neck pain in particular) to the global burden of disability. However, to date, there has not been a systematic approach to measuring the global burden of disease attributable to neuropathic pain (NP) conditions. This article gives a brief overview of the concept of burden of disease, the underlying drivers, and dynamics of disease burden at a population level and proposes an agenda in relation to NP for developing the conceptual and empirical evidence base necessary for estimating the global burden of NP.

### Human symptoms-disease network [^112ikgf8]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

In the post-genomic era, the elucidation of the relationship between the molecular origins of diseases and their resulting phenotypes is a crucial task for medical research. Here, we use a large-scale biomedical literature database to construct a symptom-based human disease network and investigate the connection between clinical manifestations of diseases and their underlying molecular interactions. We find that the symptom-based similarity of two diseases correlates strongly with the number of shared genetic associations and the extent to which their associated proteins interact. Moreover, the diversity of the clinical manifestations of a disease can be related to the connectivity patterns of the underlying protein interaction network. The comprehensive, high-quality map of disease-symptom relations can further be used as a resource helping to address important questions in the field of systems medicine, for example, the identification of unexpected associations between diseases, disease etiology research or drug design.

### Estimated county-level prevalence of selected underlying medical conditions associated with increased risk for severe COVID-19 illness-United States, 2018 [^117FoCFs]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, estimates were based on BRFSS data and subject to survey biases such as nonresponse, social desirability, and recall and knowledge of having a particular condition. Second, BRFSS data do not include all underlying medical conditions that might increase risk for severe COVID-19 illness, such as sickle cell disease, or information on organ transplant or disease severity. Third, some of the underlying medical conditions included in BRFSS might not exactly capture those conditions with the strongest and most consistent evidence such as specific heart conditions (e.g. cardiomyopathies and heart failure) or specific type of diabetes. Further, because COVID-19 is a novel disease and information regarding risk factors for severe illness is evolving, additional underlying medical conditions might be added in the future (as an example, cancer was added to the list after these analyses were conducted). Fourth, BRFSS data are collected for noninstitutionalized civilian persons and exclude populations that might be particularly vulnerable to severe COVID-19 illness, including those living in long-term care facilities and incarcerated populations, and might therefore not be representative for those groups. Finally, these estimates might be imprecise because of the multilevel regression modeling process and county-level population estimation.

These findings can be used by state and local decision-makers to help identify areas at higher risk for severe COVID-19–associated illness because of underlying medical conditions and guide resource allocation and implementation of prevention and mitigation strategies. Future analyses could include weighting the contribution of each underlying medical condition according to the risk for severe COVID-19–associated outcomes, as well as identifying and incorporating other aspects of vulnerability to both infection and severe outcomes to better estimate the number of persons at increased risk for COVID-19. These findings highlight the prevalence of underlying medical conditions at the local (county) level that are important causes of morbidity and mortality on their own and increase risk for severe COVID-19–associated illness. These findings also emphasize the importance of prevention efforts to reduce the prevalence of these underlying medical conditions and their risk factors such as smoking, unhealthy diet, and lack of physical activity.

### Human disease genes [^113vwcvg]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

The complete human genome sequence will facilitate the identification of all genes that contribute to disease. We propose that the functional classification of disease genes and their products will reveal general principles of human disease. We have determined functional categories for nearly 1,000 documented disease genes, and found striking correlations between the function of the gene product and features of disease, such as age of onset and mode of inheritance. As knowledge of disease genes grows, including those contributing to complex traits, more sophisticated analyses will be possible; their results will yield a deeper understanding of disease and an enhanced integration of medicine with biology.

### A brief history of human disease genetics [^113rXk4j]. Nature (2020). Excellent credibility.

A primary goal of human genetics is to identify DNA sequence variants that influence biomedical traits, particularly those related to the onset and progression of human disease. Over the past 25 years, progress in realizing this objective has been transformed by advances in technology, foundational genomic resources and analytical tools, and by access to vast amounts of genotype and phenotype data. Genetic discoveries have substantially improved our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for many rare and common diseases and driven development of novel preventative and therapeutic strategies. Medical innovation will increasingly focus on delivering care tailored to individual patterns of genetic predisposition.

### Decoding disease: from genomes to networks to phenotypes [^111iQqbr]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2021). High credibility.

Interpreting the effects of genetic variants is key to understanding individual susceptibility to disease and designing personalized therapeutic approaches. Modern experimental technologies are enabling the generation of massive compendia of human genome sequence data and associated molecular and phenotypic traits, together with genome-scale expression, epigenomics and other functional genomic data. Integrative computational models can leverage these data to understand variant impact, elucidate the effect of dysregulated genes on biological pathways in specific disease and tissue contexts, and interpret disease risk beyond what is feasible with experiments alone. In this Review, we discuss recent developments in machine learning algorithms for genome interpretation and for integrative molecular-level modelling of cells, tissues and organs relevant to disease. More specifically, we highlight existing methods and key challenges and opportunities in identifying specific disease-causing genetic variants and linking them to molecular pathways and, ultimately, to disease phenotypes.

### The rate by which mortality increase with age is the same for those who experienced chronic disease as for the general population [^115tKmwL]. Age and Ageing (2021). Medium credibility.

Diseases can be linked to ageing in several ways. First, the mere onset of a disease is a stressor for the human body, which may cause the rate-of-ageing to go up. Second, disease can also be interpreted as a manifestation of underlying characteristics such as genetics or lifestyle, which affect individual health and as a consequence the rate-of-ageing. Third, the onset of a disease may indicate a threshold where the deterioration of the body has reached a critical — potentially life threatening — level, and as a consequence, ageing may be accelerated.

In this study, we investigate how mortality varies between populations that have experienced different chronic diseases. More specifically we explore how these diseases affect the level of mortality, as well as the relative increase with age, to see if the increase remains at around 11% per chronological year, or if it speeds up. The selected diseases, myocardial infarction, diabetes and cancer, represent different pathogeneses. Even though following upon an underlying artery disease, myocardial infarction can be considered as an acute event or 'shock'. Diabetes develops over a longer time period without a clear onset, even if diagnosed at one point in time. It is associated with several adverse health consequences and an excess risk of mortality, even after adjusting for co-existing diseases. Finally, by looking at cancer, we include a disease that is not only the result of an accumulation of risk factors but also of pure chance by random mutations, even if the contribution of randomness has been debated.

### Inflammatory bowel disease, peptic ulcer and diverticular disease as certified causes of death in an english population 1979–2003 [^117SDJUd]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

When gastrointestinal diseases are certified as causes of death, they are often not selected as the underlying cause. Until recently, only one underlying cause of death has been coded and analysed in official national statistics in England and many other countries.

Aims

To report on the total 'burden of mortality' from some common gastrointestinal diseases, and whether it has changed over time, including all certified causes of death as well as underlying causes, (i) in the Oxford region from 1979 to 2003, (ii) in England from 1996 to 2003; and to quantify the under-ascertainment of cause-specific mortality when based on underlying cause alone.

Methods

We searched death certificate data from the Oxford Record Linkage Study database, and from English national data, for specified gastrointestinal diseases certified as underlying or contributory causes of death.

Results

For all the conditions studied, underlying-cause-coded mortality missed a substantial percentage of all certified deaths. The extent of underestimation varied according to the periods in which different criteria were used for the selection of the underlying cause. For example, in Oxford, in the latest period 1993–2003, underlying-cause-coded mortality identified only 37% of all death certificates with ulcerative colitis, 47% of Crohn's disease, between 62 and 68% for the different types of peptic ulcer and 66% of diverticular disease.

Conclusions

Studies of mortality for these diseases should take account of all certified causes as well as underlying-cause mortality. This is particularly important for analyses that go across periods of change to the rules for selecting the underlying cause of death.

### The balance between heritable and environmental aetiology of human disease [^114hXgNV]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2006). Medium credibility.

The Human Genome Project and the ensuing International HapMap Project were largely motivated by human health issues. But the distance from a DNA sequence variation to a novel disease gene is considerable; for complex diseases, closing this gap hinges on the premise that they arise mainly from heritable causes. Using cancer as an example of complex disease, we examine the scientific evidence for the hypothesis that human diseases result from interactions between genetic variants and the environment.

### Network medicine: a network-based approach to human disease [^114UDdt3]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2011). Medium credibility.

Given the functional interdependencies between the molecular components in a human cell, a disease is rarely a consequence of an abnormality in a single gene, but reflects the perturbations of the complex intracellular and intercellular network that links tissue and organ systems. The emerging tools of network medicine offer a platform to explore systematically not only the molecular complexity of a particular disease, leading to the identification of disease modules and pathways, but also the molecular relationships among apparently distinct (patho)phenotypes. Advances in this direction are essential for identifying new disease genes, for uncovering the biological significance of disease-associated mutations identified by genome-wide association studies and full-genome sequencing, and for identifying drug targets and biomarkers for complex diseases.

### Duration of protective immunity following COVID-19 vaccination of individuals with underlying health conditions: a rapid review [^113QZx3Z]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2024). Medium credibility.

The World Health Organization has stated that the primary goal of immunisation in the COVID-19 pandemic remains to protect against hospitalisation, severe disease and death. Vaccination is particularly important for those with underlying health conditions given the high risk of severe disease in this population. The aim of this review was to examine the change in efficacy and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination over time in individuals with underlying conditions. A rapid review was undertaken in Cochrane, Embase, Medline, Europe PMC, MedRxiv and Google Scholar from 01/01/2020 to 27/10/2021. A total of 14 unique studies (3 randomised controlled trials and 11 observational studies) were included. Overall, there was limited and inconsistent evidence regarding vaccine efficacy and effectiveness in those with underlying health conditions. However, the evidence suggests potentially faster waning of vaccine effectiveness against infection, severe disease and death in individuals with underlying conditions, particularly for older adults with these conditions, and in those who are immunocompromised. Protection in younger age groups with underlying conditions who are not immunocompromised, may be largely comparable to that observed in the general population, though this is uncertain. Given the significant burden of infection on individuals with underlying conditions, any small decrease in protection is likely to have a substantial impact in this population. Hence, the evidence supports a policy of providing additional doses to those who are immunocompromised, and boosters to all those with underlying health conditions. Further research is required to understand the impact of new variants on vaccine efficacy/effectiveness in this population.

### Evaluation after sudden death in the young: a global approach [^113DqpBs]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Sudden cardiac death is defined as a death occurring usually within an hour of onset of symptoms, arising from an underlying cardiac disease. Sudden cardiac death is a complication of a number of cardiovascular diseases and is often unexpected. In individuals aged < 35 years, unexplained sudden cardiac death is the most common presentation. A significant proportion of sudden cardiac death in the young (≤ 35 years) events may be precipitated by underlying inherited cardiac conditions, including both heritable cardiomyopathies and inherited arrhythmia syndromes (also known as cardiac channelopathies). Tragically, sudden death may be the first manifestation of the disease in a family and, therefore, clinical and genetic evaluation of surviving family members forms a key role in diagnosing the underlying inherited cardiac condition in the family. This is particularly relevant when considering that most inherited cardiac conditions are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner meaning that surviving family members have a 50% chance of inheriting the same disease substrate. This review will outline the underlying causes of sudden cardiac death in the young and outline our universal approach to familial evaluation following a young person's sudden death.

### Preliminary estimates of the prevalence of selected underlying health conditions among patients with coronavirus disease 2019-United States, February 12-March 28, 2020 [^115tf1fP]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic. As of March 28, 2020, a total of 571,678 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 26,494 deaths have been reported worldwide. Reports from China and Italy suggest that risk factors for severe disease include older age and the presence of at least one of several underlying health conditions. U.S. older adults, including those aged ≥ 65 years and particularly those aged ≥ 85 years, also appear to be at higher risk for severe COVID-19–associated outcomes; however, data describing underlying health conditions among U.S. COVID-19 patients have not yet been reported. As of March 28, 2020, U.S. states and territories have reported 122,653 U.S. COVID-19 cases to CDC, including 7,162 (5.8%) for whom data on underlying health conditions and other known risk factors for severe outcomes from respiratory infections were reported. Among these 7,162 cases, 2,692 (37.6%) patients had one or more underlying health condition or risk factor, and 4,470 (62.4%) had none of these conditions reported. The percentage of COVID-19 patients with at least one underlying health condition or risk factor was higher among those requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission (358 of 457, 78%) and those requiring hospitalization without ICU admission (732 of 1,037, 71%) than that among those who were not hospitalized (1,388 of 5,143, 27%). The most commonly reported conditions were diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, and cardiovascular disease. These preliminary findings suggest that in the United States, persons with underlying health conditions or other recognized risk factors for severe outcomes from respiratory infections appear to be at a higher risk for severe disease from COVID-19 than are persons without these conditions.

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic (1). As of March 28, 2020, a total of 571,678 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 26,494 deaths have been reported worldwide (2). Reports from China and Italy suggest that risk factors for severe disease include older age and the presence of at least one of several underlying health conditions (3,4). U.S. older adults, including those aged ≥ 65 years and particularly those aged ≥ 85 years, also appear to be at higher risk for severe COVID-19-associated outcomes; however, data describing underlying health conditions among U.S. COVID-19 patients have not yet been reported (5). As of March 28, 2020, U.S. states and territories have reported 122,653 U.S. COVID-19 cases to CDC, including 7,162 (5.8%) for whom data on underlying health conditions and other known risk factors for severe outcomes from respiratory infections were reported.

### Utility of genetic testing in athletes [^114xvzWE]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

When evaluating an athlete for potential underlying ICC, the genetic basis to these conditions must be carefully considered. 5, 6 Molecular studies over the last 30 years have been integral in identifying the particular genetic abnormalities that are the underlying cause of these conditions while rapid technological advances, particularly the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, have made genetic testing a readily available tool in the cardiogenetics clinic. Identification of the causative variant allows for predictive (cascade) testing in first‐degree family members due to the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern in most ICCs. Family members who are genotype‐positive require ongoing clinical surveillance and management, while those who are genotype‐negative can be reassured and released from further clinical surveillance. 7, 13

Identification of the causative variant provides benefit to both the athlete under assessment, as well as their family members. Genetic testing has potential utility to assist with diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutics for the athlete, depending on the particular disease in question (Table 1). For some conditions, such as Brugada syndrome, the utility is fairly limited due to the relatively low yield of approximately 20%, whereas in other conditions such as LQTS, the yield can be as high as 70%. In certain situations genetic testing can be used diagnostically to help differentiate between physiology and pathology such as in assessment of the athlete with a prolonged QT interval > 480 ms. 5, 14 In addition to defining the underlying disease, offering genetic testing to athletes (when appropriate) may help to inform potential management outcomes for the athlete including exercise recommendations and in guiding prognosis. 5, 15 For example in LQTS, different genetic subtypes are often offered differing management strategies, while the overall prognosis and risk of arrhythmic events is known to vary between different LQTS subtypes. 16

### Defining disease: determining practice [^111AynyQ]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2001). Low credibility.

Management of patients traditionally starts with establishing a diagnosis, a process that relies heavily on how diseases are defined. But definitions of disease vary with time and are influenced by, amongst other things, culture, politics, sociology and economics. The ninth annual Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin symposium, 'Defining disease: determining practice', explored the ways disease is defined and how this might affect practice. Here, we summarise the key points raised in the presentations and subsequent discussion.

### Pain as a disease: an overview [^111ZBKkM]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Today, it is recognized that persistent pain entails a pathologic reorganization of the neural system. This process can be due to several factors, such as a genetic predisposition,–central sensitization mechanisms, and many other factors, which are at the core of the study of the etiology of pathologic pain conditions. However, despite the progress in the understanding of the neuropathological changes associated with persistent pain, achieved especially thanks to the contribution of neuroimaging studies, two main questions remain open: 1) Do neuroimaging studies define chronic pain as a disease?–2) Is the definition of chronic pain as a brain disease useful, especially in the clinical practice?Cohen et al challenge the view of pain as a disease, by claiming that scientific findings showing pathologic changes associated with persistent pain are not sufficient to define pain as a disease. According to the authors, there are no "'characteristic' clinical features apart from the complaint of pain" which "constitute the 'disease' of pain" and the sole presence of pathologic symptoms is not enough to define pain as a disease which, on an explanatory ground, does not tell us a lot. However, beyond controversies on the definition of pain as a disease, we agree with the authors that the primary issue to be addressed in the debate is: how defining pain as a disease would improve our approach to this condition?

### Guidance for assessment of the inflammation etiologic criterion for the GLIM diagnosis of malnutrition: a modified Delphi approach [^112qcJ5U]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

GLIM practical guidance points for confirming inflammation in malnutrition diagnosis specify that the occurrence of acute or chronic disease, infection, or injury that is often/usually associated with inflammatory activity may fulfill the GLIM disease burden/inflammation criterion. When testing is available, CRP should be measured in uncertain cases to help confirm the inflammatory character of the underlying disease or condition, and confirmation of inflammation should be guided by clinical judgment based on underlying diagnosis or condition, clinical signs, or CRP; disease conditions that have no clear or perceptible inflammatory components will not fulfill the disease burden/ inflammation criterion unless confirmed by CRP. The resulting guidance statements secured strong overall support, with 99% of the responses by the Delphi participants being either "agree" or "strongly agree".

### Rare versus common diseases: a false dichotomy in precision medicine [^115DLEsY]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Some readers will have noticed a contradiction between two of our key points. If a common disease is a series of rare diseases, might that require a series of HKMD-inspired drugs? Much has been written about the genetic and environmental architecture of complex multifactorial diseases, and it is dangerous to generalize to all common diseases. However, to the extent that a disease has a common final pathway of phenotypic or clinical expression triggered by many different genetic and environmental factors, one HKMD-inspired drug may be effective for a large fraction of affected individuals. This certainly is the hope for PCSK9 inhibitors, although more years of data are required to see if they improve cardiovascular health under all genetic and environmental backgrounds. The bigger change that we wish to catalyze is the idea that sequencing people without the disease of interest may be a more efficient way to identify drug targets. Finding a LOF that causes a Mendelian disease does not immediately point us towards a drug target, but finding a LOF that confers a pharmaceutically desirable phenotype does. HKMDs need not be inherited. Some might be de novo mutations. Many are likely to be even rarer than the Mendelian disease alleles that have been the focus of so many fruitful studies. The challenge is to define traits worth emulating by drugs, and to phenotypically screen a very large population for people with these traits.

### Mapping multimorbidity progression among 190 diseases [^111A6ZvF]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Mechanisms underlying the development of multimorbidity are complex and multilevel, and genetic predispositions and mechanisms could also be at play. Previous studies have shown that multiple long term conditions that affected the same physiological system showed a greater propensity for sharing loci-level genetic components, whereas those affecting different systems had a greater probability of sharing network-level genetic components. Diseases in the same sex-specific constellations tend to share genes. Further studies demonstrate that the influence of genetics on the development of diseases may vary between males and females. By pinpointing distinct disease patterns in both sexes, we can delve into the shared biological origins of sex-specific constellations and genetic mechanisms in the development of multimorbidity.

The study is an observational study, which can be subject to potential confounding bias. Although we have taken measures to control for known confounders and have identified statistically significant effects between many pairs of diseases, there may still be alternative explanations. It is possible that there are unmeasured factors that could also be responsible for the observed causal links, and these have not been accounted for in our data. This includes diseases that occurred in early childhood, unmeasured environmental exposures, common genetically determined mechanisms, and current treatment practices. A data-rich and thoroughly phenotyped dataset with treatment details is required to conduct address these issues. Nevertheless, our findings generate hypotheses that may be tested in a smaller, well-characterized sample.

It's important to note that our dataset is limited to a single country, and as such, the findings may not be applicable to other countries that have substantial differences in unmeasured confounders compared to the United Kingdom. We also excluded rare diseases, which could limit our understanding of how these diseases may be connected with more common diseases. Additional research is required to determine the extent to which our findings can be generalized to other countries and the diseases that were excluded.

Also, it's possible that the study contains inaccuracies in measurements, such as certain conditions that are presently undetectable or undiagnosed in clinical settings, which could lead to biased estimates. To address this challenge, it's crucial to gather reliable data from population-based cohort studies that conduct comprehensive and regular assessments of individual disease status throughout the duration of the study.

### Identification of disease treatment mechanisms through the multiscale interactome [^111Fzs72]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Complex diseases, like cancer, disrupt dozens of proteins that interact in underlying biological networks –. Treating such diseases requires practical means to control the networks that underlie the disease –. By targeting even a single protein, a drug can affect hundreds of proteins in the underlying biological network. To achieve this effect, the drug relies on physical interactions between proteins. The drug binds a target protein, which physically interacts with dozens of other proteins, which in turn interact with dozens more, eventually reaching the proteins disrupted by the disease –. Networks capture such interactions and are a powerful paradigm to investigate the intricate effects of disease treatments and how these treatments translate into therapeutic benefits, revealing insights into drug efficacy –, side effects, and effective combinatorial therapies for treating the most dreadful diseases, including cancers and infectious diseases –.

However, existing systematic approaches assume that, for a drug to treat a disease, the proteins targeted by the drug need to be close to or even need to coincide with the disease-perturbed proteins – (Fig. 1). As such, current approaches fail to capture biological functions, through which target proteins can restore the functions of disease-perturbed proteins and thus treat a disease – (Supplementary Fig. 3). Moreover, current systematic approaches are black-boxes: they predict treatment relationships but provide little biological insight into how treatment occurs. This suggests an opportunity for a systematic, explanatory approach. Indeed for particular drugs and diseases, custom networks have demonstrated that incorporating specific biological functions can help explain treatment –.

### Lacking mechanistic disease definitions and corresponding association data hamper progress in network medicine and beyond [^113B6z8k]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

A long-term objective of network medicine is to replace our current, mainly phenotype-based disease definitions by subtypes of health conditions corresponding to distinct pathomechanisms. For this, molecular and health data are modeled as networks and are mined for pathomechanisms. However, many such studies rely on large-scale disease association data where diseases are annotated using the very phenotype-based disease definitions the network medicine field aims to overcome. This raises the question to which extent the biases mechanistically inadequate disease annotations introduce in disease association data distort the results of studies which use such data for pathomechanism mining. We address this question using global- and local-scale analyses of networks constructed from disease association data of various types. Our results indicate that large-scale disease association data should be used with care for pathomechanism mining and that analyses of such data should be accompanied by close-up analyses of molecular data for well-characterized patient cohorts.

### Which individuals are at increased risk of pneumococcal disease and why? Impact of COPD, asthma, smoking, diabetes, and / or chronic heart disease on community-acquired pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease [^115DmDAQ]. Thorax (2015). Low credibility.

Pneumococcal disease (including community-acquired pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease) poses a burden to the community all year round, especially in those with chronic underlying conditions. Individuals with COPD, asthma or who smoke, and those with chronic heart disease or diabetes mellitus have been shown to be at increased risk of pneumococcal disease compared with those without these risk factors. These conditions, and smoking, can also adversely affect patient outcomes, including short-term and long-term mortality rates, following pneumonia. Community-acquired pneumonia, and in particular pneumococcal pneumonia, is associated with a significant economic burden, especially in those who are hospitalised, and also has an impact on a patient's quality of life. Therefore, physicians should target individuals with COPD, asthma, heart disease or diabetes mellitus, and those who smoke, for pneumococcal vaccination at the earliest opportunity at any time of the year.

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: international expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^116TrxnK]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Managing patients with chronic diseases, particularly those with complex inflammatory disorders, can be challenging. In these patients, a considered multidisciplinary approach needs to be adopted to maintain quality of life (QoL) and improve outcomes. 2, 3 One condition that is frequently associated with chronic disease, but often overlooked, is iron deficiency. Iron deficiency is estimated to affect 37–61% of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), 24–85% of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 13–90% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 Iron is essential to every cell and, while its fundamental role in oxygen transport through erythropoiesis is well recognized, it is equally critical for energy production and efficient functioning of all of the body's organs. 10, 11 In patients with chronic inflammatory conditions, its impact can be particularly severe and may exacerbate the underlying disease state, leading to accelerated clinical deterioration. 5, 12

Anemia is the ultimate consequence of iron deficiency in many patients with chronic inflammatory conditions. 2, 3, 13, 14 However, the medical field should recognize iron deficiency as a clinical condition distinct from anemia. Recognition is improving owing to our better understanding of the pathophysiological role of iron deficiency (independent of chronic anemia) in symptomatology and clinical outcomes. 10, 15, 16 This is further supported by recent clinical observations of an association between the alleviation of morbidity or mortality and the treatment of iron deficiency, even outside the context of anemia. 6, 17, 18 However, there is uncertainty among physicians on how to diagnose iron deficiency in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions. This is partially because of symptom overlap with the underlying disease and unclear laboratory diagnostic thresholds. Several publications have also highlighted the problems of recognizing iron deficiency in the context of anemia of inflammation. 13, 19, 20, 21 This has led to under‐diagnosis of an easily treatable condition, leading to anemia, at which point physicians feel more confident about using iron therapy. 22

### Heart disease mortality in the United States, 1970 to 2022 [^115DrPwz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Our study has several limitations. The use of multiple iterations of the ICD coding system can allow for potential miscoding and presents challenges in maintaining consistency in comparisons across the years. Particularly prominent is the change from ICD‐8 to ICD‐9 in 1979, when the mortality of several conditions (valvular heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, pulmonary heart disease) dramatically increased. This is thought to be a result of regroupings ("other diseases of the endocardium" into "valvular heart disease", heart diseases with hypertension into "hypertensive heart disease", "diseases of pulmonary circulation" defined). Similarly, the decline in 1989, driven by an apparent decline in cardiac arrest, is hypothesized to be due to a major change in death certificates to encourage the inclusion of chronic conditions as the underlying cause of death and requiring the attending physician of record, who had more knowledge of the patient's chronic conditions, to certify the death certificate. However, there is also potential for misclassification, as it has been shown that nonheart disease diagnoses are often assigned coronary heart disease on death certificates in cases with unknown cause. A second limitation of our study is that certain conditions including heart failure, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, and in particular ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac arrest, may be overly simplistic, as many of these cases likely have underlying ischemic causes that cannot be precisely differentiated using current or past ICD codes. This limitation suggests that the true burden of ischemic heart disease may be underestimated in our findings. We also used "underlying cause of death" from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide‐Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research rather than "multiple cause of death", perhaps underestimating contributions to aggregate mortality from each heart disease subtype.

We recognize that we did not perform a causal analysis, and the observed mortality shifts are not solely or directly linked to the interventions described herein. Instead, this narrative summarizes medical advances and public health progress that have been previously associated with improved cardiovascular mortality in the literature. We also acknowledge there is likely substantial heterogeneity in these reductions in heart disease mortality by age, sex, race, ethnicity, region, and urbanization, which we did not analyze in the present article and should be prioritized in future studies to confirm these overall trends in subpopulations. Finally, given data availability only until 2022, we were unable to assess the full impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on heart disease mortality trends.

### The illness-disease dichotomy and the biological-clinical splitting of medicine [^117FZv8M]. Medical Humanities (2021). Medium credibility.

However, while we accept that both the experience of illness and what is usually called disease are 'abstractions', this is not enough. It is still necessary to raise the question of the relationship both between such abstractions and between them and the rest of reality, clarifying how abstractions thus conceived are connected, at least in principle, in an intersubjectively reproducible and testable way. In other words, it seems to us that in Sharpe and Greco's argument there is a serious gap, and in order to fill it they ought to provide a clear view about the causal relationship that exists between the different results of our abstractions, and especially between, on the one hand, the experience of illness, and on the other, that aspect of reality which is usually referred to as 'disease', which always includes in some sense an organic correlate (and it goes without saying that if we do not wish to forsake science for magic and fiction, then this causal relationship should be such that, at least in principle, it can be made the object of an intersubjectively testable investigation).

That said, however, we must add that Wilshire and Ward cannot accommodate one of the most important claims made by Sharpe and Greco, namely, that what is usually designated as the subjective, or better hermeneutic-normative, dimension of health is relatively autonomous. 9 Experiences of illness are real as long as they are 'lived through'. In this sense, illness cannot be understood adequately only in terms, for example, of biological mechanisms. In fact, as we shall now briefly indicate, the general model defended by Wilshire and Ward seems to implicitly assume a one-sided conception of causality, 10 that is, a unique direction of the causal vector, from organic reality to subjective lived experiences, excluding the possibility of the opposite flow. This in turn makes it difficult to understand the relationship between, for example, the doctor's necessarily typified and normalised concept of a disease and, on the other hand, the patient's unique personal experience of it.

### Predicting disease using genomics [^116QPsvg]. Nature (2004). Excellent credibility.

Information from the human genome sequence will eventually alter many aspects of clinical practice. It will increase through our understanding of disease mechanisms, and guide the development of new drugs and therapeutic procedures. In the short term, however, knowledge of the genome will have a profound clinical impact on the diagnostic capability of clinical genetics laboratories. Molecular phenotyping using genetic and genomic information will allow early and more accurate prediction and diagnosis of disease and of disease progression. Medicine will become oriented towards disease prevention rather than efforts to cure people at late stages of illness.

COPD as part of multi-morbidity should be recognized since an increasing number of people in any aging population will suffer from multi-morbidity, defined as the presence of two or more chronic conditions, and COPD is present in most multi-morbid patients; multi-morbid patients have symptoms from multiple diseases and thus symptoms and signs are complex and most often attributable to several causes in the chronic state as well as during acute events; there is no evidence that COPD should be treated differently when part of multi-morbidity, but it should be kept in mind that most evidence comes from trials in people with COPD as the only significant disease; treatments should be kept simple in the light of the unbearable polypharmacy that these patients are often exposed to.

FIGURE 2
Disease co‐occurrence networks. Disease networks depict and combine pairwise relationships between diseases and allow visualization and analysis of more complex interrelationships between multiple diseases. While each node represents a disease or disease phenotype, an edge between two diseases can represent different types of relationships in different types of disease networks; depicted relationships can range from mere comorbidity (co‐occurrence) of the two diseases as observed in the population (comorbidity network) to molecular links (e.g. genetic, metabolic) between the diseases, derived from omics studies (genetic disease network; metabolic disease network). For example, the APOE‐ε4 genotype, a genetic risk factor for both Alzheimer's diseases and for atherosclerosis, suggests shared aspects in pathomechanisms.

Big omics data sets also facilitate creation of disease maps based on shared genetic associations or shared metabolic processes, to show why some diseases co‐occur. For example, a network of Mendelian gene‐disease associations was created by connecting diseases that have been associated with the same genes.(See Figure 2) Another network was created in which two diseases were linked if their associated genes encode enzymes that catalyze adjacent metabolic reactions. In addition to gene‐ and metabolism‐based links, diseases can be related via shared protein signals because disease‐associated proteins act on the same pathwaysor are strongly correlated in proteomic analyses. As these gene‐, metabolism‐, and protein‐based disease networks typically resemble the structure of disease co‐occurrence networks, the revealed molecular connections can help elucidate the interrelated origins of many diseases.

Conceptually, network medicine/systems biology treats disease phenotypes as the result of various pathobiological processes represented in a complex layered network of the organism's "omics". Disturbances in these complex interactions within‐ and between layers of disease‐associated genes, proteins, and metabolites can result in physiological failures that eventually lead to functional, molecular and causal relationships among apparently distinct (disease) phenotypes. Until recently, disease networks built on these types of associations could not differentiate among direct, potentially causal, and indirect, probably mediated, links between molecular entities and diseases.

Advanced computational modeling, however, allows integration into network models of different kinds of data, such as metabolites, gene transcripts, and clinical parameters (e.g. diagnostics, questionnaires) available for the same individuals. By focusing on direct relationships, network models can help to elucidate why certain health conditions confer risk for others.

### Heart disease mortality in the United States, 1970 to 2022 [^117Q9sMR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Demographic shifts in the United States have additionally contributed significant changes to the landscape of heart disease mortality. Over the decades spanning from 1970 to 2022, there has been a notable increase in life expectancy, from 70.9 years to 77.5 years in the United States. This demographic change, and the successful management of AMI, have led to an increased survivorship burdened with chronic ischemic heart conditions. Consequently, the aging demographic contributes to the rising proportion of chronic ischemic heart disease prevalence and subsequent mortality, even amid the backdrop of overall declining heart disease mortality. Similarly, the demographic shift toward an aging population allows for longer accumulation and thus mortality from other heart disease conditions such as heart failure, hypertensive heart disease, and arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation. Notably, although studies cite an increase in heart disease mortality, particularly AMI in the setting of the COVID‐19 pandemic, our study found no reversal of long‐term mortality trends, rather an acute increase in 2020 followed by decline.

Finally, improvements in diagnostic capabilities and refinement of definitions over the years have led to improved identification of heart conditions such as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and pulmonary hypertension, potentially allowing these conditions to more frequently be defined as ultimate underlying causes of mortality. Regardless of identification, several studies show independent increases in mortality from these conditions in the 21st century, with significant increases in mortality due to heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and arrhythmia, particularly atrial fibrillation.

### Joint disease-specificity at the regulatory base-pair level [^111PBBfc]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The extent to which coding versus non-coding sequence variants underlie complex disease specificity and pathophysiology has been subject to much investigation. Historically, because of their visibility, predicted effect, and relative ease in functional validationthe search for causal coding mutations has taken precedence over non-coding variants. However, non-coding variants are thought to have more regulatory specificity and therefore likely more modularized phenotypic impactsmaking them in theory better candidates for mediating disease-specificity. In support of this concept, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have consistently revealed that most common disease association signals are enriched in functional non-coding sequences –, making the disease-causing variants more likely regulatory in nature.

Recently, with the development of phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), which study the associations between genetic variants and many phenotypes, it has become apparent that many GWAS loci now reproducibly associate with multiple distinct diseases, causing these loci to have broader impacts on human health and disease. As these multiple disease-associated GWAS loci can contain many types of variants, disease-specificity at each locus may result from the actions of independent, but linked, causal coding mutations or regulatory variants. On the other hand, disease risk could also reflect the effects of a single pleiotropic variant that resides in coding or non-coding sequences. Addressing this issue using existing data on true allelic causality is not possible because compared to the number of known causal coding mutations, the number of bonafide causal non-coding variants (at hundreds of thousands of GWAS loci) is likely < 20, despite advances in non-coding variant discoveryand modeling. While we expect a portion of disease-specificity at multiple disease-associated GWAS loci to be under the effects of spatiotemporally specific non-coding regulatory variants, clearly illustrated examples of such are lacking.

### Consideration of disease penetrance in the selection of secondary findings gene-disease pairs: a policy statement of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^113UboNZ]. Genetics in Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Secondary findings (SF) penetrance — Population-derived penetrance data are described as "the most directly applicable to SF list consideration, although not a strict requirement for inclusion", because the most relevant scenario is an individual with a "pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant" without "previously recognized personal or family history", and population-based penetrance is "especially relevant"; ideally, estimates come from population-scale cohorts with recruitment bias acknowledged, genomic ascertainment with documented variant classification, are stratified by sex and age, are "presented with 95% confidence intervals" and clear methodology, and are linked to a specific phenotype, derived from diverse cohorts and multiple sources, including cohorts with comprehensive clinical data/testing for the gene–phenotype of interest.

### Opportunities and challenges associated with clinical diagnostic genome sequencing: a report of the Association for Molecular Pathology [^115Y5p3W]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2012). Medium credibility.

Common complex diseases — genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) catalogs highlight scale and limits: 11 million SNPs and three million indels have been characterized, dense SNP chips have facilitated GWAS with many cases and controls (> 1000 per group), and genome.gov catalogues > 1200 polymorphisms that confer disease risk in > 165 common human diseases and traits, yet multiple risk alleles only explain approximately 5% of the variance in the population. At the individual level, the uncovering of three million SNPs within a genome requires interpretive knowledge, and the full potential can only be realized when the genome sequences of thousands of individuals are available and linked to corresponding phenotypes; data mining initiatives such as the U.K. 10,000 Genomes Project may refine disease pathways and clarify how specific alleles present as protective or deleterious.

### Early-onset epileptic encephalopathies: ohtahara syndrome and early myoclonic encephalopathy [^112MQBDT]. Pediatric Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Ohtahara syndrome and early myoclonic encephalopathy are the earliest presenting of the epileptic encephalopathies. They are typically distinguished from each other according to specific clinical and etiologic criteria. Nonetheless, considerable overlap exists between the two syndromes in terms of clinical presentation, prognosis, and electroencephalographic signature. Newer understandings of underlying etiologies of these conditions may support the previously suggested concept that they represent a single spectrum of disease rather than two distinct disorders. We review both syndromes, with particular focus on the underlying genetics and pathophysiology and implications regarding the classification of these conditions.

### Heart disease mortality in the United States, 1970 to 2022 [^113niynb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In summary, the past half‐century has witnessed a dramatic decrease in ischemic heart disease mortality, likely reflecting advancements in prevention and treatment strategies, particularly surrounding AMI. However, although the decline in ischemic heart disease mortality represents a pivotal achievement, the concomitant rise in heart disease mortality from conditions such as heart failure, hypertensive heart disease, and arrhythmias must be addressed. An aging population, improved diagnostic capabilities, and increased ischemic survivorship now burdened with chronic heart conditions may contribute to this rise in mortality, however, further research is needed to elucidate the specific underlying factors. In the future, research and patient care should focus on addressing the growing challenge of these heart conditions, while continuing to maintain and expand our progress in ischemic heart disease.

### LanDis: the disease landscape explorer [^114PzKAo]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

In recent decades, our understanding of diseases and their causes has shifted from simple relationships between genes and diseases to more comprehensive models, which take into account the interplay of gene products through their multiple molecular interactions. The set of interactions between proteins can be summarised in a network, often referred to as interactome, where nodes represent proteins and links represent interactions between them. Studying diseases in the context of the human interactome has revealed that a disease's causal genes tend to cluster in close-by regions — the disease module — and that diseases that share causal genes tend to exhibit phenotypical similarity. The idea that closeness on the interactome relates to phenotypical similarity has applications in disease gene prediction and differential diagnosis. For instance, recent methods have successfully exploited these concepts to prioritise candidate disease genes according to their level of connectivity to known disease genes. Moreover, the comprehensive study of the phenotypical similarities of diseases can help in understanding their aetiology and reveal commonalities in their pathophysiology.

A few measures have been developed to systematically quantify the similarity between pairs of diseases (see Supplementary Note 1). LanDis relies on the Caniza measure, which summarises the information about diseases that is scattered across the biomedical literature. The method is based on the idea that a disease can be described accurately by the set of MeSH terms used to annotate the publications relevant for that disease. Pairwise similarities between diseases are then calculated by exploiting the structure of the MeSH ontology. A comparison of the different similarity measures using sets of diseases with known disease genes, showed that the Caniza similarity outperforms all other measures in terms of accuracy at predicting closeness of disease modules on the interactome. This is probably due to the large volume of information, i.e. the thousands of disease-related publications, which contribute to the measure. Also notice that the Caniza similarity is related to the human disease network that contains a link representing a similarity between each pair of diseases that share disease genes (the relationship between the Caniza similarity and the human disease network is discussed in Caniza et al. see Supplementary Note 3).

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (an update) and progressive pulmonary fibrosis in adults: an official ATS / ERS / JRS / ALAT clinical practice guideline [^111U2VWe]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Part II — definition of progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF) in fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD) other than IPF states that in a patient with ILD of known or unknown etiology other than IPF who has radiological evidence of pulmonary fibrosis, PPF is defined as at least two of the following three criteria occurring within the past year with no alternative explanation: 1) worsening respiratory symptoms; 2) physiological evidence of disease progression; and 3) radiological evidence of disease progression. The guideline stresses that it is critical to exclude alternative explanations for worsening, particularly when symptoms worsen and/or Dlco declines given lower specificity compared with FVC and chest CT. The committee further emphasized that PPF is defined separately from IPF, that PPF is not a diagnosis and is agnostic to underlying condition, and that the criteria reflect multiple clinical trials because no single trial should guide antifibrotic therapy.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for treatment of heart Failure with reduced ejection Fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^112Ud1Ri]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

ACC Expert Consensus — management of comorbidities in heart failure (HF) notes that patients with HF, particularly older patients, frequently have other cardiovascular (CV) and non-CV comorbidities that affect their prognosis, including hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, anemia/iron deficiency, sleep disorders, and chronic lung disease. The presence of multiple chronic conditions is associated with increased symptom burden, may contribute to progression of underlying disease, and often plays a role in a large proportion of hospitalizations in patients with HF. Given the complex relationships between HF and many conditions, it is challenging to outline specific recommendations, additional evidence and large-scale trial data are needed, and appropriate referral to clinicians with experience treating various comorbidities is a particularly important aspect of management. Specific management recommendations can be made in some situations; Table 15 classifies comorbidities between CV and non-CV processes and provides guidance, and 3 conditions that deserve particular mention are diabetes, viral respiratory infections, and anemia/iron deficiency. For diabetes, it is common and strongly associated with both incident HF and adverse clinical outcomes and is closely linked to hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease; treatment of patients with T2D with SGLT inhibitors improves glycemic control and also significantly reduces HF events in patients with established CV disease or CV risk factors.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^117AZnVZ]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis classification and targeted types — conjunctivitis can be classified as noninfectious or infectious and as acute, chronic, or recurrent. Noninfectious types of conjunctivitis include allergic, mechanical/irritative/toxic, immune-mediated, and neoplastic, and these types may overlap, while the causes of infectious conjunctivitis include viruses and bacteria. It is important to differentiate between primary conjunctival disease and conditions in which conjunctival inflammation is secondary to systemic or ocular diseases; for example, dry eye and blepharitis are the most frequent causes of conjunctival inflammation and the treatment for each of these entities should be directed at correcting the underlying problems. Systemic conditions such as atopy or acute infections such as gonorrhea may also cause conjunctival inflammation, and treatment of conjunctivitis must include addressing the underlying systemic disease. This preferred practice pattern addresses types that are either most common or are particularly important to detect and treat, including allergic types — seasonal/perennial allergic conjunctivitis, vernal conjunctivitis, and atopic conjunctivitis — and mechanical/irritative/toxic types — superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis (SLK), blepharoconjunctivitis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye), rosacea conjunctivitis, contact lens–related keratoconjunctivitis, giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC), floppy eyelid syndrome, giant fornix syndrome, and medication-induced/preservative-induced keratoconjunctivitis.

### Phenotypic plasticity and the epigenetics of human disease [^112sGapj]. Nature (2007). Excellent credibility.

It is becoming clear that epigenetic changes are involved in human disease as well as during normal development. A unifying theme of disease epigenetics is defects in phenotypic plasticity — cells' ability to change their behaviour in response to internal or external environmental cues. This model proposes that hereditary disorders of the epigenetic apparatus lead to developmental defects, that cancer epigenetics involves disruption of the stem-cell programme, and that common diseases with late-onset phenotypes involve interactions between the epigenome, the genome and the environment. Increased understanding of epigenetic-disease mechanisms could lead to disease-risk stratification for targeted intervention and to targeted therapies.

Ventricular arrhythmia epidemiology — general concepts: Ventricular arrhythmias include a spectrum that ranges from premature ventricular complex to ventricular fibrillation, with a clinical presentation that ranges from a total lack of symptoms to cardiac arrest. Most life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias are associated with ischemic heart disease, particularly in older patients. The risks of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death vary in specific populations with different underlying cardiac conditions, and with specific family history and genetic variants, with implications for studying and applying therapies.

### Mapping multimorbidity progression among 190 diseases [^115YYnqd]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussions

In this study, we examine how multimorbidity progresses among 190 diseases by examining the comprehensive causal links among them and analyzing their coalescing patterns. Whereas previous studies that investigated multimorbidity trajectory and clusters focused on disease associations, we clustered relying on the causal relationships among them, which, to our knowledge, is the first in-depth description of the causal progression of multimorbidity for hundreds of diseases. We also compared the progression in males and females and found important differences. Importantly, our approach is capable of accounting for bi-directional causal relationships among diseases, which could enable the discovery of complex trajectory networks among diseases and identify common, mechanistically related, and prognostically relevant clusters. Our developed framework and tools are an important step towards meeting the challenge of mapping the progression of multimorbidity.

We provide a clinically driven comprehensive list of key diseases to be included when addressing multimorbidity and show that lists between females and males largely overlap. The profiles help healthcare providers in recognizing the risk of subsequent diseases while assessing patients without multimorbidity and in determining intervention and prevention strategies to prevent multiple long term conditions. We emphasized this profile should be cautiously interpreted with data limitations we shall discuss later. Whether the identified causal relationships between two diseases are a result of the natural development mechanism of multimorbidity, clinical treatment practice for the initial diagnosis, patients' adapting to healthier lifestyles after the initial diagnosis, or if screening strategies require further investigation. The top influential and influenced disease lists included acute diseases, emphasizing their significance in preventing and managing chronic multimorbidity. Many top influential diseases showed a quick effect. A secondary analysis revealed that a majority of the diseases (86.9% for females and 89.1% for males) displayed a heightened causal effect within the first year of follow-up (Supplementary Fig. 8). This could be attributed to the fact that illnesses that develop after the initial diagnosis are more prone to be detected and diagnosed within a shorter timeframe, rather than over a more prolonged period (Supplementary Data 4 and 5). It remains unclear whether this reflects the natural development mechanism of multimorbidity or if screening strategies warrant further investigation.

### How I manage autoimmune cytopenias in patients with lymphoid cancer [^1178uB5H]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune conditions can occur in a temporary relationship with any malignant lymphoma. In many instances, treatment at diagnosis is not required, but symptomatic autoimmune conditions represent an indication for treatment, particularly in chronic lymphoproliferative diseases. Treatment is selected depending on the predominant condition: autoimmune disease (immunosuppression) or lymphoma (antilymphoma therapy). Steroids and anti-CD20 antibodies are effective against both conditions and may suppress the autoimmune complication for a prolonged period. The efficacy of B-cell receptor inhibitors has provided us with novel insights into the pathophysiology of antibody-producing B cells. Screening for underlying autoimmune conditions is part of the lymphoma workup, because other drugs, such as immunomodulators and checkpoint inhibitors, should be avoided or used with caution. In this article, we discuss diagnostic challenges and treatment approaches for different situations involving lymphomas and autoimmune cytopenias.

### Lacking mechanistic disease definitions and corresponding association data hamper progress in network medicine and beyond [^114gQZZD]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

While the aforementioned studies have analyzed the impact of various types of data biases related to genes and proteins (and, to a lesser extent, also variants), the disease part of disease-gene and other disease association data introduces another, so far unstudied type of data bias: In currently available large-scale disease association data, diseases are annotated with the very phenotype-based disease definitions the network medicine field aims to overcome. BEV approaches hence risk to systematically reproduce the biases introduced by these disease definitions. Consequently, BEV approaches make the implicit assumption that the biases introduced by phenotype-based disease definitions even out and that, despite those biases, disease association data using these definitions still contain useful information about the pathomechanism that are to be uncovered.

In this work, we quantify to which extent this implicit assumption is indeed backed by data. Towards this end, we construct disease-disease networks (called "diseasomes" in the remainder of this article) based on (1) disease-gene associations, (2) disease-variant associations, (3) comorbidity data, (4) symptom data, and (5) drug-indication data, as well as drug-disease and drug-drug networks (called "drugomes") based on drug-indication and drug-target data. We then formulate two testable hypotheses that follow from the implicit assumption of BEV network medicine: The global-scale hypothesis states that, globally, networks constructed from two different types of association data that both contain useful information about endotypes should be pairwise more similar than expected by chance. The local-scale hypothesis states that this should hold not only globally but also for the neighborhoods of the individual diseases and drugs represented by nodes in the constructed networks.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^111gAjh5]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Multimorbidity — People with COPD often have concomitant chronic diseases across mild, moderate or severe airflow obstruction; multimorbidity influences mortality and hospitalizations independently of the severity of airflow obstruction and deserves specific treatment. Therefore, comorbid conditions should be looked for routinely, and treated appropriately if present, in any patient with COPD, and recommendations for diagnosis, assessment of severity, and management of individual comorbid diseases are the same as for patients without COPD. Frequent multimorbid diseases in COPD include cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, depression and anxiety, and whether the association between COPD and lung cancer is due to common risk factors, shared susceptibility genes and/or impaired clearance of carcinogens is unclear. COPD can also have significant extrapulmonary effects including weight loss, nutritional abnormalities, and skeletal muscle dysfunction characterized by sarcopenia and abnormal function of the remaining cells; causes are likely multifactorial and can contribute to exercise intolerance and poor health status.

Complex trait risk alleles — reporting guidance and scope: In common diseases, risk alleles can explain only up to 10% of population variance, and this recommendation does not address the interpretation and reporting of complex trait alleles; when such alleles are encountered during sequencing of Mendelian genes, the terms "pathogenic" and "likely pathogenic" are not appropriate, and an interim solution is to report these variants as "risk alleles" or in an "other reportable" category, with evidence descriptors such as "established risk allele", "likely risk allele", or "uncertain risk allele".

### IGF-1 and risk of morbidity and mortality from cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and all causes in EPIC-heidelberg [^1143HbAU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Another potential explanation, particularly regarding low levels IGF-1 and increased risk of mortality was that of reverse causation. It is probable that individuals with underlying preclinical conditions, particularly those affecting the liver, have low circulating levels of IGF-1 and that their underlying diseases were responsible for the observed increased risk of mortality. We explored this question by using liver enzymes and other liver-related conditions, such as hepatitis, liver cancer, and liver cirrhosis as markers of liver function and health status. We found that, among participants with low IGF-1, the risks of cancer and all-cause mortality were substantially attenuated in analyses that included participants without indications of liver diseases but were elevated in analyses restricted to participants with liver conditions. Our findings suggest that the health and functional status of the liver may explain some but not all of the mortality risk associated with low levels of IGF-1.

Another important factor in understanding the relationship between IGF-1 and mortality is nutritional status, in particular, protein intake. Earlier studies among EPIC participants reported associations between IGF-1 levels and intake of vitamins B6 and B2, proteins, milk, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorous. In our recent analyses, we found that animal intake was associated with increased risk of mortality, largely driven by increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. Others analyzed the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and reported that protein intake is associated with increased risk of total mortality and that IGF-1 moderates this association. In particular, intake of carbohydrates, dairy products, and B vitamins have been implicated to be associated with IGF-1 levels. Whether IGF-1 moderates the relationship between protein intake/overall nutritional status and cancer, cardiovascular, and total mortality endpoints in the context of the EPIC-Heidelberg cohort is a subject of ongoing research.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 case surveillance-United States, January 22-may 30, 2020 [^1175guXX]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in 5,817,385 reported cases and 362,705 deaths worldwide through May, 30, 2020, † including 1,761,503 aggregated reported cases and 103,700 deaths in the United States. § Previous analyses during February-early April 2020 indicated that age ≥ 65 years and underlying health conditions were associated with a higher risk for severe outcomes, which were less common among children aged < 18 years (1–3). This report describes demographic characteristics, underlying health conditions, symptoms, and outcomes among 1,320,488 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases individually reported to CDC during January 22-May 30, 2020. Cumulative incidence, 403.6 cases per 100,000 persons, was similar among males (401.1) and females (406.0) and highest among persons aged ≥ 80 years (902.0). Among 599,636 (45%) cases with known information, 33% of persons were Hispanic or Latino of any race (Hispanic), 22% were non-Hispanic black (black), and 1.3% were non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN). Among 287,320 (22%) cases with sufficient data on underlying health conditions, the most common were cardiovascular disease (32%), diabetes (30%), and chronic lung disease (18%). Overall, 184,673 (14%) patients were hospitalized, 29,837 (2%) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and 71,116 (5%) died. Hospitalizations were six times higher among patients with a reported underlying condition (45.4%) than those without reported underlying conditions (7.6%). Deaths were 12 times higher among patients with reported underlying conditions (19.5%) compared with those without reported underlying conditions (1.6%). The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be severe, particularly in certain population groups. These preliminary findings underscore the need to build on current efforts to collect and analyze case data, especially among those with underlying health conditions. These data are used to monitor trends in COVID-19 illness, identify and respond to localized incidence increase, and inform policies and practices designed to reduce transmission in the United States.

Secondary hypogammaglobulinemia — common etiologies and settings: A large proportion of SHG is due to the increasing use of immunosuppressive treatments, most notably B-cell–targeted therapy (BCTT), in autoimmune hematologic and neurologic conditions as well as hematologic/oncologic conditions, and corticosteroids are another common cause of iatrogenic SHG, although it does not appear to be associated with significant increases in frequency or severity of infections. Studies have shown that antibody defects are also observed in autoimmune and hematologic/oncologic conditions before initiation of immunosuppressive treatment, and there is an increasingly recognized category of IEI/PI called primary immune regulatory disorders that presents primarily with autoimmunity and lymphoproliferation rather than the classic PI presentation of severe, recurrent, and/or unusual infections. SHG observed in pulmonary conditions appears largely driven by immunosuppression rather than immune aberrations due to the underlying disease, and SHG observed after solid organ transplant for lung, heart, and kidney transplant also appears largely iatrogenic in nature due to immunosuppression with additional contribution of protein losses particularly for kidney transplant patients with nephrotic syndrome. Protein loss syndromes that can cause SHG, including nephrotic syndrome, are covered in the Protein-Losing Conditions section; primary causes including monogenic causes of very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) such as FOXP3, IL10RA, and XIAP, and loss-of-function mutations in CD55 and DGAT1 also exist.

### Crohn's disease: a clinical update [^1176Z35e]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Crohn's disease:

- **Definition**: CD is a chronic relapsing IBD characterized by a transmural granulomatous inflammation most commonly affecting the ileum, colon, or both.
- **Pathophysiology**: The exact cause of CD is unknown; however, a complex interplay of genetic factors, environmental factors, immune dysregulation to intestinal microbiota have been implicated.
- **Disease course**: The complex interplay of genetic, environmental factors and immune dysregulation to intestinal microbiota result in CD, which causes clinical manifestations of chronic diarrhea, fatigue, abdominal pain, weight loss, bloody stools, mucinous stools, peripheral arthritis, aphthous stomatitis, uveitis, erythema nodosum, ankylosing spondylitis, pyoderma, gangrenosum, psoriasis, PSC. Disease progression may lead to fistulae and decreased QoL.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The annual mortality rate in CD is 1.6%.

### Neutrophilic urticarial dermatosis: a window into systemic inflammation and autoimmune disorders [^117M2FFc]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Neutrophilic urticarial dermatosis (NUD) is a distinctive dermatological manifestation that is commonly associated with systemic autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases. This review comprehensively explores NUD in the context of five major conditions: Schnitzler syndrome, Still's disease, cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and VEXAS syndrome. For each condition, a detailed discussion of the underlying mechanisms, clinical presentations, diagnostic criteria, and treatment strategies is provided. In addition, cases exhibiting features similar to NUD are emphasized, with a comprehensive examination of the pathological characteristics, particularly focusing on neutrophilic epitheliotropism. This review underscores the significance of identifying NUD as a potential indicator of systemic autoimmune disorders and discusses the role of skin biopsy and laboratory tests in diagnosing the underlying etiology. Finally, a diagnostic framework for NUD is proposed, highlighting the importance of a multidisciplinary assessment to ascertain the underlying systemic condition responsible for the dermatological manifestations. The objective of this review is to enhance the comprehension of NUD, thereby facilitating early diagnosis and the implementation of targeted strategies for affected patients.

### Estimated county-level prevalence of selected underlying medical conditions associated with increased risk for severe COVID-19 illness-United States, 2018 [^115GsM2N]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Counties with the highest prevalences of any condition were concentrated in Southeastern states, particularly in Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and West Virginia, as well as some counties in Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and northern Michigan, among others (Figure) (Supplementary Table). The estimated number of adults with any condition generally followed the population distribution, with higher estimated numbers of persons with any underlying medical conditions in more highly populated areas.

### The complexity of epigenetic diseases [^11664Sx1]. The Journal of Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract

Over the past 30 years, a plethora of pathogenic mutations affecting enhancer regions and epigenetic regulators have been identified. Coupled with more recent genome‐wide association studies and epigenome‐wide association studies implicating major roles for regulatory mutations in disease, it is clear that epigenetic mechanisms represent important biomarkers for disease development and perhaps even therapeutic targets. Here, we discuss the diversity of disease‐causing mutations in enhancers and epigenetic regulators, with a particular focus on cancer. © 2015 The Authors.

### Six underlying health conditions strongly influence mortality based on pneumonia severity in an ageing population of Japan: a prospective cohort study [^115y9r9r]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

There was a marginally significant difference in the AUROC curve between the predictive index using six underlying health conditions and PSI. PSI was a better predictor of mortality than CURB65. This is probably because PSI contains not only disease parameters but also some underlying health conditions, such as nursing home residency and comorbid illnesses (neoplastic disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal disease, and liver disease). In addition, the PSI age variable is linearly scored and weighted according to the gender (10 points is subtracted from the age score of females). The inclusion of underlying health conditions might make PSI more suitable for morality prediction among pneumonia patients with increased age and multiple underlying health conditions.

Our study has some limitations. First, we did not perform the external validation using different cohort of pneumonia patients. This can cause the bias of a better performance of the derived model compared to the externally derived CURB and PSI scores. The validation study using a different cohort is necessary to generalise our conclusion. Second, although we showed an identical result from the sensitivity analysis, we did not validate our model internally using bootstrapped samples because we used a simple scoring method, 1 or 0 score in each variable, to develop the model. Therefore, overestimation of ORs and AUROC curves could not be assessed. However, our initial concept was the model development in which primary care physicians can calculate it easily in a busy situation who are more likely to manage elderly patients with multiple underlying conditions. We kept our clinical concept for practical use of the model.

Third, we did not obtain detailed information about each underlying condition. In particular, neoplastic diseases should have been categorised according to their stages. Fourth, the mortality prediction model based on underlying health conditions was not validated on a different cohort of patients. Further studies using different cohorts of patients are necessary to validate our results. Last, we did not actively collect information about DNR orders in this study. However, we found a similar significance of the mortality risk ratio, even after excluding non-survivors without ventilator or vasopressor use, which we evaluated as a proxy for a DNR order. Long-term outcomes are also important to assess in patients with pneumonia in society with an ageing population.

### Standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants: a joint consensus recommendation of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology [^114hwdo3]. Genetics in Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Sequence variant interpretation — population, disease-specific, and sequence databases should be applied with defined cautions in variant assessment. Population databases are described as "useful in obtaining the frequencies of variants in large populations", yet "cannot be assumed to include only healthy individuals and are known to contain pathogenic variants" and "do not contain extensive information regarding the functional effect of these variants or any possible associated phenotypes". When using population databases, users "must determine whether healthy or disease cohorts were used and, if possible, whether more than one individual in a family was included, as well as the age range of the subjects". Disease databases "primarily contain variants found in patients with disease and assessment of the variants' pathogenicity", but "often contain variants that are incorrectly classified". Overall, "Databases can be useful for gathering information but should be used with caution".

### Enhancing image analytic tools by fusing quantitative physiological values with image features [^112EF24s]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Computer-aided diagnosis systems (CADs) can quantify the severity of diseases by analyzing a set of images and employing prior statistical models. In general, CADs have proven to be effective at providing quantitative measurements of the extent of a particular disease, thus helping physicians to better monitor the progression of cancer, infectious diseases, and other health conditions. Electronic Health Records frequently include a large amount of clinical data and medical history that can provide critical information about the underlying condition of a patient. We hypothesize that the fusion of image and clinical-physiological features can be used to enhance the accuracy of automatic image classification models. In particular, this paper shows how image analytic tools can move beyond classical image interpretation models to broader systems where image and physiological measurements are fused and used to create more generic detection models. To test our hypothesis, a CAD system capable of quantifying the severity of patients with pulmonary fibrosis has been developed. Results show that CAD systems augmented with multimodal physiological values are more robust and accurate at determining the severity of the disease.

### Consideration of disease penetrance in the selection of secondary findings gene-disease pairs: a policy statement of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^111wmZLV]. Genetics in Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Secondary findings penetrance versus intervention risk — "Generally, a higher penetrance threshold would be required" to add a gene-disease pair when identifying an SF is likely to lead to a "highly burdensome or risky intervention in asymptomatic individuals"; the goal of SF is "to intervene early to mitigate adverse health effects", sometimes via "noninvasive diagnostics" or other "low-risk activities", but in other cases prevention "can only be achieved through surgery or another high-risk intervention", where acting on low-penetrance findings may be "unlikely to generate significant medical harm" yet could create "a net harm" in individuals who would not have developed symptoms.

### Livedo racemosa: clinical, laboratory, and histopathological findings in 33 patients [^114QQnkL]. The International Journal of Lower Extremity Wounds (2021). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on livedo racemosa:

- **Definition**: Livedo racemosa is a persistent, mottled, erythematous or violaceous vascular pattern that forms irregular, broken, or branching rings on the skin, typically reflecting an underlying pathology rather than a benign physiological variant. It is distinct from standard livedo reticularis by its more pronounced, netlike, and overlapping lesions.
- **Pathophysiology**: Livedo racemosa commonly arises from impaired blood flow in the cutaneous microvasculature, often due to conditions such as vasculitis or thrombotic processes. It may be associated with genetic and hereditiary conditions affecting the CNS (such as Sneddon's syndrome, Divry van Bogaert syndrome, Moyamoya disease, ADA2 deficiency, Alagille syndrome, Susac syndrome, type I interferonopathies, microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II, homocystinuria), autoimmune diseases (such as antiphospholipid syndrome, polyarteritis nodosa, SLE, cold agglutinin disease), or thrombotic-embolic phenomena or cholesterol embolization (such as livedoid vasculopathy or cutaneous metastasis from breast cancer or urothelial carcinoma). Mechanistically, these conditions compromise arterial patency or endothelial function, leading to the characteristic mottled pattern on the skin.
- **Risk factors**: Patients with autoimmune disorders, hypercoagulable states, metastatic cancers, or chronic vascular diseases have an increased risk for developing livedo racemosa. Underlying inflammatory or thrombotic conditions also predispose individuals to this manifestation.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, livedo racemosa presents as a diffuse, branching or circular purplish network of lesions that often have a broken, irregular appearance. In contrast to livedo reticularis (which may be more uniform and symmetrical), livedo racemosa tends to be more persistent and irregular in distribution, often suggesting an underlying systemic process rather than a benign or reversible cause. It may be accompanied by neurological symptoms or ischemic phenomena if associated conditions affect other organ systems. The differential includes livedo reticularis, cutis marmorata, and other vasculopathic skin presentations, with biopsy and systemic workup often necessary to identify an underlying etiology.

### Influenza virus infection in infancy and early childhood [^112jYNiM]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Infants and young children have the highest influenza infection and hospitalisation rates in paediatrics. The immaturity of the infant's immune system and the absence of prior immunity and exposure to the virus are potential contributors. Although most children that suffer from influenza infection are otherwise healthy, an underlying chronic medical condition further increases the risk for complications. Annual immunisation with influenza vaccine is recommended for any child 6 months of age and older in whom prevention of disease is desirable, particularly for those with underlying medical conditions. Offering influenza vaccine to pregnant women who will deliver during the influenza season can potentially reduce the frequency and severity of influenza disease in infants less than 6 months of age. Family members, including other children and all other close contacts, should also receive influenza vaccine to reduce transmission to children at risk and infants in the first 6 months of life.

### Diagnosis underlying appendectomy and coeliac disease risk [^113gD7RQ]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Earlier studies suggest that appendectomy is associated with a substantially reduced risk of certain types of bowel inflammation such as ulcerative colitis, particularly where the underlying diagnosis is acute appendicitis. Previous research on appendectomy and coeliac disease is inconsistent, based on small numbers with retrospective data collection, and has not differentiated between different diagnoses underlying appendectomy.

Objective

To investigate the association of diagnosis underlying appendectomy with coeliac disease.

Methods

We used Cox regression to study the risk of later appendectomy in more than 14,000 individuals with coeliac disease and 68,000 referents without coeliac disease, identified through the Swedish National Registers 1964–2003, and conditional logistic regression to study the risk of coeliac disease associated with a history of prior appendectomy. Appendectomy was categorised according to the underlying diagnosis: perforated appendicitis, non-perforated appendicitis, and appendectomy without appendicitis.

Results

Overall, coeliac disease was negatively associated with perforated appendicitis (hazard ratio = 0.78, 95% confidence interval = 0.60–1.01), not associated with non-perforated appendicitis (hazard ratio = 1.11, 95% confidence interval = 0.99–1.25), but positively associated with appendectomy without appendicitis (hazard ratio = 1.58, 95% confidence interval = 1.32–1.89). The magnitudes of the relative risks were similar irrespective of whether coeliac disease occurred prior to or after appendectomy.

Conclusion

Coeliac disease and perforated appendicitis are negatively associated irrespective of the timing of the conditions. Not surprisingly, CD increases the risk for appendectomy without appendicitis.

### Systemic sclerosis [^117HC7cP]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on systemic sclerosis:

- **Definition**: SSc is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by diffuse fibrosis and vasculopathy of the skin and internal organs.
- **Pathophysiology**: SSc is caused by a complex interplay of environmental factors that trigger an abnormal immune response in genetically predisposed individuals.
- **Epidemiology**: The overall incidence and prevalence of SSc in the US are 5.6 cases per 100,000 person-years and 13.5–18.4 cases per 100,000 persons, respectively.
- **Disease course**: The resultant vascular injury and endothelial dysfunction lead to vasoconstriction, excessive deposition of extracellular matrix and collagen, hypertrophy of intimal and medial layers of small blood vessels, and endothelial cell apoptosis, resulting in clinical manifestations of Raynaud's phenomenon, digital ulcers, pulmonary arterial hypertension, renal failure, obstructive vasculopathy, and fibrosis of the skin and internal organs.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The estimated 5-year and 10-year cumulative survival from the time of diagnosis is 74.9% and 62.5%, respectively.

### Paediatric intestinal pseudo-obstruction: evidence and consensus-based recommendations from an ESPGHAN-led expert group [^115UbUhU]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (laboratory tests), ESPGHAN 2018 guidelines recommend to decide on obtaining other laboratory tests, particularly aimed at identifying secondary causes of pediatric intestinal pseudo-obstruction, based on the presence of specific clinical signs and symptoms. Pay special attention to patients with ≥ 1 of the following:

- familial history of similar problems

- deafness

- cardiac involvement (cardiomyopathy, abnormal conduction or rhythm)

- neurological symptoms and neurological impairment in the absence of a specific cause

- dermatological involvement (scleroderma, Raynaud's phenomenon, palmar erythema, nodules)

- known or suspected mitochondrial disorders

- sudden onset of intestinal sub-occlusive episodes (idiopathic or paraneoplastic inflammatory neuro‐myopathy).

### Energy drinks: a contemporary issues paper [^114K1aFs]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Energy drinks — conclusions on risk and monitoring emphasize that energy drinks are frequently consumed and there are reports of morbidity and mortality associated with their consumption. In particular, individuals known to be more susceptible to adverse events include those of young age, small stature, caffeine-naïve or caffeine-sensitive, pregnant or breastfeeding women, those with certain medical conditions and/or taking certain medications, consuming multiple energy drinks in one session, and those with underlying cardiovascular or other diseases. Of critical importance, children and adolescents appear to be at particularly high risk of complications from energy drinks due to their small body size, being relatively caffeine naive, and potentially heavy and frequent consumption patterns, as well as the amounts of caffeine. Although most healthy adults can consume an energy drink without any significant, negative, acute health effects, the long-term effects of chronic consumption have not been well studied. Continued monitoring of adverse events related to energy drink consumption is needed to fully understand the rate, severity and nature of reactions to these products across the lifespan.

### Sildenafil citrate (Viagra) [^115Fgsr1]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1 Cardiovascular

There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including VIAGRA, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment.

VIAGRA has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg), [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing VIAGRA, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity.

Use with caution in patients with the following underlying conditions which can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including VIAGRA – those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g., aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure.

There are no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of VIAGRA in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution.

Patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia within the last 6 months;
Patients with resting hypotension (BP < 90/50 mmHg) or hypertension (BP > 170/110 mmHg);
Patients with cardiac failure or coronary artery disease causing unstable angina.

5.2 Prolonged Erection and Priapism

Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of VIAGRA. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result.

VIAGRA should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia). However, there are no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of VIAGRA in patients with sickle cell or related anemias.

Secondary findings penetrance thresholds — Although high penetrance evidence would support inclusion of a gene or variant group on the SF list, "there is no strictly defined penetrance threshold for inclusion", and the SFWG "has not adopted, and does not plan to adopt, a strict penetrance threshold that nominated genes or variants must meet", noting that any such threshold would be "chosen arbitrarily", based on an "incomplete and biased" evidence base and could "exacerbate existing inequities in genomic medicine".

Premature ventricular complexes — evaluation considerations: Because some studies have shown an association of PVCs with adverse outcomes, the detection of PVCs, particularly if multifocal and frequent, is generally considered a risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and such patients are generally evaluated to ensure they do not have underlying conditions (eg, ischemic heart disease, left ventricular [LV] dysfunction) that warrant further treatment to reduce risk.

### Lost bones: differential diagnosis of acro-osteolysis seen by the pediatric rheumatologist [^1157XcRy]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The term acro-osteolysis refers to bone resorption of the distal phalanges in the upper and lower extremities. Acro-osteolysis has been described in association with various disorders including genetic conditions, rheumatic diseases (psoriatic arthritis and systemic sclerosis in particular), hyperparathyroidism, severe neuropathy, digital ischemia, and trauma and other local factors. The underlying mechanism of bone resorption is largely unknown, although there is some evidence for vascular alterations leading to enhanced osteoclastic activity. Although acro-osteolysis may occur as an isolated idiopathic feature, its presence should prompt the clinician to obtain a targeted history and physical examination to search for the underlying etiology.

Plain radiographs are the gold standard for detecting acro-osteolysis. Two radiographic patterns of acro-osteolysis have been described: 1) resorption of the terminal tuft (more common), and 2) destruction of the proximal end of the distal phalanx causing a transverse osteolysis through the shaft. It has been suggested that the particular pattern of acro-osteolysis may be suggestive of the underlying etiology, with tuft resorption more commonly seen with systemic sclerosis, ischemia, hyperparathyroidism, and neurologic disorders, and destruction of the distal interphalangeal joint more commonly seen in inflammatory, particularly psoriatic, arthritis.

The literature to date has mostly described acro-osteolysis in the adult population. Although some of the conditions associated with acro-osteolysis, such as rheumatologic diseases, can span the age range, the approach to the differential diagnosis may be somewhat different in pediatric patients, with children being less likely to have environmental exposures and severe neuropathy, and more likely to have an underlying genetic disorder. The aim of this review is to describe the disorders with which acro-osteolysis is associated and their distinguishing features, with particular attention to those which are more commonly encountered in pediatrics.

### Understanding systematic reviews and meta-analyses [formula: see text] [^1157FyFS]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Systematic reviews should be distinguished from narrative reviews. In the latter, an editor asks an expert to sum up all of the information that is known about a particular topic. However, the expert is under no constraints regarding what he or she does, or does not, choose to include in the review. As a result, his or her bias can influence the final message. A systematic review, which may or may not be written by experts, typically asks a narrower question, and then answers it using the entirety of the medical literature. The systematic review process includes computer searches to identify the pertinent literature, a statement of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for identified studies, a list of items of interest to extract from each study, a method to assess the quality of each study, a summary of the evidence that has been found (which may or may not involve attempts to combine data), a discussion of the evidence and the limitations of the conclusions, and suggestions for future research efforts. If the data are combined, that process is called meta-analysis. In meta-analysis, an estimate of the reliability of each study is made, and those that appear to be more reliable are weighed more heavily when the data are combined. While systematic reviews depend on a more preplanned method and thus, unlike narrative reviews, contain sections on method, they can be easily read once the reader becomes familiar with the vocabulary.
