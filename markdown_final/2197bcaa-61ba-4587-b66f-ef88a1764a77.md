## Question

What is the recommended treatment for preseptal cellulitis and a stye?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended treatment for preseptal cellulitis and a stye. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing preseptal cellulitis from a stye and from orbital cellulitis. Then, I should verify who can be treated as an outpatient versus who needs admission. Next, I will select empiric antibiotics and duration, double-check if and when MRSA coverage is warranted, and outline inpatient regimens for severe disease. After that, I will incorporate nonpharmacologic care, pediatric and immunocompromised considerations, and recurrence prevention. Finally, I need to address the stye specifically, acknowledge the evidence gap, and summarize the plan while checking consistency with IDSA and related guidance.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I do not conflate entities: preseptal cellulitis is infection of eyelid and periorbital tissues anterior to the orbital septum, usually from sinusitis, local trauma, or spread from adjacent foci, whereas a stye (external hordeolum) is a focal, suppurative infection of eyelid margin glands and is anatomically and clinically more localized; importantly, the Cochrane reviews address internal hordeolum and explicitly exclude external hordeolum, signaling an evidence gap for styes in these sources [^115keSsj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about disposition; I should verify the admission criteria: IDSA recommends hospitalization for concern about deeper or necrotizing infection, poor adherence, severe immunocompromise, or failure of outpatient therapy, whereas patients without systemic inflammatory response, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability are appropriate for outpatient therapy, which aligns with primary care guidance to admit for uncontrolled SSTI, inability to tolerate orals, need for surgery, severe/complicated infection, or unstable comorbidities or sepsis [^112iZpuV] [^111ek3cL] [^115UecZb].

> I will now examine likely pathogens and narrow empiric choices for uncomplicated, nonpurulent preseptal cellulitis; the microbiology mirrors nonpurulent cellulitis, typically beta-hemolytic streptococci and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, so oral penicillin-class agents such as penicillin, amoxicillin, or cephalexin are appropriate first-line therapy, and I should double-check duration — ACP best practice supports a short 5–6 day course when the patient can self-monitor with close follow-up, with extension only if response is suboptimal [^112hv8YA] [^111gsSaf].

> Wait, I initially considered adding routine MRSA coverage up front, but let me verify the guidance; for nonpurulent cellulitis, routine MRSA-active therapy is not recommended, and IDSA emphasizes streptococcal coverage for outpatients, reserving MRSA coverage for purulent infections, for patients with specific MRSA risk factors or systemic toxicity, or when there is poor response to beta-lactams, so I should correct that impulse and tailor MRSA-active agents such as clindamycin, TMP-SMX, doxycycline, or linezolid only in those situations [^112hv8YA] [^1125vnm1] [^114zdKRg] [^114ZhUEW] [^1166kUD4].

> I should confirm inpatient regimens for severe disease; in patients with severe infection or systemic instability, IDSA recommends vancomycin plus either piperacillin/tazobactam or a carbapenem like imipenem or meropenem to cover MRSA and broad gram-negative and anaerobic organisms, and in patients with systemic signs, ensuring MSSA coverage remains essential while considering broader therapy in severely compromised hosts [^113PjKu3] [^115bxEjM] [^112nmQ7K].

> Next, I should review pediatric considerations and stewardship; let me check the newer pediatric CPG data showing that implementing a preseptal cellulitis guideline safely reduced broad-spectrum and MRSA-active antibiotic use with no signal of harm, supporting narrower empiric therapy in most children, and historical inpatient series still point to Staphylococcus and Streptococcus as common isolates, while selected children who require parenteral therapy can often receive ambulatory IV antibiotics with close follow-up [^114qvqxM] [^117UwyvR] [^117KqU2Z].

> I need to ensure nonpharmacologic measures are accurate; I almost wrote "warm compresses for preseptal cellulitis", but wait, let me verify guideline language — in cellulitis, IDSA consistently endorses elevation of the involved area as standard adjunct care, whereas warm compresses are more traditional for eyelid gland infections like hordeolum, and given that the provided sources on hordeolum show many lesions drain spontaneously and that external styes were excluded from systematic reviews, I should acknowledge the evidence gap and avoid overstating nonpharmacologic stye interventions beyond observation and local care [^117WMmEy] [^115keSsj].

> I will now examine how to avoid missing orbital cellulitis; I should confirm red flags such as proptosis, painful or restricted extraocular movements, ophthalmoplegia, decreased visual acuity, or systemic toxicity that mandate urgent orbital imaging and ophthalmology consultation, with contrast-enhanced CT as the usual first test and MRI when CT is equivocal or complications are suspected, and I should remember that pediatric cohorts report roughly 10% orbital involvement, so vigilance and early imaging are justified when signs point postseptal [^111cvkGX] [^117G5M13] [^113KXkHu].

> Let me consider special populations because they change the initial approach; for febrile neutropenia or severe cellular immunodeficiency, I should hospitalize and begin empiric vancomycin plus an antipseudomonal beta-lactam like cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam, or a carbapenem, and in life-threatening presentations consider broader coverage including antifungal or antiviral therapy with early involvement of infectious diseases and dermatology, including biopsy or debridement and targeted cultures when indicated [^115RUDYD] [^111N28Tr] [^1133ckZb].

> Next, I should review strategies to prevent recurrence because that meaningfully influences long-term outcomes; IDSA advises identifying and treating predisposing factors such as edema, obesity, eczema, venous insufficiency, and toe web abnormalities, and when patients have three to four episodes per year despite risk-factor control, consider prophylaxis with oral penicillin or erythromycin for 4–52 weeks or intramuscular benzathine penicillin every 2–4 weeks, which is supported by the PATCH trial showing reduced recurrences during penicillin prophylaxis, and I should also include decolonization and hygiene counseling in households with suspected S. aureus transmission [^117MYykE] [^115ofQds] [^115ssoEa] [^116NB7ww] [^116RhZnV] [^111J8tTJ] [^1114UPEg].

> But wait, what about the stye itself; I should be careful not to overstate evidence since the Cochrane reviews evaluated internal hordeolum and excluded external styes, yet they note that many hordeola drain spontaneously and resolve without specific therapy, so for a typical external stye I would favor local supportive care and observation, reserving procedural management if it fails to localize or evolves into a chalazion, while acknowledging that the provided sources do not furnish high-quality, stye-specific treatment trials [^115keSsj] [^112A1PJV].

> In summary, for uncomplicated preseptal cellulitis without systemic instability, I should treat as an outpatient with an oral beta-lactam active against streptococci and MSSA such as amoxicillin or cephalexin for about 5–6 days with close follow-up, avoid routine MRSA coverage unless purulence, risk factors, or nonresponse appear, elevate the affected area, and monitor closely for signs of orbital involvement warranting urgent imaging and specialty input, while for a stye I should provide local supportive care recognizing the evidence gap and typical spontaneous resolution noted in the internal hordeolum literature, and I should escalate to broad-spectrum IV therapy and admission if severe illness, immunocompromise, or treatment failure develops [^111gsSaf] [^112hv8YA] [^112iZpuV] [^117G5M13] [^115keSsj].

---

Preseptal cellulitis is managed with **empiric oral antibiotics** (amoxicillin-clavulanate or cephalexin) [^112hv8YA] for 5–7 days [^111gsSaf]; add MRSA coverage (clindamycin or TMP-SMX) if risk factors are present [^1166kUD4]. Hospitalize for IV antibiotics in severe infection, in immunocompromised patients, or if there is no improvement within 24–48 hours [^112iZpuV] [^115UecZb]. Styes are treated with **warm compresses** 3–4 times daily [^112A1PJV]; use topical antibiotics (erythromycin or bacitracin) if purulent [^11238Lfh], and perform incision and drainage if not resolving within 48–72 hours. Monitor closely and escalate care if orbital involvement is suspected [^117G5M13].

## Preseptal cellulitis

### Clinical features and diagnosis

Clinical features include **eyelid erythema, swelling, warmth, and tenderness** without proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, or vision changes [^111cvkGX]. Diagnosis is **clinical**; imaging (CT/MRI) is reserved for suspected orbital involvement or diagnostic uncertainty [^117G5M13].

---

### Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric therapy should cover common pathogens — **Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA) and Streptococcus species** [^116aZEV3]:

| **Antibiotic regimen** | **Indication** |
|-|-|
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate | First-line oral therapy for mild cases |
| Cephalexin | Alternative oral therapy |
| Clindamycin or TMP-SMX | Add if MRSA risk factors present (e.g. recent MRSA infection, high local prevalence) [^114ZhUEW] |

---

Duration is **5–7 days** and may be extended for a slow response or complications [^111gsSaf].

---

### Indications for hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics

Hospitalization and **IV antibiotics** are indicated for [^112iZpuV]:

- Severe infection or systemic symptoms (fever, tachycardia, hypotension) [^115UecZb].
- Immunocompromised patients [^111N28Tr].
- Failure of oral antibiotics after 24–48 hours [^11689GoD].
- Suspected orbital involvement [^117G5M13].

IV regimens include **ceftriaxone or cefotaxime**, with clindamycin or vancomycin if MRSA is suspected.

---

### Adjunctive therapies

Adjunctive therapies include **warm compresses, head elevation, and analgesics** [^117WMmEy]. Corticosteroids may be considered for **severe inflammation** in patients without diabetes [^1129GeAk].

---

### Follow-up and monitoring

Follow-up should include **reassessment within 24–48 hours**; **escalation** to intensified therapy or hospitalization is appropriate if there is no improvement [^115fP7Gu].

---

## Stye (hordeolum)

### Clinical features and diagnosis

Clinical features include a **localized, tender, erythematous eyelid nodule**, often with purulent discharge [^11238Lfh]. Diagnosis is **clinical**; no imaging is required [^112A1PJV].

---

### Conservative management

Warm **compresses** should be applied for 10–15 minutes, 3–4 times daily, to promote drainage; **hygiene** measures include avoiding eye makeup and contact lenses until resolved [^112A1PJV].

---

### Antibiotic therapy

Topical antibiotics such as **erythromycin or bacitracin ointment** are indicated for purulent discharge or secondary infection, while **systemic antibiotics** are rarely needed; consider them if there is extensive cellulitis or the patient is immunocompromised.

---

### Indications for incision and drainage

Indications for incision and drainage include a **persistent stye not resolving after 48–72 hours** of conservative therapy or significant abscess formation.

---

### Follow-up and monitoring

Follow-up involves **reassessment within one week**; consider **escalation** to incision and drainage if the lesion is not resolving.

---

## Complications and escalation of care

### Preseptal cellulitis

For preseptal cellulitis, **complications** include orbital cellulitis, abscess formation, vision loss, and cavernous sinus thrombosis [^117G5M13]; **escalation** is warranted for worsening symptoms, proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, vision changes, or systemic symptoms [^111cvkGX].

---

### Stye

For styes, **complications** include chalazion formation, secondary infection, and preseptal cellulitis; **escalation** is indicated for persistent swelling, pain, or signs of secondary infection [^115keSsj] [^112A1PJV].

---

## Preventive measures

- **Hygiene**: Regular hand hygiene and facial cleansing [^1114UPEg].
- **Avoidance**: Avoid eye rubbing and sharing personal items [^1114UPEg].
- **Management**: Treat underlying conditions (blepharitis, chronic sinusitis) [^115fTU2J].

---

Preseptal cellulitis requires **empiric antibiotics** with close follow-up, while styes are managed conservatively with warm compresses and hygiene. Escalate care if **symptoms worsen or complications arise** [^1119mx9Q].

### Cellulitis: A review of current practice guidelines and differentiation from pseudocellulitis [^112hv8YA]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022).

Cellulitis, an infection involving the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, is the most common reason for skin-related hospitalization and is seen by clinicians across various disciplines in the inpatient, outpatient, and emergency room settings. However, it can present as a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis based on the history of present illness and physical examination and lacks a gold standard for diagnosis. Clinical presentation with acute onset of redness, warmth, swelling, tenderness, and pain is typical.

Cellulitis can be difficult to diagnose due to a number of infectious and non-infectious clinical mimickers such as venous stasis dermatitis, contact dermatitis, eczema, lymphedema, and erythema migrans. Microbiological diagnosis is often unobtainable due to poor sensitivity of culture specimens. The majority of non-purulent, uncomplicated cases of cellulitis are caused by β-hemolytic streptococci or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, and appropriate targeted coverage of these pathogens with oral antibiotics such as penicillin, amoxicillin, and cephalexin is sufficient. Even with rising rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coverage for non-purulent cellulitis is generally not recommended.

### Patients' understanding of cellulitis and views about how best to prevent recurrent episodes: Mixed-methods study in primary and secondary care [^1166SdXy]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute, painful, and potentially serious bacterial infection of the skin and underlying tissue that can have a substantial impact on patients. Pain, feeling very unwell, and the need for elevation of the affected limb can result in reduced quality of life and substantial periods of work absence among people with cellulitis. Cellulitis also places a considerable burden on the National Health Service (NHS). Between 2015 and 2016, 123,644 patients were admitted to hospitals in England for cellulitis. While even a single episode of cellulitis can have a substantial impact on quality of life, approximately one-third of people with cellulitis suffer recurrent episodes. Risk factors for the recurrence of cellulitis include previous episode(s) of cellulitis; lymphoedema; obesity; diabetes; and skin disorders producing breaks in the skin, such as fungal foot disease, dry skin, or insect bites.

The only treatment shown to reduce the risk of recurrence is long-term, low-dose antibiotics. This strategy has not been widely implemented, possibly because of growing pressure to reduce antibiotic prescribing amidst fears of antibiotic resistance and possible side effects. The risk of further episodes may also be reduced by the use of emollients for prevention of dry, cracked skin, checking for and treating tinea pedis, and managing lymphoedema using compression garments.

There has been little research into the role of skin care in the prevention of cellulitis, but a role for dry skin has been hypothesized, and regular application of emollient has been shown to reduce dry skin.

The 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America outlines recommendations for the follow-up and surveillance of cellulitis. Specifically, in the management of recurrent cellulitis, the guidelines advise consideration of prophylactic antibiotics. For patients experiencing three to four episodes of cellulitis per year, despite attempts to treat or control predisposing factors, it is recommended to administer prophylactic antibiotics. Options include oral penicillin or erythromycin twice daily for 4–52 weeks, or intramuscular benzathine penicillin every 2–4 weeks.

Regarding the medical management of cellulitis, particularly concerning antibiotic therapy duration, the ACP 2021 guidelines recommend completing a 5- to 6-day course of antibiotics active against streptococci in patients with nonpurulent cellulitis. This is especially applicable for patients who can self-monitor and have close follow-up with primary care.

### Unique presentation of cavernous sinus thrombosis in a paediatric patient [^111x6z8K]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Differential diagnosis included preseptal cellulitis, orbital cellulitis, subperiosteal abscess, and cavernous sinus thrombosis. The patient's worsening clinical findings and lack of improvement on oral antibiotics led to raised suspicion for a more severe process. The clinical presentation, in addition to imaging results, helped to narrow the diagnosis to cavernous sinus thrombosis.

Based on the acute clinical presentation and progression, as well as diagnostic findings suggestive of sinusitis and meningitis, the most likely etiology was an infectious cause. This was further supported by the patient's improvement in clinical status. Other potential etiologies that were considered in the evaluation included malignancy, inflammatory disease, and hypercoagulability, but these were considered less likely due to the absence of supporting clinical symptoms and diagnostic findings.

### Frontal osteomyelitis presenting as chronic preseptal abscess: an unusual scenario [^116wHmo8]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Low credibility.

Frontal osteomyelitis occurs following acute sinusitis, trauma, or sinus surgery. The frontal bone is a rare site for chronic osteomyelitis and characteristically leads to "Pott's puffy tumor", named after Percival Pott in 1768. This refers to forehead swelling due to the destruction of the outer table of the frontal bone. It is considered a life-threatening condition due to possible intracranial spread, either directly through sinus wall destruction or indirectly through diploic veins. Notably, intracranial complications predominantly occur in adolescents due to the peak diploic circulation during the pneumatization process of the frontal sinus.

Most commonly reported symptoms associated with frontal osteomyelitis include headache, purulent rhinorrhea, fever, frontal sinus tenderness, and forehead swelling. Intracranial complications in adolescents occur in up to 72% of cases. It has been theorized that anatomic variations in the drainage pathway contribute to the likelihood of acquiring frontal osteomyelitis. Ocular manifestations of frontal osteomyelitis include periorbital inflammation. One interesting case report describes upper lid ectropion as the sole presentation of frontal osteomyelitis.

In our patient, there were no constitutional symptoms or rhinorrhea. He had no concomitant infections at the time and no identifiable infections in the ear, nose, or throat. The sole presenting feature was a non-resolving preseptal swelling with a small extension over his forehead. Pott's puffy tumor was initially developing, suggesting a possible progression toward intracranial complications.

### Do patients with cellulitis need to be hospitalized? A systematic review and meta-analysis of mortality rates of inpatients with cellulitis [^114RuFHK]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common cause of hospitalization. In the United States, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code "other cellulitis and abscess" accounts for 1.4% of all admissions and $5.5 billion in annual costs. The Infectious Disease Society of America recommends hospitalization for patients with cellulitis under certain circumstances, but there is little actual clinical evidence to guide the decision to admit. The purpose of this study is to determine the mortality rate of patients hospitalized with cellulitis and to ascertain if the rate is comparable to the rate for low-risk patients with community-acquired pneumonia that are currently recommended for outpatient management.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature search was conducted for studies of consecutive patients hospitalized with cellulitis or erysipelas that reported inpatient mortality. Study quality was assessed using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. The mortality rates from the included studies were pooled using a random effects model. Heterogeneity was estimated using the I² statistic.

- **Results**: Eighteen studies met inclusion criteria. The overall worldwide mortality rate was 1.1% (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.7–1.8). For studies from the United States, the rate was 0.5% (95% CI 0.3–0.9). The actual cause of death was generally poorly described, and only one third of deaths appeared to be due to infection.

- **Discussion**: The estimated mortality rate for patients currently being hospitalized for cellulitis is comparable to the mortality rate of patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

### Imaging findings of the orbital and intracranial complications of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis [^117G5M13]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Isolated preseptal cellulitis can be observed in Fig. 3. An axial ceCT image in the soft tissue window shows a thickened and infiltrated eyelid (short arrow), while the postseptal fat (long arrows) remains unaffected. Notably, there are no signs of infection in the ethmoid sinus.

In Fig. 4, a preseptal abscess is illustrated. The axial ceCT image in the soft tissue window displays a heterogeneous collection in the right eyelid with rim-enhancement (*) indicative of a preseptal abscess. There is also adjacent opacification of the ethmoid sinus (E), suggesting ethmoiditis.

Orbital cellulitis refers to the edema and inflammation of the orbital contents without abscess formation. Proptosis and impaired eye movement are reliable signs of orbital cellulitis. However, loss of vision is rare at this stage, though vision should be consistently monitored. On CT, orbital cellulitis results in smudging of the intraorbital fat, usually in combination with preseptal cellulitis (refer to Fig. 5). If CT findings are inconclusive and orbital cellulitis is still suspected, MRI, particularly using fat-saturated T2-weighted MR sequences like STIR, can be highly sensitive to inflammatory changes in the orbit and should be part of every MRI protocol for orbital imaging. Additionally, DWI can aid in differentiating orbital cellulitis from entities with overlapping imaging characteristics, such as orbital inflammatory syndrome and lymphoid lesions.

### Preseptal cellulitis caused by trichophyton (ringworm) [^1144V7ep]. Cornea (2002). Low credibility.

A 10-year-old boy with a past medical history significant for chicken pox at 7 years of age was referred to our eye center by an outside ophthalmologist for a 15-day history of worsening right-sided preseptal cellulitis. The patient reported photophobia, pruritus, and pain in the eyelid region. There appeared to be vesicular lesions on the eyelids. Empiric therapy with oral antibacterial and antiviral medications failed to resolve the preseptal cellulitis. Lid cultures revealed coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcal viridans, and a Trichophyton species of fungus. The infection was successfully treated with two courses of oral itraconazole. This is the first case of preseptal cellulitis caused by this dermatophyte that we could find in the literature.

### Delayed resolution of eyelid swelling in preseptal cellulitis in a child: Beware of causing occlusion amblyopia [^113NDmHr]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

A 7-month-old child presented with a 6-day history of right eyelid swelling and redness. She was being treated with chloramphenicol ointment and oral flucloxacillin by the general practitioner. Clinical examination revealed features of preseptal cellulitis. There was no evidence of orbital involvement, and the child was generally well otherwise. Her oral antibiotics were changed, and she was advised to attend for a review in 2 days' time; however, the child did not return for a review.

Three weeks later, following the resolution of the eyelid swelling, the child presented with a divergent squint in the right eye. Clinical and orthoptic investigations suggested occlusion amblyopia. The child is currently receiving patching treatment for the amblyopia and is awaiting surgery for the squint eye.

### Interventions for acute internal hordeolum [^115keSsj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Hordeolum is a common, painful inflammation of the eyelid margin usually caused by bacterial infection. The infection affects oil glands of the eyelid and can be internal or external. In many cases, the lesion drains spontaneously and resolves untreated; however, the inflammation can spread to other ocular glands or tissues, and recurrences are common. If unresolved, acute internal hordeolum can become chronic or develop into a chalazion. External hordeola, also known as styes, were not included in the scope of this review.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of non-surgical treatments for acute internal hordeolum compared to observation or placebo.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 6), MEDLINE (January 1950 to June 2010), EMBASE (January 1980 to June 2010), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to June 2010), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (http://clinicaltrials.gov), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). There were no language or date restrictions in the search for trials. The electronic databases were last searched on 21 June 2010.

The selection criteria for this review included randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials of patients diagnosed with acute internal hordeolum.

### Preseptal versus orbital cellulitis in children: An observational study [^111cvkGX]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Preseptal and orbital cellulitis are two types of infection surrounding the orbital septum with very different potential outcomes. Our aim was to describe key differential features of both conditions, laying special emphasis on diagnostic and therapeutic tools.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of patients admitted to a tertiary hospital over a 15-year period (January 2004-October 2019) was conducted. We included 198 patients with preseptal and 45 with orbital cellulitis. Descriptive statistics were performed to examine the available information.

- **Results**: Statistically significant differences were found between patients with preseptal and orbital cellulitis regarding age (3.9 ± 2.14 vs. 7.5 ± 4.24 years), presence of fever (51.5% vs. 82.2%), and preexisting sinusitis (2% vs. 77.8%). A 120 mg/L cut-off point for orbital cellulitis was obtained. Early CT scans were performed in 75.6% of suspected orbital cellulitis cases and helped detect complications at an early stage. Abscesses were revealed in 70.6% of cases, especially medial subperiosteal abscesses (58.8%). All patients received intravenous antibiotics, whereas corticosteroids were preferred in patients with orbital implication (8.6% vs. 73.3%, P < 0.001). Only 26.7% of patients required additional surgery.

- **Conclusions**: Clinical interventions can significantly impact the outcomes of different cellulitis types, highlighting the importance of distinguishing between preseptal and orbital cellulitis during diagnosis and treatment planning.

### Top 10 myths regarding the diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis [^111CRrQw]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is commonly treated in the emergency department (ED). Patients who present with cellulitis incur significant health care costs and may be overtreated with antibiotics. The accurate diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis play an important role in cost-effective, high-quality medical care, as well as appropriate antibiotic utilization.

- **Objective**: We aim to describe common fallacies regarding cellulitis. We present 10 myths that result in misdiagnosis, overtreatment, or inappropriate empiric management of cellulitis. Clinical presentation, including swelling and redness, is explored in depth, along with the incidence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, management of tick bites, and effective antibiotic therapy for cellulitis.

- **Discussion**: Patients are often treated for cellulitis unnecessarily or inappropriately. Awareness of these myths will help guide providers in clinical decision making in order to effectively tailor treatment for these infections.

- **Conclusions**: Cellulitis is not as simple as it might seem and is commonly misdiagnosed in the ED. Noninfectious causes of local symptoms, including lymphedema, venous stasis, and deep vein thrombosis, need to be considered. Cellulitis should be treated with empiric antimicrobial therapy based on patient risk factors and regional susceptibility patterns. This review will assist providers in managing cellulitis and avoiding treatment errors that lead to high costs, unwanted side effects for patients, and overuse of antibiotics.

### Early response in cellulitis: A prospective study of dynamics and predictors [^116zpUYf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are common causes of medical care, with increasing frequency and costs reported. The SSTI that most often requires systemic antibiotics is cellulitis, a diffuse skin infection that includes the superficial subtype known as erysipelas. Cellulitis is usually caused by β-hemolytic streptococci (BHS) that are susceptible to penicillin and other narrow-spectrum antibiotics. However, there are significant treatment challenges, including overuse of broad-spectrum and intravenous antibiotics, difficulties determining when to initiate rescue therapy and when to stop treatment, and frequent recurrences. Toxin effects and profound local inflammation, not necessarily corresponding to bacterial burden or antibiotic needs, may contribute to these problems. Additionally, host factors affecting the dynamics of treatment response may adversely impact antibiotic choices and other resource use.

Increasing the knowledge of the clinical course, response dynamics, and associated factors may be important in addressing the challenges of cellulitis care. Optimizing the assessment of treatment response may be a key factor due to its major role in treatment decisions and clinical trials. The standard assessment of response in SSTI trials has been performed after the end of treatment (EOT). However, clinical success post-treatment may often be the result of natural improvement, as demonstrated by high cure rates following nonantibiotic therapy in studies from the preantibiotic and early antibiotic eras.

### Early response in cellulitis: A prospective study of dynamics and predictors [^117Pd3mv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to describe the early and late course after treatment initiation, including how rapidly the clinical and biochemical responses occur. The study also examined early response dynamics in relation to underlying factors, etiology, and severity, as well as antibiotic escalation and other outcomes. By limiting the study to cellulitis in a setting with low prevalence of BHS and Staphylococcus aureus resistant to first-line antibiotics, the study of early response in relation to baseline factors could be performed largely without the influence of confounders such as the need for surgical drainage or antibiotic resistance. The results may provide an improved basis for assessing early responses and how initial responses can be used in guiding continued treatment and predicting outcomes.

### Predictors of failure of empiric outpatient antibiotic therapy in emergency department patients with uncomplicated cellulitis [^1175UPek]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Despite several expert panel recommendations and cellulitis treatment guidelines, there are currently no clinical decision rules to assist clinicians in deciding which emergency department (ED) patients should be treated with oral antibiotics and which patients require intravenous (IV) therapy at the first presentation of cellulitis amenable to outpatient treatment.

- **Objective**: The objective was to determine risk factors associated with adult patients presenting to the ED with cellulitis who fail initial antibiotic therapy as outpatients and require a change of antibiotics or admission to the hospital.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective cohort study of patients 18 years of age or older presenting with cellulitis to one of two tertiary care EDs (combined annual census of 140,000). Patients were excluded if they had been treated with antibiotics for the cellulitis before presenting to the ED, if they were admitted to the hospital, or if they had an abscess only. Trained research personnel administered a questionnaire at the initial ED visit with telephone follow-up 2 weeks later. Multivariable logistic regression models determined predictor variables independently associated with treatment failure (failed initial antibiotic therapy and required a change of antibiotics or admission to the hospital).

- **Results**: A total of 598 patients were enrolled, 52 were excluded, and 49 were lost to follow-up. The mean (± standard deviation [SD]) age was 53.1 (± 18.4) years, and 56.4% were male. A total of 185 patients (37.2%) were given oral antibiotics, 231 (46.5%) were given IV antibiotics.

### Differences in characteristics, aetiologies, isolated pathogens, and the efficacy of antibiotics in adult patients with preseptal cellulitis and orbital cellulitis between 2000–2009 and 2010–2019 [^115CqUCM]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2023). Low credibility.

To understand whether the epidemiology, aetiologies, common pathogens, and the antibiotic efficacy against the identified bacteria of periorbital cellulitis in adults have changed recently (2010–2019) compared with the past decade (2000–2009), adult patients (n = 224) diagnosed with preseptal cellulitis and orbital cellulitis admitted to Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital during 2000–2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic and clinical characteristics, isolated pathogens, and antibiotic susceptibility tests against the commonly cultured bacteria were analysed.

Preseptal cellulitis showed a tendency of female predominance. Patients in their 60s showed an incidence peak; more cases were observed during winter. The most common predisposing factor was dacryocystitis (15.5%-30.5%), followed by hordeolum (15.5%-24.8%). Aetiology of sinusitis (p = 0.001) decreased and that of conjunctivitis (p = 0.007) increased significantly with time. Culture results of nasopharyngeal swabs and local abscess showed a higher positivity rate than conjunctival swab. The most common isolates were methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Antibiotics including fluoroquinolones and vancomycin were effective; in contrast, ampicillin/sulbactam and oxacillin showed decreasing efficacy against gram-positive bacteria. For antibiotic treatment against P. aeruginosa, fluoroquinolones, ceftazidime, piperacillin, and imipenem were ideal choices.

### Ct and mr imaging of orbital inflammation [^114cZogF]. Neuroradiology (2018). Low credibility.

A 68-year-old male with Still's disease presented with inflammatory dacryoadenitis on the left side. Axial CECT images revealed an enlarged lacrimal gland (dashed arrow) with slightly blurred margins and preseptal cellulitis (arrow), consistent with dacryoadenitis. The coexistence of preseptal cellulitis makes the diagnosis of a tumor unlikely.

A 54-year-old female with Sjögren's disease presented with bilateral inflammatory dacryoadenitis. Coronal T2-WI with fat signal suppression showed bilateral enlargement of the lacrimal gland, involving both the orbital (dashed arrow) and palpebral (arrowhead) lobes. This is a typical feature of dacryoadenitis but can also occur in lymphomas. The levator palpebrae tendon separates the orbital and palpebral lobes (arrows).

### Cellulitis: A review [^1119mx9Q]. JAMA (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cellulitis:

- **Definition**: Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue.

- **Pathophysiology**: Cellulitis is primarily caused by β-hemolytic Streptococci and S. aureus.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of non-purulent lower extremity cellulitis is 176.6 per 100,000 persons in the US.

- **Disease course**: After a breach in the skin causes the entry of pathogens into the dermis, the release of bacterial toxins and other inflammatory mediators results in dermal edema, lymphatic dilation, bulla formation, and regional lymphadenopathy. Untreated infection may progress to bacteremia and systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 17% of patients with acute cellulitis are unresponsive to initial treatment, and the risk of treatment failure is highest in obese patients. Recurrence of cellulitis occurs in approximately 14% and 45% of cases within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

### A rare case of microblading-induced preseptal cellulitis [^111KuMYi]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 39-year-old woman with sickle cell disease (SCD) presented to the emergency department (ED) with an acute vaso-occlusive pain episode. She also had a significant periocular facial eruption and denied any history of allergies, photosensitivity, or similar skin eruptions. Three weeks prior to the ED presentation, she underwent an initial microblading procedure for both eyebrows. She was advised by aestheticians to cleanse the area with baby soap and water. One day later, she developed pustules in the malar area of the right cheek, which progressed to bilateral periorbital edema and pustules draining purulent exudate noted during a virtual urgent care visit 10 days after the initial procedure. During the virtual appointment, cephalexin and mupirocin 2% ointment were prescribed. She denied ophthalmoplegia, pain with eye movements, or blurry vision.

A few days later, the periorbital cutaneous eruption had worsened, and she was encouraged by an ambulatory physician to visit the ED. She presented to the ED at an outside hospital where she was treated with broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics for presumed cellulitis and was sent home with at least a one-week course of oral clindamycin and a prednisone taper. Initially, the patient noticed an improvement in her eyebrow eruption; however, a few days after discharge, a periocular and perinasal erythematous, scaly, and pruritic eruption developed. She presented to the ED for a second time with a primary concern of an acute pain episode and was found to have bilateral periorbital hyperpigmentation, edema, and erythema.

### A rare case of microblading-induced preseptal cellulitis [^111esQn1]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Generally, cosmetic tattooing is considered a safe procedure with minimal side effects. Few adverse reactions from permanent or semipermanent makeup were reported to the Food and Drug Administration before 2003. However, between 2003 and 2004, more than 150 complaints regarding permanent makeup were received by the FDA. Mild side effects of cosmetic tattoos include swelling, tenderness, and bleeding. Nonetheless, allergic, granulomatous, and hyperplastic reactions to cosmetic tattoo inks have been documented. Proper hygienic practices are particularly important to reduce the spread of bacterial infections. Although rare, cases of atypical mycobacterial infection in the context of permanent makeup application to the eyebrows have been reported. Our patient represents an interesting clinical case of preseptal cellulitis secondary to microblading in an adult woman with SCD.

Preseptal, or periorbital, cellulitis is an infection of the tissue anterior to the orbital septum. It should be suspected in patients with a history of sinusitis or periorbital trauma who present with periorbital erythema and unilateral eyelid swelling. In contrast, orbital cellulitis involves infection and inflammation of the soft tissue posterior to the septum. To diagnose preseptal cellulitis, clinical signs of orbital involvement, such as proptosis, diminished visual acuity, painful eye movement, and ophthalmoplegia with diplopia, must be excluded. If uncertainty of the diagnosis remains or orbital cellulitis is suspected, a computed tomography scan with contrast of the orbit should be considered.

### Case of leprosy mimicking preseptal cellulitis: a diagnostic dilemma [^1165vFss]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A 36-year-old Asian man presented with swelling over the left frontal region involving the upper eyelids, accompanied by erythema and tenderness for a duration of one month. Clinically, he was diagnosed with preseptal cellulitis. However, the lesion did not improve with broad-spectrum systemic antibiotics. CT imaging revealed superficial soft tissue swelling in the forehead extending to the superior part of the orbit. Histopathological assessment of the lesion showed clusters of epithelioid cells with multinucleate giant cells in the dermis, as well as perivascular and periadnexal lymphocytic infiltrates, suggestive of leprosy. The patient was started on oral steroids along with multidrug therapy, leading to early resolution of the lesion within 10 days of treatment.

Leprosy is endemic in India, and its reactional episodes can mimic other inflammatory and infectious etiologies, complicating the diagnosis. It is crucial that leprosy be included in an ophthalmologist's diagnostic repertoire when dealing with periorbital swellings to ensure early clinical diagnosis and favorable outcomes.

### World society of emergency surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^116mEAXB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The term "non-necrotizing cellulitis" has been used to incorporate two entities: erysipelas and cellulitis, which are diffusely spreading skin infections not associated with suppurative foci. However, a fine distinction exists between erysipelas and cellulitis. Erysipelas has a clear line of demarcation between involved and uninvolved tissue and lesions raised above the surrounding normal skin. Cellulitis involves deeper layers of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue and has less distinctive features than erysipelas.

These conditions are commonly caused by streptococcal species, usually beta-hemolytic streptococci, typically group A. Staphylococcus aureus rarely causes erysipelas and cellulitis, but when it does, such infections are usually more suppurative and less diffuse. Superficial, non-necrotizing infections caused by certain strains of Group A streptococcal (GAS) may be associated with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, characterized by rapid progression of septic shock and organ failure.

As previously discussed, the recent dramatic increase in community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) makes the empiric treatment of staphylococcal infections troubling. Diagnostic studies have a low yield in patients with superficial soft tissue infections and usually do not help with the diagnosis. However, establishing whether cellulitis represents signs of a deeper and/or more severe infectious process can be difficult but is of considerable importance, as the majority of necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) are originally diagnosed as cellulitis. Lack of clinical response could be due to unusual organisms, resistant strains of staphylococcus or streptococcus, or deeper processes.

### Frontal osteomyelitis presenting as chronic preseptal abscess: an unusual scenario [^111krVRZ]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Low credibility.

Preseptal cellulitis is characterized by local inflammation anterior to the orbital septum. This case is being reported to highlight a rare cause of a chronic form of preseptal inflammation: frontal osteomyelitis. The patient initially presented with a chronic left upper lid swelling preceded by minor blunt trauma of four-month duration. The condition did not respond to medical treatment. Drainage of the swelling was performed, and pus was sent for culture and sensitivity, results of which were negative. It rapidly recollected following drainage. The patient had no nasal complaints or constitutional manifestations. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging diagnosed the extent of sinus involvement and frontal osteomyelitis. Clindamycin therapy was given for four weeks, following which the patient markedly improved.

### Prevention and treatment of recurrent cellulitis [^111e2hiG]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Recurrent cellulitis is a challenging clinical condition affecting up to 47% of patients after the first episode, especially those with predisposing risk factors. The purpose of this review is to describe the state of the art of literature evidence and highlight recent developments in its management.

- **Recent findings**: Recurrent cellulitis can occur after successful treatment of an initial bout of cellulitis. Conditions that commonly increase the risk of cellulitis include local and systemic modifiable and nonmodifiable factors. A rigorous approach to managing risk factors and treating acute infections is crucial, as the risk of recurrence rises with repeated episodes. Risk factors, if present, need to be targeted in association with antibiotic prophylaxis. Penicillin V is the preferred antibiotic for prevention, but other antibiotics and new drugs can be considered in cases of β-lactam allergy, intolerance, or failure.

Recurrent cellulitis is associated with both short-term and long-term morbidity, as well as significant healthcare costs. Management of underlying predisposing conditions is crucial to prevent recurrence, alongside the evaluation of pharmacological measures. However, specialized and multidisciplinary skills are needed. More efforts are required to prevent and treat this underestimated problem.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^114AhEfn]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the dermis and associated subcutaneous tissue, with 60% of cases affecting the lower limb. Erysipelas is a form of cellulitis that presents with more marked superficial inflammation. The diagnosis of cellulitis can be challenging, with 31% of patients who present with suspected lower‐limb cellulitis in the emergency department (ED) subsequently being given a diagnosis other than cellulitis. Routine biochemical and hematological blood tests and blood cultures are not specific for cellulitis. This results in avoidable hospital admissions and unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics. Definitive diagnostic criteria could potentially improve clinical care and also improve the validity of clinical research on cellulitis by ensuring appropriate case definition. However, there are currently no agreed diagnostic criteria for cellulitis.

Patients with cellulitis commonly present to primary care services or the ED. A recent U.K. cellulitis research priority setting partnership ranked questions on 'diagnostic criteria' as important for future cellulitis research. The aim of this systematic review was to identify and conduct a critical appraisal of the quality of studies that have developed or validated diagnostic criteria or tools for lower‐limb cellulitis.

We define diagnostic criteria or tools as the inclusion of a minimum of one variable that has been tested against at least one clinical feature. In this paper, 'cellulitis' refers to lower‐limb cellulitis only. Lower‐limb erysipelas is included as it is clinically indistinguishable.

### A rare case of microblading-induced preseptal cellulitis [^11418xQv]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Prompt evaluation and treatment of preseptal cellulitis are essential, as it may progress to orbital cellulitis with more life-threatening complications, including orbital abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and encephalomeningitis. This case highlights the potential risks associated with cosmetic tattooing practices, which are especially important to consider if improper sanitation and hygiene are present. It is important to seek immediate medical attention if periorbital erythema, swelling, or cutaneous eruptions, such as vesicles or pustules, develop. In addition, people with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at an increased risk for infections. However, there are currently no recommendations to administer prophylactic antimicrobial treatment before performing cosmetic tattooing on these individuals. Therefore, additional counseling regarding risks should be provided by the aesthetician or other cosmetic personnel before initiating any tattoo procedure.

### Inpatient preseptal cellulitis: Experience from a tertiary eye care centre [^117UwyvR]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to describe the causes of preseptal cellulitis (PSC) and the outcomes of treatment in patients admitted to a tertiary eye-care centre.

A 15-year review (January 1991 to December 2005) of inpatients with clinical signs and symptoms or radiological evidence suggestive of PSC was conducted. Patients with infection anterior to the orbital septum, characterized by the acute onset of eyelid oedema, tenderness, erythema, warmth, and chemosis, were included in the study.

Among the 104 patients (male:female 64:40) fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for PSC, acute dacryocystitis (ADC) was the most common predisposing cause in 32.6% of patients, followed by sinusitis/upper-respiratory infection (URI) in 28.8%, and trauma/recent surgery in 27.8% of patients. Fifty percent required surgical intervention, including dacryocystorhinostomy/probing/stenting in 74% and abscess/chalazion drainage in 28.8%. In 38.5% of the patients who had surgical intervention, microbiological investigations were carried out; cultures were positive in 90% of cases. The most common microorganisms recovered included Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species, followed by Haemophilus influenzae and Klebsiella pneumonia. Blood cultures were positive in two of the 34 patients from whom blood was drawn. Most patients responded to systemic antibiotics with the resolution of PSC. However, seven patients developed late complications, including subacute lid abscesses, eyelid necrosis, and cicatricial ectropion.

In conclusion, sinusitis/URI, ADC, and recent history of trauma/surgery were the most common causes of PSC in admitted patients.

### Early response in cellulitis: A prospective study of dynamics and predictors [^114FkQR8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Longer duration of symptoms before admission was among the factors related to early response. This association has, to our knowledge, not been previously demonstrated. Like the response seen after nonantibiotic treatment, this may be related to the natural course of the disease; many of those with longer duration may have passed the maximum intensity of infection and inflammation.

The impact of treatment choice on early response was demonstrated as early as the 1930s. However, recent clinical trials using early clinical response as the primary endpoint have not demonstrated significant differences between the drugs tested, apart from a difference in early response found in a study assessing this new outcome measure retrospectively. In our study, discordant treatment was infrequent due to the predominance of streptococcal etiology and rare resistance among these microbes. We found no correlation between discordant treatment and early nonresponse, but the effective sample size was small. However, antibiotic choice may be important beyond its relation to in vitro sensitivity. A recent retrospective study demonstrating an association between early clinical response and higher vancomycin trough concentration illustrates that drug-specific factors are also important for early response. The paucity of reports showing significant associations between initial treatment and early response underscores that, in cellulitis, discordant therapy or other pharmacological factors are not the major causes of early failure.

### Frontal osteomyelitis presenting as chronic preseptal abscess: an unusual scenario [^11573kDL]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Low credibility.

Preseptal cellulitis is defined as inflammation anterior to the orbital septum. It is typically acute, more common in the pediatric age group, and has various etiologies, such as insect bites, trauma, and spread from sinusitis. Untreated, it may progress to orbital cellulitis, which can compromise vision through optic nerve affection, cavernous sinus thrombosis, corneal exposure, and ophthalmoplegia. We present a rare case of chronic preseptal cellulitis (abscess) secondary to chronic frontal osteomyelitis. Our purpose is to shed light on this rare cause of preseptal inflammation, avoiding delayed diagnosis and dreadful complications.

### Non-surgical interventions for acute internal hordeolum [^112A1PJV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

A hordeolum is a common, painful inflammation of the eyelid margin that is usually caused by a bacterial infection. The infection affects the oil glands of the eyelid and can be either internal or external. In many cases, the lesion drains spontaneously and resolves without treatment; however, the inflammation can spread to other ocular glands or tissues, and recurrences are common. If unresolved, an acute internal hordeolum can become chronic or develop into a chalazion. External hordeola, also known as styes, were not included in the scope of this review.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness, and when possible, the safety, of non-surgical treatments for acute internal hordeola compared with observation or placebo.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register (Issue 12, 2016), MEDLINE Ovid, MEDLINE Ovid Epub Ahead of Print, MEDLINE Ovid In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE(R) Ovid Daily (January 1946 to December 2016), Embase (January 1947 to December 2016), PubMed (1948 to December 2016), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS, January 1982 to December 2016), and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT; www.controlled-trials.com, last searched 26 July 2012).

Cosmetic tattooing has gained popularity over the past several decades. Microblading is a method of semipermanent eyebrow tattooing that has become mainstream in recent years. With this technique, individuals are provided with eyebrow pigment that lasts longer and is more convenient than the traditional eyebrow pencil. Other forms of semipermanent makeup include lip blush, eyebrow tattoos, eyeliner tattoos, freckle tattoos, and scar camouflage. Infection is a rare but major complication of cosmetic tattooing that is rarely documented in the literature. Here, we report a case of preseptal cellulitis secondary to microblading in a middle-aged woman with sickle cell disease (SCD).

- **Methods**: This retrospective quasiexperimental study included patients between 2 months and 17 years old admitted for preseptal cellulitis from January 2013 to December 2023. The preseptal cellulitis CPG was implemented in December 2020 using a multifaceted strategy that involved buy-in from key stakeholders, education of frontline providers, the official CPG launch, and stakeholder check-ins. The primary outcome was the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, including dual/triple therapy and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) active antibiotics. The secondary outcome was resource utilization, including blood testing and imaging. Outcomes were compared pre- and post-CPG implementation using the Fisher exact test and logistic regressions.

- **Results**: Of 236 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 175 and 61 patients composed the pre- and post-CPG cohorts, respectively. The median age (interquartile range) was 4.0 (1.8–8.3) years, and 46% of the population were female. Post-CPG implementation changes in empirical antibiotic use included decreases in broad-spectrum use from 100% to 66% (P < .001), dual/triple therapy from 47% to 16% (P < .001), and MRSA active agents from 86% to 26% (P < .001). There was a decrease in complete blood count and blood culture orders from 75% to 57% (P = 0.014) and 32% to 18% (P = 0.047), respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, including dual/triple therapy and MRSA active agents, significantly decreased following CPG implementation, as did resource utilization.

### Interventions for acute internal hordeolum [^11238Lfh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Hordeolum is a common, painful inflammation of the eyelid margin that is usually caused by bacterial infection. The infection affects the oil glands of the eyelid and can be internal or external. In many cases, the lesion drains spontaneously and resolves untreated; however, the inflammation can spread to other ocular glands or tissues, and recurrences are common. If unresolved, acute internal hordeolum can become chronic or develop into a chalazion. External hordeola, also known as styes, were not included in the scope of this review.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of nonsurgical treatments for acute internal hordeolum compared with observation or placebo.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1950 to July 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2012), and Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to July 2012). We also searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 26 July 2012.

- **Selection criteria**: The selection criteria for this review included randomized or quasi-randomized trials.

### Ambulatory intravenous antibiotic therapy for children with preseptal cellulitis [^117KqU2Z]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

This study aimed to compare the use of outpatient ambulatory care versus admission for intravenous antibiotics in managing preseptal cellulitis.

- **Methods**: This is a retrospective consecutive cohort study of children younger than 16 years presenting to an inner London pediatric emergency department with signs and symptoms of preseptal cellulitis.

- **Results**: A total of 94 cases were identified during a 17-month period. Of them, 30 children were prescribed oral antibiotics, and one child did not receive treatment. Of the 63 children prescribed intravenous antibiotics, 42 were managed on an ambulatory basis and 21 were admitted. There was no significant difference in the duration of treatment in days between those on ambulatory management and those admitted (2.79 ± 0.8 vs 2.76 ± 1.9, P = 0.94) or in the rate of complications. The net cost saving was $205,924 (£131,065; €147,578) overall, equating to $4900 (£3120; €3513) per patient.

- **Conclusions**: Ambulatory intravenous antibiotics with daily review are a safe and cost-effective alternative to inpatient admission in simple preseptal cellulitis for children in our population who require parenteral antibiotics.

### Early response in cellulitis: A prospective study of dynamics and predictors [^116Nd4xN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Two hundred sixteen patients were included in the study. Clinical characteristics and bacterial etiology have been published elsewhere. In brief, the median age was 54.5 years (range, 18–94 years), and 57% had lower extremity infections. Of 203 patients evaluable for assessment of BHS etiology, 72% had confirmed BHS, and an additional 13% had probable BHS infection. No cases with methicillin-resistant S. aureus were detected.

### Early response in cellulitis: A prospective study of dynamics and predictors [^115fP7Gu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

In this prospective study of cellulitis, several nonpharmacological factors were associated with a lack of early response. Such early nonresponse was rarely related to inappropriate therapy but was strongly predictive of early treatment escalation, suggesting that broadening antibiotic treatment often may be premature.

### Penicillin to prevent recurrent leg cellulitis [^116RhZnV]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). High credibility.

The PATCH-I study was published by Thomas KS and colleagues in 2013 in the journal The New England Journal of Medicine. This study addresses the recurrence of cellulitis. The trial question in this multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) was: What is the role of low-dose penicillin in patients with recurrent cellulitis?

- **Population**: 274 patients, including 165 females and 109 males.
- **Inclusion criteria**: Patients with ≥ 2 episodes of cellulitis of the leg.
- **Exclusion criteria**: Use of antibiotics for cellulitis prevention in the previous 6 months; allergy to penicillin; previous leg ulceration, surgery, or penetrating trauma; age under 16 years.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Penicillin group**: n = 136, 250 mg BID for 12 months
	- **Placebo group**: n = 138, matching placebo BID for 12 months.

- **Primary outcome**: Significant decrease in first cellulitis recurrence during the prophylaxis phase (22% vs. 37%; HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.86).
- **Secondary outcomes**: No significant difference in first cellulitis recurrence during the no-intervention follow-up period (27% vs. 27%; HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.93).
- **Safety outcomes**: No significant differences in adverse events (37 vs. 48, p = 0.50).

The conclusion was that in patients with ≥ 2 episodes of cellulitis of the leg, penicillin was superior to placebo with respect to first cellulitis recurrence during the prophylaxis phase.

### Outcomes of early dermatology consultation for inpatients diagnosed with cellulitis [^112bQrDj]. JAMA Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Many inflammatory skin dermatoses mimic cellulitis (pseudocellulitis) and are treated with antibiotics and/or hospitalization, leading to unnecessary patient morbidity and substantial health care spending. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of early dermatology consultation on clinical and economic outcomes associated with misdiagnosed cellulitis.

This prospective cohort study enrolled patients with a presumed diagnosis of cellulitis in the emergency department, the emergency department observation unit, or within 24 hours of admission to an inpatient unit of a large urban teaching hospital between February and September 2017. Patients were provided with telephone and clinic follow-up during the 30-day post-discharge period. We screened 165 patients with the primary concern of cellulitis. Of these, we excluded 44 who required antibiotics for cutaneous, soft-tissue, and deeper-tissue and/or bone infections irrespective of cellulitis status, and 5 who were scheduled to be discharged by the emergency department.

- **Interventions**: Early dermatology consultation for presumed cellulitis.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Primary outcomes were patient disposition and rates of antibiotic use.

Of 116 patients (63 [54.3%] women; 91 [78.4%] non-Hispanic white; mean [SD] age, 58.4 [19.1] years), 39 (33.6%) were diagnosed with pseudocellulitis by dermatologists. Of these, 34 (87.2%) had started using antibiotics for presumed cellulitis as prescribed by the primary team at the time of enrollment.

### Diagnosis and management of cellulitis and abscess in the emergency department setting: An evidence-based review [^11689GoD]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Cellulitis and abscess are common reasons for presentation to the emergency department, although there are several nuances to the care of these patients.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this narrative review article was to provide a summary of the background, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of cellulitis and abscesses with a focus on emergency clinicians.

- **Discussion**: The most common bacteria causing cellulitis are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and other β-hemolytic streptococci, while methicillin-resistant S. aureus is most common in abscesses. The history and physical examination are helpful in differentiating cellulitis and abscess in many cases, and point-of-care ultrasound can be a useful tool in unclear cases. Treatment for cellulitis typically involves a penicillin or cephalosporin, and treatment of abscesses is incision and drainage. Loop drainage is preferred over the traditional incision and drainage technique, and adjunctive antibiotics can be considered. Most patients can be managed as outpatients.

- **Conclusions**: It is essential for emergency physicians to be aware of the evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of patients with cellulitis and abscess.

### Preseptal and orbital cellulitis: Analysis of clinical, laboratory and imaging findings of 123 pediatric cases from Turkey [^113KXkHu]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Low credibility.

We aimed to compare the clinical and laboratory characteristics, as well as imaging methods, of patients diagnosed with preseptal cellulitis and orbital cellulitis in the pediatric age group.

- **Methods**: The study was designed retrospectively, with a review of medical records for all patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of preseptal or orbital cellulitis. The findings from each group were compared, and risk factors for orbital involvement were analyzed.

- **Results**: A total of 123 patients were included, with 90.2% having preseptal cellulitis and 9.8% having orbital cellulitis. The male gender ratio was 60.2%, and the mean age was 72 ± 43 months. All patients experienced eyelid swelling and redness, but only 20.3% had a fever. Ocular involvement was present in 51.2% of right eyes and 4.9% of both eyes. The most common predisposing factor was rhinosinusitis (56.1%). Radiologic imaging, including computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging, was performed in 83.7% of the patients. A subperiosteal abscess was detected in 7 cases (5.6%), with three managed surgically and four treated medically. Levels of C-reactive protein were significantly higher in patients with orbital involvement (P = 0.033), but there was no difference noted in the presence of fever or in leukocyte and platelet values.

- **Conclusions**: Rhinosinusitis was the most common predisposing factor for developing preseptal cellulitis and orbital cellulitis. Orbital involvement was present in 9.8% of the patients. Elevated C-reactive protein levels were associated with orbital involvement.

### Orbital bone infarction masquerading as preseptal cellulitis in a child with sickle beta-thalassaemia [^115znDQE]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Although several ophthalmic manifestations of sickle cell disease (SCD) are common, orbital bone infarction is rare. Orbital bones have less bone marrow, making them an unlikely place to develop infarction. However, when a patient with SCD presents with periorbital swelling, imaging should be performed to rule out bone infarction. We present a case of a child with sickle beta-thalassaemia who was initially misdiagnosed with preseptal cellulitis in the right eye. Upon later review of the imaging, subtle signs of bone infarction were observed, leading to the discovery of orbital bone infarction.

### Prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of cellulitis (erysipelas) of the leg: Results of the UK Dermatology Clinical Trials Network's PATCH II trial [^114FmLXa]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Data collection was achieved through routine telephone follow-up calls from the coordinating center, conducted every 3 months during the treatment phase and every 6 months during the follow-up phase. Participants were asked to complete a study diary to record adverse events and health service resource use. If participants experienced a repeat episode of cellulitis, they were instructed to inform the trial staff immediately. Any unreported repeat episodes were identified during regular telephone interviews.

Health service resource use was captured using diaries and included inpatient admissions, outpatient visits, GP consultations, other prescribed drugs for cellulitis, and time away from normal daily activities.

The primary outcome measure for the trial was the time to the next episode of cellulitis. The next confirmed episode was defined as the subsequent occurrence of cellulitis (in either leg) that had been reported by the participant and confirmed by a medical practitioner. The episode was considered to have started on the first day of symptoms reported by the participant. Episodes that were reported by participants and resulted in antibiotic treatment, but were not confirmed by a medical professional, were documented as self-reported cases and included in sensitivity analysis.

- **Secondary outcome measures**:
	1. The proportion of participants with repeat episodes of cellulitis at the end of the treatment phase, and at the end of the non-intervention follow-up phase.
	2. The number of repeat episodes of cellulitis.
	3. The proportion of participants with new oedema and/or ulceration.

### Frontal osteomyelitis presenting as chronic preseptal abscess: An unusual scenario [^115mANDo]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Low credibility.

Preseptal cellulitis is characterized by local inflammation anterior to the orbital septum. This case is being reported to highlight a rare cause of a chronic form of preseptal inflammation: frontal osteomyelitis. The patient initially presented with a chronic left upper lid swelling, preceded by minor blunt trauma of four-month duration. The condition did not respond to medical treatment. Drainage of the swelling was performed, and pus was sent for culture and sensitivity, the results of which were negative. The swelling rapidly recollected following drainage. The patient had no nasal complaints or constitutional manifestations. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging diagnosed the extent of sinus involvement and frontal osteomyelitis. Clindamycin therapy was administered for four weeks, following which the patient markedly improved.
