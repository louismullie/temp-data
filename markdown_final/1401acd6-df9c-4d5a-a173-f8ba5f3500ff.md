## Question

A football player sued a football team for breach of contract. He was a star player for the team before suffering a serious hip injury. Although the player attempted to continue playing for the team, he failed a physical examination and was cut from the team roster. After failing his physical, the team discontinued making contract payments to the player as per the terms of his employment contract. In his lawsuit, the player claimed that he was physically fit to continue playing but that he was cut from the team because they wanted to stop making contract payments. At trial, the team called its physician, an orthopedist, to testify that the player's hip injury was, in fact, career-threatening and, in his opinion, sufficiently serious to warrant failing his physical. The team physician stated during his testimony that his diagnosis was based, in part, upon an examination of the player's x-rays and review of an MRI test conducted by another doctor. Neither the x-rays nor the MRI test results have been admitted into evidence. In all likelihood, the team physician's testimony should be

Answer Choices:
A. admissible, provided that the other doctor testifies as to the validity of the MRI test results.
B. admissible, provided the team physician based his opinion on data reasonably relied upon by other orthopedic physicians in the field.
C. inadmissible, because neither the x-rays nor the MRI test results had been admitted into evidence at the time he formulated his opinion.
D. inadmissible, because the team physician's opinion was not based in part upon his own firsthand observation of the player's physical condition.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the team physician's expert testimony about the player's hip injury — based in part on x-rays and an MRI that were not admitted into evidence — is admissible, and under what conditions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the legal standard for expert testimony admissibility, especially the Daubert/Frye framework and the "reasonably relied upon" exception for facts or data. Then, I should verify whether an expert can base an opinion on records not formally admitted, and whether that requires the records themselves to be admitted. Next, I will examine the specific facts here: the orthopedist's reliance on imaging and another physician's MRI, and whether that fits the exception. Finally, I will weigh each answer choice against the legal standard and choose the best option, noting any caveats about foundation and cross-examination.

> Let me first confirm the governing legal standard. Under Daubert, the trial judge acts as a gatekeeper to ensure expert testimony is both relevant and reliable, focusing on the reasoning and methodology rather than the conclusion, and appellate review is for abuse of discretion. Many jurisdictions also apply a "reasonably relied upon" exception allowing experts to base opinions on facts or data that are not themselves admitted, provided the data are of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the field [^b949db01].

> Wait, let me verify the nuance about the underlying data. I initially thought the x-rays and MRI absolutely had to be admitted for the opinion to be admissible, but hold on, that's too rigid. The "reasonably relied upon" exception permits an expert to rely on medical records, including imaging, even if those records are not formally admitted, as long as the reliance is consistent with accepted medical practice and the expert can be cross-examined about the basis of the opinion. So, non-admission of the films themselves does not automatically render the testimony inadmissible [^b949db01].

> I need to check whether orthopedic physicians reasonably rely on imaging and reports from other physicians when forming opinions. Yes, standard practice includes reviewing imaging and reports from radiologists or other clinicians to inform diagnosis and prognosis; this is precisely the kind of data orthopedists routinely rely upon in clinical decision-making and expert opinions, which supports admissibility under the exception [^bc5ac56c] [^37e07e9a].

> Now, I will examine the specific facts. The team physician personally examined the player, reviewed x-rays, and considered an MRI interpreted by another doctor. His opinion is therefore based on a combination of firsthand clinical assessment and imaging data that experts in the field reasonably rely upon, even if the films themselves are not in evidence. This fits the "reasonably relied upon" exception and should be admissible, subject to cross-examination about the basis and weight of the imaging [^b949db01].

> Let me consider each answer choice carefully. Option A suggests admissibility only if the other doctor testifies to validate the MRI; but wait, that imposes a foundation requirement that is not legally required for expert reliance under the exception, so A is too restrictive and incorrect. Option B aligns with the "reasonably relied upon" standard and is the best answer. Option C claims inadmissibility because the imaging was not admitted; hold on, I should double-check — this ignores the exception and is therefore incorrect. Option D argues inadmissibility because the opinion wasn't based on firsthand observation; hmm, wait a minute, the physician did examine the player, so that premise is false, making D incorrect [^b949db01].

> Final answer: B. The team physician's testimony is admissible provided his opinion is based on data reasonably relied upon by other orthopedic physicians in the field, which includes reviewing imaging and reports from other clinicians, even if the films themselves are not admitted into evidence. Admissibility is subject to cross-examination about the basis and reliability of the relied-upon materials [^b949db01].

---

The correct answer is **B. admissible, provided the team physician based his opinion on data reasonably relied upon by other orthopedic physicians in the field**. Under FRE 703, an expert may base an opinion on facts or data not admitted into evidence if those facts or data are **reasonably relied upon** by experts in the field. The physician's reliance on x-rays and MRI reports is standard in orthopedic practice, and the lack of admission of the images themselves does not make the testimony inadmissible. Options A, C, and D are incorrect because they misstate evidentiary requirements or the basis of expert testimony.

---

## Legal standard for expert testimony admissibility

Federal Rule of Evidence 703 governs the admissibility of expert testimony based on facts or data not admitted into evidence. It states that an expert may base an opinion on facts or data not admitted if experts in the particular field **reasonably rely** on such facts or data in forming opinions. This rule recognizes that experts often rely on data such as medical records, test results, and reports generated by others in their field.

---

## Application to the present case

In this case, the team physician, an orthopedic specialist, testified that the player's hip injury was career-threatening based on his examination, review of x-rays, and an MRI report prepared by another physician. The key question is whether the physician's reliance on these sources meets the **reasonably relied upon** standard under FRE 703.

---

## Reasonable reliance in orthopedic practice

Orthopedic physicians routinely rely on imaging studies, including x-rays and MRI scans, as well as reports from radiologists and other physicians, to diagnose and assess musculoskeletal injuries. This practice is well-established and widely accepted within the medical community. Therefore, the team physician's reliance on the x-rays and MRI report falls squarely within the scope of **reasonable reliance** under FRE 703.

---

## Admissibility despite non-admission of evidence

The fact that the x-rays and MRI results were not formally admitted into evidence does not render the physician's testimony inadmissible. FRE 703 explicitly allows experts to base their opinions on facts or data not admitted into evidence, provided that such reliance is **reasonable** within the expert's field. The physician's testimony is admissible as long as he can demonstrate that his reliance on the imaging studies and reports is consistent with standard orthopedic practice.

---

## Potential challenges and cross-examination

While the testimony is admissible, the opposing party may challenge the weight and credibility of the expert's opinion through cross-examination. They may question the physician's interpretation of the imaging studies, the accuracy of the MRI report, or the physician's qualifications. However, these challenges go to the **weight of the evidence**, not its admissibility.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The team physician's testimony is **admissible** under FRE 703, provided that his opinion is based on data reasonably relied upon by other orthopedic physicians in the field. The non-admission of the x-rays and MRI results does not preclude the admissibility of the expert testimony. Therefore, the correct answer is **B**.

### Promoting ethical and objective practice in the medicolegal arena of disability evaluation [^9278d848]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

As providers of medical information and testimony, clinicians have ultimate responsibility for ethical conduct as it relates to this information. The authors offer the following recommendations for enhancing ethical relationships between expert clinicians and the courts. 1. Avoid or resist attorney efforts at enticement into joining the attorney-client team. Such compromises of scientific boundaries and ethical principles exist on a continuum ranging from standard attorney-client advocacy at the beginning of the expert consultation phase (e.g., promotional information at the forefront of retaining an expert, with either provision of selective or incomplete records or less than enthusiastic efforts to produce all records) and extending to completion of evaluation, when requests for changes in reports and documentation might be made. 2. Respect role boundaries and do not mix conflicting roles. Remember that the treating doctor possesses a bond with the patient but does not as a rule obtain complete preinjury and postinjury information in the context of assessing causality and apportionment. In contrast, the expert witness must conduct a thorough and multifaceted case analysis sans the physician-patient relationship in order to facilitate objectivity and allow optimum diagnostic formulations. Finally, the trial consultant's function in this adversarial process is to assist with critically scrutinizing and attacking positions of experts for the opposing side. These roles all represent inherently different interests, and mixing them can only reduce objectivity. 3. Insist on adequate time for thorough record review, evaluation, and report generation. Also insist on sufficient time and preparation for deposition and court appearances. 4. Work at building a reputation for general objectivity, reliance on multiple data sources, reaching opinions only after reviewing complete information from both sides, and completing the evaluation. 5. Spend a good amount of time actually treating the patient population being examined or being offered testimony about. This treatment should be current and should be of a similar frequency to treating practitioner specialists. Be able to discuss relevant research and scientific methodology issues competently and without notes. 6. Arrive at opinions only after reviewing all of the evidence from both sides of the adversarial fence, employing multiple data sources, completing the evaluation, and interpreting data within the full context of comprehensive historical, behavioral observation, and contextual information. Being otherwise favorable to retaining attorney interests suggests endorsement of "opinion prostitute", "scientific perjurer", or "hired gun" status. The only way a practitioner can reduce the likelihood of facing an "opinion prostitute" on the opposing side in future cases is to insist on establishing and maintaining a reputation for scientific objectivity. 7. Balance cases from plaintiff and defense attorneys. Predilection for one side or the other suggests bias and sets up predisposition to nonobjectivity. For example, a preponderance of plaintiff work suggests an overdiagnosis or uncritical sympathy bias, whereas a ratio that favors hiring by the defense suggests an underdiagnosis or skepticism bias. Perhaps Brodsky's suggested cut-off ratio of .8 for favorability findings would represent an initial cutoff for defense versus plaintiff ratio. That is, experts should do at least 20% work for the opposite side of the current case being represented. Further, it might be a reasonable expectation that data on these ratios be collected as an important method for ensuring objective opinions. 8. Ensure against excessive favorability to the side of the retaining attorney or firm. Objectivity demands that scientific opinions not be influenced by the position of the legal advocate. Importantly, Brodsky recommends using a ratio of .8 as a cut-off for detecting excessive bias. That is, practitioners should possess prerequisite objectivity to disagree with the referring attorney at least 20% of the time. We suggest that a more useful cut-off would be .75, where experts are expected to generate findings that do not support the referring attorney's position at least 25% of the time. 9. Never arrive at opinions that are inconsistent with plaintiff records, examination data, test data, behavioral presentation, and so forth, especially when such opinions are favorable to the side of the retaining attorney firm. Instead, use the following recommendations. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)

### Epidemiology in the courtroom: an evidence-based paradigm for the determination of causation in compensation environments [^1d9eba19]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Identify an evidence-based paradigm for the determination of causation of occupational injury and illness litigation.

Methods

The Westlaw and LexisNexis databases were used to identify legal principles governing the admissibility of scientific evidence in legal proceedings. The Medline database was referenced to identify evidence-based methods for the determination of causation complying with legal precepts for the admissibility of scientific testimony.

Results

Expert witness testimony must be relevant and reliable. Testimony must be sufficiently based on reliable facts and data. Testimony must be the product of reliable principles or methods. The witness must have reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.

Conclusions

Conscientious application of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Guide for the Determination of Work-Relatedness of Disease, as adapted, comforts with legal prerequisites for the admissibility of scientific evidence in medicolegal proceedings.

### Imaging from an orthopaedic point of view. what the orthopaedic surgeon expects from the radiologist? [^bc5ac56c]. European Journal of Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

The paradigm of coping with sometimes gross pathology, while having some small and at first sight insignificant lesions demands for accurate radiological detection and orthopaedic treatment makes it interesting and challenging to be involved in the treatment of professional athletes. In the diagnostic process we differentiate between acute, posttraumatic and overuse injuries. We must realize the importance of reproducible routine X-rays as a first step in the diagnostic process. In case of additional diagnostics, appropriate consultation between the orthopaedic surgeon and the radiologist is essential in order to determine the best strategy.

### Expert witness participation in civil and criminal proceedings [^b949db01]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Legal and ethical standards of testimony — Under Daubert, the judge is tasked as the gatekeeper for determining whether expert testimony is both relevant and reliable, and the Daubert court offered 4 guidelines a judge may, but need not, use in assessing the reliability of testimony: whether the expert's theory or technique can be (or has been) tested (aka, "falsifiability"); whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review or publication; the known or potential error rate of the theory; and whether there is general acceptance in the relevant scientific community. Although Daubert has superseded Frye in most jurisdictions, some jurisdictions still use the Frye standard, and under the Daubert standard, trial judges are to focus on the reasoning or scientific validity of the methodology, not the conclusion generated. The importance of standards is underscored by the fact that appellate courts can only consider an "abuse-of-discretion" standard in reviewing a trial judge's decision to admit or exclude expert testimony (ie, defers to the trial judge's rulings unless overtly erroneous). Attorneys may request experts to state that their testimony is being given "within a reasonable degree of medical certainty", but this rubric is not universally defined and has been interpreted differently by different courts and also is not a standard required in all jurisdictions; expert witnesses are not advocates for the side that retains them but rather are advocates for their unbiased opinion, which is derived from facts and evidence-based medicine.

### Effectiveness of an on-field rehabilitation framework for return to sports in injured male professional football players: a single-blinded, prospective, randomised controlled trial [^9c3e80e2]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Using the On FI.RE. framework ensures that a proper exercise-based rehabilitation protocol improves therapeutic outcomes for avoiding subsequent injuries. At this point, it has been mentioned the importance of a secondary prevention programme in avoiding subsequent injuries. To reduce bias, both groups followed the same prevention protocols for each type of injury (online supplemental table 2) for 8 weeks after returning to participation in team training.

Study strengths

This is the first randomised controlled trial to be conducted for OFR. Another strength is that injury diagnosis and RTT were controlled by a single physician (AK) based on evidence-based clinical examination and additional diagnostic imaging. Clinical examination of the players relied on literature references. The physician was not involved in the intervention application and outcome assessment. Moreover, one senior physiotherapist per group applied the off-field and OFR rehabilitation from the first day of rehabilitation until the day that the players returned to participation in team training. Additionally, during the rehabilitation procedure, the same senior physiotherapist supervised the execution of all therapeutic exercises. Moreover, it is important to note that all participants in the study were blinded regarding which of the two intervention protocols they were assigned to follow.

### How Do we assess controversies using evidence-based radiology? [^3e5e68c5]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

At its best, the practice of medicine involves careful integration of experience and evidence. Generating evidence to address controversies in radiology - and translating such evidence to practice - requires appropriate selection of methods, and an understanding of the strengths, shortcomings, and biases inherent to different research designs and analyses. Equipped with such knowledge, the radiologic community can ensure that both research and clinical practice in our discipline excels, and that those questions that will be the most critical to answer will be formulated for successful investigation in the years to come.

### Injury risk factors, screening tests and preventative strategies: a systematic review of the evidence that underpins the perceptions and practices of 44 football (soccer) teams from various premier leagues [^277ccfb3]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Graded recommendation

Following the assignment of a level of evidence, a graded recommendation for each of the top 3 screening tests and preventative exercises was given following the SIGN guidelines. Graded recommendations involved assessment of the body of evidence (ie, all of the articles in that area) and their respective levels of evidence in conjunction with a considered subjective judgement by professionals. Graded recommendations were considered as A: Strong recommendation, B: Moderate recommendation, C: Weak recommendation or D: Insufficient evidence to make a specific recommendation. A graded recommendation was not assigned for the top 3 risk factors, as risk factors cannot be recommended. Instead, an 'overall' level of evidence was assigned for these. The considered judgement and graded recommendation/overall level of evidence were assigned during a round table of four researchers, all of whom were qualified with a PhD (2× sport scientists and 2× sports medicine doctors currently working in professional premier league football clubs).

### Imaging choices in occult hip fracture [^68a954ff]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Hip fracture is a common injury, with an incidence rate of > 250,000 per year in the United States. Diagnosis is particularly important due to the high dependence on the integrity of the hip in the daily life of most people.

Objectives

In this article we review the literature focused on hip fracture detection and discuss advantages and limitations of each major imaging modality.

Discussion

Plain radiographs are usually sufficient for diagnosis as they are at least 90% sensitive for hip fracture. However, in the 3–4% of Emergency Department (ED) patients having hip X-ray studies who harbor an occult hip fracture, the Emergency Physician must choose among several methods, each with intrinsic limitations, for further evaluation. These methods include computed tomography, scintigraphy, and magnetic resonance imaging.

Conclusion

We present an evidence-based algorithm for the evaluation of a patient suspected to have an occult hip fracture in the ED. Also outlined are future directions for research to distinguish more effective techniques for identifying occult hip fractures.

### Perspectives on neuroradiology medical expert testimony: fact and fiction [^c48335a7]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2018). Low credibility.

There are numerous misconceptions about serving as a medical malpractice expert witness. By maintaining an objective perspective based in the unbiased interpretation of the images provided (for both sides of the conflict), one can best serve society as a whole. Most cases for which a neuroradiology expert is recruited are the following: 1) not with the radiologist as a defendant, 2) resolved without court testimony, and 3) short-lived if frivolous. One can learn much about medicine, our nonradiology colleagues, and the litigation process by participating as an expert witness.

### Football-specific extension of the IOC consensus statement: methods for recording and reporting of epidemiological data on injury and illness in sport 2020 [^35703d0a]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Several sports have published consensus statements on methods and reporting of epidemiological studies concerning injuries and illnesses with football (soccer) producing one of the first guidelines. This football-specific consensus statement was published in 2006 and required an update to align with scientific developments in the field. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) recently released a sports-generic consensus statement outlining methods for recording and reporting epidemiological data on injury and illness in sport and encouraged the development of sport-specific extensions. The Fédération Internationale de Football Association Medical Scientific Advisory Board established a panel of 16 football medicine and/or science experts, two players and one coach. With a foundation in the IOC consensus statement, the panel performed literature reviews on each included subtopic and performed two rounds of voting prior to and during a 2-day consensus meeting. The panel agreed on 40 of 75 pre-meeting and 21 of 44 meeting voting statements, respectively. The methodology and definitions presented in this comprehensive football-specific extension should ensure more consistent study designs, data collection procedures and use of nomenclature in future epidemiological studies of football injuries and illnesses regardless of setting. It should facilitate comparisons across studies and pooling of data.

### Selection / interview criteria for drafting players [^fb98a854]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

One important element for forming and cultivating a high performing team in any sport is player selection. For most professional sports, this is an intense period whereby coaching, performance, and administrative staff must work together and use collective wisdom to identify players who have the best probability of consistent high performance. The stakes of a draft are high: the wrong choice can be incredibly costly and impact a team's performance and culture for many years. This article identifies and details common features of the drafting procedure, followed by a discussion of best practices for structuring and executing a draft protocol.

### Evaluation and referral for developmental dysplasia of the hip in infants [^931f6720]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

World Health Organization screening criteria and their application to developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) are outlined. The page lists "TABLE 1 World Health Organization Criteria for Screening for Health Problems", including items 1–5 ("1. The condition should be an important health problem" through "5. There should be a suitable test or examination for the condition") and items 6–10 ("6. The test should be acceptable to the population" through "10. Case finding should be a continuous process"). The narrative states, "The AAP believes DDH fulfills most of these screening criteria (Table 1), except for an understanding of the natural history of hip dysplasia and an agreed-on policy of whom to treat", and reiterates, "A reasonable goal for screening is to prevent the late presentation of DDH after 6 months of age".

### Developing a data-driven multimodal injury and illness prevention programme in male professional football based on a risk management model: the IP2 netWork [^c15272fb]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Table 1
The main focus areas for injury/illness prevention and performance, identified by medical staff and their priority scores from survey I

During the next workshop (2020), these focus areas and their priorities were further refined. For the workshop, each working group of 4–5 team medical and technical staff prepared 5 min presentations on the scientific evidence supporting their respective focus area. The attendees then engaged in small-group discussions to assess the relevance of each focus area when developing tailor-made risk management programmes for their team. Finally, survey II, which included a table detailing the 23 focus areas, was distributed to each team during the workshop. Teams were asked to select 5 of these 23 focus areas based on their importance for their team, ranking their priority on a scale from 5 to 1, with 5 indicating the highest priority and 1 the lowest (table 2).

Table 2
Final list of focus areas included in the Aspetar IP 2 (Injury and Illness Prevention for Performance) programme and their aggregate priority scores from survey II

Final programme development: the Aspetar IP 2 NetWork

To develop the final programme components, 23 working groups composed of medical and technical staff from the clubs, and supported by experienced sports physicians, scientists, nutritionists, psychologists, podiatrists, etc, crafted fact sheets for each focus area. These fact sheets summarised the current scientific evidence on each topic. The resulting 23 fact sheets were then sent to international experts for review and input. These experts were selected based on their research publications for their expertise within each field. This process culminated in the creation of the Aspetar multimodal injury and illness prevention programme for football, encapsulated in a booklet, the 'Aspetar IP 2 NetWork' (online supplemental material 1).

Patient and public involvement

No patients or members of the public were involved in the planning, design, data collection, analysis or interpretation of this study's results.

Equity, diversity and inclusion statement

The study focused exclusively on male professional players in Qatar, a diverse group from around the world, and involved their support staff, predominantly males recruited from North Africa, Asia and Europe.

Femoral neck stress fractures in children and adolescents — These injuries are not common but have been reported; if x-rays are negative, an MRI should be obtained for diagnosis, and tension-sided fractures should be referred to an orthopedist specialist and treated with strict nonweight-bearing and/or open reduction with internal fixation due to risks including nonunion, pathologic fracture, and avascular necrosis.

### Hamstring strain injury in athletes [^2013ee2c]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2022). High credibility.

Hamstring strain injury (HSI) imaging — imaging is typically not needed in those diagnosed with a grade I or II HSI based on clinical examination, whereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment is recommended in those with a suspected grade III HSI. The role of MRI in helping to determine the clinical course, including return to play (RTP) and risk of reinjuries, is unclear, and evidence suggests that the addition of MRI does not improve the prediction of RTP beyond clinical examination. With suspicion of a nonmusculoskeletal pain source, such as a thrombosis, imaging may be indicated, and although the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria do not specifically outline guidelines for those with an HSI, the criteria for chronic hip pain note that MRI and ultrasound (US) are "usually appropriate" in those with chronic symptoms and suspected extra-articular noninfectious soft tissue abnormalities. Therefore, MRI or US imaging can be useful in decision making in individuals with an atypical presentation of symptoms or who do not have satisfactory results with nonsurgical care, and radiographs are usually not required unless symptoms are proximal and radiographs may be useful to rule out avulsion fractures.

Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) screening and initial management — evidence strongly supports screening for and treatment of hip dislocation (positive Ortolani test result) and initially observing milder early forms of dysplasia and instability (positive Barlow test result); depending on local custom, either the pediatrician or the orthopedist can observe mild forms by periodic examination and possible follow-up imaging, but actual treatment should be performed by an orthopedist. A reasonable goal for the primary care physician should be to diagnose hip subluxation or dislocation by 6 months of age by using the periodic physical examination; selective ultrasonography or radiography may be used in consultation with a pediatric radiologist and/or orthopedist. No screening program has been shown to completely eliminate the risk of a late presentation of DDH, and there is no high-level evidence that milder forms of dysplasia can be prevented by screening and early treatment.

### Diagnosing hip microinstability: an international consensus study using the Delphi methodology [^772a640c]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

In the first-round experts ranked the randomly ordered diagnostic criteria as either: not important, minor factor, major factor or essential for making the diagnosis of hip microinstability. A 4-point scale was favoured as this has previously been shown to yield stable responses in previous Delphi studies. Criteria were assigned the most popular (modal) ranking. Experts were asked an open question for any other criteria to be included in this round. In the second-round experts were asked whether they agreed or disagreed with the modal ranking assigned to each criterion. There exists no clear guidance on the consensus cut offs that facilitators should use. A criterion's ranking was finalised if it received 50% or greater agreement from the expert panel. If a criterion's ranking received less than 50% agreement, it was re-ranked as the next most popular answer and submitted back to the experts for another vote. In the third-round experts were presented with the diagnostic criteria organised into a tabular format with rankings as row headings and subcategories as column headings. Experts were asked to state the minimum number of criteria patients must fulfil in each row, each column and in total. For example, an expert may respond "at least 3 criteria must be fulfilled in the Major factor row and at least 5 criteria in the Minor factor row, these criteria must be distributed such that there are at least 2 criteria in each of the Patient History, Examination and Imaging columns". Median numbers were calculated to avoid the averages being skewed by anomalous answers. In the fourth-round experts were shown the final diagnostic tool and asked whether they approved or disapproved it.

At the beginning of this study (during the first round) experts were invited to suggest amendments to the diagnostic criteria or suggest their own diagnostic criteria. This was done to reduce the effect that facilitator bias would have on the final outcome. New criteria were fed into the study to be ranked and finalised in the same manner as the original criteria. By necessity of their conception in the first round the new criteria subsequently lagged one round behind the original criteria as shown in Fig. 1.

### Imaging for whom: patient or physician? [^12a10639]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Radiologic imaging examinations are being ordered beyond the margin of medical necessity. Radiologists can assess the value of imaging in a variety of clinical situations by gathering data regarding test ordering patterns and their effects on patient outcomes.

Conclusion

Emerging information technologies have the potential to facilitate the collection of data and permit the dissemination of appropriate guidelines to limit the number of unnecessary and possibly harmful examinations.

### Best practices in the management of orthopaedic trauma [^f5c55795]. ACS (2015). Medium credibility.

Geriatric hip fracture — injury assessment, imaging, timing, anesthesia, and fracture categorization emphasize early suspicion and coordinated care: when a geriatric patient presents with severe hip pain, particularly following a fall, a hip fracture should be suspected, and a thorough history and physical examination should be performed with evaluation for concurrent injuries; early consultation with an inpatient medical or geriatric specialist may be beneficial, geriatric specialists or hospitalists may help streamline preoperative testing and serve as an effective liaison to the anesthesia team, and a well-coordinated and multidisciplinary approach is encouraged; diagnosis is typically evident on standard radiographic assessment, and when a hip fracture is suspected in the setting of normal radiographs, it is recommended that additional imaging (for example, MRI) be obtained to evaluate for the presence of a nondisplaced fracture; once diagnosed, patients are typically admitted, medically optimized, and should be surgically treated as soon as able, preferably within 48 hours; there is strong evidence that regional anesthesia improves perioperative management in patients with hip fracture and may reduce postoperative delirium and cardiac events; geriatric fractures of the proximal femur broadly fall into three categories: femoral neck fractures, intertrochanteric fractures, and subtrochanteric fractures.

### Turf wars in radiology: training in diagnostic imaging: how much is enough? [^af9fd6af]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Although many medical organizations have issued training standards for various types of diagnostic imaging, these standards tend to be arbitrary and may not adequately address the question of how much training is necessary or sufficient. In this article, the authors review the evidence pertaining to this question, which shows that acquiring expertise in imaging is a lifelong process and that there may never be such a thing as "enough" training. It is therefore likely that even though some nonradiologist physicians may meet the standards developed by some organizations, they will not have achieved the expertise that comes with long years of experience or subspecialty training in imaging. Payers and hospital credentials committees have a responsibility to patients to try to help reduce medical errors by ensuring that only those physicians who are best trained and most experienced are allowed to perform and interpret imaging studies.

### Expert witness participation in civil and criminal proceedings [^1396acb6]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Legal concepts and processes — medical malpractice and informed consent — Medical malpractice law is based on concepts drawn from tort and contract law and is commonly understood as liabilities arising from the delivery of medical care, with causes of action that can be based on negligence, insufficient informed consent, intentional misconduct, breach of a contract, defamation, divulgence of confidential information, or failure to prevent foreseeable injuries to third parties. Medical negligence is the predominant theory of liability in medical malpractice actions, and negligence is defined as "the failure to exercise the standard of care that a reasonably prudent person would have exercised in a similar situation". To establish negligence, the plaintiff must prove all of the following elements: the existence of the physician's duty to the plaintiff, usually based on the existence of the physician–patient relationship; the applicable standard of care and its violation (ie, breach of the duty); damages (a compensable injury); and a legal causal connection between the violation of the standard of care and the injury. In a medical malpractice case, experts may be asked to provide an opinion about one or all of these elements, and it is important not to testify about all of these elements if they are not within the pediatrician's area of expertise. Besides negligence, a medical malpractice lawsuit also may include an allegation of insufficient informed consent; informed consent includes a discussion with a noncoerced patient or parent who has decision-making capacity, and the discussion should include the benefits versus the risks of proposed and alternative tests or treatments and the option of no treatment. In some jurisdictions, an informed consent claim is a derivative of a negligence claim, whereas in other jurisdictions the lack of informed consent is a claim discrete from medical malpractice, and inadequate informed consent may be the basis of a civil tort even if the care provided by the physician was consistent with the standard of care. When insufficient informed consent is an aspect of the case, the expert needs to be familiar with the standards of informed consent in the particular state involved, and there are 2 main standards of providing informed consent: the "reasonable-patient" standard and the "reasonable-physician" standard.

The hip and its disorders represent a clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic challenge greater than any other joints. Clinical symptoms are usually non specific and provocative maneuvers are sometimes unreliable, pain might be referred even from other joints and many times accurate assessment need imaging techniques. New surgical options, especially the latest development of hip arthroscopy has open horizons for treating intraarticular disorders. In this review article we will review basic clinical assessment and what we need as orthopeadic surgeons from radiology.

### European society of emergency radiology: guideline on radiological polytrauma imaging and service (short version) [^d071d2c4]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Grade of recommendation (GoR)

Using the evidence levels according to the AWMF Guidance Manual one out of three possible Grades of Recommendation (GoR) was issued on each answer to a key question: A = 'should/ should not' with the meaning of 'certainly should/ should not'; B = 'ought/ ought not' with the meaning of 'probably/preferably should/should not'; 0 = 'may be considered' or 'consider'. The GoR was based on the evidence level of the included studies: evidence level 1 led to a recommendation level 'A' (strong recommendation), evidence level 2 led to a recommendation level 'B' (recommendation) and evidence levels 3, 4, 5 lead to a recommendation '0' (open recommendation). For statements from guidelines, the specific degree of recommendation was adopted from the guideline. Following the AWMF principle and in case the used scale allowed us to do so, the consensus conference was able to increase or decrease the GoR by one degree of recommendation.

Good clinical practice points (GPP)

If there was insufficient evidence in the literature included, the degree of recommendation — GPP (Good Clinical Practice Points, -p. 27) was used. In contrast to GoR, GPP is based purely on the consensus of the experts. The GPP degrees of recommendation are identical to those for GoR: 'A' = strong recommendation, 'B' = recommendation and '0′ = open recommendation. For differentiation purposes, the degree of recommendation was therefore marked with GPP instead of GoR.

Consensus development at the conferences

For each key issue, S.W. and J.H. proposed a statement with a corresponding level of recommendation (GoR or GPP) to the consensus conference. This served as a basis for the discussion during the consensus conference. If present in person, each member of the last and the current ESER Board (from 2017 until now) had exactly one equal vote. As the consensus conferences were during congress meetings, not all consensus members were able to present for the entire consensus conferences. According to our constitution, attendance by 2/3 of members was considered quorate for each vote on each statement. All members reviewed each statement during the publication process. The suggested statements and grades of recommendation as well as the corresponding literature were sent to the participants in advance by email.

### Legal and ethical implications in the evaluation and management of sports-related concussion [^41d1e711]. Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Conflicts of interest in sports-related concussion care — physician reimbursement should be solely derived from patient evaluation, management, and counseling activities, and physicians and other members of concussion management teams should disclose all financial arrangements that could influence patient care decisions to athletes and parents, including contractual relationships, involvement in diagnostic or protective equipment development, and paid sponsorships; physicians who could benefit financially should disclose these potential conflicts and must ensure their primary duty is to the health of the athletes. Physicians employed by athletic teams may face pressure to prematurely clear athletes to return to play, and it is of paramount importance to affirm that their primary responsibility is to protect patient health and well-being regardless of financial interests or employment considerations; failure to prioritize patient well-being represents a breach of ethical and professional conduct and could result in termination of AAN membership, which is reportable to the National Practitioner DataBank.

### Injury prevention strategies at the FIFA 2014 world cup: perceptions and practices of the physicians from the 32 participating national teams [^c02996f5]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Efficacy of and challenges to implementing injury prevention strategies

The majority (81%) of teams that suggested their overall preventative strategies were effective in reducing/limiting non-contact injuries also conceded that these could be improved. This finding is encouraging as it demonstrates that there is a belief among practitioners that there is scope for further significant reductions of non-contact injuries in top-level footballers competing in postseason international tournaments. The challenge now is to find the effective methods and strategies to help national teams to achieve this.

Obtaining compliance from the coaching staff was viewed as one of the main challenges rated by physicians to prevent injuries. While 31% of teams reported perfect compliance from their coaches, there appears to remain room for improving compliance and in turn, further reducing/limiting non-contact injuries. Investigations into coach compliance is a relatively new area of research; however, it appears essential that future studies focus efforts on how to maximise coach integration into the injury prevention programme if such strategies are to be optimised. One suggestion has been to 'capture the attention of coaches' by transforming medical statistics into a meaningful context for the coaches; for example, give them specific instances of the negative effect of injury on team selection, performance and results. It would be interesting, therefore, to determine what 'details' are important to coaches and how these can be implemented in practice to improve coaches' acceptance of individual injury risk recommendations.

Further, nine specific categories pertaining to 'challenges faced' (table 4) in preventing injuries were highlighted in addition to the six areas where practitioners suggest further research (table 5) is necessary to provide meaningful solutions in the practical setting. One overwhelmingly consistent response pertained to the need for research on top-level players. This is qualitatively evidenced by one statement that suggested; "as long as clubs (top level) do not provide access to scientific studies, we will remain in this unsatisfactory status", that is, where there is little information on preventing injuries at the top level.

A limitation to be recognised is the retrospective nature of the present survey (ie, physicians were surveyed 5 months after the World Cup), and it is acknowledged that such a study design could increase the risk of reporting bias. However, this is a supposition as it is known that a well-designed and conducted retrospective study can be an effective method to guide future prospective work; for example, to focus on research questions, clarify hypotheses and identify feasibility issues for the prospective study.

### Management of rotator cuff injuries [^c47907b2]. AAOS (2025). High credibility.

Management of rotator cuff injuries — this clinical practice guideline is based on a systematic review of published studies and is intended for qualified physicians and surgeons managing rotator cuff injuries. The systematic review was conducted between October 2023 and June 2024, with the final search performed on June 7, 2024. AAOS staff and the physician workgroup systematically reviewed the available literature and wrote recommendations based on a rigorous, standardized process. The guideline aligns with evidence-based medicine (EBM) by stating that physicians use the best available evidence in clinical decision making, and it should not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding methods reasonably directed to the same results; ultimate judgment regarding any procedure or treatment must consider patient circumstances and local resources. Intended users include orthopaedic surgeons and physicians managing patients with rotator cuff injuries, with other healthcare professionals in varied practice settings also potentially benefiting.

### Football-specific extension of the IOC consensus statement: methods for recording and reporting of epidemiological data on injury and illness in sport 2020 [^b4684e75]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Subsequent, recurrent and/or exacerbation of health problems

We agreed to recommend using the categories from the IOC consensus statement where it should initially be determined whether a health problem following an index injury/illness is a subsequent injury/illness to the same location (body area/system) or a subsequent new injury/illness. As this is not clearly specified in the IOC consensus statement, we recommend that a subsequent health problem is called a recurrence if it is the same type/diagnosis; if not, it is called a subsequent local injury/illness. For recurrences, if the player's health problem was fully healed/recovered and the player has returned to football, the subsequent health problem is called a reinjury/repeated illness; if not, it is called an exacerbation (table 3).

Table 3
Examples of how to record subsequent injuries in football

A typical football-relevant example of an exacerbation is gradual-onset tendinopathies, where players can often play matches in parallel with modified football training and rehabilitation. Consequently, this injury is counted only once rather than recording several early reinjuries, which would distort the overall injury statistics; one further example of how to record subsequent injuries is seen in table 3. We recommend reporting details on injury recurrence in days rather than the categorisation of 'early' (within 2 months following return to football), 'late' (two to twelve months) and 'delayed' (more than twelve months) recurrences as was originally recommended in the 2006 football consensus statement.

Football injury and illness diagnoses

We recommend classifying injuries according to body regions/areas, tissue types and pathology, and illnesses using organ systems/regions and aetiology, as categorised in tables 4–5 and 7–9 in the IOC consensus statement. Exceptions include dividing the body area 'hip/groin' to 'hip' and 'groin' and adding 'complete and partial tendon avulsions' to the notes for the pathology type tendon rupture.

Table 4
Football-specific recommendations and additions to table 6 in the IOC consensus statement

Table 5
Examples of how to record time-loss and calculate injury/illness severity in football

The separation of the hip and groin areas will affect the grouping of diagnoses used in diagnostic coding systems and will need further standardisation to ensure reliable categorisation. For example, when using the Orchard Sport Injury & Illness Classification System (OSIICS), we recommend to group diagnostic codes related to:

### Error and discrepancy in radiology: inevitable or avoidable? [^34b21e55]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Definition of error/discrepancy

It was recently estimated that one billion radiologic examinations are performed worldwide annually, most of which are interpreted by radiologists. Most professional bodies would agree that all imaging procedures should include an expert radiologist's opinion, given by means of a written report. This activity constitutes much of the daily work of practising radiologists. We don't always get it right.

Although not always appreciated by the public, or indeed by referring doctors, radiologists' reports should not be expected to be definitive or incontrovertible. They represent clinical consultations, resulting in opinions which are conclusions arrived at after weighing of evidence; "opinion" can be defined as "a view held about a particular subject or point; a judgement formed; a belief". Sometimes it is possible to be definitive in radiological diagnoses, but in most cases, radiological interpretation is heavily influenced by the clinical circumstances of the patient, relevant past history and previous imaging, and myriad other factors, including biases of which we may not be aware. Radiological studies do not come with inbuilt labels denoting the most significant abnormalities, and interpreting them is not a binary process (normal vs abnormal, cancer vs "all-clear").

In this context, defining what constitutes radiological error is not straightforward. The use of the term "error" implies that there is no potential for disagreement about what is "correct", and indicates that the reporting radiologist should have been able to make the correct diagnosis or report, but did not. In real life, there is frequently room for legitimate differences of opinion about diagnoses or for "failure" to identify an abnormality that can be seen in retrospect. Expert opinion often forms the basis for deciding whether an error has been made, but it should be noted that "experts" themselves may also be subject to question ("An expert is someone who is more than fifty miles from home, has no responsibility for implementing the advice he gives, and shows slides". - Ed Meese, US Attorney General 1985–88).

Based on the Cutting down, Annoyance by criticism, Guilty feeling and Eye-openers Adapted to Include Drugs (CAGE-AID), drug(s) misuse in the previous 3 months was assessed through 4 items (eg, 'In the last 3 months, has anyone annoyed you or gotten on your nerves by telling you to cut down or stop using drugs?') scored as yes or no. The CAGE-AID has been validated in several populations and European languages (reliability: > 0.9; sensitivity: > 79%; specificity: > 97%). A total score ranging from 0 to 4 was obtained by summing up the answers to the four questions, with a score of 2 or more indicating the presence of drug misuse.

The Brief Eating Disorder in Athletes Questionnaire (BEDA-Q) was used to assess the presence of disordered eating in the previous 4 weeks through 9 items (eg, 'I feel extremely guilty after overeating') scored on several scales. The BEDA-Q has been validated in athletes (internal consistency: > 0.8; criterion-related validity: sensitivity > 0.8, specificity > 0.8, area under ROC curve > 0.7). A total score ranging from 0 to 18 was calculated by summing up the answers on the first 6 items, with a score of 2 or more indicating the presence of disordered eating.

Severe injury and related surgery (independent variable)

History of severe injury and related surgery in hips, knees and ankles was examined through 12 questions (eg, 'How many severe injuries in your left knee have you had so far as professional footballer?') as used in previous studies. In our study, a severe injury was defined as an injury that involved the given joint (hip, knee and/or ankles), occurred during team activities (training or match) and led to either training or match absence for more than 28 days. For this question, participants were requested to consult either their medical record or their team physician. The total number of severe injuries and related surgeries was calculated.

### Injury prevention strategies at the FIFA 2014 world cup: perceptions and practices of the physicians from the 32 participating national teams [^c8369e29]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Extrinsic risk factors

In line with the perceptions of the physicians in this survey, reduced recovery time (1st) and a congested match schedule (3rd) are supported risk factors for injury in top-level footballers. Three of the other perceived extrinsic risk factors, namely, training load prior to the World Cup (2nd), training load during the World Cup (joint 3rd place) and the number of matches played during the club season (joint 4th place) can be considered specific to national team concerns and are under the umbrella term of 'workload' imposed on the player (ie, physical and mental loads from training and matches). Previous research has shown that 60% of players who played in more than one match per week during the 10 weeks prior to the World Cup 2002 incurred injuries or underperformed during that World Cup. Although not currently shown in top-level footballers, workloads from training and matches have been associated with injury in other football codes. Investigations into the association between workload and injury in top-level football players are, therefore, highly pertinent.

Assessment and monitoring of injury risk

In sport, each athlete has a unique risk valueand it is important to examine those intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors that interact to make an athlete susceptible to injury, ideally before the injury inciting event occurs. Ninety-four per cent of teams at the FIFA 2014 World Cup assessed their players' individual injury risk profiles with the common tests and monitoring tools outlined below.

The '5' most commonly used injury risk screening tests

The '5' most commonly used screening tests used by national teams were flexibility (dynamic and static), physical fitness, joint mobility, balance/proprioception and evaluation of both muscle endurance and peak strength.

Tests of physical fitness, balance/proprioception and muscle strength are in line with their similarly ranked importance as risk factors outlined earlier. Accordingly, there appears to be a coherent approach of practitioners in terms of implementing screening tests that potentially identify what they consider to be among the most important intrinsic risk factors for their players. In contrast, as risk factors, joint mobility/function and flexibility were ranked as 11th (58/96 points) and 12th (56/96 points) out of 18 ranks, respectively. Despite this lower ranking and conflicting research about these as risk factors for professional footballers,91% of physicians rated joint mobility/function and flexibility as having at least some importance. The fact that these tests are generally easy to implement may explain why these are among the most widely used by national teams.

### Improving the reliability of measurements in orthopaedics and sports medicine [^c2f98dc5]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

In the third type, each participant is rated by the same k examiners. It is hard to imagine a situation in orthopaedics or sports medicine in which the reliability of a device and a given research procedure is only checked for certain clinicians, so such tests are not applicable for clinical or research purposes.

In contrast, intra-rater reliability refers to the variation in obtained data when one examiner records measurements across at least two trials. Also called within-observer consistency, intra-rater reliability concerns whether there is agreement between assessments of the same participants by the same rater on a minimum of two different occasions.

Test–retest reliability, or test–retest consistency, refers to variation in measurements carried out using the same measurement tool on the same participant under the same conditions. It is applicable when the rater is not involved or the effect of the rater on the result is negligible, as in the example of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Test–retest reliability studies are most commonly used to measure the level of consistency between two numerical or quantitative ratings at two different times.

Test–retest studies offer insight into the measurement error of a given instrument. If the rater is of interest (intra-rater reliability), the inter-rater reliability shows how much. In most cases, both intra-rater and inter-rater reliability or at least inter-rater reliability should be determined. Intra-rater reliability alone is not applicable to clinicians or researchers, given that, in daily practice, it is uncommon for all patients to be assessed by the same rater.

Raters, targets, and time

As previously mentioned, raters and participants in reliability studies must directly reflect or at least be similar to those involved in clinical practice or research. Moreover, the number and variability of rated participants and the number of raters are indicated in the literature as the most common factors affecting reliability.

For the purposes of inter-rater reliability studies, at least two raters must be involved. This provides two points of variability: rater expertise and rater practice setting. Generally, the more extensive the experience of the rater, the better the reliability. The rater and setting in a reliability study should reflect the real conditions in which the measurement will be employed. It has been proven that some methods — for example, ultrasound-based assessments — are dependent on rater experience; therefore, the experience and practice settings of raters must be disclosed in the study protocol. The raters must be blinded (i.e. they cannot know the results obtained by other raters).

### Epidemiology of hip and groin injuries in Swedish male first football league [^6c3a6c18]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Data collection

A total of 59 team seasons were included, involving 16 different teams, with seven of the teams participating during all five seasons. Teams participated in a mean ± SD of 3.7 ± 1.5 seasons (range 1–5). There were 1,687 players in total, with an average of 29 players per team (range 23–34), divided by 11% goalkeepers (n = 186), 35% defenders (n = 585), 34% midfielders (n = 579), and 20% forwards (n = 337). Anthropometric data for the included football players were 25 ± 5 years (range 16–44), with a height of 183 ± 6 cm (range 166–200) and weight of 78 ± 7 kg (range 53–96).

Staff members from all 16 medical teams were initially contacted, between December 2016 and February 2017, and provided with oral and written information about the study.

All teams consented in writing to participate in the present study. Data regarding player and team characteristics (player position, age, height, weight and squad size) were collected through the website Elitefootball.com, which provides such data on the official website of the Swedish first football league. All other data, such as total team exposure (training and playing time), injuries (time-loss), and absence days (days lost due to injury), were extracted from the Swedish National Injury Surveillance Database.

This injury surveillance database is used prospectively by medical teams in the Swedish first football league to report injuries and treatment of individual players. Injuries that cause time-loss are registered with an injury card, which follows the consensus on injury definitions and data collection procedures in football studies. This reporting system enables extraction of data for statistical purposes and to design epidemiological studies on football injuries.

### The football players' health study at harvard university: design and objectives [^99a22f65]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

A series of studies were undertaken to assess how stakeholders' perspectives interact (Table 2). We identified who the stakeholders in player health were, evaluated their legal and ethical obligations, and assessed the current successes as well as gaps and opportunities for each stakeholder in protecting and promoting player health. 20, 21 In addition, we applied a series of legal and ethical principles to arrive at recommendations for positive change where needed. 22 A second effort compared the NFL's policies and practices to those in place in Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, the Canadian Football League, and Major League Soccer, to assess best practices and make recommendations for areas deemed in need of improvement. 23 In addition to these major reports, a series of additional studies on the legal and ethical aspects of the game were carried out over the first 3 years of the study. These include an examination of team doctors' conflicts of interest and the ethical management thereof, an examination of the applicability of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act to NFL football and the NFL Combine, and an analysis of the applicability of workplace safety laws and guidelines (such as the Occupational Safety and Health Agency) to professional football. We also conducted a qualitative assessment project with one‐on‐one interviews of approximately 50 current and former players and another 50 of their family members. The output of this study is ongoing. The goal was to better understand the perspectives of these key stakeholders on the following topics: overall professional football experience, improving player safety, health, family, and social issues, support as a professional athlete, life after football, risk disclosure, and risk‐taking, health care and club medical staff, medical screenings, and injury and pain management. These data produced a theoretical evaluation of the path that a hypothetical college football player might face, from a legal and ethical perspective, in trying to enter the sport. 24

### Epidemiology of hip and groin injuries in Swedish male first football league [^e48372c2]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to investigate the incidence, pattern, and burden of hip/groin injuries in Swedish professional male football players over five consecutive seasons.

Methods

Injury history from 16 football teams in the Swedish male first football league was evaluated during five consecutive seasons. The team's medical staff recorded team exposure and time-loss injuries prospectively between 2012 and 2016.

Results

In total, 467 time-loss injuries located in the hip/groin area were recorded among 1,687 professional male football players, with an overall incidence and burden of 0.82/1,000 h and 15.6/1,000 h, respectively. There appeared to be an increased risk of hip/groin injuries during the last two seasons (2015–2016); however, the difference was not statistically significant (n.s). Recurrent injury rate was relatively low (14%), and overuse injuries accounted for the majority of injuries and absence days. Muscle injuries were the main injury type, while kicking and sprinting/running were the primary causes of injury. Goalkeepers had the lowest percentage of injuries and absence days.

Conclusion

Hip/groin injuries are a substantial problem in football, but does not seem to be an increasing phenomenon in the Swedish male first football league. Index and overuse injuries accounted for the majority of injuries and absence days. Thus, the focus should be on preventing hip/groin injuries to lower the injury rate. These new findings should be taken into consideration when designing and implementing preventive training interventions.

### Effectiveness of an on-field rehabilitation framework for return to sports in injured male professional football players: a single-blinded, prospective, randomised controlled trial [^4497dc43]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Trial design

A prospective block-randomised controlled parallel trial that included male professional football players from Athens, Greece, was conducted in collaboration with the Department of Physiotherapy of the University of Patras. Both the players and the examiner were blind regarding the group allocation. The University of Patras ethics committee approved the trial (file No.12193), and the trial was registered on clinicaltrials.gov under 'On-field functional rehabilitation'.

Participants

Eligibility criteria

The eligible study population consisted of male football players aged 17 and 40 participating in three professional Greek football categories. The inclusion criteria were (a) the players had played professional football for at least 3 years, (b) had a diagnosed acute low limb musculoskeletal (MSK) injury, (c) participated in the study from the initial time of injury, (d) had a moderate (7–28 day) or a severe (˃28 days) injury as defined in the prediction of initial diagnosis. Exclusion criteria were (a) the players had suffered a subsequent injury of a previous injury, (b) had a chronic overuse syndrome or other disorders that would affect the intervention and (c) had not sustained another injury in the 2 months before the index injury.

Data collection

Between July 2021 and January 2022, four teams (two teams from Super League, one team from Super League 1 and one high-level team from Super League 2) participating in Greece's top three professional football leagues, as well as two sports physical therapy clinics, were invited to participate in the study and accepted the invitation. All the players were professional football players who typically played 1–2 weekly matches, accompanied by five training sessions. The study focused on recruiting players who had sustained an acute MSK injury during a game or training session. The team's medical staff and the chief physiotherapist from the physical therapy clinics reported the injuries to an independent study worker, who then forwarded the information to the sports physician (AK) for evaluation and randomisation. Once randomisation was completed, the participants began rehabilitation at the physical therapy clinic and continued OFR on the football field.

Patient and public involvement

All participants provided written informed consent and were neither involved in the study conduct nor in disseminating study outcomes.

### Anatomic risk factors for initial and secondary noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injury: a prospective cohort study in 880 female elite handball and soccer players [^7374667c]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The current study did not support a hypothesis from a previous study based on magnetic resonance imaging measurement suggesting that increased hip anteversion would increase ACL injury risk. We found hip anteversion to be significantly smaller in players sustaining a new injury among players without a previous injury. There was a similar tendency among players with a previous ACL injury (Table 1). A prospective cohort study of 290 female high school basketball and handball players reported similar results (noncontact ACL group [15.3°] vs control group [16.6°]) and suggested that reduced femoral anteversion could be a risk factor for noncontact ACL injury. Although we observed the same trend, the mean difference in hip anteversion between groups was only 1.5°, which indicates limited usefulness in clinical practice considering the measurement error. Given the error-prone nature of hip anteversion measurement, the association between hip anteversion and ACL injury risk is still controversial, and future studies based on more accurate testing methods will be needed.

Clinical implications

Awareness of the high prevalence of injuries in female soccer players might help physicians to better recognise and understand the specific health problems of female soccer players. Moreover, knowledge of the patterns of injury occurrence and localisation could also help in developing effective and tailored preventive measures. Since the lower leagues have a higher risk of injury, as shown in this study, targeting lower league stakeholders would be one way to raise awareness and reinforce the importance of medical support and control measures for loads and health problems.

### Problem partners: how to deal with a colleague who causes problems [^31cf7052]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2022). Medium credibility.

One of the least appealing responsibilities of physician leadership is managing situations in which a physician partner is creating problems. Nevertheless, it is one of the most important aspects in maintaining a healthy team dynamic. When the behavior of problem partners goes unchecked these situations often grow to negatively impact others and detract from providing optimal patient care on multiple levels. Although little guidance has been given on how to handle these challenging situations, many of the principles of dealing with surgical complications are applicable and may be more familiar to surgeons. Similar to complications, preventing problems by carefully recruiting those who work well with the team is optimal. However, if and when disruptive behaviors occur, providing clear communication and setting well defined expectations is critical to the resolution.

### Selected issues in sport-related concussion (SRC | Mild traumatic brain injury) for the team physician: a consensus statement [^8c7b0ea2]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Prevention

Primary prevention of SRC is not completely possible.

Helmets do not prevent all SRC, although they decrease the incidence of skull fracture and moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injuries; in professional American football players, it has been reported that certain helmet models are associated with a lower rate of SRC.
There is currently no evidence to support the use of headgear or helmets in sports to prevent all SRC.
Headgear in soccer, rugby, wrestling, boxing may decrease the risk of lacerations and soft tissue trauma.
Improper use of the head in sport-specific skills, and improper fit of a helmet or required protective equipment may increase the risk of SRC.
Mouth guards may decrease the risk of dental or oral injury; more research is needed to validate their use in limiting risk of SRC.

There are strategies that may be helpful in primary prevention of SRC, including:

Limiting contact drills in practice.
Teaching sport-specific technique (eg, blocking, tackling checking).
Fitting of equipment, with more research needed to validate their role in limiting risk of SRC.
Enforcement of rules that prohibit hits to the head and other potentially unsafe conduct (eg, spearing, leading with the head).
Rule changes (eg, checking in youth ice hockey, kickoff return, blindside blocks, targeting and limited pyramid height in cheerleading).
'Fair Play' (rewarding proper behaviour and penalising improper behaviour in ice hockey played in youth).
More research is needed to recommend cervical spine strengthening and neuromuscular training as primary prevention strategies.

Prevention of disability associated with SRC is an important goal. Strategies include the following:

Immediate recognition and removal from practice and play.
Avoid prolonged strict cognitive and physical rest.
Complete clinical recovery after SRC before RTP.
In PSaSRC situations, a multidisciplinary team should be considered for evaluation and management, particularly in athletes who are significantly disabled.
Education for the athlete and other members of the athletic care network about the signs and symptoms of SRC and the importance of immediate recognition and reporting.

It is essential the team physician understand:

SRCs are not completely preventable.
In PSaSRC situations, a multidisciplinary team should be considered for evaluation and management, particularly in athletes who are significantly disabled.

It is desirable the team physician:

Understand strategies and interventions that may minimise risk of SRC and PSaSRC.
Educate the athletic care network regarding prevention strategies.(table 3)

### Communication quality between the medical team and the head coach / manager is associated with injury burden and player availability in elite football clubs [^61e5ebea]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures/dependent variables: injury data

Data on injuries were collected in accordance with the consensus statement on injury definitions and data collection procedures in studies on football (soccer) injuries, and the general methodology was identical to that employed by Hägglund et al.

An injury was defined as any physical complaint that occurred while participating in a football match or a training session that led to an inability to participate fully in a future training session or match (ie, a time-loss injury). Players remained in an injured status until the club's medical staff allowed full participation in training and released the player for selection in matches. A severe injury was defined as an injury that resulted in an absence of > 28 days from training or matches.

Baseline data on players were collected when players were first included in the study. Additionally, on inclusion, all players consented to participate in the study. A member of the club's medical staff recorded data on individual players, including their exposure to football (in minutes) during all training sessions and matches. Injury and attendance reports were sent to the study group once per month. Reports were checked by the study group on receipt, with prompt feedback sent to the clubs for corrections on any missing or unclear data. Each injury was coded in accordance with a modified version of the Orchard Sports Injury Classification System V.2.0.9.

The risk of injury over a season was evaluated for the players of each team, based on four criteria that were previously found to be correlated with team performance, as follows:
Injury burden: (total number of days of absence/total number of hours of exposure) × 1000. This variable accounted for both the incidence and severity of injuries in a season.
Incidence of severe injuries: (total number of injuries causing absences of > 28 days/total number of hours of exposure) × 1000
Attendance at training: average training attendance in a season, expressed as a percentage
Availability for matches: average availability for matches in a season, expressed as a percentage.

### High prevalence of hip and groin problems in professional ice hockey players, regardless of playing position [^3a5c1809]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study found that hip and groin problems were prevalent in professional ice hockey players in Sweden regardless of playing position. Over half (53.2%) of the players had experienced some hip and groin problems during the previous season. Forty-eight percent of players reported a problem that affected their performance, and 28% of players reported inability to train or play because of them. Players with a history of hip and groin problems during the previous season had significantly worse hip and groin function at the start of the following season. Longer duration of hip problems was associated with more impairments in self-reported function at the beginning of the new season.

This is the first study measuring the burden of hip and groin problems in professional ice hockey reporting period prevalence as opposed to incidence rates, as per previous studies. While results of this study cannot be directly compared to previous findings, they provide a novel, and arguably more appropriate, perspective on the burden of hip and groin problems in this group of athletes. Half of all players participating in the study experienced a hip and groin problem affecting their performance (non-time loss) and almost one third of all participating players were side-lined because of them (time loss). Studies on collegiate ice hockey players in North America report that over 50% of hip and groin injuries are non-time loss injuries. However, according to the National Collegiate Athletic Association, non-time loss injuries are recorded only after reports to team clinicians or athletic trainers. Nonetheless, it is not common that athletes avoid seeking medical attention for injuries out of fear of being side-lined. Arguably, current literature may, therefore, fail to include a large proportion of hip and groin problems which do not lead to time loss, but nevertheless impair performance and have long-lasting impact on hip and groin function.

### Injuries and illnesses of football players during the 2010 FIFA world cup [^7030480b]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Methods

The applied methodology combined the FIFA injury reportingand the International Olympic Committee injury and illness surveillancesystems to allow comparison with previous studies. The injury definition and data collection procedure were in accordance with the respective consensus statement for football injuries.

The definition of injury was identical to the one used in previous FIFA competitionsbut extended to training injuries. An injury was defined as 'any musculoskeletal complaint and concussion newly incurred due to competition or training during the 2010 FIFA World Cup™'.
The definition of an illness was developed based on the injury definition and had proved feasible in the 2009 FIFA Confederation Cup, the 2009 world championships of FINA and IAAF as well as during the 2010 Winter Olympics.–An illness was defined as 'any physical complaint (unrelated to injury) newly incurred during the 2010 FIFA World Cup™'. Chronic preexisting illnesses were not included unless there was an exacerbation requiring medical attention during the study period.

The medical report form was almost identical to the form that was developed for the 2009 IAAF and FINA championships, as well as the 2010 Winter Olympic games.–However, the form was slightly modified to: (1) collect football-specific information on cause of injury (the coding used was in accordance with previous FIFA competitions); (2) include codes for illness using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision system; and (3) include the duration of the daily training.

The chief physicians of the 32 finalist teams received detailed information about the study during the medical meeting held in February 2010. As part of the preparation, written informed consent to participate in the study was obtained from all the players. Upon their arrival in South Africa, each team physician received a booklet of daily medical report forms and was requested to complete one form daily starting on the first day of the World Cup (11 June) until the team leaves the competition. The completed forms were collected by a FIFA medical officer after each match during doping control. Confidentiality of all information was ensured and no individual player or team could be identified. Ethics approval for the study was obtained from the Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town (ref. no. REC 159/2009).

### Injuries of the obturator muscles in professional soccer players [^7917ffe9]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Obturator externus and internus muscular tears are uncommon injuries. Only a few case reports exist, mainly in high-level athletes. Our aim is to describe a series of obturator externus and internus muscular tears in professional soccer players.

Methods

Injury data from four teams from the First Division of the Spanish Soccer League were collected over a total of four seasons. Any soccer player who sustained an injury to either the obturator externus or internus identified on magnetic resonance (MRI) was included. All injured players were treated non-operatively with a goal of returning to play as fast as possible.

Results

Sixteen players sustained injuries to the obturator externus and internus during matches or training sessions. The main complaint was anterior hip pain with a physical examination showing pain during internal rotation or external rotation of the flexed hip. The MRI documented 12 muscular tears of the obturator externus, and 4 muscular tears of the obturator internus. All injuries were treated conservatively based on physical therapy, analgesic medications, and underwent a symptoms-based rehabilitation protocol. Mean return to play was 11.5 ± 8.8 days.

Conclusion

Although uncommon, tears of the obturator externus and internus occur in professional soccer players. The MRI scan was essential to the location, classification, and evaluation of the injury size. The clinical relevance of our investigation is based on the relatively benign prognosis of these injuries.

### Lost in transition: challenges and opportunities for improving the quality of transitional care [^4dc3e693]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Transitional care has been defined as a set of actions designed to ensure the coordination and continuity of health care as patients transfer between different locations or different levels of care in the same location. Transitional care, which primarily concerns the relatively brief time interval that begins with preparing a patient to leave one setting and concludes when the patient is received in the next setting, poses challenges that distinguish it from other types of care. Many transitions are unplanned, result from unanticipated medical problems, occur in "real time" during nights and on weekends, involve clinicians who may not have an ongoing relationship with the patient, and happen so quickly that formal and informal support mechanisms cannot respond in a timely manner. This article describes the challenges involved in and potential solutions for improving the quality of transitional care.

2.4 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy

Titration

The objective of dose titration is to identify an effective and tolerable maintenance dose for ongoing management of breakthrough cancer pain episodes. The effective and tolerable dose of LAZANDA will be determined by dose titration in individual patients.

Titration steps: If adequate analgesia is not achieved with the first 100 mcg dose, dose escalate in a step-wise manner over consecutive episodes of breakthrough pain until adequate analgesia with tolerable side effects is achieved.

Patients MUST wait at least 2 hours before treating another episode of breakthrough cancer pain with LAZANDA.

The titration steps should be:

Patients should confirm the dose of LAZANDA that works for them with a second episode of breakthrough pain and review their experience with their physicians to determine if that dose is appropriate, or whether a further adjustment is warranted.

The safety and efficacy of doses higher than 800 mcg have not been evaluated in clinical studies. Avoid the use of a combination of dose strengths to treat an episode as this may cause confusion and dosing errors.

In order to minimize the risk of LAZANDA-related adverse reactions and to identify the appropriate dose, it is imperative that patients be supervised closely by health professionals during the titration process.

Maintenance Therapy

Once an appropriate dose has been established, instruct patients to use that dose for each subsequent breakthrough cancer pain episode. Limit LAZANDA use to four or fewer doses per day.

Patients MUST wait at least 2 hours before treating another episode of breakthrough cancer pain with LAZANDA.

During any episode of breakthrough cancer pain, if there is inadequate pain relief after 30 minutes following LAZANDA dosing or if a separate episode of breakthrough cancer pain occurs before the next dose of LAZANDA is permitted (i.e., within 2 hours), the patients may use a rescue medication as directed by their healthcare provider.

2.5 Dose Re-Adjustment

If the response (analgesia or adverse reactions) to the titrated LAZANDA dose markedly changes, an adjustment of dose may be necessary to ensure that an appropriate dose is maintained.

If more than four episodes of breakthrough pain are experienced per day, re-evaluate the dose of the long-acting opioid used for persistent underlying cancer pain. If the long-acting opioid or dose of long-acting opioid is changed, re-evaluate and re-titrate the LAZANDA dose as necessary to ensure the patient is on an appropriate dose.

Limit the use of LAZANDA to treat four or fewer episodes of breakthrough pain per day.

It is imperative that any dose re-titration is monitored carefully by a healthcare professional.

### Challenges of medical care delivery in professional sports: lessons from professional baseball [^d35618ce]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2018). Low credibility.

Team medical management for professional sports teams is a demanding and high-risk activity. Every different sport has unique features and the stresses athletes place on themselves, be it from collisions or repetitive stress, result in specific challenges for the medical team and team organization in general. Injuries in professional sports are costly both to the player and organization. The challenges of managing a professional baseball team exemplify these concerns and correlate well with other professional sports. Multiple strategies exist for improvement of medical care in baseball based on observed deficiencies in player evaluation, injury prevention, and injury treatment, which will require prospective evaluation to determine their success. These include draft strategies, individualized motion and strength analyses, customized in-season and off-season training programs for individuals, and standardized treatment protocols for injuries all based on best practices. Best practices are currently poorly defined in all of these areas.

### Tackling in youth football [^4fd642dc]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

American football remains one of the most popular sports for young athletes. The injuries sustained during football, especially those to the head and neck, have been a topic of intense interest recently in both the public media and medical literature. The recognition of these injuries and the potential for long-term sequelae have led some physicians to call for a reduction in the number of contact practices, a postponement of tackling until a certain age, and even a ban on high school football. This statement reviews the literature regarding injuries in football, particularly those of the head and neck, the relationship between tackling and football-related injuries, and the potential effects of limiting or delaying tackling on injury risk.

### The limping child [^656a6930]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

A limp is a common presentation to pediatricians, emergency centers, and orthopedists. A directed history and physical examination, and the development of a differential diagnosis based on limp type, patient's age, and the anatomic site that is most likely affected, provides a selective approach to diagnostic testing. Laboratory tests are indicated when infection, inflammatory arthritis, or a malignancy is considered. Imaging usually begins with plain radiography. Ultrasonography is valuable in assessing irritable hips. Advanced imaging is done in select cases. Prompt referral to an orthopedist is essential, especially if septic joint, vascular or compartment issues, or open fractures are suspected.

### Evaluation and referral for developmental dysplasia of the hip in infants [^1f8531fd]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) ultrasonography access and protocol considerations are noted: Because of variability in performance and interpretation of the hip ultrasonographic examination and varying thresholds for treatment, the requesting physician might consider developing a regional protocol in conjunction with a consulting pediatric orthopedist and pediatric radiologist, and specific criteria for imaging and referral based on local resources can promote consistency; limited access to quality infant hip ultrasonography may determine obtaining a pelvic radiograph instead of an ultrasound. Lacking expert consensus of risk factors for DDH, whether to obtain additional imaging with a normal clinical hip examination is best left to one's professional judgment, and the overall probability of a clinically stable hip to later dislocate is very low.

### Hip pain and movement dysfunction associated with nonarthritic hip joint pain: a revision [^62c6de24]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Nonarthritic hip joint pain clinical practice guideline — scope, definitions, and methods — states that it is not a standard of care and focuses on nonoperative physical therapy. For the purposes of this guideline, nonarthritic hip joint pain refers to intra-articular hip conditions including femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS), developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), hip instability, acetabular labral tears, osteochondral lesions, loose bodies, and ligamentum teres tears, with literature also using terms such as hip-related groin pain, hip-related pain, chronic hip joint pain (CHJP), and prearthritic hip disease/pain. Diagnoses are based on a combination of subjective history and clinical examination, which may be aided by imaging. Recommendations address diagnosis, examination, and intervention pertinent to physical therapy as part of nonoperative care, while surgery may be an option when nonoperative intervention fails, and postoperative rehabilitation is not within scope. The scope is limited to literature specific to nonarthritic hip joint pain; studies focused on extra-articular sources of pain were excluded and pain science studies were not included. This is a revision of the 2014 guideline, and content experts appointed by the Academy of Orthopaedic Physical Therapy conducted a literature review to develop the updated CPG.
