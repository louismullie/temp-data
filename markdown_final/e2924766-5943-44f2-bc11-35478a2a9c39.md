hypertension guidelines

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about contemporary hypertension guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching framework and why guidelines differ. Then, I should verify diagnostic thresholds and risk stratification. Next, I will examine treatment initiation thresholds by risk and region. After that, I need to check blood pressure targets across populations and comorbidities. Then, I will review initial pharmacologic strategies, including combination therapy and single-pill combinations. I should also consider special populations, secondary hypertension, and resistant hypertension. Finally, I will integrate implementation and adherence strategies and synthesize a pragmatic, patient-centered approach with explicit caveats and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: modern hypertension guidance is risk-based rather than purely threshold-driven, reflecting trial data like SPRINT and meta-analyses showing that absolute cardiovascular risk modifies the net benefit of intensifying blood pressure lowering, which explains why recommendations diverge despite similar evidence bases [^115PhMLy] [^115hfUxF].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic thresholds before moving further. The ACC/AHA 2017 framework defines hypertension at ≥ 130/80 mmHg and stages risk accordingly, whereas ESC/ESH 2018 and 2023 retained ≥ 140/90 mmHg for hypertension, and ESC 2024 introduced a three-category schema: nonelevated < 120/70, elevated 120–139/70–89, and hypertension ≥ 140/90, which reframes treatment decisions rather than changing the hypertension definition per se [^116VRena] [^115qRHYE] [^113a1pp9].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of out-of-office measurement because misclassification is common. All major guidelines emphasize ambulatory or home blood pressure monitoring to confirm diagnosis, detect white-coat or masked hypertension, and guide titration; ESC/ESH 2018 and 2023, ACC/AHA 2017, and WHO 2021 all embed ABPM/HBPM in diagnostic algorithms, and this is especially critical when using lower thresholds or considering intensive targets [^115qRHYE] [^116VRena] [^116K17V8].

> Next, I should review treatment initiation thresholds by risk. For ACC/AHA, drug therapy is recommended at ≥ 130/80 mmHg when 10-year ASCVD risk is ≥ 10% or CVD is present, and at ≥ 140/90 mmHg for lower-risk individuals. ESC 2024 aligns by recommending pharmacotherapy after 3 months of lifestyle therapy for confirmed ≥ 130/80 mmHg in patients with sufficiently high CVD risk, while treating promptly at ≥ 140/90 mmHg regardless of calculated risk. ESH 2023 treats grade 1 hypertension (140–159/90–99) with drugs if lifestyle fails or risk is high, and WHO 2021 uses ≥ 140/90 mmHg as the universal treatment threshold in primary care contexts [^116VRena] [^1177dRHK] [^111JAPwR].

> I need to ensure I capture regional and guideline-specific nuances correctly. NICE guidance generally diagnoses at ≥ 140/90 mmHg and uses less intensive targets than ACC/AHA and ESC, while Hypertension Canada 2025 initiates pharmacotherapy at ≥ 140/90 mmHg and considers treatment at 130–139 mmHg for high-risk patients; AAFP endorses a standard target of < 140/90 mmHg for most adults, reflecting a more conservative stance than ACC/AHA and ESC [^116gKgmN] [^115uoJkA] [^112A21uM] [^111qiJtZ].

> Let me think about blood pressure targets next, and I should double-check age-specific recommendations. ACC/AHA 2017 and 2025 generally target < 130/80 mmHg for most treated adults, with attention to tolerability; ESC/ESH 2018 and 2023 recommend initial control to < 140/90 mmHg, then < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated, with an explicit SBP target of 120–129 mmHg for most adults < 65 years; ESC 2024 adopts a default SBP target of 120–129 mmHg when tolerated, with allowance for more lenient targets in the very old, frail, or those with orthostatic symptoms; WHO 2021 accepts < 140/90 mmHg as an initial goal in resource-limited settings, with < 130/80 mmHg when feasible [^111xtZ1o] [^113Xz66w] [^112mo4vk] [^114WUXKM].

> But wait, what about older adults and frailty? I should confirm the cautions. ESC/ESH advises SBP 130–139 mmHg for ≥ 65 years and warns against routine targeting below 120 mmHg due to potential harm in trials of older, comorbid populations; ESC 2024 explicitly recommends relaxing targets in ≥ 85 years, moderate-to-severe frailty, limited life expectancy, or symptomatic orthostasis; AAFP endorses < 140/90 mmHg broadly, reflecting concern about overtreatment in older adults [^114FFvZw] [^114WUXKM] [^111qiJtZ].

> I will now examine initial pharmacologic therapy, and I need to check whether combination therapy is favored. ESH 2023 recommends initiating with a two-drug combination in most patients, preferably a RAS blocker (ACEi or ARB) plus a CCB or thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, to achieve faster control; WHO 2021 similarly supports initial combination therapy and single-pill combinations to improve adherence; ACC/AHA 2017 advises initiating two drugs when BP is > 20/10 mmHg above goal, with otherwise flexible monotherapy choices among the major classes; ESC 2024 continues to prioritize combination strategies for timely control [^111rJjTU] [^116K17V8] [^116VRena].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of beta-blockers and special indications. ESH 2023 elevates beta-blockers to major-agent status and supports their use when compelling indications exist or as part of combination therapy; ACC/AHA retains beta-blockers for compelling indications such as CAD, HF with reduced EF, or arrhythmias; ESC 2024 maintains this stance while emphasizing combination therapy to overcome inertia [^114Vx2JC].

> Next, I should review resistant hypertension and secondary causes, and I need to ensure I include practical triggers for referral. Both ESH 2023 and ESC 2024 frame resistant hypertension as high risk and recommend structured evaluation for nonadherence, suboptimal regimens, and secondary causes, with referral to specialized centers; young-onset hypertension (< 40 years) warrants evaluation for secondary etiologies and specialist input; primary aldosteronism screening is emphasized in appropriate phenotypes, and device-based therapies remain investigational outside trials [^115ueqwJ] [^111JuabG] [^117AmU7m] [^113GhXGe].

> Let me consider special populations and comorbidities, and I should confirm CKD-specific guidance. In CKD, ACEi/ARB therapy is prioritized for cardiorenal protection, with SGLT2 inhibitors and finerenone added per evolving evidence; ESC/ESH and nephrology commentaries endorse risk-adapted lower BP targets when tolerated, while acknowledging limited evidence in advanced CKD; pregnancy requires avoidance of teratogens and preference for labetalol, nifedipine, or methyldopa, with thresholds for treatment typically ≥ 150/95 mmHg or ≥ 140/90 mmHg if HMOD is present [^111dvwNr] [^112gDYYh] [^112UuRwv].

> I should double-check implementation and adherence strategies because poor control often reflects systems issues. Major guidelines converge on team-based care, HBPM/ABPM, single-pill combinations, and structured follow-up to mitigate therapeutic inertia; WHO 2021 operationalizes task-sharing and simplified algorithms for LMIC settings; Japanese guidance highlights multidisciplinary team-based care to close the evidence-practice gap; implementation science repeatedly shows that measurement accuracy, adherence support, and rapid titration are key levers for improving control rates [^116K17V8] [^115bAZHn] [^111HNZQC].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought ESC 2024 redefined hypertension to ≥ 130/80 mmHg, but that's not quite right. Let me reconsider and correct that. ESC 2024 introduced a new categorical framework labeling 120–139/70–89 mmHg as "elevated" and kept "hypertension" at ≥ 140/90 mmHg, so the diagnostic threshold did not shift downward, even though treatment may begin at ≥ 130/80 mmHg for sufficiently high-risk patients after lifestyle therapy [^113a1pp9] [^111JAPwR].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the synthesis is clinically actionable and risk-aligned. For a typical adult < 65 years without major frailty, confirm BP with out-of-office measurements, initiate pharmacotherapy at ≥ 140/90 mmHg or at ≥ 130/80 mmHg if high risk, start with a two-drug combination (RAS blocker plus CCB or thiazide), titrate to 120–129/ < 80 mmHg if tolerated, and adjust for adverse effects or special circumstances. For adults ≥ 65 years or with frailty, target 130–139 mmHg and avoid SBP < 120 mmHg. Embed lifestyle therapy, HBPM/ABPM, and structured follow-up to sustain control and minimize harm [^111xtZ1o] [^113Xz66w] [^111rJjTU] [^116VRena].

Current hypertension guidelines emphasize **risk-based treatment** and **lower BP targets** to reduce cardiovascular events. Most guidelines define hypertension as **≥ 140/90 mmHg** and recommend initiating pharmacotherapy at this threshold, with consideration of **≥ 130/80 mmHg** for high-risk patients [^1177dRHK] [^113a1pp9]. The **general target is < 130/80 mmHg** if tolerated, with a default SBP goal of 120–129 mmHg for most adults [^112mo4vk] [^113Xz66w]. Initial therapy favors **two-drug combinations** (RAS blocker + CCB or thiazide) for most patients, with single-pill combinations to improve adherence [^111rJjTU] [^113GhXGe]. Lifestyle interventions are recommended for all, and out-of-office BP monitoring is essential for diagnosis and management [^116VRena] [^116oYz48].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and measurement

- **Office BP measurement**: Standardized, calibrated devices; proper patient positioning; multiple readings.
- **Ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM)**: Gold standard for diagnosis; detects white-coat and masked hypertension [^notfound].
- **Home BP monitoring (HBPM)**: Encouraged for ongoing management and adherence [^115NdXYT].

---

## Treatment thresholds and initiation of pharmacotherapy

- **General population**: Initiate pharmacotherapy at ≥ 140/90 mmHg [^111JAPwR].
- **High-risk patients**: Consider initiation at ≥ 130/80 mmHg (e.g. CVD, diabetes, CKD) [^1177dRHK].
- **Elderly or frail patients**: Individualized approach; consider higher thresholds [^116ZCKT9].

---

## Blood pressure targets

- **General target**: < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated [^113Xz66w].
- **Default SBP target**: 120–129 mmHg for most adults [^112mo4vk].
- **Elderly or frail patients**: Personalized, more lenient targets (e.g. < 140/90 mmHg) [^114WUXKM].

---

## Lifestyle interventions

Lifestyle interventions include **dietary sodium restriction** to < 2 g/day, **weight loss** to BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m², at least 150 minutes/week of **moderate-intensity aerobic exercise**, **moderation of alcohol intake** (≤ 1 drink/day for women, ≤ 2 for men), and **smoking cessation** with support and counseling [^116VRena].

---

## Pharmacological treatment

- **Initial therapy**: Two-drug combination (RAS blocker + CCB or thiazide) for most patients [^111rJjTU].
- **Single-pill combinations**: Recommended to improve adherence [^113GhXGe].
- **Beta-blockers**: Reserved for specific indications (e.g. heart failure, ischemic heart disease) [^notfound].

---

## Special populations

- **Elderly**: Cautious titration; avoid excessive BP lowering [^114FFvZw].
- **Diabetes/CKD**: Lower targets (< 130/80 mmHg) if tolerated [^113Xz66w].
- **Pregnancy**: Methyldopa, labetalol, nifedipine preferred; avoid ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and diuretics [^112UuRwv].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring and follow-up emphasize **regular follow-up** to assess adherence, adverse effects, and BP control, with **home BP monitoring** to improve adherence and detect white-coat hypertension [^113GhXGe] [^116VRena].

---

## Emerging trends and controversies

Emerging trends and controversies include **intensive BP lowering** — supported by SPRINT for high-risk patients — and **device-based therapies** (e.g. renal denervation), which are considered for resistant hypertension in specialized centers [^115hfUxF] [^114a4kHy].

---

Current guidelines prioritize **risk-based treatment**, **lower BP targets**, and **combination therapy** to optimize cardiovascular outcomes.

Criteria for Classification of Recommendations

We found inconsistent guidance for a disconcertingly high proportion of reference recommendations. This suggests that clinicians evaluating and treating hypertension are often faced with impossible expectations, in that following one guideline's recommendations would mean going against recommendations from another guideline.

Regardless of measures taken to improve CPG development, a high degree of consistency and strong guidance may be unrealistic in hypertension management. The direct evidence for precise actions is often limited, the thresholds for action are often more continuous than binary, and the relative importance of benefits and harms is sensitive to an individual patient's values and preferences.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^114eZ6aq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension affects ≈29% of the US adult population, an estimated 72 million people, with a prevalence of > 65% in persons older than 60 years. 1, 2 It is an important risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), accounting for ≈41% of all CVD deaths. 3, 4 Indeed, there is a known graded relationship between increasing blood pressure (BP) and the risk of CVD, starting at 115/75 mm Hg. 5 Based on observational data, an increase in BP of 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic is associated with a doubling of the risk of CVD death, regardless of age. 5 Further, hypertension in middle age is known to increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dementia in later life, an important issue given the aging demographic in Western societies. 6 Finally, despite the fact that BP recognition and control are improving, it is concerning that nearly half of the hypertensive population remains suboptimally controlled. 2

With the 2003 Joint National Committee's seventh report (JNC 7) becoming increasingly outdated and the 2011 Institute of Medicine report calling for high‐quality evidence‐based guidelines, 7, 8 the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) was initially appointed to create an updated treatment guideline for hypertension under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Although the NIH ultimately withdrew from the guideline development process at a late stage in the development of JNC 8, the panel decided, nonetheless, to publish their recommendations independently.

The panel aimed to answer 3 questions: Does initiating antihypertensive treatment at specific BP thresholds improve health outcomes? Does treatment with antihypertensive therapy to a specific BP goal improve health outcomes? Are there differences in benefit/harm between antihypertensive drugs or drug classes on specific health outcomes? The committee focused exclusively on large, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as supporting evidence, although 5 of the 9 recommendations in the final report were ultimately based on expert opinion. Partly in response to JNC 8, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) are now in the process of developing official hypertension guidelines. In this review, we discuss the basis of each recommendation from the JNC 8 panel, provide additional insights, and compare these recommendations with guidelines from other professional societies to generate suggestions for the new AHA/ACC hypertension guideline committee.

- high-normal BP and very high cardiovascular risk

- frailty and/or advanced age.

### Management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy: a position statement of the European Society of Hypertension working group' hypertension in women' [^116u1KR7]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HDP), remain the leading cause of adverse maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes. Epidemiological factors, comorbidities, assisted reproduction techniques, placental disorders, and genetic predisposition determine the burden of the disease. The pathophysiological substrate and the clinical presentation of HDP are multifarious. The latter and the lack of well designed clinical trials in the field explain the absence of consensus on disease management among relevant international societies. Thus, the usual clinical management of HDP is largely empirical. The current position statement of the Working Group 'Hypertension in Women' of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) aims to employ the current evidence for the management of HDP, discuss the recommendations made in the 2023 ESH guidelines for the management of hypertension, and shed light on controversial issues in the field to stimulate future research.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to indications for treatment, general population, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating BP-lowering treatment in patients meeting the following criteria only from ≥ 140/90 mmHg under close monitoring of treatment tolerance, recognizing that the benefit of reducing CVD outcomes is uncertain in these patients:

- pre-treatment symptomatic orthostatic hypotension

- age ≥ 85 years

- clinically significant moderate-to-severe frailty

- limited predicted lifespan (< 3 years).

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: a World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^116oYz48]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

In 1978, the World Health Organization (WHO) published one of the earliest clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of arterial hypertension, which were later updated in 1999 and 2003. In 2007, the WHO published some recommendations for the management of hypertension in guidelines for the assessment and management of total CVD risk. However, these are now outdated considering new evidence and practices. Guidance is particularly needed now on some controversial issues, such as the threshold level of BP at which to start pharmacological treatment and whether laboratory testing and CVD risk assessment are needed before initiating antihypertensive pharmacological therapy. In the past decade, the WHO included diagnosis and management of hypertension in a total CVD risk approach as part of the WHO Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions (WHO PEN) 2007, 2010, and 2013. However, this approach preceded recent advances in the pharmacological management of hypertension. More recently, the WHO has provided information about the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the Global HEARTS Initiative including the HEARTS Technical Package and the HEARTS in the Americas Program. However, these too provide general practical information and not specific guidelines and recommendations. The WHO Essential Medicines List includes ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, and thiazide diuretics for management of hypertension. In June 2019, single-pill combination antihypertensive medications were added to the WHO Essential Medicines List.

Herein, we summarize the recommendations of the 2021 WHO Guidelines for the Pharmacological Treatment of Hypertension in Adults. They include guidance on the BP threshold for the initiation of pharmacological treatment for hypertension, initial and longer-term visit intervals for follow-up of treated patients, treatment target BP levels, and the best use of health care workers for management of hypertension. The 2021 WHO hypertension guidelines aim to provide the most current and relevant evidence-based guidance for pharmacological treatment of hypertension in nonpregnant adults, with a particular focus on practice in middle- and low-income countries.

Although these guidelines do not address modifiable risk factors for hypertension such as unhealthy diet, overweight, obesity, physical inactivity, or consumption of alcohol, a comprehensive treatment plan for hypertension should address these risk factors through lifestyle modifications and other interventions. Likewise, treatment of hypertension should be accompanied by management of other CVD risk factors such as cigarette smoking, diabetes, lipid abnormalities, and comorbid conditions.

### Sex and gender in hypertension guidelines [^111pxZ1G]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

We reviewed international and selected national guidelines for the management of hypertension representing all continents to underline between-guideline similarities and differences in epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of hypertension in men and women. We also aimed to explore how sex-related evidence evolved from earlier to recent hypertension international guidelines reports. Always under the guideline context, sex-specific conditions, such as hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, sexual dysfunction, menopause, or use of contraceptive pills, were also addressed.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: a World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^116oZq7q]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In the above guidelines, the WHO provides the most current and relevant evidence-based global public health guidance on the initiation of treatment with pharmacological agents for hypertension in adults. The guidelines are expected to be valid for a period of 5 years. This period reflects the fact that new research findings are likely to become available in the meantime but also represents a feasible time frame, considering the costs, time and other resources that are needed to update such guidelines. If the evidence base or user needs change before the 5-year mark, consideration will be given to producing updates sooner. More large randomized controlled trials, powered for CVD and/or mortality outcomes, are needed to shed light on the research gaps mentioned in discussion above especially for subpopulations that have not been adequately represented in previous trials.

### Changing concepts in hypertension management [^111i4Bfn]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertension is the most common modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and death, and lowering blood pressure with anti-hypertensive drugs reduces target organ damage and prevents cardiovascular disease outcomes. The recent trials SPRINT and HOPE-3 will lead to changes in the way we manage hypertension and impact on clinical practice guidelines. These studies also demonstrate the shift toward automated blood pressure measurements. We have reviewed these studies and others to put them in context with the guidelines that have come before and to describe how they will impact on hypertension treatment thresholds and targets, the treatment of hypertension in the elderly, and changing approaches to the management of hypertension including resistant hypertension.

Introduction

Globally, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) lead to one-third of all annual deaths, which is nearly 17 million total deaths worldwide. Of these deaths due to CVDs, complications of hypertension account for 53% of CVD-related mortality worldwide every year. Although highly preventable, hypertension is the most prevalent risk factor for CVD. The global prevalence of hypertension is projected to increase from 26% in 2000 to 29.2% by 2025. Factors attributed to the increase in prevalence of hypertension include, population growth, ageing of the population, and behavioral risk factors, such as smoking, poor diet, harmful use of alcohol, low physical activity, and overweight or obesity. Globally, the observed increasing burden of hypertension is a major public health concern.

In 2017, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) published updated guidelines titled, The ACC/AHA Guidelines for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults or the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines. These guidelines provide updated recommendations for the diagnostic criteria of hypertension, appropriate blood pressure (BP) criteria for pharmacologic intervention, BP target goals, diagnostic work and evaluation for hypertension, and lifestyle management strategies both for prevention and for treatment of hypertension. The 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines were developed based on evidence from recently published randomized control trials, and a broader range of evidence, such as epidemiological studies and expert opinion. However, of note, several scientific organizations, such as the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians, have not endorsed the updated guidelines particularly its applicability to those aged 60 years and above. This may impact uptake of the updated diagnostic criteria of hypertension and recommendations for care and treatment, included in the 2017 ACC/AHA among physicians in the United States.

Key Points for Practice
- In the general population, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg or higher in adults 60 years and older, or 140/90 mm Hg or higher in adults younger than 60 years.
- In patients with hypertension and diabetes, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg or higher, regardless of age.
- Initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide diuretic, calcium channel blocker, ACE inhibitor, or ARB in the general nonblack population or a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker in the general black population.
- If the target blood pressure is not reached within one month after initiating therapy, the dosage of the initial medication should be increased, or a second medication should be added.

From the AFP Editors Hypertension is one of the most important preventable contributors to disease and death in the United States, leading to myocardial infarction, stroke, and renal failure when it is not detected early and treated appropriately. The Eighth Joint National Committee recently released evidence-based recommendations on treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. In the general population of adults 60 years and older, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when the systolic pressure is 150 mm Hg or higher, or when the diastolic pressure is 90 mm Hg or higher. Patients should be treated to a target systolic pressure of less than 150 mm Hg and a target diastolic pressure of less than 90 mm Hg. Treatment does not need to be adjusted if it results in a systolic pressure lower than 140 mm Hg, as long as it is not associated with adverse effects on health or quality of life.

Hypertension in Patients with CKD or Diabetes For persons 18 years or older with chronic kidney disease or diabetes mellitus, the treatment threshold and target blood pressures are the same as those for the general population younger than 60 years.

INTRODUCTION

The European Society of Hypertension (ESH) published several guidelines (GLs) for the management of arterial hypertension in recent years to help physicians and patients make decisions in particular disease conditions. The last one was published in 2023, the ESH 2023 guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension.

The year 2023 marks the 20th anniversary of the hypertension guidelines of the ESH, which were published for the first time in 2003. It is evident that guidelines – based on past collected knowledge – are important regarding diagnosis and treatment, to prevent or delay the adverse effects of hypertension.

Several studies conducted in the past few decades have shown that clinical practice guidelines, for the management of cardiovascular diseases, include a small percentage, less than 15%, of the recommendations which are supported by Level A evidence, meaning that multiple randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses providing the highest level of evidence are not present. Furthermore, these studies also have demonstrated a steady temporal trend or small increase in Level A evidence. Based on a recent study comparing 50 clinical practice guidelines from 2011 to 2022, 16% of the recommendations were supported by the highest quality of evidence, Level A, at the same time, there was a slight global increase in Level A in recent years.

There are no systematic methods to measure quantitatively the helpfulness or quality of GLs, that is, how much help they provide to the physicians. Moreover, previous assessments/methods also pose several questions. Whether the previous analysis could provide an objective 'result' on the helpfulness of a GL, for example, based on: the frequency of recommendations and evidence, the frequency of evidence at each class of recommendation (Level by Class), or vice versa the frequency of recommendations in each level of evidence (Class by Level)? These questions underline the need to further develop the methods of assessing GLs, which can be improved by including implementation advice and translating scientific Evidence into Recommendations.

The ESH 2023 guideline was a further development of the 2018 guideline, in terms of structure and function, covering more than 40 new aspects in detail. In addition, several new clinical trials were completed in recent years, thus we have hypothesized that the 2023 guideline will provide greater help to clinicians in the diagnosis and management of hypertension. We also hypothesized that our method provides an objective assessment of the usefulness of a guideline, as a kind of 'quality control', and allows comparison of various medical guidelines.

### Reconciling multiple hypertension guidelines to promote effective clinical practice [^1177QiTj]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

The new Joint National Committee 8 (JNC-8) blood pressure guidelines were recently published, and there are some major changes from JNC-7. There are also differences between JNC-8 and hypertension guidelines created by major organizations in North America and around the world published from 2013 to the present. In the face of conflicting evidence, it is difficult for practicing clinicians to reconcile these differences and to incorporate new guidance into their practice. This commentary will identify similarities and differences between guidelines, provide some literature context in the areas of differing recommendations, and then provide advice to enhance patient care.

CONCLUSIONS

The 2023 ESH Guidelines for the Management of Arterial Hypertension document includes important information and several recommendation updates regarding the management of hypertension in CKD, following the evolution of evidence in recent years (Table 2). Updated recommendations for daily nephrology practice that were briefly summarized in this text are relevant to the optimal BP targets, the algorithm of antihypertensive drug use in patients with CKD G3b and G4, the use of nephroprotective and cardioprotective agents such as SGLT2is and finerenone, management of hypertension in KTRs and current treatment of renovascular disease. Several other topics that are not discussed herein due to reasons of space can be also useful to practicing nephrologists, including management of hypertension in patient phenotypes that are commonly encountered (patients with diabetes, obesity, advanced CVD, sleep apnea), management of secondary hypertension, follow-up algorithms, the importance of adherence to treatment and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, among others. For all these topics, the reader is referred to the main Guideline document. Implementation of the above recommendations in clinical practice is expected to help towards the improvement of BP control and reduction of hypertension-associated morbidity in patients with CKD.

### Targeting multivariable risks: an opportunity for population high blood pressure control [^11189QTS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

The incorporation of risk assessment in the hypertension treatment and control efforts has implications for the clinical treatment guidelines of high blood pressure. The evolution and modifications of the guidelines and recommendations for prevention, detection, treatment, and control of high blood pressure over the past 5 decades have been associated with lower blood pressure distributions and reduced cardiovascular disease risks. The updates and modifications of the clinical guidelines have been based on ongoing study results and findings providing evidence for inclusion in recommendations. Current hypertension guidelines have incorporated systematic reviews to produce evidence-based guidelines. The evidence-grading process has become the major component and activity for the development of clinical guidelines for the management of hypertension, as seen in the recent recommendations. However, there are significant evidence gaps in the risks associated with blood pressure levels with different populations, multiple risk factors, and comorbid conditions. Such variations have led to guidelines specific to the risk differential addressing specific characteristics, such as those associated with the treatment of hypertension in patients with ischemic heart disease. Current guidelines propose different blood pressure target levels, blood pressure values for initiating therapy, and different therapy regimens for the clinical management of hypertension based on the risks and comorbid conditions. However, the lack of clinical study evidence for the multiple stratifications of risks and corresponding treatment strategies have led to differences in recommendations. The lack of information leads to confusion and lack of consistency in the management of high blood pressure and subsequent risk benefit.

As high blood pressure prevention, management, and control continue to emerge and develop globally, the issues of hypertension risk management will be a major consideration for clinicians throughout the world. The World Hypertension League has identified the future needs and essential study evidence for the development of high blood pressure control strategies for the diverse populations with various risk levels. The current article contributes to the evidence gap in refining the risks for elevated blood pressure and proposing a mechanism to improve hypertension management by supplementing risk assessment with blood pressure measurements. These results provide a guide for future studies to provide evidence for the diverse hypertensive populations of the world.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^115CjvEw]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.

HYPERTENSION GUIDELINE AND TREATMENT CONTROVERSIES

Hypertension care is complex. Multiple guidelines with different treatment thresholds, diagnostic criteria, and target goals introduce potential program, communication, and management complexity may have contributed to the decline in controlled BP. The 2017 AHA/ACC BP guidelineand the report from members initially appointed to the Joint National Committee (JNC-8)have been the subject of debate and inconsistent implementation by some professional organizations and clinicians. For example, the American College of Physicians (ACP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommended that patients with hypertension who are 60 years and older should be treated to a systolic BP target of < 150 mm Hg, aligning with the JNC-8 writing group recommendation, but conflicting with JNC-7 and the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline. It is unclear whether these inconsistencies contribute to reduced BP control. Of note, hypertension control to < 140/ < 90 mm Hg declined more in adults 40–59 years than in those 60 years and older. This finding suggests that factors other than the JNC-8 report and ACP/AAFP recommendations for a higher systolic BP target may contribute to the broad-based decline in hypertension control.

### Prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults: synopsis of the 2017 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association hypertension guideline [^116VRena]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Description

In November 2017, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) released a clinical practice guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure (BP) in adults. This article summarizes the major recommendations.

Methods

In 2014, the ACC and the AHA appointed a multidisciplinary committee to update previous reports of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. The committee reviewed literature and commissioned systematic reviews and meta-analyses on out-of-office BP monitoring, the optimal target for BP lowering, the comparative benefits and harms of different classes of antihypertensive agents, and the comparative benefits and harms of initiating therapy with a single antihypertensive agent or a combination of 2 agents.

Recommendations

This article summarizes key recommendations in the following areas: BP classification, BP measurement, screening for secondary hypertension, nonpharmacologic therapy, BP thresholds and cardiac risk estimation to guide drug treatment, treatment goals (general and for patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and advanced age), choice of initial drug therapy, resistant hypertension, and strategies to improve hypertension control.

The 2022 Blood Pressure Targets in Adults With Hypertension: A Clinical Practice Guideline From the AAFP, was developed by the American Academy of Family Physicians and approved by the Board of Directors in July 2022. The guideline was then published in the American Family Physician. These recommendations are provided only as assistance for physicians making clinical decisions regarding the care of their patients. As such, they cannot substitute for the individual judgment brought to each clinical situation by the patient's family physician. As with all clinical reference resources, they reflect the best understanding of the science of medicine at the time of publication, but they should be used with the clear understanding that continued research may result in new knowledge and recommendations. These recommendations are only one element in the complex process of improving the health of America. To be effective, the recommendations must be implemented.

Clinical Perspective

Hypertension, characterized by persistent blood pressure (BP) elevation, is a pervasive global health issue associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In 2017, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) released updated guidelines for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of hypertension in adults, which introduced revised diagnostic criteria, treatment goals, and management strategies. Compared with the previous Seventh Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure report, these updated 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines resulted in a substantial increase in the prevalence of hypertension among United States adults, a small increase in the percentage of individuals recommended for antihypertensive medications, and stricter BP‐lowering goals for those currently on antihypertensives. Despite the availability of evidence‐based guidelines, diagnosis, adherence to treatment recommendations, and optimal medication use in hypertension management remain crucial for achieving favorable health outcomes.

BP control confers significant mortality benefits from cardiovascular disease, highlighting the need for accurate diagnosis and treatment adherence. Unfortunately, hypertension remains largely uncontrolled, most commonly due to suboptimal daily compliance with medication dosing and early discontinuation of antihypertensive therapy. While many factors contribute to suboptimal adherence, the World Health Organization has identified 5 major categories, including socioeconomic, patient‐related, therapy‐related, condition‐related, and health care–related issues. As demonstrated by Burnier et al, physicians trained in shared decision‐making and proactive communication substantially improved antihypertensive adherence and achievement of BP goals.

Limited research has examined national treatment adherence rates and medication utilization patterns, explicitly following the introduction of the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines. Identifying treatment adherence and medication utilization is crucial for identifying gaps and areas for improvement in hypertension management practices. Thus, this study aims to investigate contemporary hypertension identification and management trends.

### Commentary on the 2014 BP guidelines from the panel appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^116xjPrG]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

The recently published article "2014 Evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: Report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8)" (James et al. JAMA 311: 507–520, 2014) has generated considerable controversy. In this commentary, we evaluate the document and compare the recommendations contained within it with those of the JNC 7 and other national and international guidelines. The evidence quality rating approach followed by the article "2014 Evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: Report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8)" (James et al. JAMA 311: 507–520, 2014) disqualified nearly 98% of previous studies from review; as a result, some of the key recommendations were on the basis of expert opinion alone. We are especially concerned that the recommendation to raise the systolic/diastolic BP levels at which treatment is initiated to ≥ 150/ ≥ 90 mmHg in adults ≥ 60 years old may affect cardiovascular and renal health in these patients. Additionally, we recommend that hypertension guidelines should be updated every 3–4 years with a fresh approach to the definition of target BP levels, the use of modern technology in the diagnosis of hypertension, and the treatment of hypertension in special populations not addressed in earlier guidelines.

This review article summaries the main recommendations in NICE guidelines, and compares them with the American and European guidelines. NICE and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommend diagnosing hypertension at a higher level than the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA). NICE treats to less stringent targets than both the ACC/AHA and the ESC, while using similar, although non-combination pill based, treatment regimens.

### Harmonization of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension blood pressure / hypertension guidelines [^117GgAjo]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The ACC/AHA guideline provides 106 formal recommendations and the ESC/ESH provides 122. In both guidelines, each recommendation is characterized by a class of recommendation that specifies the strength or importance of the recommendation and by a level-of-evidence designation. Both the ESC/ESH and ACC/AHA guideline committees voted on the wording and grading of each recommendation. Both guidelines provide comprehensive advice for prevention, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of high BP/hypertension. As a result, the 2 full reports are relatively long (103 pages for the ACC/AHA and 84 pages for the ESC/ESH). For ease of reading, however, the documents are divided into sections and subsections that use a similar presentation format. In addition, a variety of shorter executive summaries and brief synopses have been published. Guideline authors have published articles that expand on individual guideline topics, provide perspective for the evidence underpinning selected recommendations, and furnish quantitative estimates of potential impact based on universal application of guideline recommendations in their target populations. Last, both guidelines are complemented by publicly available slide sets, CVD risk estimation calculators, and other educational tools.

### Variation in hypertension clinical practice guidelines: a global comparison [^113f1nZY]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Currently, there are many local, national and international guidelines produced by different organisations that give recommendations for the management of hypertension. Studies comparing these guidelines have shown variation in recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment and treatment targets for patients with hypertension. However, these studies compared a small number of guidelines, mainly from HICs and offered only a brief insight into their similarities and differences. Hence, scope exists to compare hypertension guidelines on a far larger scale and, importantly, across income settings.

As a condition for which the affected population predominantly live in LMICs, knowledge of variation in recommendations made to clinicians treating patients with hypertension in these settings remains poorly understood. This study aims to address this deficiency by examining the extent of variation across clinical practice guidelines for the management of hypertension internationally. The primary aim is to determine whether variation exists between CPGs for the management of hypertension through analysis of national and international guidelines from different income settings. Specifically, this study aims to compare the following:
Diagnostic thresholds for hypertension and staging of hypertension
Recommended treatment strategies for uncomplicated primary hypertension (in the absence of comorbidities)
Target BP for patients with uncomplicated primary hypertension
Whether different targets are recommended for the elderly and other at-risk subpopulations

### Blood pressure guidelines-where are we now? [^115pucha]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

In June 2006, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) updated its recommendations on the management of patients with hypertension (published in 2004), in light of "significant new data" relating to drug treatment.1,2 The update, published in collaboration with the British Hypertension Society (BHS), recommended first-line use of a calcium-channel blocker or a thiazide-type diuretic in patients aged over 55 years or an ACE inhibitor in those aged under 55 years, and advised that beta-blockers should no longer be used for routine initial therapy.1 Recently published data from England suggest that primary care prescribing has changed in line with this new guideline.3 However, interpretation of the evidence that underpins some of the key recommendations is open to debate, particularly as there are differences from some other major guidelines in the recommendations for first-line therapy. Here we consider the updated NICE guideline, the rationale for its treatment recommendations, and the subsequent change in clinical practice. In particular, we focus on the initial drug management of adults without conditions such as diabetes mellitus or coronary heart disease that would in themselves be a key determinant of management.

### What is new and different in the 2024 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension? [^113a1pp9]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

In 2024, the European Society of Cardiology released a new guideline for the management of elevated blood pressure (BP) and hypertension. The guideline introduced a new BP categorization: (1) nonelevated (office BP < 120/70 mmHg) for which drug treatment is not recommended, (2) elevated (120–139/70–89 mmHg) for which drug treatment is recommended based on cardiovascular disease risk and follow-up BP level, and (3) hypertension (≥ 140/90 mmHg) for which prompt confirmation and drug treatment are recommended in most individuals. The initial default systolic BP treatment target is 120 to 129 mmHg; however, relaxed targets (BP as low as reasonably achievable) are recommended in case of treatment intolerance, adults ≥ 85 years, symptomatic orthostasis, moderate-to-severe frailty, or limited life expectancy. Here, we summarize what is new and different in the 2024 European Society of Cardiology guidelines, relative to other major international hypertension guidelines in Europe and America. Our aim is to reconcile any uncertainty clinicians may have about implementing these various guidelines in patient care.

Other Topics

Both guidelines provide recommendations for follow-up intervals, with the ACC/AHA CPG suggesting 1 year for reevaluation of adults with a normal BP, 3 to 6 months for those treated with nonpharmacological therapy, and 1 month after initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy followed by 3 to 6 months after meeting the BP goal. The ESC/ESH CPG suggests follow-up within the first 2 months after the initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy, with the caveat that the interval should depend on the severity of hypertension and urgency to achieve BP control. After the desired BP target has been achieved, an interval of a few months is suggested for BP monitoring and 2 years for reassessment of risk factors and evidence of asymptomatic target organ damage. The ESC/ESH CPG recommends achieving BP control within 3 months of initiating therapy, further emphasizing the need to consider initial therapy with combination drugs in most patients to achieve rapid BP control.

Both guidelines provide detailed guidance for detection and management of secondary hypertension, definition and management of resistant hypertension, hypertensive urgencies and emergencies, masked and white coat hypertension, hypertension in older adults, men and women, persons of different race/ethnicity, and patients with various comorbidities and conditions, including heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, CKD, peripheral vascular disease, DM and metabolic syndrome, aortic disease, and pregnancy.

Both guidelines focus considerable attention on strategies to improve adherence to therapy, emphasizing the advantage of single-pill combinations to improve adherence and overcome therapeutic inertia, and team-based care. Both guidelines also focus on implementation, that is, models for delivery of care, use of health information technology, improving quality of care, health literacy, access to care, social and community services, and a patient-specific plan of care. The ESC/ESH provides recommendations for treatment of isolated systolic hypertension, and it recommends reserving device-based treatments of hypertension for research settings. The ESC/ESH provides recommendations for managing concomitant CVD risk with specific recommendations for the use of statins, antiplatelet drugs, and oral anticoagulation (in atrial fibrillation), whereas the ACC/AHA largely defers to other ACC/AHA guidelines that cover these topics. Last, both guidelines identify gaps in evidence and provide a summary key message (ESC/ESH) or BP treatment thresholds and goals (ACC/AHA).

### Research gaps in primary pediatric hypertension [^117G4MpX]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypertension affects > 40% of the US population and is a major contributor to cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality. Although less common among children and adolescents, hypertension affects 1% to 5% of all youth. The 2017 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents provided updates and strategies regarding the diagnosis and management of hypertension in youth. Despite this important information, many gaps in knowledge remain, such as the etiology, prevalence, and trends of hypertension; the utility and practicality of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring; practical goals for lifestyle modification that are generalizable; the long-term end-organ impacts of hypertension in youth; and the long-term safety and efficacy of antihypertensive therapy in youth. The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, in collaboration with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the US Food and Drug Administration, sponsored a workshop of experts to discuss the current state of childhood primary hypertension. We highlight the results of that workshop and aim to (1) provide an overview of current practices related to the diagnosis, management, and treatment of primary pediatric hypertension; (2) identify related research gaps; and (3) propose ways to address existing research gaps.

According to this guideline, hypertensive men 55 or older and women 65 years or older are at higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Moreover, in a simplified classification algorithm of the overall cardiovascular risk, it is stated that risk categories will vary according to age and sex. Regarding alcohol consumption, recommended daily consumption of alcohol is limited to 20 g and 15 g of alcohol for men and women, respectively. Beta blockers should be used in younger women with or planning pregnancy. Fibromuscular dysplasia should always be suspected in women with onset of hypertension below 30 years.

Pregnancy-related aspects

Regarding the management of hypertension during pregnancy, identifiable hypertension-related conditions are pre-existing hypertension, gestational hypertension, pre-existing hypertension with superimposed gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia, and HELLP (i.e. hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) syndrome. 2020 ISH guidelines endorsed the traditional definition of preeclampsia (i.e. hypertension and proteinuria). Optimally, ambulatory BP monitoring should be used to evaluate white coat hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease during pregnancy. Women at high risk of preeclampsia should be identified and treated with 75–162 mg daily aspirin. Drug treatment initiation is reserved for persistent BP of more than 150/95 mmHg for all pregnant women; however, a threshold of 140/90 mmHg may be used in women with hypertension-mediated organ damage. Methyldopa, slow-release nifedipine, nicardipine, and labetalol are preferred to treat mild hypertension. However, methyldopa should be avoided during puerperium, due to the risk of inducing postpartum depression. Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy are associated with an increased risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease in later life.

2018 ESC/ESH Guideline

Sex-related aspects of previous ESC/ESH guidelines before 2018 are reported in Data Supplement. The 2018 ESC/ESH guideline provides an extensive argumentation on sex-related or sex-specific issues for the management of hypertension.

### Strategies for improving the treatment and control of hypertension in Japan [^115bAZHn]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the significant advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension, the burden of hypertension remains a major global health care concern. In Japan, estimates show that more than two-thirds of the population have uncontrolled hypertension, regardless of whether they were taking antihypertensive medication. To improve hypertension management, hypertension guidelines have been developed and updated regularly by hypertension societies across various countries and regions. The Japanese Society of Hypertension (JSH) updated the Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension in 2019 (JSH 2019). The JSH 2019 aims to establish a standard management strategy for hypertension and provide evidence to all health care providers. One of its updated main features is its proposal for multidisciplinary team-based care (TBC) involving physicians, pharmacists, nurses, dietitians, and other health care providers. The TBC will help initiate and intensify the management of hypertension, as well as combat clinical inertia, which is expected to contribute to uncontrolled blood pressure and subsequent development of cardiovascular diseases. This is consistent with the recommendations from recent major guidelines on hypertension management. Moreover, to reduce the evidence-practice gap in hypertension management, it is essential to disseminate the essence of the guidelines and provide hypertension education programs for all health care providers and patients. This review summarizes the points of the JSH 2019-based strategy for improving hypertension management and discusses guidelines for its implementation into actual clinical practice.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: a World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^116K17V8]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a major cause of cardiovascular disease and deaths worldwide especially in low- and middle-income countries. Despite the availability of safe, well-tolerated, and cost-effective blood pressure (BP)-lowering therapies, < 14% of adults with hypertension have BP controlled to a systolic/diastolic BP < 140/90 mmHg. We report new hypertension treatment guidelines, developed in accordance with the World Health Organization Handbook for Guideline Development. Overviews of reviews of the evidence were conducted and summary tables were developed according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach. In these guidelines, the World Health Organization provides the most current and relevant evidence-based guidance for the pharmacological treatment of nonpregnant adults with hypertension. The recommendations pertain to adults with an accurate diagnosis of hypertension who have already received lifestyle modification counseling. The guidelines recommend BP threshold to initiate pharmacological therapy, BP treatment targets, intervals for follow-up visits, and best use of health care workers in the management of hypertension. The guidelines provide guidance for choice of monotherapy or dual therapy, treatment with single pill combination medications, and use of treatment algorithms for hypertension management. Strength of the recommendations was guided by the quality of the underlying evidence; the tradeoffs between desirable and undesirable effects; patient's values, resource considerations and cost-effectiveness; health equity; acceptability, and feasibility consideration of different treatment options. The goal of the guideline is to facilitate standard approaches to pharmacological treatment and management of hypertension which, if widely implemented, will increase the hypertension control rate world-wide.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guideline [^112gDYYh]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and reduction of elevated blood pressure (BP) remains an important intervention for slowing kidney disease progression. Over the past decade, the most appropriate BP target for initiation and titration of BP-lowering medications has been an area of intense research and debate within the clinical community. In 2017, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) in conjunction with several other professional societies released new hypertension guidelines based on data from a systematic review of clinical trials and observational data. While many of the recommendations in the ACC/AHA hypertension guideline are relevant to nephrology practice, BP targets and management strategies for patients receiving dialysis are not discussed. This Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) commentary focuses largely on recommendations from the ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines that are pertinent to individuals at risk of chronic kidney disease or with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease. This KDOQI commentary also includes a brief discussion of the consensus statement regarding hypertension diagnosis and management for adults receiving maintenance dialysis published by the European Renal and Cardiovascular Medicine Working Group of the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA) and the Hypertension and the Kidney working group of the European Society of Hypertension. Overall, we support the vast majority of the ACC/AHA recommendations and highlight select areas in which best diagnosis and treatment options remain controversial.

### Developing hypertension guidelines: an evolving process [^114X8KMZ]. American Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Hypertension guidelines provide up-to-date information and recommendations for hypertension management to healthcare providers, and they facilitate translation of new knowledge into clinical practice. Guidelines represent consensus statements by expert panels, and the process of guideline development has inherent vulnerabilities. Between 1977 and 2003, under the direction of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC) issued 7 reports. The evolution of the JNC recommendations reflects the acquisition of observational and clinical trial data and the availability of newer antihypertensive drugs. Despite 5 years in preparation, NIH did not release a JNC 8 report and recently made the decision to withdraw from issuing guidelines. The responsibility for issuing hypertension-related guidelines was transferred to the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology. Without the endorsement of the NIH or the AHA, JNC 8 committee members recently published their guideline report. Notably, there have been discrepancies of JNC recommendations over time as well as discrepancies with recommendations of other professional organizations. The Institute of Medicine recently recommended criteria for "trustworthy" guidelines. Criticisms of the guideline process, and of the guidelines themselves, should not obscure their likely contribution to improved hypertension control and to decreases of mortality rates of stroke and cardiovascular disease over the past several decades. Nevertheless, translation of guidelines into clinical practice remains a challenge.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^114FFvZw]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — blood pressure targets: In patients (≥ 65 years), SBP should be targeted to between 130 and 140 mmHg and diastolic BP (DBP) to < 80 mmHg, and treated SBP should not be targeted to < 120 mmHg. The guideline specifies a target range because the lower safety boundary assumes greater importance when BP is targeted to lower levels, and when SBP is lowered to < 120 mmHg in patients included in randomized controlled trials (older and higher-risk patients with comorbidities and cardiovascular disease), the risk of harm appears to increase and outweigh the benefits.

EUROPEAN SOCIETY OF HYPERTENSION GUIDELINES

Historically, essential hypertension represents one of the first clinical conditions for which diagnostic and therapeutic clinical guidelines have been developed. The first official guideline paper dates back to 1977 when the Joint National Committee in the United States released the document, which was revised few years later in a new paper jointly issued by an 'ad hoc' Committee of the WHO in conjunction with the International Society of Hypertension (ISH). During the last decade of the XX century, updated versions of the guidelines document have been prepared by the previously mentioned organizations in collaboration with American scientific societies. The first guideline document prepared by European Societies dates back to 2003, when the ESH together with the European Society of Cardiology jointly signed the European guidelines document. New guidelines followed in 2007, 2013 and 2018, the latter being as previously mentioned, the most frequently cited paper in the worldwide medical literature. The new guidelines document, released during the 32nd European Meeting on Hypertension held in Milan in 2023 and published in the Journal of Hypertension, represents the most updated document on the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension.

Although an in-depth analysis of the guidelines is beyond the scope of this article, it should be mentioned that the 2023 guidelines document addresses a number of critical issues in the field of hypertension diagnosis and treatment, also offering to the readers elements of novelties. These include, for example, the thresholds and targets of the blood pressure-lowering intervention, the relevance of out-of-office blood pressure measurements, the modern quantification of cardiovascular risk, the greater use of organ damage measures, the upgrading of beta-blocking drugs to the level of major antihypertensive agents and the wider choice of drug combination between major drugs, with confirmation of their strategic role as first-line and subsequent treatment in the majority of patients. Finally, emphasis has been given to the treatment strategies based on renal denervation, particularly but not exclusively in drug-resistant hypertension, and to the patient's follow-up modalities, including the careful assessment of nonadherence as a fundamental barrier to the long-term blood pressure control.

Finally, given the importance of primary care providers in the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the hypertensive state, ESH has decided to provide a novel concise format of the guidelines, the so called '2024 Clinical Practice Guidelines', for implementation into current clinical practice. The four pillars of these practice guidelines include the accurate diagnostic approach, the assessment of the patient's cardiovascular risk profile, the careful selection of the treatment strategy and the long-term evaluation of the blood pressure response.

### Variation in hypertension clinical practice guidelines: a global comparison [^114B8PeJ]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study identified 48 national and international guidelines for the management of hypertension. BP thresholds for the diagnosis and staging of hypertension, as well as BP target recommendations, were largely consistent across guidelines and across income settings. However, recommendations on antihypertensive drug therapy at each treatment step differed greatly, with guidelines from higher-income settings offering greater clinician autonomy in choice of antihypertensive drugs and dual-combination therapies, in contrast to lower-income settings, which may reflect drug costs or availability. The variation seen may represent the lack of a robust evidence base on management, particularly for lower-income settings, given research is focused on higher-income countries. Further research is needed to explore the reasons for such divergence in guidelines to better inform those involved in their creation and the clinicians using them.

### Development of quality indicators for hypertension management at the primary health care level in South Africa [^111XjMwP]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Quality indicators measure whether the evidence-based guidelines regarding the current management of hypertension are being implemented and can provide data to monitor the achievement of programme outcomes. However, currently in South Africa there is no agreed minimum set of indicators to assess the quality of care and to monitor progress towards attainment of the hypertension objectives set out in these initiatives. Developing and testing quality indicators as part of a multiple approach is key to strengthening health programmes and enhancing the quality and efficiency of clinical services. This has implications not only for the management of hypertension in South Africa but also across Africa, given current concerns. Consequently, the aim of this study was to develop evidence-based quality indicators for hypertension management and monitoring at the PHC level for South Africa.

### New high blood pressure guidelines: back on track with lower treatment goals, but implementation challenges abound [^115NdXYT]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The recently released 2017 High Blood Pressure Guidelines depart from past guidelines in both their approach and recommendations. Developed by multiple health organizations, including the American College of Preventive Medicine, the guidelines continue to define normal blood pressure as < 120/80 mmHg, but now define hypertension as ≥ 130/80 mmHg (previously ≥ 140/90 mmHg). This change categorizes 101 million Americans (46% of adults) as hypertensive (compared to 32% previously). The guidelines rely heavily on findings from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT). This clinical trial demonstrated substantial reductions in key adverse outcomes from intensive blood pressure management (goal systolic blood pressure < 120 mmHg) compared to standard treatment (< 140 mmHg). The guidelines emphasize non-drug strategies for blood pressure management, particularly healthy diet, several forms of physical activity, reduction in sodium intake, enhancement of potassium intake, reduction in alcohol use, and weight loss. A risk-based approach is recommended for drug therapy. Individuals with an elevated 10-year risk of future cardiovascular disease events should receive drug therapies for blood pressures ≥ 130/80 mmHg, whereas those at lower risk should receive antihypertensive medications for blood pressures ≥ 140/90 mmHg. Given that high blood pressure is poorly managed even with easier-to-reach goals, effective implementation of the guidelines will present significant challenges. The guidelines suggest that successful implementation requires the adoption of new models of chronic disease care, including team-based care, telehealth, a shift towards self-management, better approaches to patient adherence, and use of home blood pressure monitoring. Attention to systems level issues is much needed, including population-based management, aligned financial incentives, improved health literacy, community interventions, and improved access to primary care and medications.

Other Limitations

There are several limitations to consider in the JNC 8 committee's approach to BP treatment (Table 2). Unlike the other professional societies' guidelines, the JNC 8 panel did not address topics outside of their chosen critical questions, specifically given the paucity of randomized trial evidence addressing such questions. While they endorsed the AHA/ACC Guideline on Lifestyle Management to Reduce Cardiovascular Risk, 50 the JNC 8 does not address lifestyle modifications or a timeline for attempting them. Another limitation is that ambulatory BP monitoring, including cut‐off values for diagnosing hypertension based on home BP readings, is not addressed.

Table 2
Recommendations for the AHA/ACC Committee

One suggestion is to confirm elevated BP with ambulatory BP monitoring, such as that recently recommended by the US Preventive Service Task Force. 51 There is in general a lack of guidance on the diagnosis of hypertension and the evaluation for secondary causes. Although the JNC 8 committee offers a titration schedule for treating hypertension, the recommendations are somewhat vague, and there is no guidance for resistant hypertension beyond referral to a hypertension specialist.

We also recommend that the AHA/ACC guideline committee focus on the benefits of the various drug classes and the situations that call for monodrug versus multidrug therapy. Another important area of focus will be the benefit of more‐intensive BP treatment, especially in the elderly and those with diabetes, and the addition of a risk‐based approach to initiating treatment (described earlier). These are all areas that can be targeted by the new AHA/ACC guideline committee.

### High blood pressure: ACC / AHA releases updated guideline… [^113bbWPz]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Accurate measurement of blood pressure is essential to categorize blood pressure, stratify cardiovascular risk, and guide management.
- A target blood pressure of less than 130/80 mm Hg is recommended for adults with confirmed hypertension and cardiovascular disease, or a 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk of 10% or more.
- Adults with elevated blood pressure or stage 1 hypertension whose estimated 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is less than 10% should be treated with nonpharmacologic interventions. From the AFP Editors. Definitions To prevent and treat hypertension, BP should first be categorized as normal, elevated, stage 1 hypertension, or stage 2 hypertension.

Treatment Goals A target BP of less than 130/80 mm Hg is recommended for adults with confirmed hypertension and CVD or a 10-year atherosclerotic CVD risk of 10% or more. A target of less than 130/80 mm Hg may be reasonable for adults with confirmed hypertension but no additional markers of increased CVD risk. Target BPs for adults with hypertension and comorbid conditions are shown in. Follow-Up Adults with elevated BP or stage 1 hypertension whose estimated 10-year risk of atherosclerotic CVD is less than 10% should be treated with nonpharmacologic interventions and reevaluated in three to six months. Those with stage 1 hypertension whose estimated risk is 10% or more should receive BP-lowering therapy in conjunction with nonpharmacologic interventions, then undergo repeat evaluation in one month.

Adults with stage 2 hypertension should be evaluated by or referred to a primary care physician within one month, receive a combination of nonpharmacologic interventions and BP-lowering medications, and undergo repeat evaluation in one month. Adults with very high BPs should be evaluated quickly and provided drug therapy.

### Case-based applications of the 2025 AHA / ACC / multispecialty high blood pressure guideline [^111Uraa4]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension affects nearly half of all adults in the United States and is the leading, preventable cause of cardiovascular disease worldwide. The American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and 11 other professional organizations recently published an updated 2025 guideline to reflect the latest advances in the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure. To bridge the gap between this guideline update and individualized patient care, this Special Article presents 4 hypothetical cases of high blood pressure, focusing on management in the outpatient setting. These cases illustrate how to apply a risk-based approach to high blood pressure management that incorporates blood pressure levels, cardiovascular disease risk factors and the predicting risk of cardiovascular disease events cardiovascular disease equations. They also highlight notable updates in the 2025 guideline such as recommendations for lifestyle approaches, initiation of medications, blood pressure goals, primary aldosteronism screening, and management of high blood pressure before, during and after pregnancy. By contextualizing the 2025 guideline within these hypothetical case scenarios, this Special Article provides practical guidance to health care teams to offer the most up-to-date, evidence-based care of high blood pressure.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^115hfUxF]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — new evidence on systolic and diastolic targets: Prior guidance recommended an office blood pressure (BP) target of < 140/90 mmHg with no obvious incremental benefit of lowering BP to < 130/80 mmHg, but newer RCTs and meta-analyses refine thresholds. In post hoc analyses, compared with 130–139 mmHg, lowering systolic BP (SBP) to < 130 mmHg was generally not associated with further benefit on major cardiovascular (CV) events, and reducing SBP to < 120 mmHg increased the incidence of CV events and death. The SPRINT trial compared SBP targets < 140 vs < 120 mmHg in > 9000 high-risk patients (excluding diabetes or previous stroke), where achieved SBP 121 vs 136 mmHg yielded a 25% reduction in major CV events and a 27% reduction in all-cause death, though interpretation is influenced by unattended automated office BP measurement and the possibility that SPRINT BP values correspond to conventional office SBPs in the 130–140 and 140–150 mmHg ranges. Meta-analyses stratified achieved SBP into 149–140 mmHg, 139–130 mmHg, and < 130 mmHg, and one analysis found every 10 mmHg SBP reduction reduced major CV events and death down to baseline SBP 130–139 mmHg, with benefit also reported when baseline SBP was < 130 mmHg and achieved values < 120 mmHg; however, the incremental benefit decreased as targets were lowered, and more intensive targets must be weighed against an increased risk of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events. Notably, < 50% of patients treated for hypertension currently achieve a target office SBP of < 140 mmHg.

### An effective approach to high blood pressure control: a science advisory from the American Heart Association, the American college of cardiology, and the centers for disease control and prevention [^114mB11i]. Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

We believe that identification of best practice, evidence–based management algorithms leading to standardization of treatment is a critical element in helping to achieve these ambitious national goals at a population level. In this paper, we describe the value of hypertension treatment algorithms, provide criteria for effective hypertension management algorithms, describe an AHA/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/CDC-recommended treatment algorithm based on current guidelines and describe examples of other specific algorithms that have been associated with improved blood pressure on a large scale.

### Consistency of recommendations for evaluation and management of hypertension [^1176YRHu]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Hypertension is very common, but guideline recommendations for hypertension have been controversial, are of increasing interest, and have profound implications.

Objective

To systematically assess the consistency of recommendations regarding hypertension management across clinical practice guidelines (CPGs).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study of hypertension management recommendations included CPGs that had been published as of April 2018. Two point-of-care resources that provided graded recommendations were included for secondary analyses. Discrete and unambiguous specifications of the population, intervention, and comparison states were used to define a series of reference recommendations. Three raters reached consensus on coding the direction and strength of each recommendation made by each CPG. Three independent raters reached consensus on the importance of each reference recommendation.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcomes were rates of consistency for direction and strength among CPGs. Sensitivity analyses testing the robustness were conducted by excluding recommendation statements that were described as insufficient evidence, excluding single recommendation sources, and stratifying by importance of recommendations.

Results

The analysis included 8 CPGs with a total of 71 reference recommendations, 68 of which had clear recommendations from 2 or more CPGs. Across CPGs, 22 recommendations (32%) were consistent in direction and strength, 18 recommendations (27%) were consistent in direction but inconsistent in strength, and 28 recommendations (41%) were inconsistent in direction. The rate of consistency was lower in secondary analyses. When insufficient evidence ratings were excluded, there was still substantial inconsistency, and a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis suggested the inconsistency could not be attributed to any single recommendation source. Inconsistency in direction was more common for recommendations deemed to be of lower importance (11 of 20 recommendations [55%]), but 17 of 48 high-importance recommendations (35%) had inconsistency in direction.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hypertension is a common chronic condition with widespread expectations surrounding guideline-based care, yet CPGs have a high rate of inconsistency. Further investigations should determine the reasons for inconsistency, the implications for recommendation development, and the role of synthesis across recommendations for optimal guidance of clinical care.

### Investigation and management of young-onset hypertension: British and Irish hypertension society position statement [^117AmU7m]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

National and international hypertension guidelines recommend that adults with young-onset hypertension (aged < 40 years at diagnosis) are reviewed by a hypertension specialist to exclude secondary causes of hypertension and optimise therapeutic regimens. A recent survey among UK secondary care hypertension specialist physicians highlighted variations in the investigation of such patients. In this position statement, the British and Irish Hypertension Society seek to provide clinicians with a practical approach to the investigation and management of adults with young-onset hypertension. We aim to ensure that individuals receive consistent and high-quality care across the UK and Ireland, to highlight gaps in the current evidence, and to identify important future research questions.

### European guidelines for hypertension in 2024: a comparison of key recommendations for clinical practice [^113vwMGX]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension is the most prevalent modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality globally. Suboptimal control of elevated blood pressure places a substantial burden on health-care systems worldwide. Several factors contribute to this suboptimal control, such as limited awareness of hypertension, lack of appropriate diagnosis and poor control of blood pressure among those with a diagnosis. These factors can be due to patient non-adherence to treatment, inertia among health-care professionals and low uptake and implementation of clinical guideline recommendations. From 2003 to 2018, the European Society of Hypertension and the European Society of Cardiology jointly published four sets of guidelines on hypertension. However, the two societies released separate guidelines on hypertension in 2023 and 2024, respectively. These two sets of European guidelines agree on most recommendations, but some differences have been identified. In this Expert Recommendation, we highlight the key consensus recommendations from the two guidelines; compare differing approaches to the definition, classification, diagnosis and treatment of hypertension; and aim to help health-care professionals in their decision-making to improve the management of hypertension and to reduce the burden of hypertension-associated outcomes and premature deaths.

### Hypertension guidelines: criteria that might make them more clinically useful [^113ZmA3w]. American Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease prevention depends on reduction of risk factors, including hypertension. Guidelines designed to improve management of hypertension are widely available. Their purpose is to assemble the available data from basic biomedical science, epidemiology, and clinical science in an accessible form with which physicians and patients can make reasoned decisions for individual cases. However, guidelines have been neither widely accepted, nor effectively implemented. We recommend a strategy for guideline preparation designed to yield a product more user friendly, accessible, and effective. Guideline recommendations and the evidence used to make them should be based on an explicit grading system. Relevant clinical as well as nonclinical factors must be considered. Moreover, because the goal of antihypertensive therapy is to prevent cardiovascular events, and the likelihood of such events is determined by multifactor or absolute risk assessment, risk, rather than level of blood pressure (BP), should determine the need for therapy. Similarly, the benefit of therapy must be assessed by reduction in cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality.

### Editors' commentary on the 2023 ESH management of arterial hypertension guidelines [^111HNZQC]. Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines are ideally suited to the provision of advice on the prevention, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure (BP). The recently published European Society of Hypertension (ESH) 2023 ESH Guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension is the latest in a long series of high BP clinical practice guidelines. It closely resembles the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/ESH guidelines, with incremental rather than major changes. Although the ESH guidelines are primarily written for European clinicians and public health workers, there is a high degree of concordance between its recommendations and those in the other major BP guidelines. Despite the large number of national and international BP guidelines around the world, general population surveys demonstrate that BP guidelines are not being well implemented in any part of the world. The level of BP, which is the basis for diagnosis and management, continues to be poorly measured in routine clinical practice and control of hypertension remains suboptimal, even to a conservative BP target such as a systolic/diastolic BP < 140/90 mmHg. BP guidelines need to focus much more on implementation of recommendations for accurate diagnosis and strategies for improved control in those being treated for hypertension. An evolving body of implementation science can assist in meeting this goal. Given the enormous health, social, and financial burden of high BP, better diagnosis and management should be an imperative for clinicians, government, and others responsible for the provision of health care services. Hopefully, the 2023 ESH will help enable this.

### Blood pressure and the new ACC / AHA hypertension guidelines [^115GPRbD]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines cover virtually all aspects of the diagnosis, evaluation, monitoring, secondary causes as well as drug and non-drug treatment of hypertension. Substantial and appropriate emphasis has been given to the strategies necessary for accurate measurement of blood pressure in any setting where valid blood pressure measurements are desired. Most "errors" made during blood pressure measurement bias readings upwards resulting in over-diagnosis of hypertension and, amongst those already on drug therapy, underestimating the true magnitude of blood pressure lowering resulting in over-treatment. Hypertension is diagnosed when blood pressure is consistently ≥ 130 and/or ≥ 80 mm Hg. However, the majority of patients with hypertension between 130–139/80–89 mm Hg (stage 1 hypertension) do not qualify for immediate drug therapy. The guideline breaks new ground with some of its recommendations. Absolute cardiovascular risk is utilized, for the first time, to determine high-risk status when BP 130–139/80–89 mm Hg (Stage 1 hypertension) and high-risk patient characteristics/co-morbidities are absent including age 65 and older, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, known cardiovascular disease; high-risk individuals initiate drug therapy when BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg. The exception amongst high-risk individuals is for secondary stroke prevention in drug naïve individuals as drug therapy is initiated when blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. Non-high risk individuals will initiate drug therapy when BP is ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. Irrespective of blood pressure threshold for initiation of drug therapy, the target BP is minimally < 130/80 mm Hg in most. However, target BP is < 130 systolic amongst those 65 and older as the committee made no recommendation for a DBP target. Treatment should be initiated with two drugs having complementary mechanisms of action when blood pressure is > 20/10 mm Hg above goal.

### Advancing risk-based approaches in blood pressure management: reflections on the 2025 AHA / ACC statement [^116x7BGU]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure (BP) management strategies have evolved substantially over recent decades, shifting from approaches based exclusively on BP thresholds to the adoption of multidimensional, risk-based decision making. Within this context, the 2025 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) Scientific Statement on the use of risk assessment in BP managementrepresents a further welcome advancement towards aligning clinical practice with contemporary evidence. The Statement offers a robust and evidence-informed framework for risk-based BP management. However, in our view, some key issues remain that are worth highlighting.

### Harmonization of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension blood pressure / hypertension guidelines [^115PhMLy]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension clinical practice guidelines for management of high blood pressure/hypertension are influential documents. Both guidelines are comprehensive, were developed using rigorous processes, and underwent extensive peer review. The most notable difference between the 2 guidelines is the blood pressure cut points recommended for the diagnosis of hypertension. There are also differences in the timing and intensity of treatment, with the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline recommending a somewhat more intensive approach. Overall, there is substantial concordance in the recommendations provided by the 2 guideline-writing committees, with greater congruity between them than their predecessors. Additional harmonization of future guidelines would help to underscore the commonality of their core recommendations and could serve to catalyze changes in practice that would lead to improved prevention, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension, worldwide.
