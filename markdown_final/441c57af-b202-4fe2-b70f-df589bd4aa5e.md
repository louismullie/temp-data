## Question

When is a ddimer accurate

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when a D‑dimer test can be considered "accurate". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical question and the pre‑test probability (PTP) framework. Then, I should verify assay type and analytical performance. Next, I will examine cut‑off strategies (standard, age‑adjusted, and PTP‑adjusted) and special populations like pregnancy. After that, I need to check syndrome‑specific nuances such as acute aortic dissection. Finally, I should integrate pitfalls like timing, embolus size, preanalytical factors, and overuse, and end with operational rules for declaring a D‑dimer "accurate" in context.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: D‑dimer is primarily a rule‑out test, whose safety and "accuracy" hinge on a low or intermediate PTP determined by a validated clinical decision rule (Wells, revised Geneva, or a validated algorithm like YEARS), with imaging reserved for high PTP patients; using D‑dimer in high PTP increases failure rates and is discouraged by contemporary guidance, even as the direct evidence base in the highest‑risk strata is limited [^113UHRKg] [^113kRJDw] [^114nesFZ] [^115gdtqy].

> Hold on, I should verify the assay landscape because "accuracy" also depends on test sensitivity: quantitative ELISA, ELFA, and modern quantitative latex assays are highly sensitive (generally ≥ 93–97%), whereas whole‑blood qualitative or semi‑quantitative assays (for example, SimpliRED) are less sensitive and therefore less safe for rule‑out unless paired with very low PTP and careful algorithms [^115P1Co8] [^111YD3Bi] [^111CUH5f].

> Initially, I was going to say point‑of‑care (POC) quantitative assays perform similarly to central lab ELISA, but wait, let me verify the data and not jump to conclusions: in head‑to‑head work, the Triage POC assay showed lower sensitivity than a lab ELISA (about 91% vs 98%), while pooled analyses suggest quantitative POC methods can approach lab performance yet still vary by platform and threshold; so I should correct myself — POC quantitative tests can be useful, but assay‑specific sensitivity matters and can be lower than central lab ELISA in some studies [^112Qkt9h] [^11112JGv] [^111j5XUn].

> I need to ensure unit interpretation is correct because FEU and DDU can mislead if interchanged; FEU cut‑offs of 500 ng/mL correspond roughly to 250 ng/mL DDU, but laboratories differ, and age‑adjusted formulas derived in FEU do not automatically translate to DDU without validation; moreover, lack of global standardization complicates cross‑platform interpretation, so I should double‑check the local method, units, and manufacturer‑approved decision limits before declaring a result "negative" [^1169A3VB] [^114hsAB7] [^114K89Ly] [^112rL2NR].

> Next, I should review cut‑off strategies; the conventional threshold of 500 µg/L FEU works for low/intermediate PTP but loses specificity with age; age‑adjusted cut‑offs (age × 10 µg/L for patients > 50 years) restore specificity while maintaining sensitivity ≥ 97% across older strata and raise the proportion of patients safely avoiding imaging, with NPVs typically ≥ 99% in non‑high PTP cohorts [^117Rxa3x] [^112jpuht] [^117Rxa3x] [^111KWbcx] [^114KVDRH].

> Let me consider PTP‑adjusted thresholds because they may further reduce imaging; selective strategies using higher cut‑offs in low PTP (for example, < 1.0 µg/mL) and standard cut‑offs in moderate PTP can safely exclude VTE while improving specificity and decreasing ultrasounds, albeit with a very small trade‑off in failure rates in some comparisons; I should confirm that any adopted strategy mirrors those validated in trials and IPD meta‑analyses before applying it locally [^116NJWJD] [^117YBSbL] [^112QAqKG] [^114nx8TY].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant; I should verify a pregnancy‑adapted approach like the YEARS algorithm or validated pregnancy strategies, which consistently show very high sensitivity and NPV for rule‑out in low/intermediate PTP pregnant patients, recognizing that specificity is limited because D‑dimer rises physiologically and that some algorithms allow higher thresholds in very low PTP to safely reduce imaging [^111BAkcE] [^115or3pN] [^116vh9Xu] [^111mRXm3].

> I need to check syndrome specificity; if the clinical question is acute aortic dissection, a low or negative D‑dimer cannot be used as a stand‑alone screen due to false negatives in subsets like intramural hematoma and variable study populations; imaging remains mandatory when suspicion is nontrivial, so "accuracy" in this syndrome is insufficient for rule‑out without clinical and imaging correlation [^1145UCn5] [^114XdoMX].

> Let me think about factors that erode sensitivity; subsegmental PE is a known gap where D‑dimer sensitivity drops relative to more proximal clot burden, so a "negative" in a patient with worrisome features for distal emboli may be falsely reassuring; also, timing matters — D‑dimer appears within about 2 hours of clot formation and declines with a half‑life near 6 hours, and perioperative elevations can persist for weeks, so I should align sampling with symptom onset and understand post‑surgical kinetics [^115CB3mB] [^115MCfmo].

> Hold on, I should review preanalytical and contextual pitfalls; assay variability, preanalytical handling, and comorbid inflammatory, malignant, or renal conditions can raise D‑dimer and diminish specificity, fueling overuse; guidelines even advise against routine D‑dimer in asymptomatic post‑COVID or long COVID evaluations, underscoring the need to order the test only when it will change management within an algorithm [^111CUH5f] [^113VjdMm] [^112Qi91G] [^114Q7wUS].

> I should confirm setting applicability; much of the safety data for D‑dimer rule‑out comes from outpatients with suspected first events, whereas inpatients have higher baseline D‑dimer and less robust exclusion evidence, so inpatient "accuracy" is lower and imaging thresholds should be correspondingly cautious; prospective management studies reinforce that combining PTP assessment with D‑dimer safely excludes DVT in a sizable outpatient subset [^111XAuCs] [^116KWqnW].

> Next, I will examine what "accurate" means operationally; in a patient with low or intermediate PTP, tested with a highly sensitive, well‑validated quantitative assay, using the correct unit‑specific and population‑appropriate cut‑off (standard, age‑adjusted, or PTP‑adjusted), a negative D‑dimer has an NPV around or above 99% for ruling out VTE, which is clinically "accurate" for the intended purpose; conversely, in high PTP, in poorly sensitive assays, with misapplied units/cut‑offs, or in syndromes like suspected aortic dissection, a "negative" is not accurate enough to obviate imaging [^113UHRKg] [^113kRJDw] [^117Rxa3x] [^116NJWJD] [^114XdoMX].

> Finally, let me summarize the verification steps I must follow before trusting a "negative" D‑dimer: I should double‑check clinical probability with a validated rule, verify the assay type and its sensitivity, confirm the reporting units and the correct threshold strategy for this patient (standard, age‑adjusted, or PTP‑adjusted), apply pregnancy‑adapted algorithms when relevant, and avoid relying on D‑dimer in high‑PTP VTE or as a sole screen for suspected aortic dissection, proceeding directly to imaging when indicated [^113UHRKg] [^114iWSdG] [^112QAqKG] [^111BAkcE] [^114nesFZ] [^114XdoMX].

D-dimer is most accurate for **ruling out VTE in low/intermediate risk** outpatients [^116NJWJD] when combined with a validated clinical decision rule [^113UHRKg] and a high-sensitivity assay [^112rULpX] [^113kRJDw]. It is **less accurate in high-risk patients**, inpatients, or those with cancer, recent surgery, trauma, pregnancy, or inflammation, where false positives are common and imaging is often required [^111XAuCs] [^113UHRKg]. Age-adjusted cutoffs improve specificity in older adults [^114iWSdG] without compromising safety [^117Rxa3x]. D-dimer is not reliable for ruling out VTE in high-risk patients [^114nesFZ] or for confirming VTE [^113kRJDw] [^113UHRKg], and is not recommended as a sole test for acute aortic dissection [^114XdoMX] [^1145UCn5] or in asymptomatic patients [^113VjdMm].

## Clinical scenarios where D-dimer is accurate

### Exclusion of venous thromboembolism (VTE)

- **Low or intermediate pretest probability**: D-dimer is highly accurate for excluding VTE (DVT or PE) [^113kRJDw] in outpatients with low or intermediate pretest probability [^116NJWJD] when combined with a validated clinical decision rule (e.g. Wells or Geneva) [^113UHRKg].

- **Age-adjusted cutoffs**: In patients over 50, age-adjusted cutoffs (age × 10 µg/L) increase specificity [^114iWSdG] without compromising sensitivity, reducing unnecessary imaging [^111KWbcx].

- **Pregnancy**: In pregnant women [^111mRXm3] with low or intermediate pretest probability, D-dimer has high sensitivity and negative predictive value, allowing safe exclusion of VTE without imaging [^116vh9Xu].

---

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)

D-dimer is **a cornerstone for diagnosing and monitoring DIC** [^113kRJDw] [^113UHRKg], and elevated levels reflect ongoing coagulation and fibrinolysis [^113kRJDw].

---

## Clinical scenarios where D-dimer is less accurate

### High pretest probability of VTE

In patients with high clinical probability, D-dimer testing is **not recommended** [^114nesFZ] because of its lower negative predictive value and a higher risk of diagnostic failure [^113UHRKg]. Imaging is required [^116NJWJD].

---

### Hospitalized patients and specific conditions

In hospitalized patients, D-dimer **accuracy is reduced** [^111XAuCs] because comorbidities and ongoing coagulation activation are common [^113kRJDw]. In conditions such as cancer, recent surgery, trauma, or inflammation, D-dimer is frequently elevated, which reduces specificity and necessitates imaging [^113UHRKg].

---

### Acute aortic dissection

D-dimer **cannot reliably rule out** acute aortic dissection [^1145UCn5] because of false negatives in intramural hematomas. Imaging is required [^114XdoMX].

---

## Factors influencing D-dimer accuracy

| **Factor** | **Influence on accuracy** |
|-|-|
| Clinical probability | High accuracy in low/intermediate probability [^116NJWJD]; low accuracy in high probability [^113UHRKg] |
| Age | Specificity decreases with age [^112jpuht]; age-adjusted cutoffs improve accuracy [^114iWSdG] |
| Pregnancy | Physiological increase reduces specificity; still useful with low/intermediate probability [^111mRXm3] [^116vh9Xu] |
| Comorbidities | Cancer, inflammation, recent surgery, trauma reduce specificity [^113UHRKg] [^113kRJDw] |
| Assay type | High-sensitivity assays preferred [^115P1Co8]; variability exists among assays [^112rULpX] |

## Summary of D-dimer accuracy

- **Highly accurate**: Excluding VTE in low/intermediate probability outpatients [^114iWSdG], especially with age-adjusted cutoffs [^116NJWJD].

- **Less accurate**: High-risk patients, inpatients [^111XAuCs], cancer, recent surgery, trauma, inflammation [^113kRJDw], pregnancy.

- **Not recommended**: Sole test for acute aortic dissection [^114XdoMX] or in asymptomatic patients [^113VjdMm].

### D-dimer as the sole screening test for acute aortic dissection: A review of the literature [^1145UCn5]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Recent studies have proposed the use of D-dimer as a screening tool to "rule out" acute aortic dissection, claiming a sensitivity approaching 100%. We reviewed the literature to determine whether D-dimer can be used as the sole screening tool for acute aortic dissection. An Ovid MEDLINE search from 1966 to present was performed with the keywords "aortic dissection", "fibrin degradation products", and "D-dimer", limited to "human" and "English language".

Ten original research articles were identified that directly addressed the use of D-dimer in acute aortic dissection. There appears to be a subset of patients with acute aortic dissection who develop intramural hematomas, frequently found to have low or negative D-dimer levels. In addition, none of the studies reviewed defined a specific patient population eligible for D-dimer screening, and many of the studies had wide sensitivity confidence intervals (CIs) due to low patient numbers. Despite a high sensitivity, D-dimer cannot be recommended as the sole screening tool for acute aortic dissection.

Ten per 100,000 Americans will have an acute aortic dissection, and missing the diagnosis may be catastrophic. A definitive diagnosis of aortic dissection largely relies on advanced radiographic imaging, either invasive or noninvasive. However, 38% of dissections are missed on initial evaluation, and there are no validated clinical decision rules for the clinical diagnosis of acute aortic dissection. Clinical suspicion and chest radiograph findings were the only tools for determining which patients require further imaging until r

### Diagnostic accuracy of conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values in older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^114iWSdG]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to review the diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer testing in older patients (over 50 years) with suspected venous thromboembolism, using conventional or age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off values.

- **Design**: This research was a systematic review and bivariate random effects meta-analysis.

- **Data sources**: Researchers searched Medline and Embase for studies published before June 21, 2012, and contacted the authors of primary studies.

- **Study selection**: The primary studies included enrolled older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism in whom D-dimer testing using both conventional (500 µg/L) and age-adjusted (age × 10 µg/L) cut-off values and reference testing were performed. For patients with a non-high clinical probability, 2×2 tables were reconstructed and stratified by age category and applied D-dimer cut-off level.

- **Results**: The meta-analysis included 13 cohorts comprising 12,497 patients with a non-high clinical probability. The specificity of the conventional cut-off value decreased with increasing age: 57.6% (95% confidence interval 51.4% to 63.6%) for patients aged 51–60 years, 39.4% (33.5% to 45.6%) for those aged 61–70, 24.5% (20.0% to 29.7%) for those aged 71–80, and 14.7% (11.3% to 18.6%) for those aged over 80. Age-adjusted cut-off values showed higher specificities across all age categories: 62.3% (56.2% to 68.0%), 49.5% (43.2% to 55.8%), 44.2% (38.0% to 50.5%), and 35.2% (29.4% to 41.5%), respectively. Sensitivities of the age-adjusted cut-off remained above 97% in all age categories.

- **Conclusions**: The application of age-adjusted cut-off values for D-dimer tests substantially increases specificity.

### How we manage a high D-dimer [^113UHRKg]. Haematologica (2024). Low credibility.

Several scores have been developed to assess the clinical probability of VTE. The most used are the Wells and Geneva scores. In addition, a simplified and validated version of the Geneva score has been developed to widen its adoption in clinical practice. The combination of a negative D-dimer ELISA and low-intermediate pre-test clinical probability excludes DVT or pulmonary embolism in approximately 30% of cases with suspected VTE, with no need for imaging (i.e. venous ultrasonography for suspected DVT and computed tomography [CT] pulmonary angiogram for suspected pulmonary embolism). Conversely, D-dimer is not recommended in patients with a high clinical probability because a normal result does not exclude VTE, even when a highly sensitive assay is used; these cases should directly undergo imaging without D-dimer testing.

Notably, as D-dimer levels increase with age, an age-adjusted cutoff (age × 10 µg/L for patients aged > 50 years) rather than a fixed cutoff (< 500 µg/L) is warranted to exclude VTE in patients with low or intermediate pre-test clinical probability. Although impaired renal function has been suggested to affect D-dimer levels in individuals suspected of having VTE, its influence seems to be less important than age.

D-dimer testing in combination with a clinical pre-test probability assessment (YEARS criteria or revised GENEVA score) has also been used for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism in pregnant women with the aim of avoiding unnecessary imaging.

### Response to the comment: "Advocating prudent D-dimer testing: constructive perspectives and comments on 'How we manage a high D-dimer'" [^111C8uTr]. Haematologica (2024). Low credibility.

We would like to thank Gonzaga and de Alencas for their letter. Their comments on our review article, "How we manage a high D-dimer", recently published in Haematologica, are reasonable and well substantiated. The main objective of our review was to simplify the particularly complex topic of increased D-dimer levels to provide a handy tool for the daily clinical practice of hematologists.

The authors made two comments on our narrative review. We agree with Gonzaga and de Alencas's first comment that D-dimer may carry a high positive predictive value in selected pathological conditions characterized by a very high pre-test probability. However, in our review, we referred (always for reasons of practicality) to the main clinical setting for which the D-dimer is used, which is pulmonary embolism exclusion. In this setting, to ensure optimal patient management, an ideal D-dimer test should have very high sensitivity and a very high negative predictive value.

Regarding the second comment on the inappropriateness and overuse of the D-dimer test in most cases, we also agree with the authors. Unfortunately, the D-dimer test has become very common practice, at least in Italy, and its use has exponentially increased over the last few years (hence the nickname "D-dimeritis"), particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is clear, however, that an elevated D-dimer in an individual referred by the general practitioner to the hematologist cannot be ignored, but all the diagnostic procedures listed in Figure 3 of our review have to be implemented to rule out or diagnose the possible conditions.

### Decision-making with D-dimer in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^115qeJk9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The measurement of D-dimer can provide useful information to aid in the diagnosis of patients with suspected venous thromboembolism. D-dimer measurement, in conjunction with adequate estimation of pretest probability, can facilitate the safe discharge of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism and limit unnecessary investigation or anticoagulation. We review clinical decision-making strategies in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and propose means to minimize diagnostic error that might arise from knowledge of the D-dimer result prior to clinical assessment.

### The performance of two rapid quantitative D-dimer assays in 287 patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism [^116nVwse]. Thrombosis Research (2002). Low credibility.

Objective tests are necessary for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) as D-dimer assays have been suggested as useful screening tests to exclude this diagnosis.

To compare the diagnostic accuracy of two rapid quantitative D-dimers in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism, plasma D-dimer levels were measured using two commercially available assays (Tinaquant and Vidas). A strict imaging protocol was used to arrive at a final diagnosis of PE or deep venous thrombosis (DVT).

This multicenter study was conducted in six Dutch referral centers and included a total of 287 in- and outpatients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism.

- **Main outcome measures**: Diagnostic accuracy indices for the two assays were calculated, and additional receiver-operated characteristics (ROC) analysis was performed.

- **Results**: Using the manufacturer's advised cutoff values, the sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 52% for Vidas and 82% and 61% for Tinaquant, respectively. These differences were statistically significant (McNemar, P < 0.0001). However, no statistical differences were found between the two assays using ROC analysis (AUC = 0.78 for both assays).

- **Conclusions**: Both quantitative D-dimer tests had similar diagnostic accuracy; however, at the manufacturer's advised cutoff level, Vidas performed significantly better. Nevertheless, to safely exclude pulmonary embolism, D-dimer assays should be combined with other diagnostic tests.

### Embolus location affects the sensitivity of a rapid quantitative D-dimer assay in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^115CB3mB]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

D-dimer blood tests have been suggested to rule out pulmonary embolism. Despite evidence of the safety of withholding anticoagulant treatment in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism and a normal D-dimer assay result, clinicians remain reluctant to use a D-dimer assay as a sole diagnostic test. This prospective study in 314 consecutive inpatients and outpatients investigates the relation between the diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer plasma concentration and pulmonary embolus location.

Plasma D-dimer levels were measured using a quantitative immunoturbidimetric method. A strict protocol of ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy, pulmonary angiography, and spiral computed tomography was used to arrive at a final diagnosis and to assess the largest pulmonary artery in which embolus was visible. The influence of embolus location on the diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test and receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis. There was a strong correlation between plasma D-dimer concentration and embolus location (Kruskal-Wallis, p < 0.001).

Thus, the assay showed greater accuracy in excluding segmental or larger emboli (sensitivity = 93%) than subsegmental emboli (sensitivity = 50%). D-dimer concentration and the accuracy of D-dimer assays are clearly dependent on embolus location, and smaller, subsegmental emboli may be missed when D-dimer assays are used as a sole test to exclude pulmonary embolism.

### Clinical pre-test probability adjusted versus age-adjusted D-dimer interpretation strategy for DVT diagnosis: A diagnostic individual patient data meta-analysis [^117YBSbL]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Low credibility.

To increase the clinical usefulness of the D-dimer test in the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), two strategies have been proposed: the age-adjusted and the clinical pre-test probability (CPTP) adjusted interpretation. However, it is not known which of these strategies is superior.

- **Objective**: To conduct an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis that compares the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and utility (the proportion of all patients who have a negative D-dimer test) when the two strategies are used to interpret D-dimer results.

- **Methods**: Using an established IPD database, we conducted a meta-analysis to compare the two strategies. A bivariate random effects regression model was used to estimate and compare the pooled sensitivity and specificity simultaneously. The pooled NPV and utility of the two strategies were compared using a univariate random effects model.

- **Results**: Four studies were eligible for this analysis, with a total of 2554 patients. Overall prevalence of DVT was 12% with substantial heterogeneity between studies (P value < .001). Both strategies have high pooled NPVs (99.8%) with a difference of 0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.1, 0.1). The difference between the pooled specificity of the CPTP-adjusted strategy (57.3%) and the age-adjusted strategy (54.7%) was 2.6% (95% CI: -7.7, 12.8). The CPTP-adjusted strategy (49.4%) has a marginally greater pooled utility compared with the age-adjusted approach (47.4%), with a pooled difference of 1.9% (95% CI: -0.1, 3.9).

- **Conclusions**: Both D-dimer interpretation strategies offer similar effectiveness in diagnostic testing for DVT.

### Sex-related differences in D-dimer levels for venous thromboembolism screening [^114SDqcS]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

D-dimer is generally considered positive above 0.5 mg/L irrespective of sex. However, women have been shown to be more likely to have a positive D-dimer after controlling for other factors. Thus, differences may exist between males and females in using D-dimer as a marker of venous thromboembolic (VTE) disease. We hypothesized that the accuracy of D-dimer tests may be enhanced by using appropriate cutoff values that reflect sex-related differences in D-dimer levels.

- **Methods**: This research is a secondary analysis of a multicenter, international, prospective, observational study of adult (18+ years) patients suspected of VTE, with low-to-intermediate pretest probability based on Wells criteria ≤ 6 for pulmonary embolism (PE) and ≤ 2 for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). VTE diagnoses were based on computed tomography, ventilation perfusion scanning, or venous ultrasound. D-dimer levels were tested for statistical difference across groups stratified by sex and diagnosis. Multivariable regression was used to investigate sex as a predictor of diagnosis. Sex-specific optimal D-dimer thresholds for PE and DVT were calculated from receiver operating characteristic analyses. A Youden threshold (D-dimer level coinciding with the maximum of sensitivity plus specificity) and a cutoff corresponding to 95% sensitivity were calculated. Statistical difference for cutoffs was tested via 95% confidence intervals from 2,000 bootstrapped samples.

- **Results**: We included 3,586 subjects for analysis, of whom 61% were female. Race demographics were 63% White, 27% Black/African American, and…

Regarding diagnostic investigations for long COVID, particularly concerning laboratory tests, the ESCMID 2022 guidelines recommend avoiding D-dimer testing in patients without respiratory symptoms.

### How we manage a high D-dimer [^115MCfmo]. Haematologica (2024). Low credibility.

The presence of D-dimer in the bloodstream is physiological, representing the continuous balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis. Only when D-dimer exceeds the cutoff value is it considered pathologic. Cutoff values, earlier considered fixed and universal, are now considered variable and age-dependent, perhaps reflecting the physiological changes of the homeostatic system with the increased prevalence with aging of inflammatory-coagulative-reparative processes. From the time of its formation, D-dimer begins to be detectable in blood within approximately two hours, with a half-life of approximately six hours. After surgery, D-dimer increases, peaking at about one week and then decreasing by 5–10% daily; it is detectable for at least one month.

Numerous assays are commercially available for the laboratory measurement of D-dimer. Most of them rely on monoclonal antibodies and are typically enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). However, other methods use microparticles covered with monoclonal antibodies that bind D-dimer and cause agglutination, detected and quantified by nephelometry or turbidometry. There are point-of-care (POC) assays that produce both qualitative and quantitative results, and provide faster results in emergency care settings. Quantitative ELISA have a high sensitivity (> 95%) but a low specificity for VTE and thus are principally used for exclusion purposes. For this reason, establishing a cutoff value is very important, but these values differ greatly among the various assays used, perhaps due to the different specificity and epitope affinity.

### Widely used types and clinical applications of D-dimer assay [^111CUH5f]. Laboratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

D-dimers are formed by the breakdown of fibrinogen and fibrin during fibrinolysis. D-dimer analysis is critical for the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Modern assays for D-dimer are monoclonal antibody-based. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the reference method for D-dimer analysis in the central clinical laboratory but is time-consuming to perform. Recently, a number of rapid, point-of-care D-dimer assays have been developed for acute care settings, utilizing a variety of methodologies.

In view of the diversity of D-dimer assays used in central laboratory and point-of-care settings, several caveats must be considered to ensure proper interpretation and clinical application of the results. These include the consideration of preanalytical variables and interfering substances, as well as patient drug therapy and underlying disease.

D-dimer assays should also be validated in clinical studies, have established cut-off values, and be reported according to the reagent manufacturer's recommendations.

### Diagnostic accuracy of conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values in older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^114KVDRH]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

Diagnostic investigations in patients with suspected venous thromboembolism have been explored extensively. Others have argued for increasing the D-dimer cut-off value in older patients to improve specificity and thereby increase the number of patients in whom — based on a D-dimer level below the cut-off value — imaging could be avoided. An age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off value that increases gradually with age showed a promising increase in specificity without substantial loss of safety.

This age-adjusted cut-off value was defined as age (years) × 10 μg/L for patients aged over 50 years. For example, for a patient aged 78 years, the D-dimer concentration would be considered normal below 780 μg/L. The age-adjusted cut-off value was derived from a cohort of secondary care patients with a non-high probability of pulmonary embolism. This cohort was subdivided into 10-year age groups, and the optimal cut-off value was selected for each age group — that is, the cut-off value with a sensitivity of 100% and the highest accompanying specificity. This revealed an increase of the optimal cut-off value of approximately 100 μg/L per decade (10 μg/L per year).

This age-adjusted cut-off value was subsequently validated in secondary care patients with suspected pulmonary embolism, and in both primary and secondary care cohorts of patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis. However, higher cut-off values may also lead to an increased percentage of false-negative cases, meaning missed cases of venous thromboembolism.

### Is D-dimer used according to clinical algorithms in the diagnostic work-up of patients with suspicion of venous thromboembolism? A study in six European countries [^111mh2wu]. Thrombosis Research (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical algorithms consisting of pre-test probability estimation and D-dimer testing are recommended in the diagnostic work-up for suspected venous thromboembolism (VTE). The aim of this study was to explore how physicians working in emergency departments investigated patients suspected to have VTE.

- **Materials and methods**: A questionnaire with two case histories related to the diagnosis of suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) (Case A) and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) (Case B) was sent to physicians in six European countries. The physicians were asked to estimate the pre-test probability of VTE and indicate their clinical actions.

- **Results**: In total, 487 physicians were included. Sixty percent assessed the pre-test probability of PE to be high in Case A, but 7% would still request only a D-dimer test and 11% would exclude PE if D-dimer was negative, which could be hazardous. Besides imaging, a D-dimer test was requested by 41%, which is a "waste of resources" (extra costs and efforts, no clinical benefit). For Case B, 92% assessed the pre-test probability of DVT to be low. Correctly, only D-dimer was requested by 66% of the physicians, while 26% requested imaging, alone or in addition to D-dimer, which is a "waste of resources".

- **Conclusions**: These results should encourage scientific societies to improve the dissemination and knowledge of the recommendations for the diagnosis of VTE.

### Excluding venous thromboembolism using point of care D-dimer tests in outpatients: A diagnostic meta-analysis [^111j5XUn]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

Some methodological issues need to be considered. Firstly, we found substantial heterogeneity across the SimpliRED D-dimer studies. This variation could not be corrected for, or explained by adding covariates in the bivariate meta-regression model. In the summary receiver operating characteristic graph, all but three of the 12 "sensitivity - (1-specificity)" combinations of the individual SimpliRED D-dimer studies lie on or near the receiver operating characteristic curve; therefore, studies with a higher sensitivity have a lower specificity and vice versa. This pattern is commonly attributed to differences in the threshold for test positivity used in the different studies. Indeed, the heterogeneity across the SimpliRED studies could well be explained by threshold differences, as defining a positive test result for this point of care D-dimer test is subjective and depends on the amount of visible agglutination seen. This assessment may have low interobserver agreement and, therefore, different thresholds for test positivity. Threshold differences across diagnostic studies are implicit, so they cannot be accounted for in the analysis. Hence, calculating a common underlying sensitivity and specificity of SimpliRED D-dimer might not be possible with the currently available data. The use of quantitative point of care assays and further standardising the interpretation of qualitative point of care tests will surely reduce this problem.

### A tale of two D-dimers: Comparison of two assay methods to evaluate deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism [^1169A3VB]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

D-dimer testing rules out deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in low-risk emergency department (ED) patients. Most research has measured fibrin-equivalent units (FEUs); however, many laboratories measure D-dimer units (DDUs).

- **Objective**: Our aim was to determine whether either DDU measurements or FEU measurements can rule out DVT/PE using traditional or age-related cutoff values.

- **Methods**: We performed a de-identified multicenter retrospective evaluation of D-dimer in nonpregnant adult ED patients to evaluate for DVT/PE. DDUs were multiplied by 2 to determine equivalent FEUs prior to analysis. Sensitivity measurements for D-dimer were calculated for FEUs, DDUs, combined FEU/DDUs, and multiple age-adjusted values.

- **Results**: We identified 47,088 ED patients with a D-dimer laboratory value (27,307 FEUs/19,781 DDUs) and 1,623 DVT/PEs. The median combined FEU/DDU D-dimer was 400 ng/mL FEUs (interquartile range [IQR] 300–900 ng/mL FEUs) for patients without a DVT/PE vs 2,530 ng/mL FEU (IQR 1,094–6,000 ng/mL FEUs) with a DVT/PE (p < 0.001), overall sensitivity of 87.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 87.0–87.6%) and negative predictive value of 99.3% (95% CI 99.2–99.4%). Individually, FEUs performed better than DDUs, with sensitivities of 88.0% (95% CI 85.8–89.9%) and 86.1% (95% CI 83.1–88.7%), respectively; however, this difference was not statistically significant. Combined age-adjusted performance had a sensitivity of 90.3% (95% CI 88.3–92.0%); however, a new DDU-only age-adjusted criteria had the highest sensitivity of 91.1% (95% CI 87.9–93.6%).

### Diagnostic accuracy of conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values in older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113zQV2r]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

Characteristics of the included study cohorts were sorted according to the primary suspicion of pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and the setting. All studies used a D-dimer cut-off value of 500 μg/L and age×10 μg/L.

PE stands for pulmonary embolism; DVT for deep vein thrombosis; VTE for venous thromboembolism; CDR for clinical decision rule; ELISA for enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; ELFA for enzyme linked fluorescent assay; CUS for compression ultrasonography of the leg (if repeated, 6–8 days after initial presentation); HRCT for helical computed tomography of the chest; VQ for ventilation perfusion.

- **Second reference**: Refers to primary studies describing the cohort.

- **Classification**: According to Heim et al. and Di Nisio et al…

- **Additional data**: One study also presented data for a cut-off value of 750 μg/L in patients aged > 60 years. These data were not included in this meta-analysis.

One study was performed in primary care, whereas all other cohorts concerned patients presenting at emergency departments or in outpatient clinics. In two studies, inpatients were also included.

Overall, the quality of the included study cohorts was good (see the results of QUADAS-2 in supplementary appendix 3). All but one cohort included prospectively collected data of consecutive patients with suspected venous thromboembolism. However, in 12 of the 13 study cohorts, a three-month event-free follow-up (no signs or symptoms of recurrence) instead of imaging investigation was used as the reference test in patients with a negative D-dimer result and a non-high clinical probability, so not all patients underwent the same sequence of reference testing.

### Age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off levels to rule out venous thromboembolism in patients with non-high pre-test probability: Clinical performance and cost-effectiveness analysis [^117Rxa3x]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). High credibility.

As aging was found to be associated with increased D-dimer levels, the question arose whether D-dimer measurement was useful in the diagnostic strategy of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in elderly patients.

- **Aim of the study**: To compare retrospectively the performance of six diagnostic strategies based on the three-level Wells scores and various cut-off levels for D-dimer, evaluated using the HemosIL D-Dimer HS 500 assay, in a derivation cohort of 644 outpatients with non-high pretest probability (PTP) of VTE. The clinical usefulness of the best-performing strategy was then confirmed in a multicenter validation study involving 1255 consecutive outpatients with non-high PTP.

- **Results**: The diagnostic strategy based on the age-adjusted cut-off level, calculated by multiplying the patient's age by 10 above 50 years, was found to perform the best in the derivation study with a better sensitivity-to-specificity ratio than the conventional strategy based on the fixed cut-off level (500 ng/ml), a higher specificity, and a negative predictive value (NPV) above 99%. This increase in test specificity was confirmed in the validation cohort, with the NPV remaining above 99%. Taking into account the local reimbursement rates of diagnostic tests, using this strategy led to a 6.9% reduction in diagnostic costs for pulmonary embolism and a 5.1% reduction for deep vein thrombosis, as imaging tests would be avoided in a higher percentage of patients.

### Excluding venous thromboembolism using point of care D-dimer tests in outpatients: a diagnostic meta-analysis [^11112JGv]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

The objective is to review the evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of the currently available point of care D-dimer tests for excluding venous thromboembolism.

- **Design**: Systematic review of research on the accuracy of point of care D-dimer tests, using bivariate regression to examine sources of variation and to estimate sensitivity and specificity.

- **Data sources**: Studies on the diagnostic accuracy of point of care D-dimer tests published between January 1995 and September 2008 and available in either Medline or Embase.

- **Review methods**: The analysis included studies that compared point of care D-dimer tests with predefined reference criteria for venous thromboembolism, enrolled consecutive outpatients, and allowed for construction of a 2x2 table.

- **Results**: 23 studies (total number of patients 13,959, range in mean age 38–65 years, range of venous thromboembolism prevalence 4–51%) were included in the meta-analysis. The studies reported two qualitative point of care D-dimer tests (SimpliRED D-dimer (n = 12) and Clearview Simplify D-dimer (n = 7)) and two quantitative point of care D-dimer tests (Cardiac D-dimer (n = 4) and Triage D-dimer (n = 2)). Overall sensitivity ranged from 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.78 to 0.90) to 0.96 (0.91 to 0.98) and overall specificity from 0.48 (0.33 to 0.62) to 0.74 (0.69 to 0.78). The two quantitative tests, Cardiac D-dimer and Triage D-dimer, scored most favorably.

- **Conclusions**: In outpatients suspected of venous thromboembolism, point of care D-dimer tests can contribute important information and guide patient management, notably in low-risk patients.

### Use of different D-dimer levels to exclude venous thromboembolism depending on clinical pretest probability [^115zBrs6]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2004). Low credibility.

Currently, the same D-dimer cut-off point is used to define a positive result for all patients with suspected venous thromboembolism, regardless of their pretest probability. However, using a relatively high D-dimer cut-off point (lower sensitivity) for those with a low clinical pretest probability, and a low D-dimer cut-off point (higher sensitivity) for those with a high clinical pretest probability, may be preferable.

Data from a previously published study of 571 patients was used to identify the highest D-dimer cut-off point with a negative predictive value of at least 98% for patients with low and high pretest probability. The D-dimer cut-off point for those with moderate clinical pretest probability remained unchanged at 0.5 fibrinogen equivalent units (FEU) microgram mL⁻¹.

- **Accuracy comparison**: The accuracy of D-dimer testing for venous thromboembolism using three cut-off points vs. one cut-off point was then determined. D-dimer cut-off points of 0.2 and 2.1 FEU microgram mL⁻¹ were selected for the high and low pretest probability groups, respectively. When three pretest probability-specific cut-off points were used instead of the previously determined single D-dimer cut-off point (0.5 FEU microgram mL⁻¹), sensitivity and negative predictive value were unchanged (95% and 98%, respectively), but specificity increased from 44.7.

### D-dimer to rule out venous thromboembolism during pregnancy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115or3pN]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

This systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) and the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta‐Analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies (PRISMA‐DTA) guidelines.

- **Criteria for study selection**: Prospective and retrospective studies that used plasma D‐dimer measurement to rule out VTE in pregnant women with suspected PE and/or DVT were considered. We included studies using D‐dimer (index test), combined or not with PTP assessment, in which an imaging test (V/Q lung scan, CTPA, pulmonary angiography, lower limb venous CUS) or clinical follow‐up at 3 months were used as the reference standard. Studies were eligible if a 2 × 2 contingency table was supplied or could be back‐calculated (true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives), or if the sensitivity and NPV of D‐dimer could be calculated.

- **Population**: The study's population consisted of adult (≥ 18 years) pregnant women during their first, second, or third trimester of pregnancy presenting to an outpatient clinic or emergency department with symptoms and/or signs suggestive of acute PE and/or DVT, namely acute or new‐onset dyspnea and/or chest pain or lower limb pain and/or edema without an obvious explanation. The present analysis targets a population of pregnant women estimated with a disease prevalence consistent with a low/intermediate or unlikely PTP according to a CDR (prespecified PTP) or irrespective of PTP when a CDR had not been applied (PTP not used) in the original study.

### An evaluation of D-dimer in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism: a randomized trial [^115J9k13]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

It may be safe to omit additional diagnostic testing in selected patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) who have a negative D-dimer test, but this approach has never been evaluated in a randomized, controlled trial.

- **Objective**: To determine if additional diagnostic testing can be safely withheld in patients with suspected PE who have negative erythrocyte agglutination D-dimer test results.

- **Design**: Randomized comparisons in two subgroups of a prospective multicenter study.

- **Setting**: Seven university hospitals.

- **Patients**: A total of 1126 outpatients or inpatients with suspected PE participated; within this group, 456 patients with negative erythrocyte agglutination D-dimer test results were randomly assigned to the intervention groups. Patients were classified into two clinical probability groups: those with a low clinical probability of PE (low-probability group) and those with a moderate or high clinical probability of PE, a nondiagnostic ventilation-perfusion lung scan, and no evidence of proximal deep venous thrombosis on bilateral ultrasonography (moderate- or high-probability group).

- **Interventions**:
	- The experimental intervention for both probability groups was no further diagnostic testing for PE.
	- The control intervention for the low-probability group involved a ventilation-perfusion lung scan followed by ultrasonography of the proximal deep veins of the legs on the same day. If the lung scan was nondiagnostic, ultrasonography of the legs was repeated 7 and 14 days later.
	- The control intervention for the moderate- or high-probability group was ultrasonography of the proximal deep veins.

### Is it possible to make a common reference standard for D-dimer measurements? Communication from the ISTH SSC subcommittee on fibrinolysis [^114K89Ly]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: Several different methods were used and compared when studying D-dimer in patient plasma or fibrin degradation products (FDP) added to plasma, including the Dade Behring Innovance D-dimer Assay (Siemens Healthcare); HemosIL D-dimer HS on an ACL Top 500 (Instrumentation Laboratory SpA); Hyphen Zymutest D-dimer (HYPHEN BioMed); Stago Asserachrom D-DI (Diagnostica Stago SAS), and Technoclone Technozyme D-dimer ELISA (Technoclone). Hyphen and Stago methods were ELISA-based and were performed using a Softmax M5 plate reader (Molecular Devices), with results analyzed using GraphPad Prism Software (GraphPad Software). Additional details for methods and platforms used for commutability studies are described below.

- **Preparation of SS258**: Patient plasma left over from routine testing and with high levels of D-dimer was collected at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital UK, and its use in standard development was approved by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) ethics committee. Thirty plasma pools were provided, consisting of 10–12 mL each, and D-dimer in each pool was determined using the Dade Behring Innovance D-dimer Assay. D-dimer values for these samples ranged from approximately 3 to > 20 µg/ml (FEU units), with an expected estimated overall value of approximately 6 µg/ml using the Dade Behring Innovance method. The pooled plasma was chilled on ice and 1 M Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, was added to the plasma to a final concentration of 40 mM before the pool was dispensed in 0.5 mL aliquots into 3 mL ampoules for freeze-drying over 4.

### Using an age-dependent D-dimer cut-off value increases the number of older patients in whom deep vein thrombosis can be safely excluded [^111KWbcx]. Haematologica (2012). Low credibility.

D-dimer testing to rule out deep vein thrombosis is less useful in older patients due to lower specificity. An age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off value has been shown to increase the proportion of older patients (over 50 years) in whom pulmonary embolism could be excluded. We retrospectively validated the efficacy of this cut-off combined with clinical probability for the exclusion of deep vein thrombosis.

- **Design and methods**: Five management study cohorts of 2818 consecutive outpatients with suspected deep vein thrombosis were used. Patients with non-high or unlikely probability of deep vein thrombosis were included in the analysis; four different D-dimer tests were utilized. The proportion of patients with a normal D-dimer test and the failure rates were calculated using the conventional (500 μg/L) and the age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off (patient's age × 10 μg/L in patients over 50 years).

- **Results**: In 1672 patients with non-high probability, deep vein thrombosis could be excluded in 850 (51%) patients with the age-adjusted cut-off value versus 707 (42%) patients with the conventional cut-off value. The failure rates were 7 (0.8%; 95% confidence interval 0.3–1.7%) for the age-adjusted cut-off value and 5 (0.7%; 0.2–1.6%) for the conventional cut-off value. The absolute increase in patients in whom deep vein thrombosis could be ruled out using the age-adjusted cut-off value was largest in patients over 70 years: 19% among patients with non-high probability.

- **Conclusions**: The age-adjusted cut-off of the D-dimer combined with clinical probability greatly increases the proportion of older patients in whom deep vein thrombosis can be safely excluded.

### Diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer test for exclusion of venous thromboembolism: A systematic review [^115P1Co8]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2007). Low credibility.

The reported diagnostic accuracy of the D-dimer test for exclusion of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) varies. It is unknown to what extent this is due to differences in study design or patient groups, or to genuine differences between D-dimer assays.

- **Methods**: Studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of the D-dimer test in the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism were systematically searched for in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases up to March 2005. Reference lists of all included studies and of reviews related to the topic of the present meta-analysis were manually searched for other additional potentially eligible studies. Two reviewers independently extracted study characteristics using standardized forms.

- **Results**: In total, 217 D-dimer test evaluations for DVT and 111 for PE were analyzed. Several study design characteristics were associated with systematic differences in diagnostic accuracy. After adjustment for these features, the sensitivities of the D-dimer enzyme-linked immunofluorescence assay (ELFA) (DVT 96%; PE 97%), microplate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (DVT 94%; PE 95%), and latex quantitative assay (DVT 93%; PE 95%) were superior to those of the whole-blood D-dimer assay (DVT 83%; PE 87%), latex semiquantitative assay (DVT 85%; PE 88%), and latex qualitative assay (DVT 69%; PE 75%). The latex qualitative and whole-blood D-dimer assays had the highest specificities (DVT 99%, 71%; PE 99%, 69%).

- **Conclusions**: Compared to other D-dimer assays, the ELFA, microplate ELISA, and latex quantitative assays have higher sensitivities.

### Clinical probability assessment and D-dimer determination in patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis, a prospective multicenter management study [^116KWqnW]. Thrombosis Research (2009). Low credibility.

To investigate the reliability of a combined strategy of clinical assessment scores followed by a local D-dimer test to exclude deep vein thrombosis. For comparison, D-dimer was analyzed post hoc and batchwise at a coagulation laboratory.

- **Design**: Prospective multicenter management study.

- **Setting**: Seven hospitals in southern Sweden.

- **Subjects**: 357 patients with a suspected first episode of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) were prospectively recruited, and a pre-test probability score (Wells score) was estimated by the emergency physician. If categorized as low pre-test probability, D-dimer was analyzed, and if negative, DVT was considered ruled out. The primary outcome was recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) during 3 months of follow-up.

- **Results**: The prevalence of DVT was 23.5% (84/357). A low pre-test probability and a negative D-dimer result at inclusion were found in 31% (110/357) of the patients, of whom one (0.9% [95% CI 0.02–4.96]) had a VTE at follow-up. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and negative likelihood ratio for our local D-dimer test in the low probability group were 85.7%, 74.5%, 98.2%, and 0.19 respectively, compared to 85.6%, 67.6%, 97.9%, and 0.23 using batchwise analysis at a coagulation laboratory.

- **Conclusion**: Pre-test probability scores and D-dimer safely rule out DVT in about 30% of outpatients with a suspected first episode of DVT. One out of 110 patients was diagnosed with DVT during follow-up. No significant difference in diagnostic performance was seen between the local D-dimer test and the post hoc batch analysis.

### Advocating prudent D-dimer testing: Constructive perspectives and comments on 'How we manage a high D-dimer' [^113VjdMm]. Haematologica (2024). Low credibility.

For these reasons, we suggest that instead of recommending an evaluation algorithm for elevated D-dimer tests in asymptomatic ambulatory individuals, the focus should shift back towards avoiding unnecessary medical tests. Such efforts could lead to the better education of healthcare professionals on the rational prescription of these tests, ensuring effective and appropriate use based on solid clinical reasoning and a specific patient context.

### Investigation of age-adjusted D-dimer using an uncommon assay [^114hsAB7]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Use of an age-adjusted D-dimer for the evaluation of acute pulmonary embolus (PE) has been prospectively validated in the literature and has become a practice recommendation from major medical societies. Most research on this subject involves the most common D-dimer assays reporting in Fibrinogen Equivalent Units (FEU) with a non-age-adjusted manufacturer-recommended cutoff of 500 ng/ml FEU. Limited research has evaluated age-adjustment in assays that report in D-Dimer Units (D-DU), which use a manufacturer-recommended cutoff of 230 ng/ml D-DU. Despite scant evidence, an age-adjusted formula using D-DU has been recently endorsed by the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP). This formula seems arbitrary in its derivation and unnecessarily deviates from existing thresholds, thus prompting the creation of our novel age-adjustment formula. The goal of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the test characteristics of our novel age-adjusted D-dimer formula using the D-DU assay in comparison to existing traditional and age-adjusted D-dimer thresholds for the evaluation of acute PE in the ED.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective chart review at an academic quaternary health system with three EDs and 195,000 combined annual ED visits. Only patients with D-dimer testing and CT PE protocol (CTPE) imaging were included. Admission and discharge diagnosis codes were used to identify acute PE. Outcome measures were sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) of an unadjusted traditional threshold (230).

### D-dimer to rule out venous thromboembolism during pregnancy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111mRXm3]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021).

The usefulness of D-dimer measurement to rule out venous thromboembolism (VTE) during pregnancy is debated. A systematic meta-analysis to investigate the safety of D-dimer in ruling out acute VTE in pregnant women was performed. The pooled estimate values were 99.5% for sensitivity (95% CI, 95.0–100.0; I², 0%) and 100% for negative predictive value (95% CI, 99.19–100.0; I², 0%). Our results suggest that D-dimer allows for safely ruling out VTE in pregnant women with suspected VTE and a disease prevalence consistent with a low/intermediate or unlikely pre-test probability.

### Failure rate of D-dimer testing in patients with high clinical probability of pulmonary embolism: Ancillary analysis of three European studies [^114nesFZ]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is commonly suspected in the emergency department (ED). Accurate diagnosis of this potentially deadly condition is critical to ensuring effective management and treatment. A workup strategy for the diagnosis of PE is considered safe if its failure rate is less than 2%.

Both European and American guidelines recommend a sequential approach. The clinical probability of PE is assessed using a clinical decision rule (Wells, revised Geneva score) or unstructured estimation (gestalt), categorized as low, moderate, or high. If the risk of PE is low or moderate, a diagnostic strategy based on D-dimer levels is advised due to its high negative predictive value. PE is ruled out if the D-dimer level is below the age-adjusted threshold (i.e. less than 500 ng/mL in patients younger than 50 and age multiplied by 10 ng/mL in patients older than 50). If not, chest imaging, preferably computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA), is recommended. However, performing D-dimer testing is not recommended for patients with a high clinical probability of PE. Due to the high prevalence of PE in this population, relying solely on D-dimer testing may result in a lower negative predictive value and increase the risk of diagnostic failure. Therefore, guidelines recommend that high-risk patients should systematically undergo chest imaging without D-dimer testing.

This recommendation is based on a very low level of evidence, with very scarce data published on the negative predictive value of D-dimers in these high-risk patients.

### Is it possible to make a common reference standard for D-dimer measurements? Communication from the ISTH SSC subcommittee on fibrinolysis [^112rL2NR]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

Preparation of SS444 and SS523 involved generating FDP to produce a heterogeneous mixture of fibrin fragments from a purified system. Clots were formed using purified fibrinogen and thrombin, which included FXIIIa, plasminogen activator, and plasminogen. Plasmin was generated from plasminogen by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA, code 98/714; NIBSC) or urokinase plasminogen activator (code 11/184; NIBSC). All solutions were prepared in 10 mM Hepes buffer pH 7.4, containing 0.15 M NaCl and 0.01% Tween 20.

Clot lysis mixtures were prepared by mixing 0.2 mL of activator solution (containing thrombin and FXIIIa [code 02/170; NIBSC] plus tPA or urokinase [uPA]) with 1.0 mL of fibrinogen solution (also containing plasminogen). The final mixtures contained 4 nM thrombin (code 01/578, NIBSC), 1 IU/ml activated FXIIIa, 2.5 mg/ml fibrinogen (Calbiochem), and 0.22 µM plasminogen, either glu‐plasminogen (HYPHEN BioMed) or lys‐plasminogen (Immuno) with 2 nM tPA or 1 nM uPA.

Clot lysis at 37°C was followed in four mixtures of tPA or uPA with glu‐ or lys‐plasminogen (abbreviated to TG, TL, UG, UL) for varying amounts of time. Samples of 1 mL were taken at four time points: the moment the clot collapsed, t₀ (6–12 minutes), 2× t₀, 60 min, and 300 min. Reactions were stopped by immediate cooling on ice and adding concentrated aprotinin (Baxter) to a final concentration of 7 µM [see Longstaff and Locke] before adding to plasma and snap freezing for storage at −80°C. Assays on samples from these reaction mixtures were performed using the Technoclone Technozyme D‐dimer EL.

### Diagnostic accuracy of the triage D-dimer test for exclusion of venous thromboembolism in outpatients [^112Qkt9h]. Thrombosis Research (2008). Low credibility.

We evaluated the diagnostic performance of the Triage D-dimer test, a new fast quantitative point-of-care whole blood D-dimer assay, and compared it with the Vidas D-dimer assay.

- **Materials and methods**: The study population comprised 319 outpatients for whom D-dimer testing was requested in order to rule out venous thromboembolism (VTE). Routine testing consisted of a plasma ELISA D-dimer analysis (Vidas). For all included patients, an additional EDTA whole blood D-dimer test (Triage) was performed. Patients were classified by reference imaging or by follow-up of the medical record. Accuracy indices, receiver operating characteristics, and the kappa coefficient for agreement were calculated using the cutoff values recommended by the manufacturer.

- **Results**: The prevalence of VTE was 14%. Sensitivity and specificity for VTE were 98% (95%CI: 88–100) and 34% (95%CI: 28–40) for Vidas, and 91% (95%CI: 78–97) and 42% (95%CI: 36–48) for Triage, respectively. The differences in sensitivity and specificity between both D-dimer assays were statistically significant (McNemar, p < 0.0001). ROC-curve analysis yielded an area under the curve of 0.83 (95%CI: 0.76–0.89) for the Vidas and 0.81 (95%CI: 0.74–0.88) for the Triage (p = 0.396). The kappa coefficient for agreement between Vidas and Triage was 0.75 (95%CI: 0.68–0.79).

- **Conclusions**: The Triage and Vidas D-dimer tests show comparable diagnostic accuracy. Vidas demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity. Our findings strongly suggest lowering the cutoff for the Triage D-dimer test from 400 to 350 ng/mL.

### Diagnostic accuracy of conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values in older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^115eeGeq]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

The forest plot in supplementary appendix 4 depicts the sensitivity and specificity of D-dimer testing stratified by cohort, age group, and D-dimer cut-off level. We analyzed the effect of covariates — such as the venous thromboembolism prevalence in each total cohort, applied D-dimer assays, and whether the patients were initially suspected of having pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis — on the D-dimer sensitivity and specificity. We found no association between the sensitivity and specificity of D-dimer testing and the prevalence of venous thromboembolism in the study populations or whether patients were suspected of having either pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.

- **Overall and covariate analysis for D-dimer testing**: Stratified by use of conventional and age adjusted cut-off levels in patients with a non-high clinical probability of venous thromboembolism (all age categories except < 50 years).

The enzyme linked fluorescent assay (ELFA) showed a higher sensitivity and a trend towards lower specificity in the three cohorts in which only ELFA was applied, compared with the cohorts in which quantitative latex assays were also used. Additionally, the ELFA assays indicated less decrease in sensitivity by application of the…

### Accuracy of routine laboratory tests to predict mortality and deterioration to severe or critical COVID-19 in people with SARS-CoV-2 [^114G55em]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

- **D-dimer increase**: D-dimer increase was assessed in the target conditions, including mortality, deterioration, and the combined outcome.

	- **Mortality**: In these studies (Figure 13), the cut-off values ranged between 0.5 and 1.71 mg/L, encompassing 14 studies. Sensitivity ranged from 46% to 95%, and specificity from 8% to 74%. At a fixed specificity of 48% (Q1), 56% (median), and 63% (Q3), the meta-analysis found a sensitivity of 77% (95% CI 71% to 83%), 70% (95% CI 64% to 76%), and 62% (95% CI 56% to 69%), respectively.

	- **Deterioration**: Figure 14 shows the cut-off values, which ranged between 0.14 and 1.15 mg/L across 10 studies. Sensitivity varied from 30% to 90%, while specificity ranged from 32% to 80%. At a fixed specificity of 46% (Q1), 63% (median), and 71% (Q3), the meta-analysis determined a sensitivity of 80% (95% CI 69% to 88%), 65% (95% CI 56% to 74%), and 56% (95% CI 44% to 67%), respectively.

	- **Combined outcome**: For the combined outcome, the cut-off values ranged between 0.5 and 1.3 mg/L in 4 studies. Sensitivity ranged from 55% to 73%, with specificity from 49% to 60%. At fixed specificity levels of 52% (Q1), 54% (median), and 57% (Q3), the meta-analysis reported a sensitivity of 67% (95% CI 55% to 76%), 65% (95% CI 52% to 76%), and 62% (95% CI 46% to 76%), respectively.

### Selective D-dimer testing for diagnosis of a first suspected episode of deep venous thrombosis: a randomized trial [^116NJWJD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). High credibility.

D-dimer testing is sensitive but not specific for diagnosing deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Changing the use of testing and the threshold level for a positive test result based on the risk for DVT might improve the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity and reduce the need for testing.

- **Objective**: To determine whether using a selective D-dimer testing strategy based on clinical pretest probability (C-PTP) for DVT is safe and reduces diagnostic testing compared with using a single D-dimer threshold for all patients.

- **Design**: Randomized, multicenter, controlled trial. Patients were allocated using a central automated system. Ultrasonographers and study adjudicators, but not other study personnel, were blinded to trial allocation (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00157677).

- **Setting**: Conducted at 5 Canadian hospitals.

- **Patients**: Consecutive symptomatic patients with a first episode of suspected DVT were included.

- **Intervention**:
	- Selective testing (n = 860) was defined as D-dimer testing for outpatients with low or moderate C-PTP (DVT excluded at D-dimer levels < 1.0 µg/mL [low C-PTP] or < 0.5 µg/mL [moderate C-PTP]) and venous ultrasonography without D-dimer testing for outpatients with high C-PTP and inpatients.
	- Uniform testing (n = 863) was defined as D-dimer testing for all participants (DVT excluded at D-dimer levels < 0.5 µg/mL).

- **Measurements**: The study measured the proportion of patients not diagnosed with DVT during initial testing who had symptomatic venous thromboembolism during the 3-month follow-up and the proportion of patients undergoing D-dimer testing and ultrasonography.

### D-dimer to rule out venous thromboembolism during pregnancy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111BAkcE]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

Characteristics of included studies and baseline characteristics of patients enrolled in the studies are summarized. Study size ranged from 149 to 498 patients. The total overall population of the four studies was 1,194 patients, of whom 836 were eligible for the present analysis. Of the four included studies, three were prospective, and only one study had a retrospective design. Of all the studies, only one was specifically designed for suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT), whereas the other three focused on suspected pulmonary embolism (PE).

Regarding the D-dimer test, highly sensitive quantitative assays, such as ELISA and immuno-turbidimetric assays, expressing results as fibrinogen equivalent units, were used in three studies. Of these, two used the same commercial assay for all their patients, whereas one allowed different types of commercially available assays. The prespecified D-dimer cutoff used was the standard cutoff of 500 ng/ml in two studies — applying to all patients in one and for low-intermediate pre-test probability (PTP) patients in the other. One study used a higher prespecified cutoff (< 1000 ng/ml) in patients with low PTP and a standard 500 µg/L cutoff in other patients, based on a defined diagnostic algorithm. Only one study used a red blood cell agglutination assay (qualitative assay), known to have lower sensitivity (the SimpliRED test).

### Diagnostic accuracy of conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values in older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112jpuht]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to review the diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer testing in older patients (> 50 years) with suspected venous thromboembolism, using conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values.

- **Design**: Systematic review and bivariate random effects meta-analysis.

- **Data sources**: We searched Medline and Embase for studies published before 21 June 2012, and we contacted the authors of primary studies.

- **Study selection**: Primary studies that enrolled older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism in whom D-dimer testing, using both conventional (500 µg/L) and age adjusted (age × 10 µg/L) cut-off values, and reference testing were performed. For patients with a non-high clinical probability, 2 × 2 tables were reconstructed and stratified by age category and applied D-dimer cut-off level.

- **Results**: Thirteen cohorts including 12,497 patients with a non-high clinical probability were included in the meta-analysis. The specificity of the conventional cut-off value decreased with increasing age, from 57.6% (95% confidence interval 51.4% to 63.6%) in patients aged 51–60 years to 39.4% (33.5% to 45.6%) in those aged 61–70, 24.5% (20.0% to 29.7%) in those aged 71–80, and 14.7% (11.3% to 18.6%) in those aged > 80. Age adjusted cut-off values revealed higher specificities over all age categories: 62.3% (56.2% to 68.0%), 49.5% (43.2% to 55.8%), 44.2% (38.0% to 50.5%), and 35.2% (29.4% to 41.5%), respectively. Sensitivities of the age adjusted cut-off remained above 97% in all age categories.

- **Conclusions**: The application of age adjusted cut-off values for D-dimer tests substantially increases specificity, while maintaining high sensitivity.

### Diagnostic accuracy of conventional or age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off values in older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^115cYYWv]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

D-dimer concentrations are highly sensitive for thrombus formation; hence, D-dimer tests are often used to rule out venous thromboembolism (pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis) in suspected patients with a non-high clinical probability. Patients with a high clinical probability do not require a D-dimer test, as imaging examinations are warranted to confirm or refute the diagnosis, irrespective of the D-dimer results. However, D-dimer concentrations increase with age, which leads to a high proportion of older patients with D-dimer concentrations higher than conventional cut-off values (500 µg/L). This results in low specificity (more false positive results) of D-dimer testing in older patients suspected of having venous thromboembolism; the specificity is 49% to 67% for patients aged less than 50 years, but in older patients (≥ 80 years), it is between 0% and 18%.

As imaging is indicated in patients suspected of having venous thromboembolism with a D-dimer concentration above the cut-off value, a high proportion of older patients with a non-high clinical probability undergo unnecessary diagnostic investigations. This can be burdensome, especially in older patients, and the yield of this imaging is relatively low (typically 20% or fewer of patients with clinically suspected venous thromboembolism are actually affected). Due to the low specificity of D-dimer testing in older patients, some authors dissuade doctors from D-dimer testing in very old patients, which would imply referring all suspected older patients for further investigation.

### A test in context: D-dimer [^113kRJDw]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). High credibility.

D-dimer is a soluble fibrin degradation product that results from the ordered breakdown of thrombi by the fibrinolytic system. Numerous studies have shown that D-dimer serves as a valuable marker of activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Consequently, D-dimer has been extensively investigated for the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and is used routinely for this indication. In addition, D-dimer has been evaluated for determining the optimal duration of anticoagulation in VTE patients, for diagnosing and monitoring disseminated intravascular coagulation, and as an aid in the identification of medical patients at high risk for VTE. Thus, quantification of D-dimer levels serves an important role in guiding therapy.

- **Generation of D-dimer**: This review describes how D-dimer is generated.

- **Detection assays**: It reviews the assays used for its detection.

- **Role of D-dimer determination**: The review discusses the role of D-dimer determination in these various conditions.

### Excluding pulmonary embolism at the bedside with low pre-test probability and D-dimer: Safety and clinical utility of 4 methods to assign pre-test probability [^115gdtqy]. Thrombosis Research (2006). Low credibility.

Less than 35% of patients suspected of having pulmonary embolism (PE) actually have PE. Safe bedside methods to exclude PE could save scarce health care resources if they exclude large proportions of patients with suspected PE and are widely applicable. Non-Elisa D-dimer in combination with the pre-test probability of suspected PE can safely exclude PE at the bedside. Pre-test probability can be assigned by gestalt or by using clinical models (Wells, Wicki, Rodger).

- **Materials and methods**: We combined two databases from studies of patients with suspected PE and retrospectively compared the diagnostic test characteristics of the different methods of assigning pre-test probability.

- **Results**: 535 patients were studied. PE was confirmed in 20.8% of study patients. Two clinical predictive models (Rodger and Wells) and overall diagnostic impression have similar sensitivities ranging from 96% (95% confidence interval (CI) 89–99%) to 99% (93–100%). Wicki's model has a sensitivity of 89% (77–96%). The Wells' model with a cutoff of less than 2 points in association with semi-quantitative D-dimer has a specificity of 11% (CI 7–15%). The specificities for the other clinical predictive model range from 21% (17–25%) to 49% (CI 42–55%).

- **Conclusion**: Semi-quantitative D-dimer must be combined with safe clinical probability assessment to safely exclude PE in a significant proportion of patients. Wicki's model in association with semi-quantitative D-dimer has the lowest sensitivity and should be used carefully to exclude PE at the bedside.

### The accuracy of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay D-dimer test in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism: a meta-analysis [^111YD3Bi]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

We sought to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) D-dimer test in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) in the adult emergency department population.

- **Methods**: A search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and bibliographies of previous systematic reviews was conducted, with no language restriction. Experts in the field of PE research were contacted to identify unpublished studies. Prospective investigations involving a predominantly outpatient population suspected of PE that used ELISA D-dimer tests were included. Two authors extracted data independently and assessed study quality on the basis of the patient spectrum and reference standard. Consensus was reached by means of conference. The analysis was based on a summary receiver operating characteristic curve and pooled estimates for sensitivity and specificity by using a random-effects model.

- **Results**: The search yielded 52 publications. No unpublished studies were found. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria and provided a sample of 2,126 patients. The summary receiver operating characteristic curve analysis found significant heterogeneity among the 11 studies. Subgroup analysis of the 9 studies that used traditional ELISA D-dimer methods yielded the most valid pooled estimates, with a sensitivity of 0.94 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88 to 0.97) and a specificity of 0.45 (95% CI 0.36 to 0.55). Advanced age resulted in a lower specificity. A prolonged duration of symptoms decreased the sensitivity and specificity.

- **Conclusion**: The ELISA D-dimer test is highly sensitive but less specific for diagnosing PE.

### Comparison of the age-adjusted and clinical probability-adjusted D-dimer to exclude pulmonary embolism in the ED [^114nx8TY]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE) in the emergency department (ED) can be challenging because its signs and symptoms are non-specific. We compared the efficacy and safety of using age-adjusted D-dimer interpretation, clinical probability-adjusted D-dimer interpretation, and the standard D-dimer approach to exclude PE in ED patients.

- **Design/methods**: We performed a health records review at two emergency departments over a two-year period. We reviewed all cases where patients had a D-dimer ordered to test for PE or underwent CT or VQ scanning for PE. PE was considered to be present during the emergency department visit if PE was diagnosed on CT or VQ (subsegmental level or above), or if the patient was subsequently found to have PE or deep vein thrombosis during the next 30 days. We applied the three D-dimer approaches to the low and moderate probability patients. The primary outcome was exclusion of PE with each rule. The secondary objective was to estimate the negative predictive value (NPV) for each rule.

- **Results**: A total of 1,163 emergency patients were tested for PE, and 1,075 patients were eligible for inclusion in our analysis. PE was excluded in 70.4% (95% CI 67.6–73.0%), 80.3% (95% CI 77.9–82.6%), and 68.9% (95% CI 65.7–71.3%) with the age-adjusted, clinical probability-adjusted, and standard D-dimer approach, respectively. The NPVs were 99.7% (95% CI 99.0–99.9%), 99.1% (95% CI 98.3–99.5%), and 100% (95% CI 99.4–100.0%) respectively.

- **Conclusion**: The clinical probability-adjusted rule appears to exclude PE in a greater proportion of patients, with a very small reduction in the negative predictive value.

### Excluding venous thromboembolism using point of care D-dimer tests in outpatients: a diagnostic meta-analysis [^116SZDpS]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

This is the first meta-analysis of studies on the currently available point of care D-dimer tests. Measuring D-dimer levels is an important step in the diagnostic investigation of patients suspected of venous thromboembolism. A negative D-dimer test result in combination with a low pre-test probability of venous thromboembolism is widely used to exclude the diagnosis and thus safely reduce the number of unnecessary referrals for imaging. A meta-analysis performed by Fancher et al. in 2004 concluded that a negative result on SimpliRED D-dimer could exclude venous thromboembolism in low-risk patients. However, after 2004, various newer point of care D-dimer tests (qualitative as well as quantitative) have become available. We summarized the literature on the diagnostic accuracy of these point of care assays, including the older SimpliRED D-dimer.

Our meta-analysis shows that the qualitative assays (SimpliRED D-dimer and Clearview Simplify D-dimer) have a lower sensitivity (that is, a higher number of false negatives) but higher specificity (that is, a lower number of false positives) than the quantitative assays (Cardiac D-dimer and Triage D-dimer). The latter seem, therefore, better suited to rule out DVT in suspected patients, as they decrease the pre-test probability of venous thromboembolism more effectively. In this regard, Cardiac D-dimer outperforms Triage D-dimer, as it is able to rule out DVT both in patients with a low pre-test risk and in those with a moderate pre-test risk.

### D-dimer levels for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism: Making sense of international guideline recommendations [^112rULpX]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). Low credibility.

Several international guidelines provide recommendations regarding the use of D-dimer testing for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism, including the appropriate D-dimer threshold (or cutoff), but there is no consensus among them. We briefly discuss guideline variation, performance characteristics, and limitations of commercially available D-dimer assays in this setting, referencing the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines that recommend immunoassays with high sensitivity (≥ 97%) and negative predictive value (≥ 98%).

While age-adjusted D-dimer and pretest-adjusted D-dimer are considered a safe strategy across predefined patient subgroups, clinicians need to recognize the different performance characteristics of D-dimer assays to enable safe clinical decisions for their patients. Importantly, D-dimer values must be correlated not only to clinical findings but also interpreted within the context of the accuracy and precision of the specific testing modality, adhering to manufacturer specifications that are approved by regulatory authorities.

### D-dimer to rule out venous thromboembolism during pregnancy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116vh9Xu]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

Our results showed a high sensitivity and NPV of 99.5% (95% CI, 95.0–100.0; I², 0%) and 100% (95% CI, 99.1–100.0; I², 0%), respectively, for D-dimer testing. Notably, for sensitivities and NPV, the estimates reported by single studies were close to 100%, with a low level of heterogeneity. These findings are consistent with sensitivity observed in the general population, supporting the use of the D-dimer test for safely ruling out VTE in non-high-risk pregnant women without the need for imaging.

A main limitation for the use of the D-dimer test is its generally poor specificity. In pregnant women, D-dimer concentrations are even less specific due to the physiological increase of D-dimer levels during normal pregnancies, reducing the diagnostic yield of the test. In our review, the estimated proportion of patients with a negative D-dimer was 34.2% (95% CI, 15.9–55.1; I², 98%). Despite the wide CI and high level of heterogeneity across studies, this proportion could be considered clinically significant, potentially avoiding further testing in a considerable number of patients.

### Age-adjusted D-dimer, clinical pre-test probability-adjusted D-dimer, and whole leg ultrasound in ruling out suspected proximal and calf deep venous thrombosis [^112QAqKG]. American Journal of Hematology (2023). High credibility.

D-dimer (DD) and ultrasonography (US) are integral parts of the diagnostic workup for lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Recent studies indicate that adjusting DD level cut-offs by age or clinical pre-test probability (PTP) reduces the need for US. We compared the diagnostic accuracy of PTP-adjusted DD and age-adjusted DD in 3,883 patients (61.1% female; age: 65.3 ± 16.8 years) referred to our unit for clinically suspected DVT. All patients underwent clinical evaluation, DD testing, and US. Proximal DVT was detected in 477 patients (12.4%), while distal DVT was isolated in 342 patients (8.9%). Among the remaining 3,064 patients, there were 23 venous thromboembolic events (0.75%, 95% CI: 0.50–1.12) during the 3-month follow-up.

- **Specificities and negative predictive value**: In patients without high PTP levels, the specificities of DD, age-adjusted DD, and PTP-adjusted DD were 47% (95% CI: 45–49), 61% (95% CI: 59–62), and 67% (95% CI: 65–68), respectively. The negative predictive value (NPV) was 96% (95% CI: 95–97) for all diagnostic strategies. When only proximal DVTs were considered, the NPV increased to 99% (95% CI: 98–99).

- **Use of ultrasonography**: US was avoided in 37% (95% CI: 36–38) of patients with a fixed cut-off DD, in 48% (95% CI: 47–50) with age-adjusted DD, and in 52% (95% CI: 51–54) with PTP-adjusted DD.

- **Failure rates and conclusions**: The failure rates for all DVTs for DD, age-adjusted DD, and PTP-adjusted DD were 2.0% (95% CI: 1.6–2.5), 2.7% (95% CI: 2.2–3.2), and 2.5% (95% CI: 2.1–3.0), respectively. Compared to the standard DD cut-off, both age-adjusted and PTP-adjusted DD reduced the proportion of patients requiring US, albeit with a minor increase in the failure rate.

### Appropriate use of venous imaging and analysis of the D-dimer/clinical probability testing paradigm in the diagnosis and location of deep venous thrombosis [^113Wiwme]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The D-dimer (DD) level combined with the pretest Wells criteria probability (WCP) score can safely exclude deep venous thrombosis (DVT). The objective of this study was to examine the correlation between DD results alongside the WCP score with findings on venous duplex ultrasound (VDU). The hypothesis is that VDU remains overutilized in low-risk patients with a negative DD and that higher DD levels may correlate with thrombus burden and location.

- **Methods**: Patients who presented to a high-volume tertiary care center with lower limb swelling, with or without associated pain, were retrospectively examined through June and July for four consecutive years (2012 to 2015). After calculating WCP, patients were divided into low-, moderate-, and high-risk categories. Electronic DD results utilizing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, WCP data, and VDU analysis data were merged and analyzed based on the receiver operator characteristic curve to determine the DD cutoff point for each WCP. Abnormal DD with an average value ≥ 0.6 mg/L fibrinogen equivalent units (FEUs) was correlated to positive DVT to differentiate proximal DVT (above the popliteal vein) from distal DVT (below the popliteal vein).

- **Results**: Data of 1,909 patients were analyzed, and 239 (12.5%) patients were excluded due to serial repeat visits or follow-ups, surveillance screens, and if they had a previous history of DVT. The average age was 62.1 ± 16.3 years, with more women (55.7%), and the majority presented with limb pain and edema (87%). DD studies were ordered and completed in 202 patients and correlated with all positive findings.

### D-dimer testing: The role of the clinical laboratory in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^115n9rxw]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is a common yet often unsuspected and unrecognized disease associated with high mortality. New, objective, "user-friendly", and cost-effective diagnostic strategies are being explored. D-dimers, the fibrinolytic degradation products of cross-linked fibrin, have emerged as the most useful markers of procoagulant activity and ongoing fibrinolysis. D-dimer measurements are very sensitive in excluding a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism when normal values, low clinical suspicion, and non-diagnostic lung scans are present. Several assays have been developed and are reviewed.

### Diagnostic accuracy of conventional or age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off values in older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^115TV64w]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

Other strategies to adjust the D-dimer cut-off value to exclude venous thromboembolism in older patients have been suggested — such as a fixed cut-off of 750 µg/L in all patients over 60 or 70 years. Owing to the heterogeneity of the applied D-dimer assays, methodology, and categorization of age (for example, > 60 or > 70 years instead of 61–70 years, 71–80 years, and > 80 years), we were unable to provide pooled estimates of the studies that analyzed alternative D-dimer cut-off levels. This hampered the comparison of the different adjusted D-dimer cut-off values.

We also found some heterogeneity in the sensitivity and specificity of D-dimer tests among the studies, which was partly explained by the application of different assays. Our covariate analysis suggests that the application of age-adjusted rather than conventional cut-off values was most favorable in the cohorts in which enzyme-linked fluorescent assays were exclusively applied, as high sensitivity remained constant in these cohorts. These findings are consistent with previous studies: enzyme-linked fluorescent assays turned out to have a higher sensitivity at the expense of a lower specificity compared with second-generation latex assays. However, as a result of between-study variation of covariates and their potential multicollinearity (linear relation between explaining variables), we are unable to draw firm conclusions on the differences between various D-dimer assays based on our meta-analysis.

### Role of fibrin D-dimer testing in emergency medicine [^114Q7wUS]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Systemic values of the fibrinolytic plasma marker fibrin D-dimer are raised in a variety of acute clinical conditions. D-dimer values can now be rapidly determined and used to aid diagnosis in emergency medicine. However, despite clinical guidelines, inappropriate and unnecessary measurement of D-dimer values is a significant clinical problem. An understanding of the pathophysiological basis and limitations of the value of D-dimer values may help reduce this problem. This review discusses the pathophysiology of the fibrinolytic system, the currently used assays, clinical indications, and limitations of D-dimer measurement. Finally, the potential future clinical indications for measurement of D-dimer values in emergency medicine are discussed.

The literature on D-dimer was identified from Medline, along with cross-referencing from the reference lists of major articles on the subject. Systemic D-dimer values aid diagnosis and are potentially prognostic indicators in various clinical conditions in emergency medicine. However, they have limited specificity in patients with comorbid conditions. Although there is currently no standard D-dimer assay, immunoturbidimetric assays are the most suitable for use in emergency medicine.

### Diagnostic accuracy of conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values in older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^116SZ4wq]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

Another limitation might be that we included studies with populations suspected of having both pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis, as well as with primary and secondary care patients. This might have introduced some extra between-study variation. Furthermore, there was a variation in the prevalence of venous thromboembolism in the included cohorts, ranging from 5.1% to 39%. However, although previous studies revealed an association between the prevalence of venous thromboembolism and the diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer testing, our covariate analysis did not show such an association. Moreover, there was a fair similarity in study design and patient selection across the included cohorts; in all studies, only patients with a non-high clinical probability were selected. Therefore, we assumed that the conditions for pooling were met.

Finally, the reference standards used to diagnose or exclude venous thromboembolism differed between the included studies. In all but one study, differential verification was of concern; in these studies, venous thromboembolism was excluded without confirmation by imaging in patients with a negative D-dimer test result and without recurrence of symptoms during follow-up. Hence, the false negative cases from using the conventional cut-off value were patients presenting with worsening or recurrence of their symptoms within 45 days or three months, leading to further examinations and the detection of venous thromboembolism. Although this is common practice, this could have introduced small overestimations of the diagnosis.

### Excluding venous thromboembolism using point of care D-dimer tests in outpatients: a diagnostic meta-analysis [^1174474d]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to review the evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of the currently available point of care D-dimer tests for excluding venous thromboembolism.

- **Design**: Systematic review of research on the accuracy of point of care D-dimer tests, utilizing bivariate regression to examine sources of variation and to estimate sensitivity and specificity.

- **Data sources**: Studies on the diagnostic accuracy of point of care D-dimer tests published between January 1995 and September 2008, available in either Medline or Embase.

- **Review methods**: The analysis included studies that compared point of care D-dimer tests with predefined reference criteria for venous thromboembolism, enrolled consecutive outpatients, and allowed for construction of a 2×2 table.

- **Results**: 23 studies (total number of patients 13,959, range in mean age 38–65 years, range of venous thromboembolism prevalence 4–51%) were included in the meta-analysis. The studies reported two qualitative point of care D-dimer tests (SimpliRED D-dimer (n = 12) and Clearview Simplify D-dimer (n = 7)) and two quantitative point of care D-dimer tests (Cardiac D-dimer (n = 4) and Triage D-dimer (n = 2)). Overall sensitivity ranged from 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.78 to 0.90) to 0.96 (0.91 to 0.98) and overall specificity from 0.48 (0.33 to 0.62) to 0.74 (0.69 to 0.78). The two quantitative tests Cardiac D-dimer and Triage D-dimer scored most favourably.

- **Conclusions**: In outpatients suspected of venous thromboembolism, point of care D-dimer tests can contribute important information and guide patient management, notably in low risk patients.

### Appropriate use of D-dimer in hospital patients [^111XAuCs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

D-dimer, the final product of plasmin-mediated degradation of fibrin-rich thrombi, has emerged as a simple blood test that can be utilized in diagnostic algorithms for the exclusion of venous thromboembolism. It is also employed as part of the diagnostic tests for disseminated intravascular coagulation, where excessive thrombin generation is the key pathophysiological factor. However, at present, there are no robust data available on the use of this test to exclude venous thromboembolism in hospital inpatients. Considerable confusion exists among physicians regarding its appropriate use and interpretation in disseminated intravascular coagulation. This article focuses on the available evidence to guide the appropriate use of D-dimer in patients admitted to a hospital.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of D-dimer as a rule-out test for suspected acute aortic dissection [^114XdoMX]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine the diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer as a rule-out test for acute aortic dissection. Previous meta-analyses have encountered methodological problems with conflicting conclusions, and new diagnostic accuracy studies have been published since.

All prospective cross-sectional analytic studies of D-dimer as a diagnostic test for acute aortic dissection were included, where diagnosis was confirmed by an accepted reference standard. Studies were identified using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Medion, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and bibliographies of relevant articles and previous systematic reviews. Two reviewers independently screened articles for inclusion, assessed study quality, and extracted data.

Abstracts from 800 articles were reviewed, yielding 30 potentially relevant studies that were reviewed in full text. Five studies met all eligibility criteria. Data from four studies (1,557 participants) that used a D-dimer cutoff of 0.50 μg/mL were pooled to estimate sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios. Overall, sensitivity and negative likelihood ratio were 98.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 96.3% to 99.1%) and 0.05 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.09), respectively. These measurements had little statistical heterogeneity. Specificity (41.9%; 95% CI 39.0% to 44.9%) and positive likelihood ratio (2.11; 95% CI 1.46 to 3.05) showed significant statistical heterogeneity. When applied to a low-risk population as defined by the American Heart Association (prevalence 6%), the posttest probability was evaluated.
