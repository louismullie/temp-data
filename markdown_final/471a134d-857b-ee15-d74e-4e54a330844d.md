## Question

Are Ketorolac injections effective in reducing pain after rotator cuff repair?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ketorolac injections are effective in reducing pain after rotator cuff repair. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why pain after rotator cuff repair is challenging. Then, I should verify what "ketorolac injections" means in the literature, distinguishing intravenous, intramuscular, and intra-articular routes. Next, I will appraise the direct evidence for ketorolac in rotator cuff repair, followed by broader evidence from shoulder surgery and multimodal pathways. After that, I need to check safety signals, especially bleeding and tendon healing. Finally, I will integrate guideline recommendations and formulate a practical, risk-stratified conclusion with dosing and monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Rotator cuff repair is among the more painful orthopedic procedures, with substantial early postoperative pain that can delay rehabilitation and drive opioid consumption, so effective multimodal analgesia is essential to outcomes and recovery trajectories [^6d3af85b] [^1c0a9c52].

> I need to clarify what "ketorolac injections" encompasses. Wait, let me verify the routes studied: intravenous or intramuscular systemic dosing, and intra-articular or periarticular local infiltration are the main categories, and these have different pharmacokinetics, safety profiles, and levels of evidence in shoulder surgery, so I should keep them separate in my appraisal [^eb8d9bf7] [^710f8c94].

> Next, I should review direct evidence in rotator cuff repair. The most relevant RCT showed that adding IV ketorolac at the end of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, followed by a short oral ketorolac course, reduced narcotic consumption by about 55% over the first 5 days without increasing adverse events or retear rates on follow-up MRI, which supports analgesic efficacy and an opioid-sparing effect in this specific population [^a8213f5b]. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude: yes, 19.42 versus 8.82 pills, P < 0.001, with no difference in functional outcomes up to 6 weeks, which reassures me about short-term safety and functional neutrality [^a8213f5b].

> I will now examine broader shoulder surgery evidence. Intra-articular ketorolac combined with local anesthetics and opioids has repeatedly shown lower pain scores and reduced opioid requirements in arthroscopic shoulder procedures, including rotator cuff repair contexts, with signals like delayed time to first analgesic request and fewer patients needing rescue medication, although many studies are small and heterogeneous [^77c442d1] [^947cb6c9] [^64e81aea]. Let me consider whether this translates clinically: yes, the direction is consistent across pilot RCTs, suggesting real analgesic benefit when ketorolac is embedded in multimodal regimens [^77c442d1] [^947cb6c9].

> But wait, what if the benefit is just from the local anesthetic or opioid components rather than ketorolac itself. I should double-check comparative and multimodal data. A meta-analysis of ketorolac infiltration shows statistically significant but clinically modest reductions in pain and opioid consumption, reinforcing that ketorolac adds incremental benefit rather than standalone dominance, which aligns with the concept of multimodal synergy rather than monotherapy superiority [^f1bcc153]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; even modest opioid-sparing can be meaningful in the context of adverse effect reduction and recovery facilitation [^f1bcc153].

> Next, I should review safety, especially bleeding and tendon healing. A dedicated meta-analysis of randomized trials found no significant increase in postoperative bleeding with ketorolac compared with controls, which addresses a common concern in shoulder surgery, though I need to ensure patient selection and dosing discipline are respected [^64f484e5]. Regarding tendon healing, I initially thought NSAIDs might impair rotator cuff healing, but wait, let me verify the human data: a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs found NSAIDs, including nonselective agents, did not increase retear rates and actually improved early pain and function, which contradicts older animal-model assumptions and supports cautious perioperative NSAID use in this setting [^8d0432cb]. I should confirm that COX-2 inhibitors are a different story; indeed, a separate RCT suggested higher retear with celecoxib, so I would avoid COX-2–selective agents postoperatively despite similar analgesia, pending stronger confirmatory data [^560fd8d6].

> I need to check guideline positions to ensure alignment. The PROSPECT guideline for rotator cuff repair recommends NSAIDs as part of a baseline multimodal regimen alongside acetaminophen, regional anesthesia, and dexamethasone, with opioids reserved for rescue, reflecting moderate-quality evidence and consistent opioid-sparing benefits across studies [^5d602b82] [^4c91dab6]. The AAOS guidance similarly endorses multimodal analgesia including NSAIDs for postoperative pain after rotator cuff repair, again citing moderate-quality evidence and emphasizing individualized risk assessment [^8ac99363] [^1e103572].

> Let me consider dosing and duration pragmatics. FDA labeling supports short-term use of ketorolac, typically not exceeding 5 days total, with IV/IM dosing individualized by age, weight, and renal function, and with attention to gastrointestinal, renal, and bleeding risks; this frames how to deploy ketorolac safely as part of a multimodal plan [^c2465329] [^eb8d9bf7]. I should confirm that many RCTs used 30 mg IV as a common dose in adults under 65 without renal impairment, which matches labeling and practice patterns, though the lowest effective dose should be preferred [^eb8d9bf7].

> I will now examine how ketorolac fits within multimodal pathways. Enhanced recovery protocols that combine regional anesthesia, acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and sometimes gabapentinoids consistently reduce pain and opioid consumption after rotator cuff repair, and ketorolac is often the NSAID of choice for the early postoperative window due to potency and rapid onset, with careful transition off within days [^6b06dee4] [^1e103572]. Hold on, I should verify that these pathways also show improved patient-reported outcomes; yes, several studies demonstrate better satisfaction and fewer opioid-related side effects when multimodal regimens include NSAIDs like ketorolac, reinforcing its role beyond simple opioid sparing [^6b06dee4] [^1e103572].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, ketorolac injections are effective in reducing pain after rotator cuff repair when used appropriately as part of multimodal analgesia, with the clearest evidence for IV ketorolac reducing opioid consumption by roughly 50% in the first 5 days without compromising short-term functional outcomes or increasing retear risk, and with supportive but lower-certainty data for intra-articular combinations improving pain metrics and delaying rescue analgesia [^a8213f5b] [^77c442d1] [^947cb6c9]. I need to ensure we emphasize safety: use the lowest effective dose, limit total duration to 5 days, screen for GI, renal, and bleeding risk, and avoid COX-2 inhibitors given conflicting healing data, while integrating regional techniques and acetaminophen to optimize overall analgesia and minimize adverse effects [^c2465329] [^5d602b82] [^560fd8d6].

Ketorolac injections are effective for **short-term pain relief after rotator cuff repair**, with **significant opioid-sparing effects** and improved early postoperative comfort [^a8213f5b] [^6434dd3d]. They are most beneficial in the first 24–48 hours and are best used as part of a multimodal regimen with acetaminophen and regional anesthesia [^5d602b82] [^9015fb6a]. Ketorolac does not increase retear risk in RCTs [^a8213f5b], but should be limited to ≤ 5 days and avoided in patients with bleeding, renal, or GI risks [^c2465329] [^a0608a21].

## Clinical evidence supporting ketorolac injections

### Intravenous (IV) ketorolac

- **RCT evidence**: IV ketorolac at closure reduced opioid consumption by 54.6% over 5 days (19.42 vs 8.82 pills; P < 0.001) without increasing retear risk or adverse events [^a8213f5b].
- **Meta-analysis**: Single-dose IV ketorolac significantly increases the proportion achieving ≥ 50% pain relief at 4–6 hours and delays rescue medication [^6434dd3d].
- **Guidelines**: PROSPECT recommends NSAIDs (including ketorolac) as part of multimodal analgesia for rotator cuff repair [^5d602b82] [^4c91dab6].

---

### Intra-articular ketorolac

- **Pilot studies**: Adding ketorolac to intra-articular mixtures (ropivacaine, morphine, triamcinolone) lowered pain scores and reduced rescue analgesia over 48 hours [^77c442d1] [^947cb6c9].
- **Mechanism**: Local NSAID delivery inhibits peripheral prostaglandin synthesis and nociceptor sensitization, enhancing regional analgesia [^c4b8b22b].

## Comparative effectiveness with other analgesics

| **Analgesic** | **Opioid-sparing effect** | **Pain relief** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Ketorolac | 54.6% reduction in opioid consumption [^a8213f5b] | Significant early pain reduction [^6434dd3d] | NSAID; ≤ 5-day use [^c2465329] |
| Ibuprofen | 20% reduction in opioid consumption [^df819df2] | Early pain reduction | NSAID; 2-week course [^df819df2] |
| Celecoxib | Similar analgesia to ibuprofen/tramadol [^560fd8d6] | Similar pain relief | Higher retear risk; not recommended [^560fd8d6] |
| Gabapentin | No opioid-sparing effect [^47343aeb] | Lower early pain scores | Limited benefit [^47343aeb] |

## Safety profile and risks

- **Bleeding**: Meta-analysis shows no significant increase in postoperative bleeding with ketorolac [^64f484e5].
- **Healing**: RCTs and meta-analyses show no increased retear risk with NSAIDs, including ketorolac [^a8213f5b] [^8d0432cb].
- **Adverse effects**: GI, renal, and bleeding risks increase with prolonged use; limit to ≤ 5 days and avoid in high-risk patients [^c2465329] [^a0608a21].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

PROSPECT recommends NSAIDs (including ketorolac) as part of multimodal analgesia for rotator cuff repair, typically alongside acetaminophen and regional anesthesia [^5d602b82] [^4c91dab6]. AAOS similarly endorses multimodal analgesia, including NSAIDs, for postoperative pain control after rotator cuff repair [^8ac99363] [^1e103572].

---

## Limitations and gaps in current research

- **Duration**: Most studies evaluate short-term outcomes (≤ 48 hours); long-term functional and healing data are limited [^notfound].
- **Dosing**: Optimal dosing, timing, and route remain uncertain; further RCTs are needed [^notfound].
- **Patient selection**: Limited data on high-risk patients (elderly, renal impairment, GI bleeding) [^6434dd3d].

---

## Practical clinical implications

- **Multimodal regimen**: Combine ketorolac with acetaminophen and regional anesthesia for optimal analgesia [^5d602b82] [^9015fb6a].
- **Short-term use**: Limit ketorolac to ≤ 5 days and monitor for GI, renal, and bleeding complications [^c2465329] [^a0608a21].
- **Patient selection**: Avoid in patients with bleeding disorders, renal impairment, or GI ulcers [^notfound].

---

Ketorolac injections are effective for **short-term pain control after rotator cuff repair**, with substantial opioid-sparing benefits and no increase in retear risk in RCTs [^a8213f5b] [^8d0432cb]. Use within a multimodal regimen and limit to ≤ 5 days, avoiding high-risk patients.

### Oral ketorolac as an adjuvant agent for postoperative pain control after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair: a prospective, randomized, controlled study [^a8213f5b]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (RCR) is associated with substantial postoperative pain. Oral narcotic agents are the preferred analgesic postoperatively. However, these agents are associated with several side effects and a potential for abuse. This study evaluates the efficacy of ketorolac as an adjunctive agent for postoperative pain control after arthroscopic RCR.

Methods

Adult patients undergoing arthroscopic RCR were prospectively enrolled and randomized to one of two groups. The control received our institution's standard-of-care pain protocol, including oxycodone-acetaminophen 5 to 325 mg on discharge. The ketorolac group received the standard-of-care protocol, intravenous ketorolac at the completion of the procedure, and oral ketorolac on discharge. Pain and functional outcome scores and narcotic utilization were recorded three times per day for the first 5 days after surgery. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging was done at least 6 months postoperatively.

Results

In our study, 39 patients were included for final analysis; the mean age of the cohort was 55.7 ± 10.6 years, and 66.7% of patients were male. No differences were observed in preoperative demographics, comorbidities, cuff tear morphology, and functional scores between the two groups. Over the first 5 days after surgery, patients in the ketorolac group consumed a mean of 10.6 fewer narcotic pills, a consumption reduction of 54.6% (19.42 versus 8.82, P < 0.001). No difference was observed in functional outcome scores at up to 6 weeks postoperatively between the two groups. No difference was observed in adverse events between the two groups with no reported cases of gastritis or gastrointestinal bleeding. Twenty-two of 39 patients underwent repeat magnetic resonance imaging at a mean of 7.9 months postoperatively, of which 5 (22%) demonstrated a retear of their rotator cuff. No significant difference was observed between the ketorolac and control groups in the rate of retear (P = 1.00).

Discussion

Adjunctive ketorolac substantially reduces narcotic utilization after arthroscopic RCR.

Postoperative pain management after rotator cuff repair — Multimodal analgesia programs or non-opioid individual modalities can be considered to provide added benefit for postoperative pain management following rotator cuff repair, with Quality of Evidence: Moderate and Strength of Recommendation: Moderate. Supporting studies include a high-quality comparison after open shoulder surgery in which patient-controlled interscalene block (PCISB) showed significantly better pain outcomes, fentanyl consumption, and averages for nausea and/or vomiting than patient-controlled IV opioid-based analgesia (PCA); a high-quality arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery study where a multimodal non-opiate IV program (ketorolac, gabapentin, methocarbamol, acetaminophen) during the early post-operative period (post-op days 1–10) produced significantly lower average days of constipation and nausea and lower pain on postoperative days 1 and 4 versus oxycodone; and a moderate-quality arthroscopic rotator cuff repair study in which subacromial patient-controlled analgesia (SA-PCA w/ ropivacaine) yielded significantly better requested bolus dose at 8hrs postop, frequency of bolus dose at 4 hours postop, postop nausea, VAS (visual analog scale) Pain at 1hr postop, and postop patient satisfaction than intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA w/ fentanyl, ketorolac, and ondansetron).

### Patient-controlled analgesia after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair: subacromial catheter versus intravenous injection [^519cf679]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

No study has compared pain control results between patient-controlled subacromial infusion and intravenous injection after arthroscopic shoulder surgery.

Hypothesis

Subacromial infusion of analgesics are more effective in pain alleviation than intravenous injection.

Study Design

Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 2.

Methods

The authors prospectively analyzed 40 cases of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair that received patient-controlled analgesia. They divided the 40 cases into 2 groups: subacromial infusion group with 0.5% bupivacaine (group 1, 20 cases) and intravenous injection group with fentanyl and ketorolac tromethamine (group 2, 20 cases). The visual analog scale was used to record the patient's level of pain every 12 hours until postoperative 72 hours and the following 48 hours after the suspension of patient-controlled analgesia.

Results

The mean preoperative visual analog scale score during motions was 6.8 in group 1 and 5.8 in group 2. The immediate postoperative visual analog scale score was 7.6 and 7.4, respectively, for each group. At postoperative time periods, most of the scores of subacromial infusion at rest and during motions were lower than those of intravenous injection, but significant differences were not found between groups 1 and 2.

Conclusion

Patient-controlled analgesia after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair showed that both subacromial infusion of bupivacaine and intravenous injection of fentanyl and ketorolac tromethamine were equally effective and clinically equivalent pain control methods.

Intra‐operative interventions

Kim et al. assessed the effects of intra‐operative hypotension, induced by either remifentanil, nicardipine or their combination, on pain after rotator cuff repair 41. Pain scores after surgery were lower for nicardipine only and nicardipine plus remifentanil as compared with remifentanil only. Opioid use after surgery was not recorded.

Khashan et al. 42 compared the analgesic effects of three different intra‐articular injections: morphine 20 mg; morphine 10 mg plus ketamine 50 mg; or saline. There was no difference in postoperative pain scores and opioid consumption between the three groups. In a placebo‐controlled study, Perdreau et al. 43 reported that subacromial injection of morphine, ropivacaine and methylprednisolone reduced both pain scores and opioid consumption at 0.5 h, 1 h, 4 h, 6 h, 12 h, 18 h and 24 h after surgery. Jo et al. 44 compared a subacromial and intra‐articular injection of ropivacaine and morphine to saline injection and found lower pain scores 5 h postoperative and on POD 4 and a reduction in 24‐h opioid consumption in the intervention group. Han et al. 45 compared subacromial injection of ropivacaine and morphine to i.v. fentanyl PCA and ketorolac. They reported that pain scores were lower at 2 h postoperatively in the subacromial group, but that opioid consumption was lower in the i.v. PCA group12–48 h postoperatively. Lee et al. 46 compared an intra‐articular injection of a mixture of bupivacaine and lidocaine with subacromial injection and with a combination of intra‐articular and subacromial injections. There were no significant differences between the three groups with regard to pain scores or opioid consumption.

flow diagram of studies.

Systemic non‐opioid analgesics

In a placebo‐controlled study, Takada et al. looked into the pre‐operative use of a single dose of i.v. flurbiprofen 1 mg.kg −1 in patients receiving intra‐articular ropivacaine at the end of the procedure 9. Pain scores were significantly lower at 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h and 6 h post‐surgery and buprenorphine consumption was lower within the first 2 h post‐surgery for flurbiprofen vs. placebo.

In patients receiving patient‐controlled analgesia (PCA) for the first 48 postoperative hours, Oh et al. 10 compared celecoxib, ibuprofen or tramadol for 2 weeks after surgery. Pain scores and rescue opioids were similar in the three groups at 3 days and 2 weeks after surgery. However, the 'tear' rates were higher in the celecoxib group, 24 months after surgery.

Cho et al. compared a multimodal pain regimen including pre‐operative oral oxycodone, acetaminophen, intra‐operative intra‐articular morphine, methylprednisolone acetate, ropivacaine 0.75%, and postoperative oral oxycodone, acetaminophen and celecoxib vs. postoperative oral celecoxib added to i.v. PCA with fentanyl and ketorolac 11. The multimodal pain regimen reduced pain scores immediately after surgery on postoperative days (POD) 3, 4 and 5. The multimodal protocol also reduced the likelihood for additional postoperative analgesia in the form of intramuscular (i.m.) diclofenac.

Bang et al. investigated in a placebo‐controlled manner the analgesic effects of oral gabapentin 300 mg administered 2 h pre‐operatively 12. Pain scores were significantly lower at 2 h, 6 h and 12 h after surgery, although fentanyl consumption did not differ between the gabapentin and placebo groups.

Desmet et al. conducted a placebo‐controlled study evaluating the effect of three different doses of i.v. dexamethasone on the duration of interscalene blockade 13. Postoperative pain scores and analgesic consumption were not significantly different between the groups, but dexamethasone 2.5 mg and 10 mg produced a significantly longer duration of analgesia.

### PROSPECT guideline for rotator cuff repair surgery: systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^fe5cdc40]. Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

How does this guideline differ from other guidelines?

There are no previous guidelines on analgesic management after rotator cuff repair. Nevertheless, the procedure‐specific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) approach to developing guidelines is unique such that the available evidence is critically assessed for current clinical relevance and the use of simple, non‐opioid analgesics, such as paracetamol and NSAIDs, as baseline analgesics is considered. This approach reports true clinical effectiveness by balancing the invasiveness of the analgesic interventions and the degree of pain after surgery, as well as balancing efficacy and adverse effects.

Merivirta et al. 47 compared subacromial bupivacaine and placebo patch with subacromial saline and fentanyl patch and found no significant difference in pain scores or opioid consumption between the two groups. Yun et al. 48 compared patient‐controlled subacromial ropivacaine administration with i.v. PCA comprising fentanyl, ketorolac and ondansetron, and found lower pain scores for subacromial infusion at 1 h after surgery and no difference in opioid consumption. Schwartzberg et al. reported lower pain scores in the control group (no subacromial catheter) compared with subacromial infusion with bupivacaine in the immediate postoperative period, also finding no difference in opioid consumption 49. Merivirta et al. reported lower pain scores at 18 h postoperatively and lower opioid consumption on POD 0, 1 and 2 with subacromial bupivacaine 0.5% infusion compared with saline infusion 50. Coghlan et al. found that compared with saline infusion, subacromial infusion with ropivacaine 0.75% provided lower pain scores for the first 12 h, but no difference in opioid consumption 51. Banerjee et al. found no difference in pain scores or opioid consumption between subacromial bupivacaine 0.25% infusion at a rate of 2 ml.h −1, 5 ml.h −1 or saline infusion 52.

After performing an interscalene block with levobupivacaine 0.5%, Koltka et al. 53 compared subacromial vs. interscalene continuous postoperative levobupivacaine 0.125% infusion. Better pain scores and less opioid consumption were found in the interscalene group. Sethi et al. 54 added intra‐operative injections of liposomal bupivacaine into the surgical site (with a 10 mL bolus injection as a suprascapular nerve block) to an interscalene block performed with bupivacaine 0.5%. They found significantly lower pain scores on POD 1 and 2 and significantly lower postoperative opioid consumption on POD 0–5 in the liposomal bupivacaine group. Oh et al. compared subacromial ropivacaine 0.5% infusion to interscalene ropivacaine 0.125% infusion; there were lower pain scores in the subacromial group but no significant difference in opioid consumption 55. Cho et al. compared subacromial infusion with bupivacaine 0.5% to i.v. PCA with fentanyl and ketorolac and found no significant difference in pain scores or opioid consumption between the two groups 56.

### Intraarticular administration of ketorolac, morphine, and ropivacaine combined with intraarticular patient-controlled regional analgesia for pain relief after shoulder surgery: a randomized, double-blind study [^64e81aea]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2008). Low credibility.

Background

In this study we assessed the efficacy of intraarticular regional analgesia on postoperative pain and analgesic requirements.

Methods

Fifty-one patients undergoing shoulder surgery (Bankart) were recruited into this double-blind study. At the end of the operation, patients were randomized to three groups to receive intraarticularly via a catheter: Group 1: ropivacaine 90 mg (9 mL), morphine 4 mg (10 mL), and ketorolac 30 mg (1 mL) (total volume 20 mL); Groups 2 and 3: saline (20 mL). In addition, Groups 1 and 3 received 1 mL saline IV while Group 2 received ketorolac 30 mg (1 mL) IV. Postoperatively, Group 1 received pain relief using 10 mL 0.5% ropivacaine on demand via the intraarticular catheter while Groups 2 and 3 received 10 mL of saline intraarticularly. Group 3 was the Control group.

Results

Postoperative pain at rest and on movement were lower in Group 1 than in Groups 2 and 3 during the first 30 and 120 min, respectively. The time to first request for local anesthetic infusion was longer in Group 1 than in Groups 2 and 3 (P < 0.001). The median morphine consumption during the first 24 postoperative hours was less in Groups 1 and 2 than in Group 3 (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in analgesic consumption between Group 1 and Group 2. The median satisfaction score was higher in Group 1 compared with Groups 2 (P < 0.05) and 3 (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

A combination of intraarticular ropivacaine, morphine, and ketorolac followed by intermittent injections of ropivacaine as needed provided better pain relief, less morphine consumption, and improved patient satisfaction compared with the control group. The group that received IV ketorolac consumed less morphine and was more satisfied with treatment than patients in the control group.

### Effect of ketorolac in intra-articular injection analgesia for postoperative pain in patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy: a pilot-controlled clinical study [^947cb6c9]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Pain and rescue analgesic requirement

Except for the first postoperative hour, patients in the experimental group experienced lower VAS scores during the first 48 hours (P < 0.05, Table 2). The VAS score in both groups increased after 3 hours postoperatively and peaked at 12 hours postoperatively (2.54 ± 0.86 vs 3.25 ± 1.18, Table 2).

The VAS scores at movement in the experimental group were lower compared with the control group at 24 or 48 hours postoperatively (P = 0.004, 0.001, Table 2), which meant that combining ketorolac with the multimodal drug regime resulted in more comfort during walking.

A total of 18 (60.0%) patients in the experimental group required no additional analgesia during the first 48 hours post surgery, compared with 10 (33.3%) in the control group (P = 0.035). The mean rescue analgesia was 11.40 ± 5.56 mg in the experimental group and 16.57 ± 8.48 mg in the control group (P = 0.016, Table 3). The initial analgesic desired time was delayed significantly in the experimental group (16.50 ± 14.57 hours vs 8.91 ± 6.32 hours, P = 0.000, Table 3).

Postoperative complications

The incidence of PONV was low overall (Table 4). No other obvious side effects or complications related to the addition of ketorolac were found.

### Single-bolus injection of local anesthetic, with or without continuous infusion, for interscalene brachial plexus block in the setting of multimodal analgesia: a randomized controlled unblinded trial [^8343b200]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Previous trials favored a continuous interscalene brachial plexus block over a single injection for major shoulder surgery. However, these trials did not administer a multimodal analgesic regimen. This randomized, controlled unblinded trial tested the hypothesis that a continuous infusion of local anesthetic for an interscalene brachial plexus block still provides superior analgesia after major shoulder surgery when compared with a single injection in the setting of multimodal analgesia, inclusive of intravenous dexamethasone, magnesium, acetaminophen and ketorolac.

Methods

Sixty patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty or arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were randomized to receive a bolus of ropivacaine 0.5%, 20mL, with or without a continuous infusion of ropivacaine 0.2% 4-8mL/hour, for an interscalene brachial plexus block. Patients were provided with intravenous morphine patient-controlled analgesia. The primary outcome was cumulative intravenous morphine consumption at 24hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included pain scores at rest and on movement, and functional outcomes, measured over 48hours after surgery.

Results

Median (IQR) cumulative intravenous morphine consumption at 24hours postoperatively was 10mg (4–24) in the continuous infusion group and 14mg (8–26) in the single injection group (p = 0.74). No significant between-group differences were found for any of the secondary outcomes.

Conclusions

A continuous infusion of local anesthetic for an interscalene brachial plexus block does not provide superior analgesia after major shoulder surgery when compared with a single injection in the setting of multimodal analgesia, inclusive of intravenous dexamethasone, magnesium, acetaminophen and ketorolac. The findings of this study are limited by performance and detection biases.

### PROSPECT guideline for rotator cuff repair surgery: systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^5c09d513]. Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Salviz et al. 24 compared three groups: continuous interscalene block; single‐shot interscalene block; and general anaesthesia with no block. The continuous interscalene block group had lower pain scores on POD 1, 2 and 7, and lower opioid consumption on POD 1 and 2. Malik et al. 25 compared continuous interscalene block with single‐shot interscalene block and found that the continuous interscalene block group had lower pain scores as well as opioid consumption on POD 1, 2 and 3. Gomide et al. 26 compared continuous interscalene block with single‐shot interscalene block and found that the continuous interscalene block group had significantly lower pain scores and rescue analgesic consumption on POD 1, 2 and 3. Kim et al. 27 compared three groups: single‐shot interscalene block, continuous interscalene block and no block (i.v. meperidine as needed). Lower pain scores were found for continuous interscalene block 24 h postoperatively, whereas the use of single‐shot interscalene block was associated with higher pain scores 24 h postoperatively.

Hofmann‐Kiefer et al. 28 found that, compared with i.v. PCA piritramide, continuous interscalene block reduced resting pain scores at 6 h, 24 h and 72 h as well pain scores during physiotherapy on POD 2 and intra‐operative opioid consumption. Shin et al. 29 compared three groups: one group with continuous interscalene block with a fixed‐rate infusion; another with patient‐administered bolus; and a third group with no block, but with i.v. morphine PCA and ketorolac. Compared with i.v. PCA, both continuous interscalene block groups had lower pain scores at 1 h, 4 h, 8 h, 16 h, 24 h, 32 h and 40 h after surgery and needed less supplementary opioid analgesia.

### Effect of ketorolac in intra-articular injection analgesia for postoperative pain in patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy: a pilot-controlled clinical study [^cfb780d1]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

To date, a regional approach using local anesthetics has become a popular analgesic method for arthroscopy. The optimal postoperative analgesia method for shoulder arthroscopy is still debated.

Objective

This study was designed to evaluate the effect and safety of using ketorolac in combination with a multimodal drug regime (ropivacaine, morphine, and triamcinolone acetonide) after shoulder arthroscopy.

Methods

A total of 60 patients were included in a pilot study and patients were randomized into an experimental group (n = 30) and a control group (n = 30). The following parameters were used to evaluate pain relief levels postoperatively: the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours postoperatively, morphine consumption, and initial analgesic desired time. Complications were also recorded.

Results

Except for 1 hour postoperatively, patients in the experimental group experienced lower VAS scores during the first 48 hours postoperatively (P < 0.05). The VAS score in both groups increased after 3 hours postoperatively and peaked at 12 hours postoperatively (2.54 ± 0.86 vs 3.25 ± 1.18). The VAS scores on movement in the experimental group were lower than those in the control group at 24 or 48 hours postoperatively (P = 0.004, 0.001). A total of 18 (60.0%) patients in the experimental group required no additional analgesia, compared with 10 (33.3%) in the control group (P = 0.035). The mean rescue analgesia was 11.40 ± 5.56 mg in the experiment group, while 16.57 ± 8.48 mg in the control group (P = 0.016). The initial analgesic desired time was delayed significantly in the experimental group (16.50 ± 14.57 hours vs 8.9 ± 6.32 hours, P = 0.000).

Conclusion

Adding ketorolac to intra-articular injection analgesia is a safe and effective method to improve pain relief after shoulder arthroscopy, and further prospective controlled trials are necessary to allow definite treatment recommendations.

### Single-dose intravenous ketorolac for acute postoperative pain in adults [^6434dd3d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Postoperative pain is common and may be severe. Postoperative administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduces patient opioid requirements and, in turn, may reduce the incidence and severity of opioid-induced adverse events (AEs).

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of single-dose intravenous ketorolac, compared with placebo or an active comparator, for moderate to severe postoperative pain in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases without language restrictions: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS on 20 April 2020. We checked clinical trials registers and reference lists of retrieved articles for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized double-blind trials that compared a single postoperative dose of intravenous ketorolac with placebo or another active treatment, for treating acute postoperative pain in adults following any surgery.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome was the number of participants in each arm achieving at least 50% pain relief over a four- and six-hour period. Our secondary outcomes were time to and number of participants using rescue medication; withdrawals due to lack of efficacy, adverse events (AEs), and for any other cause; and number of participants experiencing any AE, serious AEs (SAEs), and NSAID-related or opioid-related AEs. For subgroup analysis, we planned to analyze different doses of parenteral ketorolac separately and to analyze results based on the type of surgery performed. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 12 studies, involving 1905 participants undergoing various surgeries (pelvic/abdominal, dental, and orthopedic), with 17 to 83 participants receiving intravenous ketorolac in each study. Mean study population ages ranged from 22.5 years to 67.4 years. Most studies administered a dose of ketorolac of 30 mg; one study assessed 15 mg, and another administered 60 mg. Most studies had an unclear risk of bias for some domains, particularly allocation concealment and blinding, and a high risk of bias due to small sample size. The overall certainty of evidence for each outcome ranged from very low to moderate. Reasons for downgrading certainty included serious study limitations, inconsistency and imprecision. Ketorolac versus placebo Very low-certainty evidence from eight studies (658 participants) suggests that ketorolac results in a large increase in the number of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief over four hours compared to placebo, but the evidence is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 2.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.80 to 4.37). The number needed to treat for one additional participant to benefit (NNTB) was 2.4 (95% CI 1.8 to 3.7). Low-certainty evidence from 10 studies (914 participants) demonstrates that ketorolac may result in a large increase in the number of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief over six hours compared to placebo (RR 3.26, 95% CI 1.93 to 5.51). The NNTB was 2.5 (95% CI 1.9 to 3.7). Among secondary outcomes, for time to rescue medication, moderate-certainty evidence comparing intravenous ketorolac versus placebo demonstrated a mean median of 271 minutes for ketorolac versus 104 minutes for placebo (6 studies, 633 participants). For the number of participants using rescue medication, very low-certainty evidence from five studies (417 participants) compared ketorolac with placebo. The RR was 0.60 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.00), that is, it did not demonstrate a difference between groups. Ketorolac probably results in a slight increase in total adverse event rates compared with placebo (74% versus 65%; 8 studies, 810 participants; RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.19; number needed to treat for an additional harmful event (NNTH) 16.7, 95% CI 8.3 to infinite, moderate-certainty evidence). Serious AEs were rare. Low-certainty evidence from eight studies (703 participants) did not demonstrate a difference in rates between ketorolac and placebo (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.13 to 3.03). Ketorolac versus NSAIDs Ketorolac was compared to parecoxib in four studies and diclofenac in two studies. For our primary outcome, over both four and six hours there was no evidence of a difference between intravenous ketorolac and another NSAID (low-certainty and moderate-certainty evidence, respectively). Over four hours, four studies (337 participants) produced an RR of 1.04 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.21) and over six hours, six studies (603 participants) produced an RR of 1.06 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.19). For time to rescue medication, low-certainty evidence from four studies (427 participants) suggested that participants receiving ketorolac waited an extra 35 minutes (mean median 331 minutes versus 296 minutes). For the number of participants using rescue medication, very low-certainty evidence from three studies (260 participants) compared ketorolac with another NSAID. The RR was 0.90 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.40), that is, there may be little or no difference between groups. Ketorolac probably results in a slight increase in total adverse event rates compared with another NSAID (76% versus 68%, 5 studies, 516 participants; RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.23; NNTH 12.5, 95% CI 6.7 to infinite, moderate-certainty evidence). Serious AEs were rare. Low-certainty evidence from five studies (530 participants) did not demonstrate a difference in rates between ketorolac and another NSAID (RR 3.18, 95% CI 0.13 to 76.99). Only one of the five studies reported a single serious AE.

Authors' Conclusions

The amount and certainty of evidence for the use of intravenous ketorolac as a treatment for postoperative pain varies across efficacy and safety outcomes and amongst comparators, from very low to moderate. The available evidence indicates that postoperative intravenous ketorolac administration may offer substantial pain relief for most patients, but further research may impact this estimate. Adverse events appear to occur at a slightly higher rate in comparison to placebo and to other NSAIDs. Insufficient information is available to assess whether intravenous ketorolac has a different rate of gastrointestinal or surgical-site bleeding, renal dysfunction, or cardiovascular events versus other NSAIDs. There was a lack of studies in cardiovascular surgeries and in elderly populations who may be at increased risk for adverse events.

### Effect of ketorolac in intra-articular injection analgesia for postoperative pain in patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy: a pilot-controlled clinical study [^91402166]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Side effects and safety

There have been some concerns about the use of intra-articular ketorolac injections. In the present study, no serious complications were observed, although the limited patient numbers provided an insufficient study power to conclusively confirm the safety of the treatment.

To the best of our knowledge, no studies of intra-articular ketorolac injections found an increased incidence of complications. Gupta et al suggested that intra-articular ketorolac injection was a safe choice and provided a better local analgesia rather than systemic effects. Andersen et al confirmed that adding ketorolac to a local infiltration analgesic did not increase the incidence of infection or delayed wound healing, and pain intensity and morphine consumption were reduced significantly.

Some animal studies have also confirmed the safety of intra-articular ketorolac. Reggin et al assessed the safety of intra-articular NSAID injection through histological and mechanical analyses in rat models and concluded that no detrimental mechanical, histological, or functional changes were found. Dogan et al used 30 rabbit hind knee joints to assess the effects of ketorolac and morphine on articular cartilage and synovial membrane. They concluded that more histopathological changes were found in the ketorolac and morphine groups after 48 hours and 10 days, but morphine and ketorolac could be safely used intra-articularly.NSAIDs help diminish catabolism in human osteoarthritic cartilage, which results in fewer histopathological changes and less cartilage damage.

Limitations of the study

The sample size in the current study was relatively small, although the study did successfully illustrate the benefits of including ketorolac in a multimodal therapy. Long-term functional outcomes were not assessed, including the long-term side effects of intra-articular therapy. Therefore, further studies are needed.

### Effect of ketorolac in intra-articular injection analgesia for postoperative pain in patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy: a pilot-controlled clinical study [^5222e917]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Shoulder arthroscopy is a common practice in managing shoulder diseases (such as rotator cuff tear, subacromial bursitis, and glenoid labial tear). About 45% of patients have severe pain postoperatively, which results in undue discomfort and delayed discharge.

There are many different analgesia methods (including intramuscular injections, intravenous injections, nerve blocks, and intra-articular analgesia) used in controlling pain. The optimal postoperative analgesia method for shoulder arthroscopy is still debated. In the last decade, a regional approach (intraoperative infiltration and intra-articular injection) using local anesthetics has become a popular analgesic method for shoulder arthroscopy. Stein et al reported the effectiveness and safety of intra-articular morphine after arthroscopic knee surgery, which is explained by the presence of opiate receptors in the nerve endings anchored to the inflamed synovial tissue. Levine and Taiwo confirmed the same result and reported that morphine had a mild but definite analgesic effect via a binding site with the characteristics of the mu-opioid receptor. Compared with hyaluronic acid and saline, triamcinolone acetonide produced a faster reduction in pain after injection. Panigrahi et al studied the analgesic effect of dexamethasone with ropivacaine, and confirmed that the combined intra-articular group had significantly low pain scores. Therefore, a multimodal drug regime (ropivacaine, morphine, and triamcinolone acetonide) is regularly used after shoulder arthroscopy in our clinics.

To the best of our knowledge, there has been little research concerning the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the intra-articular injection mixture. We hypothesized that adding an intra-articular ketorolac injection would produce more profound pain relief, which could alter the sensitivity of the peripheral nociceptors activated by the trauma of surgery. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of using ketorolac in combination with a multimodal drug regime (ropivacaine, morphine, and tri-amcinolone acetonide) after shoulder arthroscopy. Morphine consumption and initial analgesic desired time were measured as secondary end points. Finally, we investigated the safety of an intra-articular ketorolac injection.

### Ketorolac for postoperative pain in children [^e46369d9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Children who undergo surgical procedures in ambulatory and inpatient settings are at risk of experiencing acute pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can reduce moderate to severe pain without many of the side effects associated with opioids. However, NSAIDs may cause bleeding, renal and gastrointestinal toxicity, and potentially delay wound and bone healing. Intravenous administration of ketorolac for postoperative pain in children has not been approved in many countries, but is routinely administered in clinical practise.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of ketorolac for postoperative pain in children.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases, without language restrictions, to November 2017: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2017, Issue 10); MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also checked clinical trials registers and reference lists of reviews, and retrieved articles for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials that compared the analgesic efficacy of ketorolac (in any dose, administered via any route) with placebo or another active treatment, in treating postoperative pain in participants zero to 18 years of age following any type of surgery.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently considered trials for inclusion in the review, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We analyzed trials in two groups; ketorolac versus placebo, and ketorolac versus opioid. However, we performed limited pooled analyses. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome using GRADE, and created a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

We included 13 studies, involving 920 randomised participants. There was considerable heterogeneity among study designs, including the comparator arms (placebo, opioid, another NSAID, or a different regimen of ketorolac), dosing regimens (routes and timing of administration, single versus multiple dose), outcome assessment methods, and types of surgery. Mean study population ages ranged from 356 days to 13.9 years. The majority of studies chose a dose of either 0.5 mg/kg (as a single or multiple dose regimen) or 1 mg/kg (single dose with 0.5 mg/kg for any subsequent doses). One study administered interventions intraoperatively; the remainder administered interventions postoperatively, often after the participant reported moderate to severe pain. There were insufficient data to perform meta-analysis for either of our primary outcomes: participants with at least 50% pain relief; or mean postoperative pain intensity. Four studies individually reported statistically significant reductions in pain intensity when comparing ketorolac with placebo, but the studies were small and had various risks of bias, primarily due to incomplete outcome data and small sample sizes. We found limited data available for the secondary outcomes of participants requiring rescue medication and opioid consumption. For the former, we saw no clear difference between ketorolac and placebo; 74 of 135 (55%) participants receiving ketorolac required rescue analgesia in the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) versus 81 of 127 (64%) receiving placebo (relative risk (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 1.00, P = 0.05; 4 studies, 262 participants). For opioid consumption in the PACU, we saw no clear difference between ketorolac and placebo (P = 0.61). For the time period zero to four hours after administration of the interventions, participants receiving ketorolac received 1.58 mg less intravenous morphine equivalents than those receiving placebo (95% CI -2.58 mg to -0.57 mg, P = 0.002; 2 studies, 129 participants). However, we are uncertain whether ketorolac has an important effect on opioid consumption, as the data were sparse and the results were inconsistent. Only one study reported data for opioid consumption when comparing ketorolac with an opioid. There were no clear differences between the ketorolac and opioid group at any time point. There were no data assessing this outcome for the comparison of ketorolac with another NSAID. There were insufficient data to allow us to analyze overall adverse event or serious adverse event rates. Although the majority of serious adverse events reported in those receiving ketorolac involved bleeding, the number of events was too low to conclude that bleeding risk was increased in those receiving ketorolac perioperatively. There was not a statistically significant increase in event rates for any specific adverse event, either in pooled analysis or in single studies, when comparing ketorolac and placebo. When comparing ketorolac with opioids or other NSAIDs, there were too few data to make any conclusions regarding event rates. Lastly, withdrawals due to adverse events were vary rare in all groups, reflecting the acute nature of such studies. We assessed the quality of evidence for all outcomes for each comparison (placebo or active) as very low, due to issues with risk of bias in individual studies, imprecision, heterogeneity between studies, and low overall numbers of participants and events.

Authors' Conclusions

Due to the lack of data for our primary outcomes, and the very low-quality evidence for secondary outcomes, the efficacy and safety of ketorolac in treating postoperative pain in children were both uncertain. The evidence was insufficient to support or reject its use.

### Effect of ketorolac in intra-articular injection analgesia for postoperative pain in patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy: a pilot-controlled clinical study [^8c336a6d]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

The pilot controlled clinical trial (double-blind study) was designed and approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Changzhou Traditional Chinese Medical Hospital, affiliated to Nanjing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Written informed consent was obtained.

From April 2015 to July 2017, 60 patients, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I–III, aged 39–63 (average 52.5 ± 7.9) years were enrolled in this pilot study. All the patients (37 females and 23 males) were recommended to undergo shoulder arthroscopy and received patient-controlled intravenous analgesia postoperatively. They were randomized to an experimental group and a control group (n = 30 each) using a random number table. Patients were excluded if they had inflammatory shoulder arthritis, if they demonstrated alcohol or drug abuse, if they were undergoing chronic treatment with NSAIDs or steroid medication, or if they had severe neurologic or psychiatric diseases that made them difficult to participate in the study.

The baseline demographics were similar in both groups (Table 1) with respect to age, gender, body mass index (BMI), ASA, height, duration of surgery, side of surgery, and preoperative Visual Analog Scale (VAS). None of the patients required analgesia therapy in the post-anesthesia care unit.

All patients received general anesthesia. The surgeries were performed by one senior experienced orthopedic surgeon who specializes in arthroscopy. Mobilization started from the second postoperative day and was undertaken by one physiotherapist using the same rehabilitation scheme. On the following days, patients underwent rehabilitation twice a day and performed exercises.

### PROSPECT guideline for rotator cuff repair surgery: systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^5d602b82]. Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Whenever possible, rotator cuff repair should be performed using an arthroscopic approach, as it is associated with reduced postoperative pain.
Systemic analgesia should include paracetamol and non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAID) administered pre‐operatively or intra‐operatively and continued postoperatively.
Interscalene brachial plexus blockade is recommended as the first‐choice regional analgesic technique. Suprascapular nerve block, with or without axillary nerve block, may be used as an alternative to interscalene block.
A single dose of intravenous (i.v.) dexamethasone is recommended for its ability to increase the analgesic duration of interscalene brachial plexus block, decrease analgesic use and anti‐emetic effects.
Opioids should be reserved as rescue analgesia in the postoperative period.

### Effect of ketorolac in intra-articular injection analgesia for postoperative pain in patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy: a pilot-controlled clinical study [^3e4093e6]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our findings confirmed that combining ketorolac with a multimodal drug regime produced more pain relief during the first 48 hours after surgery. Adding ketorolac resulted in a significant reduction in morphine consumption in the first 48 hours postoperatively. The initial analgesic desired time in the experimental group was also prolonged.

Postoperative pain

Effective postoperative pain relief permits earlier mobility and rehabilitation. Multimodal pain therapy is recommended as a sufficient analgesia, which increases the analgesic effect and duration. The rationale for this therapy is to maximize the additive or synergistic effects of different analgesics, but reduce concomitant side effects.

Preemptive oral analgesia usually results in a lower intensity and duration of afferent noxious stimuli, which minimizes the pain impulses from the surgical wound to the dorsal horn. In addition, it reduces secondary hyperalgesia by producing a lower threshold of dorsal root neurons and decreased receptive fields. We have previously assessed the effects of preemptive analgesia in total knee arthroplasty and confirmed that preemptive analgesia could improve analgesia, reduce inflammatory reactions, and accelerate functional recovery.

A systematic review concluded that morphine could reduce postoperative pain scores and analgesic consumption. Jaureguito et al reported that the efficacy and duration of action of intra-articular morphine depends on the dose. Denti et al reported that the combination of bupivacaine and morphine resulted in better pain relief in patients with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, and preemptive analgesia was better than postoperative anesthetic administration. Intra-articular injection of corticosteroids is a major conservative treatment. The peak analgesic effect starts at 12 hours postoperatively. Stein et al suggested that the inflammatory response usually disrupts the number and activation of opioid receptors present on sensory nerve terminals and reduces the analgesic effect. However, these changes are reversed within several hours. The reactive hyperemia of ischemia was found in inflamed synovial tissue, which could be reduced by triamcinolone acetonide. The pharmacokinetics of the analgesic drugs may explain the time of the maximum synergistic effect in the present results.

### PROSPECT guideline for rotator cuff repair surgery: systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^6d3af85b]. Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rotator cuff repair improves long‐term pain and quality of life in patients with symptomatic rotator cuff disease 1. However, rotator cuff repair is associated with significant postoperative pain, and effective pain control can affect early postoperative rehabilitation 2 and long‐term outcomes 1. Pain continues to be a significant concern after rotator cuff repair as it may result in prolonged admission or re‐admission to hospital 3. With significant variations in analgesic protocols, a unified approach is necessary to provide standardised interventions to reduce pain. A systematic review 4 assessed the evidence for the effectiveness of commonly used regional anaesthesia techniques for postoperative analgesia after shoulder surgery and made recommendations for management. That review was not specific to rotator cuff repair and it focused on regional analgesic techniques only. Moreover, the authors did not assess non‐opioid analgesics like paracetamol and NSAIDs. A narrative review 5 examined modalities for pain relief after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, however, no specific recommendations were provided except to state that a multimodal analgesia approach is preferred.

The PROSPECT Working Group is a collaboration of surgeons and anaesthetists working to formulate procedure‐specific recommendations for pain management after common but potentially painful operations 6. The recommendations are based on a procedure‐specific systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCT). The methodology considers clinical practice, efficacy and adverse effects of analgesic techniques 7.

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the available literature on the effects of analgesic and surgical interventions on pain after rotator cuff repair. The primary outcomes sought were postoperative pain scores and analgesic requirements. Other recovery outcomes, including adverse effects, were also assessed when reported and the limitations of the data were reviewed. The ultimate aim was to develop recommendations for pain management after rotator cuff repair.

### Comparison of morphine, ketorolac, and their combination for postoperative pain: results from a large, randomized, double-blind trial [^a17fa963]. Anesthesiology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Meta-analyses report similar numbers needed to treat for nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids. Differences in baseline pain intensity among the studies from which these numbers needed to treat were derived may have confounded the results. NSAIDs have an opioid-sparing effect, but the importance of this effect is unclear. Therefore, the authors sought to compare the proportions of subjects who obtain pain relief with ketorolac versus morphine after surgery and to determine whether the opioid-sparing effect of an NSAID reduces the magnitude of opioid side effects.

Methods

The study was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. The authors randomly assigned 1,003 adult patients to receive 30 mg ketorolac or 0.1 mg/kg morphine intravenously. They calculated the proportion of subjects who achieved at least 50% reduction in pain intensity 30 min after analgesic administration. Further, so long as pain intensity 30 min after analgesic administration was 5 or more out of 10, patients received 2.5 mg morphine every 10 min until pain intensity was 4 or less out of 10. The authors assessed the presence of opioid-related side effects.

Results

Five hundred patients received morphine and 503 received ketorolac. Fifty percent of patients in the morphine group achieved pain relief, compared with 31% in the ketorolac group (difference, 19%; 95% confidence interval, 13–25%). The ketorolac-morphine group required less morphine (difference, 6.5 mg; 95% confidence interval, -5.8 to -7.2) and had a lower incidence of side effects (difference, 11%; 95% confidence interval, 5–16%) than the morphine group.

Conclusions

Opioids are more efficacious analgesics than NSAIDs, although historic data for these two drugs yield similar numbers needed to treat. Adding NSAIDs to the opioid treatment reduces morphine requirements and opioid-related side effects in the early postoperative period.

### Opioid-sparing pain management protocol after shoulder arthroplasty results in less opioid consumption and higher satisfaction: a prospective, randomized controlled trial [^823716e8]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The opioid epidemic has become a central focus in health care. In an effort to reduce opioid use, orthopedic surgeons use multimodal strategies to control postoperative pain. However, no clear consensus exists on ideal pain management strategies after shoulder arthroplasty, and most protocols are opioid-driven. This study sought to determine if patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty using a postoperative opioid-sparing pain-control regimen would have equivalent pain scores and satisfaction as patients using a traditional opioid-based regimen.

Methods

Patients undergoing primary anatomic or reverse total shoulder arthroplasty were prospectively enrolled and randomized into an opioid-sparing (OS) or a traditional opioid-based (OB) postoperative pain protocol. Both groups received opioid education, periarticular injection with liposomal bupivacaine, and preoperative and postoperative multimodal management (acetaminophen, celecoxib, and gabapentin). The OB group was discharged with 40 oxycodone tablets and standard icing, whereas the OS group received ketorolac during admission, continuous cryotherapy, and discharged with 10 oxycodone tablets for rescue. Patients were queried regarding levels of pain and opioid consumption at days 1–7 and at 2, 6, and 12 weeks postoperatively. Patient satisfaction was recorded at 1, 2, 6, and 12 weeks. Range of motion (ROM), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form (ASES), and Single Assessment Numerical Evaluation (SANE) scores were assessed preoperatively and at 12 weeks postoperatively. Complications, readmissions, and reoperations were recorded.

Results

In 78 patients, no difference in VAS pain scores were seen at any time between groups. The OS group consumed less oral morphine equivalents (OME) from inpatient hospitalization to 12 weeks postoperatively (P < .05). Total OME consumption was reduced by 213% for the OS vs. the OB group (112 vs. 239; P < .0001). The OS group consumed fewer opioid pills at all time points (P < .05). A 395% reduction in number of opioid pills consumed in the first 12 weeks postoperatively was seen in the OS vs. the OB group (4.3 vs. 17.0; P < .0001). Significantly more patients in the OS group discontinued opioids by 2 weeks postoperatively (86.1% vs. 58.5%; P = 0.011), and 94.4% in the OS group discontinued opioids by 6 weeks postoperatively. The OS group was more satisfied with pain management at 1 and 6 weeks (P = 0.05). No difference in ROM, ASES or SANE scores, complications, readmissions, or reoperations were seen between groups.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated a nearly 4-fold reduction in opioid pain pill consumption and earlier cessation of opioids with an OS pain management protocol. Patients also reported higher satisfaction with this pain management strategy.

### Perioperative single dose ketorolac to prevent postoperative pain: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^85f5b62c]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Preventive analgesia using non-opioid analgesic strategies is recognized as a pathway to improve postoperative pain control while minimizing opioid-related side effects. Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug frequently used to treat postoperative pain. However, the optimal dose and route of administration for systemic single dose ketorolac to prevent postoperative pain is not well defined. We performed a quantitative systematic review to evaluate the efficacy of a single dose of perioperative ketorolac on postoperative analgesia.

Methods

We followed the PRISMA statement guidelines. A wide search was performed to identify randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effects of a single dose of systemic ketorolac on postoperative pain and opioid consumption. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. Effects of ketorolac dose were evaluated by pooling studies into 30- and 60-mg dosage groups. Asymmetry of funnel plots was examined using Egger regression. The presence of heterogeneity was assessed by subgroup analysis according to the route of systemic administration (IV versus IM) and the time of drug administration (preincision versus postincision).

Results

Thirteen randomized clinical trials with 782 subjects were included. The weighted mean difference (95% confidence interval [CI]) of combined effects showed a difference for ketorolac over placebo for early pain at rest of -0.64 (-1.11 to -0.18) but not at late pain at rest, -0.29 (-0.88 to 0.29) summary point (0–10 scale). Opioid consumption was decreased by the 60-mg dose, with a mean (95% CI) IV morphine equivalent consumption of -1.64 mg (-2.90 to -0.37 mg). The opioid-sparing effects of ketorolac compared with placebo were greater when the drug was administered IM compared with when the drug was administered IV, with a mean difference (95% CI) IV morphine equivalent consumption of -2.13 mg (-4.1 to -0.21 mg). Postoperative nausea and vomiting were reduced by the 60-mg dose, with an odds ratio (95% CI) of 0.49 (0.29–0.81).

Conclusions

Single dose systemic ketorolac is an effective adjunct in multimodal regimens to reduce postoperative pain. Improved postoperative analgesia achieved with ketorolac was also accompanied by a reduction in postoperative nausea and vomiting. The 60-mg dose offers significant benefits but there is a lack of current evidence that the 30-mg dose offers significant benefits on postoperative pain outcomes.

### Ketorolac tromethamine [^c2465329]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS & USAGE

Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of ketorolac tromethamine and other treatment options before deciding to use ketorolac. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).

 Acute Pain in Adult Patients Ketorolac tromethamine is indicated for the short-term (≤ 5 days) management of moderately severe acute pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level, usually in a postoperative setting. Therapy should always be initiated with intravenous or intramuscular dosing of ketorolac tromethamine, and oral ketorolac tromethamine is to be used only as continuation treatment, if necessary.

The total combined duration of use of ketorolac tromethamine injection and oral ketorolac tromethamine is not to exceed 5 days of use because of the potential of increasing the frequency and severity of adverse reactions associated with the recommended doses (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Patients should be switched to alternative analgesics as soon as possible, but ketorolac tromethamine therapy is not to exceed 5 days.

### Effect of ketorolac in intra-articular injection analgesia for postoperative pain in patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy: a pilot-controlled clinical study [^c4b8b22b]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The main analgesic mechanism of NSAIDs is a peripheral rather than central mechanism, and increasing local NSAID concentrations may be beneficial. An intra-articular injection of ketorolac has shown promising pain reduction after arthroscopy.

Arthroscopic therapy usually activates the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme system and prostaglandin synthesis in inflamed synovial tissue. The inflamed tissues usually hinder opioid-mediated analgesia and reduce patient comfort. As an NSAID, ketorolac can effectively inhibit the synthesis process, and alter the local concentration and sensitivity of peripheral nociceptors, and control pain scores. Gupta et al reported on the synergistic analgesic effect of ketorolac and morphine in local intra-articular analgesia. Lashbrook et al established an experimental rat model of neuropathic pain and demonstrated the synergistic antiallodynic effects of opiates combined with ketorolac. They also found that prostanoids were produced via both the COX1 and COX2 pathways. Intra-articular ketorolac reduced the inflammation in synovial tissue after surgical trauma and produced an additive analgesic effect in combination with morphine. Intra-articular ketorolac injection produced better patient comfort, especially when combined with bupivacaine, ropivacaine, and morphine. The current study demonstrated lower VAS scores in the experimental group. Including ketorolac resulted in reduced morphine consumption and a prolonged initial analgesic desired time.

Dosage and volume of intra-articular injections

Different regimes have been used for intra-articular injection at the end of arthroscopic procedures. To date, no conclusive results concerning dosage and volume have been established.

Raja et al reported that 3 mg of morphine in a 20 mL volume produced no obvious analgesic effect in patients following arthroscopic knee surgery. However, Joshi et al found that the administration of 5 mg of morphine in a 45mL volume produced excellent local analgesia. De Andrés et al concluded that the combination of morphine and bupivacaine in a volume of 20 mL was preferable to bupivacaine or morphine alone, although it produced a similar analgesic effect.

Considering the volume of the shoulder and our own experience, we chose a multimodal drug regime in a 20 mL volume.

### PROSPECT guideline for rotator cuff repair surgery: systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^0358d42f]. Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary

Rotator cuff repair can be associated with significant and difficult to treat postoperative pain. We aimed to evaluate the available literature and develop recommendations for optimal pain management after rotator cuff repair. A systematic review using procedure‐specific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) methodology was undertaken. Randomised controlled trials published in English from 1 January 2006 to 15 April 2019 assessing postoperative pain after rotator cuff repair using analgesic, anaesthetic or surgical interventions were identified from, Embase and Cochrane Databases. Out of 322 eligible studies identified, 59 randomised controlled trials and one systematic review met the inclusion criteria. Pre‐operative and intra‐operative interventions that improved postoperative pain were paracetamol, cyclo‐oxygenase‐2 inhibitors, intravenous dexamethasone, regional analgesia techniques including interscalene block or suprascapular nerve block (with or without axillary nerve block) and arthroscopic surgical technique. Limited evidence was found for pre‐operative gabapentin, perineural adjuncts (opioids, glucocorticoids, or α‐2‐adrenoceptor agonists added to the local anaesthetic solution) or postoperative transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Inconsistent evidence was found for subacromial/intra‐articular injection, and for surgical technique‐linked interventions, such as platelet‐rich plasma. No evidence was found for stellate ganglion block, cervical epidural block, specific postoperative rehabilitation protocols or postoperative compressive cryotherapy. The analgesic regimen for rotator cuff repair should include an arthroscopic approach, paracetamol, non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, dexamethasone and a regional analgesic technique (either interscalene block or suprascapular nerve block with or without axillary nerve block), with opioids as rescue analgesics. Further randomised controlled trials are required to confirm the influence of the recommended analgesic regimen on postoperative pain relief.

### Periarticular injection in addition to interscalene nerve block can decrease opioid consumption and pain following total shoulder arthroplasty: a comparison cohort study [^19d2308b]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Interscalene nerve block (INB) is an effective technique to provide postoperative analgesia for total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). However, the analgesic effects of the block typically resolve between 8 and 24 hours postadministration, which results in rebound pain and subsequent increased opioid use. The objective of this study was to address this issue by determining how adding an intraoperative periarticular injection (PAI) in combination with INB affects acute postoperative opioid consumption and pain scores in patients undergoing TSA. We hypothesized that compared with INB alone, INB + PAI will significantly reduce opioid consumption and pain scores for the first 24 hours postsurgery.

Methods

We reviewed 130 consecutive patients who underwent elective primary TSA at a single tertiary institution. The first 65 patients were treated with INB alone, followed by 65 patients treated with INB + PAI. The INB used was 15–20 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine. The PAI used was 50 mL of a combination of ropivacaine (123 mg), epinephrine (0.25 mg), clonidine (40 μg), and ketorolac (15 mg). The PAI was injected using a standardized protocol: 10 mL into the subcutaneous tissues prior to incision, 15 mL into the supraspinatus fossa, 15 mL at the base of the coracoid process, and 10 mL into the deltoid and pectoralis muscles-a protocol analogous with a previously described technique. For all patients, a standardized postoperative oral pain medication protocol was used. The primary outcome was acute postoperative opioid consumption represented by morphine equivalent units (MEUs), whereas the secondary outcome was visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores over the first 24 hours postsurgery, operative time, length of stay, and acute perioperative complications.

Results

No significant differences in demographics existed between patients who received INB alone vs. INB + PAI. Patients who received INB + PAI had a significantly lower 24-hour postoperative opioid consumption compared to the INB alone group (38.6 ± 30.5 MEU vs. 60.5 ± 37.3 MEU, P < .001). Additionally, VAS pain scores for the first 24 hours postsurgery in the INB + PAI group were significantly lower compared to those for the INB alone group (2.9 ± 1.5 vs. 4.3 ± 1.6, P ≤ .001). No differences existed between groups regarding operative time, length of inpatient stay, and acute perioperative complications.

Conclusion

Patients undergoing TSA with INB + PAI demonstrated significantly decreased 24-hour postoperative total opioid consumption and 24-hour postoperative pain scores compared to the group treated with INB alone. No increase in acute perioperative complications related to PAI was observed. Thus, compared to an INB, the addition of an intraoperative periarticular cocktail injection appears to be a safe and effective method to reduce acute postoperative pain following TSA.

### The analgesic benefits of ketorolac to local anesthetic wound infiltration is statistically significant but clinically unimportant: a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis [^f1bcc153]. Advances in Wound Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective: Even though ketorolac-infiltration is said to provide superior postoperative analgesic benefits in different surgical procedures, its safety and efficacy remain to be validated because of the lack of high-quality evidence. We aimed to summarize the efficacy and safety of ketorolac-infiltration based on published randomized-controlled trials (RCTs). Approach: This work followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, assessing the methodological quality of systematic reviews and the Cochrane Collaboration recommendations. We searched for RCTs evaluating the efficacy of ketorolac-infiltration in adults in the PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, Chinese databases, and Google Scholar. The two co-primary outcomes of this meta-analysis were rescue analgesic consumption in the 24-h postoperative period and rest pain scores. Results: Twelve trials (761 patients) were analyzed. Ketorolac-infiltration provided a clinically unimportant benefit in morphine consumption (mean difference, -2.81mg; 95% confidence interval [CI] -5.11 to -0.50; p = 0.02; moderate-quality evidence). Low-to-moderate quality evidence supported a brief (2-6h), clinically subtle, but statistically consistent effect of surgical site ketorolac-infiltration in reducing wound pain at rest. High-quality evidence supported shorter hospital stays for surgical patients receiving local ketorolac-infiltration when compared to controls (mean difference, -0.12 days; 95% CI, -0.17 to -0.08; p < 0.00001). Further, ketorolac-infiltration does not improve any opioid-related side effects. Innovation: Ketorolac-infiltration provides statistically significant but clinically unimportant benefits for improving postoperative wound pain. Conclusion: Overall, despite the fact that current moderate-to-high quality of evidence does not support routine using of ketorolac as an adjuvant to local anesthetic for wound infiltration, these findings underscore the importance of optimizing agents and sustained delivery parameters in postoperative local anesthetic practice.

### SABER-bupivacaine reduces postoperative pain and opioid consumption after arthroscopic subacromial decompression: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^f91e6862]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Shoulder arthroscopy is a widely performed orthopaedic procedure, with an estimated volume of 1.4 million cases worldwide in 2016. Arthroscopic subacromial decompression (ASD), either as an isolated procedure or combined with rotator cuff repair, accounted for more than 600,000 cases in the United States in 2017, according to several large outpatient and inpatient databases. Despite tremendous growth in the popularity of this procedure and accompanying advancements in analgesic techniques, many patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy continue to experience substantial postsurgical pain. Undertreated postoperative pain can reduce patient satisfaction, prolong recovery time, increase immobility leading to clinical complications, and elevate the risk of developing chronic pain.

Systemic opioid analgesics, still a mainstay of postoperative pain treatment, are associated with well-documented adverse effects that can delay mobilization and complicate postoperative care. Recently, concerns have also been raised about the contribution of postoperative opioid prescriptions to rising rates of opioid dependence and abuse. Multimodal approaches to pain management take advantage of the synergistic effect of combining different analgesic agents and administration techniques to improve the treatment of postoperative pain while also reducing the consumption of opioid analgesics and lessening their attendant risks. The role of local anesthetics in these strategies is promising but has so far been limited by their relatively short durations of action compared with the typical time course of postsurgical pain.

### Ketorolac does not increase perioperative bleeding: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^64f484e5]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative pain control is essential for optimal patient outcomes. Ketorolac is an attractive alternative for achieving pain control postoperatively, but concerns over postoperative bleeding have limited its use.

Methods

Computer searches of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were performed. Twenty-seven double-blind, randomized, controlled studies were reviewed by two independent investigators for the incidence of adverse events, including postoperative bleeding. Comprehensive meta-analysis software was used to evaluate the differences between ketorolac and control groups.

Results

Twenty-seven studies with 2314 patients were analyzed. Postoperative bleeding occurred in 33 of 1304 patients (2.5 percent) in the ketorolac group compared with 21 of 1010 (2.1 percent) in the control group (OR, 1.1; 95 percent CI, 0.61 to 2.06; p = 0.72). Adverse events were similar in the groups, 31.7 percent in the control group and 27.9 percent in the ketorolac group (OR, 0.64; 95 percent CI, 0.41 to 1.01; p = 0.06). There was a lower incidence of adverse effects with low-dose ketorolac (OR, 0.49; 95 percent CI, 0.27 to 0.91; p = 0.02). Pain control with ketorolac was superior to controls and equivalent to opioids.

Conclusions

This is the first meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials examining whether there is increased postoperative bleeding with ketorolac. Postoperative bleeding was not significantly increased with ketorolac compared with controls, and adverse effects were not statistically different between the groups. Pain control was found to be superior with ketorolac compared with controls. Ketorolac should be considered for postoperative pain control, especially to limit the use of opioid pain medications.

### Effect of ketorolac in intra-articular injection analgesia for postoperative pain in patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy: a pilot-controlled clinical study [^79652490]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Multimodal analgesic regime

All patients were administered a preemptive oral analgesic regimen of imrecoxib (100 mg, Jiang Su Hengrui Medicine Co. Ltd, Lianyungang, China; 200 mg, peros) within 1 hour preoperatively. When the surgery was finished and after the cleaning solution was removed, intra-articular injection (20 mL) was administered through the incision.

The control group received a 20 mL intra-articular injection of the multimodal drug regime (450 mg of ropivacaine with 5 mg of morphine and 25 mg of triamcinolone acetonide).

The experimental group received a 20 mL intra-articular injection of the multimodal drug treatment containing ketorolac (450 mg of ropivacaine with 5 mg of morphine, 25 mg of triamcinolone acetonide, and 10 mg of ketorolac).

Imrecoxib (100 mg PO twice daily) was administered as a primary analgesic treatment, which was started 12 hours postoperatively until discharge. Morphine was used when analgesia was desired, and narcotic consumption was recorded. Ondansetron was used to treat post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV).

Study clinical parameters

The follow-up duration was defined as the time between the injection of the drug into the joint and the recording time. The initial analgesic desired time was defined as the time between the injection of the drug into the joint and the first analgesic administration time. Postoperative side-effects and complications (such as nausea and vomiting) were also recorded.

Baseline demographics

The following baseline demographics were evaluated: age, sex, BMI (kg/m 2), ASA, side of surgery, preoperative VAS score, and duration of surgery (minutes).

Pain

The postoperative pain relief level was evaluated using morphine consumption, initial analgesic desired time, and the VAS. VAS scores were recorded postoperatively at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours. The VAS scores at movement were recorded at 24 and 48 hours postoperatively. The enrolled patients were trained to mark their pain level on a 10-cm VAS.

### PROSPECT guideline for rotator cuff repair surgery: systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^4c91dab6]. Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

From a range of surgical interventions, an arthroscopic approach is recommended as it reduces postoperative pain. However, there is limited evidence to recommend hyperosmotic vs. isotonic irrigation during arthroscopy. Single‐row anchor fixation as compared with transosseous hardware‐free suture repair has limited procedure‐specific evidence and this approach is, therefore, not recommended. Additionally, there is inconsistent procedure‐specific evidence to support the use of platelet‐rich plasma supplementation in the rotator cuff repair setting.

The limitations of this review are related to those of the included studies. There was considerable heterogeneity between studies such as variable dosing regimens, methods of administration and control groups as well as inconsistency in the time‐points of pain assessments. Many of the included studies suffered from small sample sizes and might not have been adequate to draw valid conclusions from concerning the safety profile of analgesic interventions. In addition, many of the analgesic interventions were not evaluated against a control group that included an optimised multimodal analgesic regimen such as paracetamol and NSAIDs. Future adequately powered studies should assess the effects of analgesic interventions not only on time to ambulation and length of hospital stay but also other patient‐related outcome measures such as chronic pain and long‐term opioid consumption.

In summary, this review has identified the analgesic regimen for optimal pain management after rotator cuff repair (Table 1). We have also identified analgesic interventions that are not recommended for pain management in patients undergoing rotator cuff repair surgery (Table 2). Peri‐operative pain management after rotator cuff repair should include unless contraindicated, paracetamol and NSAIDs administered pre‐operatively or intra‐operatively that should be continued into the postoperative period. Intravenous dexamethasone is recommended for its ability to increase the analgesic duration of interscalene block, decrease analgesic use and its antiemetic effects. Interscalene brachial plexus blockade is recommended as the first‐choice regional analgesic technique. Suprascapular nerve block with or without axillary nerve block may be administered as an alternative to interscalene block. Opioids should be reserved for rescue postoperative analgesia. Whenever possible, rotator cuff repair should be performed using an arthroscopic approach, as it is associated with reduced postoperative pain.

### PROSPECT guideline for rotator cuff repair surgery: systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^931a3034]. Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

In a placebo‐controlled study, Lee et al. 36 investigated the effects of adding an axillary nerve block to a suprascapular nerve block. As compared with saline, when ropivacaine 0.75% was used for performing the axillary nerve block, pain scores were lower at 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 18 h and 24 h after surgery. Opioid consumption was not reported. Park et al. 37 assessed combined axillary nerve block and suprascapular nerve block vs. suprascapular nerve block only vs. no block and found lower pain scores for the treatment groups vs. no block at 1 h, 6 h, 12 h and 36 h after surgery. Lower pain scores were also identified up to 48 h after surgery for the combined group vs. suprascapular nerve block‐only group. Desroches et al. 38 found that, compared with suprascapular nerve block, interscalene block provided lower pain scores and opioid consumption at 2 h after surgery. Lee et al. 39 added a suprascapular nerve block to an interscalene block in a placebo‐controlled study and identified lower pain scores for the group that received the suprascapular nerve block at 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 18 h and 24 h after surgery. Opioid consumption was not reported. Lee et al. 40 found that, compared with placebo, arthroscopic suprascapular nerve block reduced the i.v. fentanyl PCA consumption. Pain scores were not significantly different.

### Evidence-based answer… [^921d7710]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question In emergency department settings, is parenteral ketorolac superior to morphine for achieving timely pain reduction in patients with acute long bone fractures. Evidence-Based Answer Parenteral ketorolac is as effective as parenteral morphine for short-term pain relief in patients with long bone fractures, and it results in fewer adverse effects. Ketorolac is slightly more effective than morphine for pain relief during limb motion. The primary outcome of pain reduction was assessed by a zero- to 10-point visual analog scale, with a score of 10 indicating maximal pain. Pain was assessed at baseline, then every five minutes for the first 30 minutes, every 30 minutes for the next 90 minutes, then once more six hours after the initial injection.

Compared with ketorolac, morphine administration nonsignificantly increased the likelihood of pain reduction when the injured limb was at rest. However, ketorolac administration increased the likelihood of pain reduction when the limb was moved. At rest, the median decrease in pain score per hour did not differ significantly between the groups. However, with activity, the median decrease favored ketorolac. Patients who received morphine were more likely to have adverse effects, such as drowsiness, dizziness, and nausea. Limitations of the study included the small sample size and data collection at only one facility. The primary outcome was timely pain reduction as measured by VAS. Pain scores were recorded by the patient and assessed by an emergency medicine resident just before ketorolac or morphine administration, then at five, 30, and 60 minutes after the initial injection.

Patients were given a loading dose of ketorolac or morphine on presentation, followed by additional doses every five to 20 minutes if the VAS score was 4 or higher.

### PROSPECT guideline for rotator cuff repair surgery: systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^5305097f]. Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

In an effort to prolong the duration of a single‐shot interscalene block, several analgesic adjuncts are administered perineurally combined with a local anaesthetic. There is limited procedure‐specific evidence regarding perineural benefits of buprenorphine, tramadol or magnesium sulphate. Procedure‐specific evidence is lacking for perineural clonidine. Limited procedure‐specific evidence was also identified for perineural glucocorticoids (betamethasone and dexamethasone). Nevertheless, we recommend using i.v. dexamethasone over perineural administration.

Several studies investigated subacromial injection or infusion in the rotator cuff repair setting. However, the data concerning analgesia are inconsistent and therefore hinder recommendation. Only a few studies found beneficial effects for both pain scores and opioid consumption, whereas some demonstrated reductions in pain scores with no effect on postoperative opioid consumption. Most studies found insignificant differences in both pain scores and opioid consumption. In addition, the technique and timing of the subacromial injections or infusions were heterogeneous – some blocks were performed intra‐operatively whereas others were performed at the end of surgery. Stellate ganglion block or cervical epidural block cannot be recommended in the rotator cuff repair setting due to a lack of procedure‐specific evidence and increased risk of complications. Various postoperative interventions studied lack procedure‐specific evidence (early vs. delayed motion protocols, compressive cryotherapy, use of specific shoulder immobilisation device) or have limited procedure‐specific evidence (TENS, zolpidem as a sleep aid) and are, therefore, not recommended.

### Ketorolac in the era of cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: a systematic review of efficacy, side effects, and regulatory issues [^cf108d74]. Pain Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The recent introduction of oral COX-2 selective NSAIDs with potential for perioperative use, and the ongoing development of intravenous formulations, stimulated a systemic review of efficacy, side effects, and regulatory issues related to ketorolac for management of postoperative analgesia.

Design

To examine the opioid dose sparing effect of ketorolac, we compiled published, randomized controlled trials of ketorolac versus placebo, with opioids given for breakthrough pain, published in English-language journals from 1986–2001. Odds ratios were computed to assess whether the use of ketorolac reduced the incidence of opioid side effects or improved the quality of analgesia.

Results

Depending on the type of surgery, ketorolac reduced opioid dose by a mean of 36% (range 0% to 73%). Seventy percent of patients in control groups experienced moderate-severe pain 1 hour postoperatively, while 36% of the control patients had moderate to severe pain 24 hours postoperatively. Analgesia was improved in patients receiving ketorolac in combination with opioids. However, we did not find a concomitant reduction in opioid side effects (e.g., nausea, vomiting). This may be due to studies having inadequate (to small) sample sizes to detect differences in the incidence of opioid related side effects. The risk for adverse events with ketorolac increases with high doses, with prolonged therapy (> 5 days), or invulnerable patients (e.g. the elderly). The incidence of serious adverse events has declined since dosage guidelines were revised.

Conclusions

Ketorolac should be administered at the lowest dose necessary. Analgesics that provide effective analgesia with minimal adverse effects are needed.

### PROSPECT guideline for rotator cuff repair surgery: systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^73bdea63]. Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Regional analgesic interventions

Choi et al. 14 evaluated the efficacy of stellate ganglion block vs. no block in the rotator cuff repair setting. Neither postoperative pain scores nor opioid consumption was significantly different between the groups.

Liu et al. 15 compared analgesia provided by a single‐shot interscalene brachial plexus block with placebo and found that pain scores were lower at 1 h, 6 h and 12 h after surgery in the block group, and postoperative opioid use was lower at 6 h after surgery. Wong et al. 16 assessed the analgesic effects of two different concentrations of ropivacaine (0.2% vs. 0.1%) for single‐shot interscalene block and found that, although pain scores were similar, postoperative opioid consumption was reduced for the first 72 h after surgery by ropivacaine 0.2%. In a study with a similar design, Lee et al. 17 compared different volumes of ropivacaine 0.75% (5 mL vs. 10 ml) for a single‐shot interscalene block and did not find any differences either for pain scores or for opioid consumption.

### PROSPECT guideline for rotator cuff repair surgery: systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^9015fb6a]. Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Based on available evidence and the PROSPECT approach to providing recommendations, combinations of paracetamol and an NSAID or a cyclo‐oxygenase‐2 (COX‐2)‐specific inhibitor are recommended pre‐operatively or intra‐operatively, and should be continued into the postoperative period, unless there are contra‐indications. The analgesic benefits and opioid‐sparing effects of these simple analgesics are well described 6, 70, 71. Although there is limited procedure‐specific evidence, i.v. dexamethasone is recommended for its ability to increase the analgesic duration of interscalene block and decrease supplemental analgesia use, as well as for its antiemetic effects. Limited procedure‐specific evidence was found for pre‐operative gabapentin, which was not demonstrated to have opioid‐sparing effects in this setting. Further evidence is, therefore, needed to support peri‐operative use of gabapentin for rotator cuff repair. Intra‐operative controlled hypotension is not recommended as there is insufficient procedure‐specific evidence regarding its analgesic benefits. Moreover, there is a concern that hypotension may increase the risk of a reduction in cerebral perfusion and oxygenation 72, 73.

The use of a regional analgesic technique as a component of multimodal analgesia is recommended. A continuous interscalene block is favoured over a single‐shot interscalene block. A systematic review with meta‐analysis of RCTs assessing analgesic effects of single‐shot interscalene block in patients undergoing shoulder surgery including rotator cuff repair found that interscalene block was more effective compared with placebo or systemic analgesia 74. However, the duration of analgesia was short (6 h and 8 h with motion and at rest, respectively) and there was rebound pain at 24 h. Therefore, it is imperative that patients receive paracetamol and NSAID or a COX‐2‐specific inhibitor regularly to avoid a significant increase in pain after the regional block has resolved. If an interscalene block is not possible, an axillary nerve block with or without suprascapular nerve block is favoured over no block or over a suprascapular nerve block alone. Additionally, a suprascapular nerve block reduces pain scores and/or opioid use after surgery but does not seem to have analgesic advantages over interscalene block.

### Editorial commentary: multiple factors, including multimodal anesthesia, can reduce opioid requirements after rotator cuff repair [^f0f4c67a]. Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Rotator cuff repair often results in significant pain and discomfort early after surgery, whereas longer-term outcomes generally result in substantial improvement. Efforts to decrease pain levels and opioid use after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair have led to the expansion of multimodal analgesia techniques. An interscalene brachial plexus block (ISBPB)-"plus" technique adds a subacromial space injection and "blind" (i.e., without imaging) suprascapular and axillary nerve blocks. Recent research has shown that the ISBPB-plus technique results in less opioid consumption at 48 hours compared with an isolated ISBPB and that both techniques show similar patient satisfaction and postoperative pain scores. Although the optimal multimodal strategy has yet to be determined for specific surgical treatments, decreased opioid consumption is a high priority. Multiple patient factors also require consideration, including severity of pathology, management of depression, preoperative patient education, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Moreover, surgical technique modifications, cryotherapy, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation may provide pain-reduction benefits.

### Local infiltration analgesia versus interscalene block for pain management following shoulder arthroplasty: a prospective randomized clinical trial [^b31a1b56]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

While providing effective analgesia following shoulder arthroplasty, an interscalene block has known complications. Local infiltration analgesia (LIA) using ropivacaine has been successfully employed in other joint arthroplasties, but its efficacy in shoulder arthroplasty has not been studied extensively. The purpose of this study was to compare pain and opioid consumption between LIA and an interscalene block following shoulder arthroplasty.

Methods

Patients undergoing primary shoulder arthroplasty were prospectively randomized into 2 groups: the block group received an interscalene block using liposomal bupivacaine, and the injection group received an LIA injection intraoperatively. The LIA injection included ropivacaine, epinephrine, ketorolac, and normal saline solution. Postoperative visual analog scale pain scores, opioid consumption in morphine milligram equivalents, and complications were compared between the groups. The mean pain scores during the first 24 hours postoperatively were used to test noninferiority of LIA compared with an interscalene block.

Results

The study included 74 patients (52 men and 22 women with a mean age of 69 years; 37 were in the injection group and 37 in the block group). There was no significant difference between the groups with respect to pain scores at any postoperative time points (p > 0.05), except for the 8-hour time point, when the injection group had a significantly higher pain score than the block group (p = 0.01). There was no significant difference in opioid consumption between the groups at any time points postoperatively (p > 0.05). The amount of intraoperative opioid consumption was significantly higher in the injection group (p < 0.001). In noninferiority testing for the mean pain scores during the first 24 hours, the injection group was found to be noninferior to the block group. One patient in the block group developed transient phrenic nerve palsy. One patient in the injection group developed dislocation after reverse arthroplasty related to noncompliance. The mean procedure hospital charge was $1,718 for an interscalene block and $157 for LIA.

Conclusions

LIA and an interscalene block provided similar analgesia during the first 24 hours after primary shoulder arthroplasty. LIA was associated with worse pain at 8 hours postoperatively and more intraoperative opioid consumption but was also substantially less costly.

### Ketorolac tromethamine (Ketorolac) [^66ae854a]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of ketorolac
tromethamine and other treatment options before deciding to use ketorolac
tromethamine. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent
with individual patient treatment goals.

Ketorolac tromethamine tablets are indicated for the short-term
(≤ 5 days) management of moderately severe acute pain that requires analgesia at
the opioid level, usually in a postoperative setting. Therapy should always be
initiated with ketorolac tromethamine-IV or IM and ketorolac tromethamine
tablets are to be used only as continuation treatment, if necessary.

The total combined duration of use of ketorolac tromethamine-IV/IM and
ketorolac tromethamine tablets is not to exceed 5 days of use because of the
potential of increasing the frequency and severity of adverse reactions
associated with the recommended doses (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, DOSAGE AND
ADMINISTRATION and ADVERSE
REACTIONS). Patients should be switched to alternative analgesics as soon as
possible, but ketorolac tromethamine tablet therapy is not to exceed 5 days.

### Intraarticular morphine and bupivacaine reduces postoperative pain after rotator cuff repair [^9d7cd9e4]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

To determine whether intraarticular injection of morphine, fentanyl, or sufentanil added to bupivacaine provided pain control after open rotator cuff repair.

Methods

These data were collected as a prospective, randomized, blinded observer study. All patients received a standard interscalene anesthetic with 1.4% mepivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine. At the conclusion of surgery, they received an intraarticular injection after the shoulder capsule was closed. Patients were randomized into 4 groups. All received 20 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine: group 1, plain; group 2, with 1 mg of morphine added; group 3, with 50 microg of fentanyl added; and group 4, with 10 microg of sufentanil added. Pain scores in the postanesthesia care unit were evaluated at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 240 minutes and at 4-hour intervals postoperatively using a visual analogue scale. Breakthrough pain was managed with morphine, via patient controlled analgesia pump.

Results

Thirty-nine patients were entered into the study. Pain scores at 2 hours and beyond were lowest in group 2. Total morphine utilization was significantly lower for the first 24 hours in group 2.

Conclusions

Intraarticular injection of the shoulder with 0.25% bupivacaine and 1 mg morphine at the conclusion of surgery provided pain control and diminished morphine used in the first 24 hours after open rotator cuff repair. Fentanyl and sufentanil did not improve the analgesia over that achieved with bupivacaine alone.

### Does pure platelet-rich plasma affect postoperative clinical outcomes after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair? A randomized controlled trial [^7eb9d576]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The exact role of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in rotator cuff tendon reconstruction remains unclear.

Purpose/Hypothesis

This study investigated whether an intraoperative pure PRP injection, compared with a local anesthetic injection, improves patient-reported outcomes at 3 and 6 months after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. The hypothesis was that pure PRP improves patient-reported outcomes (Oxford Shoulder Score [OSS]) at 3 and 6 months after surgery and has the same pain-reducing effect compared with a postoperative subacromial local anesthetic (ropivacaine) injection.

Study Design

Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods

Between January 2011 and November 2012, a total of 120 patients who underwent arthroscopic double-row repair of a supraspinatus tendon rupture were randomized to receive either pure PRP by an injection at the footprint (PRP group; n = 60) or ropivacaine injected in the subacromial region (control group; n = 60). Seventy-eight percent of patients had other concomitant tears. All patients, surgeons, and follow-up investigators were blinded. Clinical parameters and various outcome scores (Constant-Murley shoulder score; OSS; patient American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score; quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score; EuroQol 5 dimensions) were documented preoperatively and at 3, 6, and 24 months postoperatively. The repair integrity was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound at 24 months. Furthermore, a pain diary was completed within the first 10 postoperative days, and adverse events were recorded. Group outcome differences were analyzed using t tests, Fisher exact tests, and mixed models.

Results

The final follow-up rate was 91%. An associated tear of the subscapularis tendon was diagnosed in 23% of PRP-treated patients and 36% of control patients. Three months after surgery, the mean (± SD) OSS was 32.9 ± 8.6 in PRP-treated patients and 30.7 ± 10.0 in control patients (P = 0.221). No significant differences were noted for other outcome parameters as well as at 6 and 24 months postoperatively. Smoking was a significant effect modifier. Pain for both groups decreased from postoperative day 1 to 10 without any significant group difference (P = 0.864). Six (12.2%) and 11 (20.8%) patients were diagnosed with a recurrent supraspinatus tendon defect in the PRP and control groups, respectively (P = 0.295). Twenty-two (40.7%) and 18 (30.5%) PRP-treated and control patients, respectively, experienced a local adverse event within 24 months (P = 0.325).

Conclusion

Patients treated with pure PRP showed no significantly improved function at 3, 6, and 24 months after arthroscopic repair compared with control patients receiving ropivacaine; however, a similar pain reduction was documented in both groups. The negative influence of smoking on the effect of pure PRP requires further investigation.

### Intravenous meloxicam versus ketorolac for pain control following total joint arthroplasty: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^68273ed1]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Although joint arthroplasty surgery is considered safe and effective in reducing osteoarthritis-related pain long-term, the surgery is known to be painful in the immediate postoperative period. Therefore, optimal pain management has become a crucial goal for orthopaedic surgeons. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used but can cause adverse effects due to their mechanism of action. Meloxicam, however, has a unique mechanism of action, allowing it to better spare the gut lining, translating to reduced complications. This double-blind randomized controlled trial sought to compare intravenous (IV) meloxicam and IV ketorolac for total joint arthroplasty regarding pain scores, opioid consumption, and lengths of stay.

Methods

All other institutional protocols and medications remained unchanged. A total of 223 patients were randomized. The meloxicam group received 30 mg IV meloxicam preoperatively two hours before primary incision, while the ketorolac group received 15 mg IV ketorolac intraoperatively followed by 15 mg IV every six hours, scheduled for two doses. Pain, opioid consumption, and nausea were recorded at two and 24 hours postoperatively. An a priori power analysis demonstrated a need for 170 total patients. The study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05291598) and received Institutional Review Board approval.

Results

The IV meloxicam group had increased total opioid consumption 24 hours postoperatively and longer lengths of stay compared to the IV ketorolac group; however, there were no differences in pain scores or nausea.

Conclusion

The use of IV meloxicam as part of a perioperative pain management protocol led to increased opioid consumption, longer lengths of stay, and a lower rate of same-day discharges compared to IV ketorolac.

Postoperative interventions

Mazzocca et al. compared early (POD 2–3) vs. delayed (POD 28) motion rehabilitation protocols after rotator cuff repair and did not find any difference in pain scores 7–10 days postoperatively 57. Opioid consumption was not recorded. Hollman et al. assessed an abduction brace vs. an antirotation sling as a way to immobilise the shoulder after surgery 58. Neither pain scores nor opioid use after surgery were different between the techniques. Mahure et al. performed a placebo‐controlled study investigating postoperative transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and found lower pain scores at 12 h and on POD 7 59. Opioid consumption after surgery also favoured TENS. Kraeutler et al. compared compressive cryotherapy vs. standard ice wrap and found neither pain scores nor opioid use after surgery was significantly different 60. Cho et al. compared the addition of zolpidem as a sleep aid to multi‐modal analgesia with multimodal analgesia only 61. Pain scores after surgery were not significantly different; the zolpidem group had lower rescue analgesic requirements.

### A double-blind prospective comparison of rofecoxib vs ketorolac in reducing postoperative pain after arthroscopic knee surgery [^f3e661c1]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2005). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the analgesic efficacy of premedication with rofecoxib vs intravenous (IV) ketorolac in reducing postoperative pain after arthroscopic knee surgery.

Study Design

This is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study.

Setting

This study was set at a university hospital.

Subjects

The subjects include 54 patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical statuses I, II, and III undergoing knee arthroscopy.

Interventions

Group 1 received 50 mg oral rofecoxib preoperatively with IV placebo injection, which was administered 20 minutes before the end of the operation. Group 2 received a preoperative placebo and 30 mg IV ketorolac 20 minutes before the end of surgery.

Measurements

The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients reporting pain in the postoperative anesthesia care unit, 6 hours and 24 hours after discharge. Additional end points included the use of 5:325 mg oxycodone-acetaminophen (O/A) tablets, pain scores, patient's satisfaction survey, and comparison of side effects. Data were analyzed using independent samples t tests for continuous variables or chi2 tests for categorical variables. P < .05 was considered significant.

Results

The 2 groups were comparable with regard to patient characteristics, intraoperative medication use, and duration of surgery. There was no difference either in pain scores or O/A use in the postoperative anesthesia care unit. At 24 hours after discharge, significantly more patients in the ketorolac group (91%) reported pain than the rofecoxib group (63%) (P = 0.02). Sixty-one percent of patients in the ketorolac group used O/A during the first 24 hours vs 38% in the rofecoxib group. The difference, however, was not statistically significant.

Conclusion

Preoperative rofecoxib is as effective as ketorolac for the treatment of pain after knee arthroscopy. Higher frequency of pain reporting at 24 hours by patients in ketorolac group is explained by the longer analgesic effect of rofecoxib. Future studies should directly compare gastrointestinal injury of these drugs, as well as cost-effectiveness of rofecoxib vs ketorolac.

### Do relaxation exercises decrease pain after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair? A randomized controlled trial [^507205c2]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pain after rotator cuff repair is commonly managed with opioid medications; however, these medications are associated with serious adverse effects. Relaxation exercises represent a potential nonpharmacologic method of pain management that can be easily implemented without substantial adverse effects; however, the effects of relaxation exercises have not been studied in a practical, reproducible protocol after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Does performing relaxation exercises after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) decrease pain compared with standard pain management medication? (2) Does performing relaxation exercises after ARCR decrease opioid consumption? (3) What proportion of patients who used the relaxation techniques believed they decreased their pain level, and what proportion continued using these techniques at 2 weeks? (4) Does performing relaxation exercises after ARCR affect shoulder function?

Methods

During the study period, 563 patients were eligible for inclusion; however, only 146 were enrolled, randomized, and postoperatively followed (relaxation group: 74, control group: 72); 68% (384 of 563) of patients were not contacted due to patient and research staff availability. Thirty-three patients were unenrolled preoperatively or immediately postoperatively due to change in operative procedure (such as, only debridement) or patient request; no postoperative data were collected from these patients. Follow-up proportions were similar between the relaxation and control groups (relaxation: 80%, control: 81%; p = 0.90). The relaxation group received and reviewed educational materials consisting of a 5-minute video and an educational pamphlet explaining relaxation breathing techniques, while the control group did not receive relaxation education materials. Patients recorded their pain levels and opioid consumption during the 5 days after ARCR. Patients also completed the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons shoulder score preoperatively and 2, 6, 13, 18, and 26 weeks postoperatively. Linear mixed models were created to analyze postoperative pain, opioid consumption measured in morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs), and shoulder function outcomes. A per-protocol approach was used to correct for patients who were enrolled but subsequently underwent other procedures.

Results

There was no difference in pain scores between the relaxation and control groups during the first 5 days postoperatively. There was no difference in pain scores at 2 weeks postoperatively between the relaxation and control groups (3.3 ± 3 versus 3.5 ± 2, mean difference -0.22 [95% CI -1.06 to 0.62]; p = 0.60). There was no difference in opioid consumption during the first 5 days postoperatively between the relaxation and control groups. The use of relaxation exercises resulted in lower 2-week narcotics consumption in the relaxation group than in the control group (309 ± 241 MMEs versus 442 ± 307 MMEs, mean difference -133 [95% CI -225 to -42]; p < 0.01). Sixty-two percent (41 of 66) of patients in the relaxation group believed the relaxation exercises decreased their pain levels. Fifty-two percent (34 of 66) were still performing the exercises at 2 weeks postoperatively. During the 6-month follow-up period, there was no difference in shoulder function between the relaxation and control groups.

Conclusion

The preoperative administration of quick, basic relaxation exercises allowed patients to use appreciably lower opioid analgesic doses over the first 2 weeks after ARCR, without any worsening of pain scores. We consider this result promising but preliminary; it is possible that a more intense mindfulness intervention-the one we studied here was disseminated using only a 5-minute video-would deliver reductions in pain and further reductions in opioid usage.

### PROSPECT guideline for rotator cuff repair surgery: systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^2fdcdda0]. Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Watanabe et al. 18 found that, compared with placebo, betamethasone 4 mg added perineurally to ropivacaine 0.375% reduced pain scores at 12 h after surgery and on POD 1 and 7, and also reduced opioid consumption. Desmet et al. compared perineural placebo, perineural dexamethasone 10 mg and i.v. dexamethasone 10 mg in patients receiving single‐shot interscalene block with ropivacaine 0.5%. Both dexamethasone groups had lower pain scores compared with perineural placebo as well as lower paracetamol and diclofenac use for the first 48 h after surgery 19 (p = 0.03). There were no differences in pain scores or opioid consumption between perineural and i.v. dexamethasone.

Behr et al. 20 compared placebo, perineural buprenorphine 150 μg and i.m. buprenorphine 150 μg. Compared with placebo, both perineural and i.m. buprenorphine increased the duration of analgesia and reduced opioid consumption. Perineural buprenorphine provided a longer duration of analgesia compared with i.m. buprenorphine. With a similar study design, Allemano et al. 21 compared placebo, perineural tramadol 1.5 mg.kg −1 and i.m. tramadol 1.5 mg.kg −1. Perineural and i.m. tramadol increased the duration of analgesia when compared with placebo. Also, perineural tramadol was more effective in increasing the duration of analgesia when compared with i.m. tramadol. In a placebo‐controlled study, Faria‐Silva et al. 22 reported that perineural clonidine 150 μg did not influence pain scores or opioid consumption. Lee et al. 23 found that 2 mL of perineural magnesium sulphate 10% added to interscalene block reduced the pain scores at 12 h postoperatively compared with placebo, but did not reduce opioid consumption.

### Do selective COX-2 inhibitors affect pain control and healing after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair? A preliminary study [^560fd8d6]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors are commonly used analgesics that provide similar analgesia as that of other analgesics but with fewer adverse effects. However, few prospective studies have performed comparative analyses in this regard.

Purpose

To evaluate the efficacy of a selective COX-2 inhibitor in early postoperative pain control, satisfaction with pain management, and incidence of systemic adverse effects in patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

Study Design

Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods

This study included 180 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair between September 2011 and August 2012. The patients were randomly assigned to receive celecoxib, ibuprofen, or tramadol (n = 60 each). Visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain intensity and satisfaction with medication, incidence of adverse effects, and use of rescue medication were recorded and compared between the 3 groups at 3 days and 2 weeks after surgery. Magnetic resonance and ultrasonography images of 82 patients were retrospectively reviewed at least 24 months after surgery, along with the range of motion and pain VAS and functional scores.

Results

There were no significant differences among the 3 groups in terms of pain intensity, incidence of adverse effects, or dosage of rescue medication at 3 days or 2 weeks after surgery. Pain VAS and functional scores at the final follow-up were also comparable among the 3 groups. However, the retear rate in the celecoxib group (11/30 [37%]) was significantly higher than those in the ibuprofen (2/27 [7%]) and tramadol (1/25 [4%]) groups (P = 0.009).

Conclusion

Despite having similar postoperative analgesic effects as other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids, selective COX-2 inhibitors should not be used for postoperative analgesia because they might negatively affect tendon-to-bone healing after surgical repair. Registration: NCT02850211 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier).

### Editorial commentary: steroid injections prior to arthroscopic rotator cuff repair-is It time to rethink a conservative treatment paradigm? [^61948b21]. Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

The standard of care for most rotator cuff conditions over the past half century or longer has been a trial of nonoperative treatment including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, physiotherapy, and steroid injections prior to surgery. There is compelling basic science data to suggest a negative effect of corticosteroids on tissue quality. Chronicity of the tear is a risk factor for unsuccessful repair, but other factors including use of tobacco products, repair technique, and postoperative management all have an impact. Evidence either in favor of or against use of steroid injections as a treatment option is limited or weak at best. Given advances in rotator cuff repair techniques and successful long-term outcomes, treating surgeons should be mindful of how injections might affect surgical outcomes owing to either delayed surgical intervention or a direct effect on tissue quality.

### Ketorolac tromethamine (Acunivive 60) [^eb8d9bf7]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

KETOROLAC TROMETHAMINE INJECTION

Ketorolac tromethamine injection may be used as a single or multiple dose on a regular or "prn" schedule for the management of moderately severe, acute pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level, usually in a postoperative setting. Hypovolemia should be corrected prior to the administration of ketorolac tromethamine (see WARNINGS, Renal Effects). Patients should be switched to alternative analgesics as soon as possible, but ketorolac tromethamine therapy is not to exceed 5 days.

When administering ketorolac tromethamine injection, the IV bolus must be given over no less than 15 seconds. The IM administration should be given slowly and deeply into the muscle. The analgesic effect begins in ~30 minutes with maximum effect in 1 to 2 hours after dosing IV or IM. Duration of analgesic effect is usually 4 to 6 hours.

Single-Dose Treatment: The following regimen should be limited to single administration use only

IM Dosing

Patients < 65 years of age: One dose of 60 mg.
Patients ≥ 65 years of age, renally impaired and/or less than 50 kg (110 lbs) of body weight: One dose of 30 mg.

IV Dosing

Patients < 65 years of age: One dose of 30 mg.
Patients ≥ 65 years of age, renally impaired and/or less than 50 kg (110 lbs) of body weight: One dose of 15 mg.

Multiple-Dose Treatment (IV or IM)

Patients < 65 years of age: The recommended dose is 30 mg ketorolac tromethamine injection every 6 hours. The maximum daily dose for these populations should not exceed 120 mg.
For patients ≥ 65 years of age, renally impaired patients (see WARNINGS), and patients less than 50 kg (110 lbs): The recommended dose is 15 mg ketorolac tromethamine injection every 6 hours. The maximum daily dose for these populations should not exceed 60 mg.

For breakthrough pain, do not increase the dose or the frequency of ketorolac tromethamine. Consideration should be given to supplementing these regimens with low doses of opioids "prn" unless otherwise contraindicated.

### Can gabapentin help reduce postoperative pain in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair? A prospective, randomized, double-blind study [^47343aeb]. Arthroscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of the study was to determine the effect of low-dose gabapentin on postoperative pain management in patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

Methods

This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study included 46 patients. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the drug administered 2 hours before surgery, either 300 mg of gabapentin or placebo. The primary outcome measure was the visual analog scale (VAS) score at 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively. The secondary outcome measures were fentanyl consumption and side effects during the first 2 hours in the postanesthesia care unit and then at 6 and 24 hours postoperatively. The patients were evaluated for side effects including nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, dizziness, drowsiness, voiding difficulty, and pruritus.

Results

The VAS scores at 2, 6, and 12 hours postoperatively were significantly lower in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group (P = 0.023, P = 0.019, and P = 0.022, respectively). The consumption of fentanyl, over a period of 24 hours, was not different in the comparisons between the groups (P = 0.686). The incidence of side effects was similar in the 2 groups.

Conclusions

A single dose of 300 mg of gabapentin reduced the VAS score during the first 24 hours postoperatively in patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, without significant side effects when compared with placebo. However, the fentanyl consumption did not differ between the gabapentin and placebo groups.

### The effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications after rotator cuff surgery: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^df819df2]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently used for postoperative pain management. However, animal studies have demonstrated negative effects of NSAIDs on bone and tendon healing after commonly performed procedures such as rotator cuff repair. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of postoperative NSAID use on opioid use, pain control, and shoulder outcomes after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

Methods

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of postoperative NSAID use was performed in patients undergoing primary arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery at a single institution. Patients were randomized to receive ibuprofen or placebo for 2 weeks postoperatively, in addition to opioid medication. They were instructed to keep a daily pain diary for the first week after surgery, which was returned at their first postoperative visit for analysis. Visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores, shoulder range of motion, and 12-item Short Form Survey, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand, and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scores were collected. Assessment of rotator cuff healing was performed using ultrasound at 1 year postoperatively.

Results

A total of 50 patients in the placebo group and 51 patients in the ibuprofen group were included for analysis. There were no differences in age, race, sex, history of preoperative NSAID or opioid use, or operative findings between groups. The amount of mean total morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) used in the first postoperative week was lower in the ibuprofen group than in the placebo group (168 MMEs vs. 211 MMEs, P = 0.04). Early VAS scores on postoperative days 3, 4, 5, and 6 were lower in the ibuprofen group, but there was no difference in mean VAS scores between groups by 6 weeks after surgery. At 6 months, mean forward flexion and the mean ASES score were higher in the ibuprofen group than in the placebo group: 162° vs. 153° (P = 0.03) and 86 vs. 78 (P = 0.02), respectively. There were no differences in shoulder motion or 12-item Short Form Survey, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand, or ASES scores at 1 year. At 1 year after surgery, 7 patients in the ibuprofen group had evidence of tendon retear diagnosed on ultrasound (5 partial and 2 full thickness) compared with 13 patients in the placebo group (5 partial and 8 full thickness), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.20).

Conclusion

Postoperative ibuprofen use reduces opioid requirements and decreases patient pain levels in the first week after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. In addition, ibuprofen use after rotator cuff repair does not lead to an increased risk of tendon retear.

### Postoperative pain control after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair [^1c0a9c52]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) can provide excellent clinical results for patients who fail to respond to conservative management of symptomatic rotator cuff tears. ARCR, however, can be associated with severe postoperative pain and discomfort that requires adequate analgesia. As ARCR continues to shift toward being performed as an outpatient procedure, it is incumbent on physicians and ambulatory surgical centers to provide appropriate pain relief with minimal side effects to ensure rapid recovery and safe discharge. Although intravenous and oral opioids are the cornerstone of pain management after orthopedic procedures, they are associated with drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and increased length of hospital stay. As health care reimbursements continue to become more intimately focused on quality, patient satisfaction, and minimizing of complications, the need for adequate pain control with minimal complications will continue to be a principal focus for providers and institutions alike. We present a review of alternative modalities for pain relief after ARCR, including cryotherapy, intralesional anesthesia, nerve blockade, indwelling continuous nerve block catheters, and multimodal anesthesia. In choosing among these modalities, physicians should consider patient- and system-based factors to allow the efficient delivery of analgesia that optimizes recovery and improves patient satisfaction.

Study 3

Study 3 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (vehicle) and open-label PK clinical trial in 92 patients undergoing a variety of shoulder surgical procedures, including rotator cuff repair, subacromial decompression, glenoid labrum repair or debridement, and biceps tendon repair. The majority of patients underwent arthroscopic procedures; however, six patients underwent a combination of arthroscopic and open procedures. The mean age was 54 years (range 20 to 82 years), 59% of treated patients were male, 87% were White, 8% were African American, 3% were Other, and 2% were Asian.

An equal number of patients were randomized to two cohorts. The routes of POSIMIR or vehicle placebo administration in Cohort 1 were subacromial or subcutaneous injection or a combination. In Cohort 2, POSIMIR or vehicle placebo was administered via injection under direct arthroscopic visualization into the subacromial space. Surgical procedures were completed either under local or general anesthesia. Post-operatively, patients were allowed morphine IV, oxycodone orally, or acetaminophen orally as needed.

The primary outcome measures were mean pain intensity on movement and at rest through 120 hours and pain control through day seven. There was no statistically significant difference in either primary endpoint between POSIMIR and vehicle placebo treatment groups (Figure 3).

### Liposomal bupivacaine reduces opiate consumption after rotator cuff repair in a randomized controlled trial [^8aa07f27]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) provides excellent clinical outcomes but is often associated with significant postoperative pain. The use of intraoperative anesthesia in conjunction with multimodal pharmacologic strategies is a widely accepted approach for managing surgical pain and reducing opiate use. The purpose of this study was to determine whether using a combined field and suprascapular nerve block with liposomal bupivacaine (LB) in addition to an interscalene block would provide greater pain relief and a reduction in opiate consumption compared with an interscalene block alone.

Methods

The study enrolled 50 patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears undergoing primary ARCR surgery. Patients were randomized to receive intraoperative LB (n = 25) or not (n = 25) and given postoperative "pain journals" to document visual analog scale pain scores and to track their daily opioid consumption during the first 5 postoperative days.

Results

Patients in the LB group reported statistically and clinically lower pain scores during postoperative days 1 and 2 (P < .0001 and P = 0.03, respectively). In addition, patients in the LB group consumed significantly fewer narcotics than the control group during the 5-day period, demonstrating a 64% reduction in total narcotic consumption (P = 0.002).

Conclusion

The findings of this study suggest that the addition of LB to multimodal anesthetic protocols significantly reduces the acute perioperative pain experienced following rotator cuff repair and the number of narcotic pills consumed in the first 5 days after ARCR. Furthermore, the findings provide guidelines for postoperative narcotic prescribing to reduce the quantity of opiates prescribed.

### Perioperative pain management for shoulder surgery: evolving techniques [^136d838d]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Improving management of postoperative pain following shoulder surgery is vital for optimizing patient outcomes, length of stay, and decreasing addiction to narcotic medications. Multimodal analgesia (ie, controlling pain via multiple different analgesic methods with differing mechanisms) is an ever-evolving approach to enhancing pain control perioperatively after shoulder surgery. With a variety of options for the shoulder surgeon to turn to, this article succinctly reviews the pros and cons of each approach and proposes a potential pain management algorithm.

### A comprehensive enhanced recovery pathway for rotator cuff surgery reduces pain, opioid use, and side effects [^6b06dee4]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients often have moderate to severe pain after rotator cuff surgery, despite receiving analgesics and nerve blocks. There are many suggested ways to improve pain after rotator cuff surgery, but the effects of adopting a pathway that includes formal patient education, a long-acting nerve block, and extensive multimodal analgesia are unclear.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Does adoption of a clinical pathway incorporating patient education, a long-acting nerve block, and preemptive multimodal analgesia reduce the worst pain during the first 48 hours after surgery compared with current standard institutional practices? (2) Does adoption of the pathway reduce opioid use? (3) Does adoption of the pathway reduce side effects and improve patient-oriented outcomes?

Methods

From September 2018 to January 2020, 281 patients scheduled for arthroscopic ambulatory rotator cuff surgery were identified for this paired sequential prospective cohort study. Among patients in the control group, 177 were identified, 33% (58) were not eligible, for 11% (20) staff was not available, 56% (99) were approached, 16% (29) declined, 40% (70) enrolled, and 40% (70) were analyzed (2% [4] lost to follow-up for secondary outcomes after postoperative day 2). For patients in the pathway cohort, 104 were identified, 17% (18) were not eligible, for 11% (11) staff was not available, 72% (75) were approached, 5% (5) declined, 67% (70) enrolled, and 67% (70) were analyzed (3% [3] lost to follow-up for secondary outcomes after postoperative day 2). No patients were lost to follow-up for primary outcome; for secondary outcomes, four were lost in the control group and three in the pathway group after postoperative day 2 (p = 0.70). The initial 70 patients enrolled received routine care (control group), and in a subsequent cohort, 70 patients received care guided by a pathway (pathway group). Of the 205 eligible patients, 68% (140) were included in the analysis. This was not a study comparing two tightly defined protocols but rather a study to determine whether adoption of a pathway would alter patient outcomes. For this reason, we used a pragmatic (real-world) study design that did not specify how control patients would be treated, and it did not require that all pathway patients receive all components of the pathway. We developed the pathway in coordination with a group of surgeons and anesthesiologists who agreed to apply the pathway as much as was viewed practical for each individual patient. Patients in both groups received a brachial plexus nerve block with sedation. Major differences between the pathway and control groups were: detailed patient education regarding reasonable pain expectations with a goal of reducing opioid use (no formal educational presentation was given to the control), a long-acting nerve block using bupivacaine with dexamethasone (control patients often received shorter-acting local anesthetic without perineural dexamethasone), and preemptive multimodal analgesia including intraoperative ketamine, postoperative acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and gabapentin at bedtime, with opioids as needed (control patients received postoperative opioids but most did not get postoperative NSAIDS and no controls received gabapentin or separate prescriptions for acetaminophen). The primary outcome was the numerical rating scale (NRS) worst pain with movement 0 to 48 hours after block placement. The NRS pain score ranges from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain possible). The minimum clinically important difference (MCID) [12] for NRS that was used for calculation of the study sample size was 1.3 [18], although some authors suggest 1 [13] or 2 [5] are appropriate; if we had used an MCID of 2, the sample size would have been smaller. Secondary outcomes included NRS pain scores at rest, daily opioid use (postoperative day 1, 2, 7, 14), block duration, patient-oriented pain questions (postoperative day 1, 2, 7, 14), and patient and physician adherence to pathway.

Results

On postoperative day 1, pathway patients had lower worst pain with movement (3.3 ± 3.1) compared with control patients (5.6 ± 3.0, mean difference -2.7 [95% CI -3.7 to -1.7]; p < 0.001); lower scores were also seen for pain at rest (1.9 ± 2.3 versus 4.0 ± 2.9, mean difference -2.0 [95% CI -2.8 to -1.3]; p < 0.001). Cumulative postoperative opioid use (0–48 hours) was reduced (pathway oral morphine equivalent use was 23 ± 28 mg versus 44 ± 35 mg, mean difference 21 [95% CI 10 to 32]; p < 0.01). The greatest difference in opioid use was in the first 24 hours after surgery (pathway 7 ± 12 mg versus control 21 ± 21 mg, mean difference -14 [95% CI -19 to -10]; p < 0.01). On postoperative day 1, pathway patients had less interference with staying asleep compared with control patients (0.5 ± 1.6 versus 2.6 ± 3.3, mean difference -2.2 [95% CI -3.3 to -1.1]; p < 0.001); lower scores were also seen for interference with activities (0.9 ± 2.3 versus 1.9 ± 2.9, mean difference -1.1 [95% CI -2 to -0.1]; p = 0.03). Satisfaction with pain treatment on postoperative day 1 was higher among pathway patients compared with control patients (9.2 ± 1.7 versus 8.2 ± 2.5, mean difference 1.0 [95% CI 0.3 to 1.8]; p < 0.001). On postoperative day 2, pathway patients had lower nausea scores compared with control patients (0.3 ± 1.1 versus 1 ± 2.1, mean difference -0.7 [95% CI -1.2 to -0.1]; p = 0.02); lower scores were also seen for drowsiness on postoperative day 1 (1.7 ± 2.7 versus 2.6 ± 2.6, mean difference -0.9 [95% CI - 1.7 to -0.1]; p = 0.03).

Conclusion

Adoption of the pathway was associated with improvement in the primary outcome (pain with movement) that exceeded the MCID. Patients in the pathway group had improved patient-oriented outcomes and fewer side effects. This pathway uses multiple analgesic drugs, which may pose risks to elderly patients, in particular. Therefore, in evaluating whether to use this pathway, clinicians should weigh the effect sizes against the potential risks that may emerge with large scale use, consider the difficulties involved in adapting a pathway to local practice so that pathway will persist, and recognize that this study only enrolled patients among surgeons and the anesthesiologists that advocated for the pathway; results may have been different with less enthusiastic clinicians. This pathway, based on a long-lasting nerve block, multimodal analgesia, and patient education can be considered for adoption.

### Oral ketorolac as an adjuvant agent for postoperative pain control after arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a prospective, randomized controlled study [^d35eaa21]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Successful outpatient anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction hinges on effective analgesia. Routinely, oral narcotic agents have been the preferred analgesic postoperatively in orthopaedic surgery. However, these agents have several known adverse effects and are associated with a potential for abuse. This study evaluates the efficacy of ketorolac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with analgesic properties, as an adjuvant agent for postoperative pain control after ACL reconstruction.

Methods

Adult patients undergoing primary ACL reconstruction were prospectively enrolled. Exclusion criteria involved patients with a history of bleeding diathesis, renal dysfunction, chronic analgesia use, or alcohol abuse. Eligible patients were randomized into one of two groups. The control group received a standard-of-care pain protocol involving oxycodone-acetaminophen 5 to 325 on discharge. The ketorolac group additionally received intravenous ketorolac postoperatively and 3 days of oral ketorolac on discharge. Pain levels and total narcotic utilization were recorded three times per day for the first 5 days after surgery. Pain and functional outcomes were obtained at 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively.

Results

The final analysis included 48 patients; the mean age of the cohort was 32 ± 11.6 years, and 60.4% of patients were female. No differences were observed in preoperative demographics, comorbidities, and preoperative functional scores between the two groups. Over the first 5 days after surgery, patients in the ketorolac group consumed a mean of 45.4% fewer narcotic pills than the control group (P < 0.001). In addition, mean postoperative pain scores were 22.36 points lower for patients in the ketorolac group (P < 0.001). There was no difference in functional outcome scores at up to 6 weeks postoperatively or adverse events between the two groups with no reported cases of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Discussion

The use of adjunctive intravenous and short-term oral ketorolac substantially reduces narcotic utilization and pain levels after ACL reconstruction.

### Editorial commentary: multimodal, opioid-free pain management after rotator cuff repair may Be safe and effective, and decreases the risk of drug abuse [^b6de3603]. Arthroscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

In 2020, approximately 94,000 people died in the United States due to drug overdose, a grim 78% increase since release of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) information statement on opioid abuse nearly 5 years ago. Annual opioid-related mortality rates now far surpass those stemming from either car crashes or gun violence. Multiple risk factors exist for opioid misuse and abuse, including a major risk factor under the orthopaedic surgeon's control-exposure to opioid medication. Prescription protocols that decrease a patient's access to narcotic medication could lead to a decrease in overall opioid abuse, while also avoiding second-order effects, such as drug diversion. Multimodal, nonopioid pain protocols often employ peripheral nerve blocks, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication (NSAIDs), gabapentinoids, and antispasmodic muscle relaxants, and this has yielded promising results after arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery. As good stewards of the musculoskeletal community, we should proactively employ evidence-based practices for establishing realistic postoperative patient expectations, common analgesic care pathways, and standardized pill counts stratified by procedure type.

### Postoperative opioid sparing with injectable hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin-diclofenac: pooled analysis of data from two phase III clinical trials [^9c3018e0]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Study design and outcomes

The included studies were identified based on their similar design, patient populations, duration of treatment, and endpoints. Both studies were Phase III trials with a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, multiple-dose, placebo- and active comparator-controlled design. In both studies, patients were randomized to receive HPβCD-diclofenac (Dyloject ™; Hospira, Inc. a Pfizer company, Lake Forest, IL, USA), ketorolac, or placebo, according to a computer-generated random number code. Investigators, clinical staff, and patients were blinded to treatment group assignment. Dose levels of individual study treatments in the orthopedic surgery study were not blinded, however. Patients in the abdominal/pelvic surgery study received 18.75 or 37.5 mg HPβCD-diclofenac (based on randomization), 30 mg ketorolac, or placebo. Patients in the orthopedic surgery study received either 18.75, 37.5, or 50 mg HPβCD-diclofenac, based on the presence of defined risk factors. The standard dose was 37.5 mg; however, patients weighing < 50 kg, aged ≥ 65 years, or with NSAID-related gastrointestinal risk factors, hepatic impairment, or renal insufficiency (based on serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen measures being greater than the upper limit of normal) received the 18.75 mg dose, and patients ≥ 95 kg with no predefined risk factors received 50 mg. Dose adjustment of ketorolac in the orthopedic surgery study was similar. Patients < 65 years old and without renal insufficiency received a standard dose of 30 mg, while high-risk patients received 15 mg.

Study medication was given as an IV bolus injection, with the first dose given ≤ 6 hours following surgery to patients reporting moderate to severe pain on the VAS. The time of first study drug administration was taken as time 0, and subsequent doses were given every 6 hours until discharge or withdrawal/discontinuation. In the abdominal/pelvic surgery population, patients were observed for at least 48 hours following the first study drug dose, and for up to 5 days; in the orthopedic surgery population, patients were observed for at least 24 hours, and for up to 5 days. Safety was monitored throughout both studies by physical examinations, laboratory testing, vital signs, ECG, AEs, and evaluation of thrombophlebitis and wound healing (safety data previously reported).

### Liposomal bupivacaine infiltration in the surgical site for analgesia after rotator cuff repair: a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial [^827a65af]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is among the most painful of orthopedic surgeries. Liposomal bupivacaine is Food and Drug Administration approved for administration into surgical sites to provide postsurgical analgesia and has been used to address postoperative pain after many types of surgery, including total shoulder arthroplasty. However, its efficacy for pain control after rotator cuff repair is unclear.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we compared liposomal bupivacaine with an equivalent volume of saline injected into the subacromial space and arthroscopy portal sites in patients undergoing rotator cuff repair under the interscalene block with sedation. The primary outcome measure was numeric rating pain score at the time of block resolution, as reported during the follow-up phone call on postoperative day 1. Secondary outcomes included mean pain scores at rest as well as oral morphine equivalent requirements on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3. This study provides Level 1 evidence.

Results

There were no statistically significant differences in the primary outcome of numeric rating pain scores on resolution of the interscalene nerve block, nor in those reported on postoperative day 1 or 2. There was a minor but statistically significant difference in mean resting pain scores on day 3, though opioid consumption and patient satisfaction score did not differ between groups. In those instructed to perform passive range-of-motion exercises, there was no difference in reported mean pain scores among the groups.

Discussion

In this study of patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, we found no statistically significant difference in mean pain scores on interscalene block resolution, a result consistent with a number of studies investigating liposomal bupivacaine for total shoulder arthroplasty. A modest reduction in pain was evident only on day 3, and there was no impact on perioperative opioid requirements, opioid-related side effects, or pain with motion. Liposomal bupivacaine, when injected into the subacromial space and the tissues around the arthroscopy port sites, provided minimal improvement in pain control in this patient population.

### Administration of analgesics after rotator cuff repair: a prospective clinical trial comparing glenohumeral, subacromial, and a combination of glenohumeral and subacromial injections [^68a601ab]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Local analgesic injections are commonly used for pain relief after shoulder surgery. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of local injections administered in the glenohumeral joint, the subacromial space, or both locations after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

Methods

Between March 2011 and December 2011, 121 consecutive patients who had undergone arthroscopic rotator cuff repair surgery were enrolled in the study and all patients were randomly allocated to 3 groups. In group 1, 40 patients received a postoperative glenohumeral injection of bupivacaine (20 mL) and lidocaine (10 mL). In group 2, 42 patients received the same postoperative injection, but it was administered in the subacromial space. In group 3, 39 patients received the same amount of local anesthesia but with half injected in the glenohumeral joint and half in the subacromial space. The visual analog scale was used to assess pain intensity before surgery and at postoperative hours 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24. Demerol was used as a postinjection rescue analgesic, and the total number of administrations was recorded at each time point.

Results

There were no significant differences between groups in patient age, sex, or rotator cuff tear size (P > .05). The visual analog scale scores for pain between each group were not significantly different at any time point, including before surgery (P > .05). In addition, the amount of supplementary analgesic administered was not significantly different between the groups (P > .05).

Conclusion

Injection of local analgesics after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair relieves postoperative pain regardless of the injection location.

### Postoperative opioid sparing with injectable hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin-diclofenac: pooled analysis of data from two phase III clinical trials [^06775101]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The goal of postoperative analgesia is to optimally manage pain while minimizing the potential for adverse effects that can delay recovery or present risks to the patient. While opioids are efficacious analgesics, AEs associated with this drug class can be wide ranging and represent an important concern for clinicians and patients. Furthermore, opioid-related AEs in postsurgical patients are associated with increased hospital length of stay and added costs which recent studies have estimated to range from $4,707 to $13,737 per patient. Thus, multimodal pain management approaches that make use of analgesics with different mechanisms of action, such as the NSAIDs, are recommended.

The results of this analysis of data from two Phase III trials reveal that repeated-dose HPβCD-diclofenac was associated with a significant opioid-sparing effect when given for up to 5 days for moderate to severe pain following abdominal/pelvic or orthopedic surgery. In addition, HPβCD-diclofenac (37.5 mg dose groups and all dose groups combined) demonstrated significant opioid-sparing effects in comparison to the active comparator ketorolac, a drug currently used in clinical practice, with respect to both cumulative rescue opioid dose and the number of doses. There were no discernible differences in baseline pain level (moderate, severe) between comparator groups, suggesting that the observed differences are not likely due to differences in baseline pain. Notably, opioid consumption appeared to be lowest in the HPβCD-diclofenac 37.5 mg group. While potential reasons for this were not investigated, it is noteworthy that 37.5 mg is the standard HPβCD-diclofenac dose and was given to patients without defined risk factors, while the 50 mg dose was given to patients weighing ≥ 95 kg. The results of this analysis expand upon previously reported data from the individual studies, which showed that HPβCD-diclofenac was associated with increased time to rescue opioid administration and reduced opioid consumption over 72 hours versus placebo in abdominal/pelvic surgery patients, as well as increased time to rescue opioid administration and reduced opioid consumption over 120 hours versus placebo in orthopedic surgery patients.

### An opioid-sparing pain protocol of intravenous and oral ketorolac reduces opioid consumption and pain levels after arthroscopic meniscus surgery: a prospective, randomized controlled trial [^eace76c7]. Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To compare ketorolac to oxycodone-acetaminophen with respect to pain and opioid consumption after arthroscopic meniscus surgery. The secondary purpose was to compare short-term functional outcomes between the 2 protocols.

Methods

A power analysis demonstrated that 43 patients were required. In this randomized control trial, patients with meniscal pathology undergoing arthroscopic meniscus surgery were included. Group 1 received oxycodone-acetaminophen alone. Group 2 received 1 dose of intravenous ketorolac intraoperatively, oral ketorolac upon discharge, and "rescue" oxycodone-acetaminophen. Patients recorded the number of opioid tablets consumed and visual analog pain scale (VAS) scores 3 times per day for 5 days postoperatively. Opioids were converted to morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs). VAS, Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale, and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score were obtained.

Results

Forty-eight patients were randomized. There were 25 patients in the control group and 23 patients in the ketorolac group. The mean (SD) age was 47.9 (14.3) years. Fifty-two percent (n = 25) of the population were female. Three patients (6.3%) underwent meniscal repair. During the first 5 days postoperatively, the mean VAS score (β = -13.2, SE = 5.97, P = 0.029) and the MMEs consumed were significantly lower (β = -4.7, SE = 1.93, P = 0.015) per time point in the ketorolac group relative to the control group. The control group had better Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale (mean [SD] 80.6 [18.5] vs 65 [21.5], P = 0.016) and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (mean [SD], 74.1 [16.7] vs 61.9 [18.6], P = 0.029) scores at 6 weeks. There were no significant differences in the rates of side effects.

Conclusions

An opioid-sparing pain protocol of intravenous and oral ketorolac is associated with significant reductions in VAS scores and MME consumption in the first 5 days after arthroscopic meniscus surgery. There were significant differences in patient-reported outcomes at final follow-up, favoring the control group. There were no significant differences in adverse reactions and side effects.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors Do not affect healing after rotator cuff repair: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8d0432cb]. Arthroscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine whether non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors affect healing rate, functional outcomes, and patient satisfaction after rotator cuff repair.

Methods

Medline, EMBASE, PsychINFO and the Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the use of NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Primary outcomes included healing and retear rate, determined by radiological imaging. Secondary outcomes included shoulder-specific outcome measures and the visual analog scale (VAS). Risk of bias was graded using the Cochrane risk-of-bias v2.0 tool. The GRADE framework was used to assess certainty of findings.

Results

Seven RCTs with a total of 507 patients were included (298 randomized to NSAID/COX-2 vs 209 randomized to control). NSAIDs use did not yield a difference in retear rate (P = 0.77). NSAIDs were shown to significantly reduce pain in the perioperative period (P = 0.01); however, no significant difference was present at a minimum of 6 months (P = 0.11). COX-2 inhibitors did not significantly reduce pain (P = 0.15). Quantitative analysis of ASES and UCLA scores showed NSAIDs significantly improved functional outcomes versus control (P = 0.004). COX-2 inhibitors did not significantly improve functional outcomes (P = 0.15). Two trials were deemed "low" risk of bias, four trials were graded to have "some concerns", and one trial was graded to have "high" risk of bias. Retear rate and functional PROMs were deemed to have "low" certainty. VAS pain scale was graded to have "moderate" certainty.

Conclusions

This systematic review and meta-analysis indicates that NSAIDs do not affect healing rate after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, but they do significantly improve postoperative pain and functional outcomes. No significant difference was seen in pain or functional outcomes with the use of COX-2 inhibitors.

Subjects were observed in an inpatient setting for 7 days after surgery. All subjects received oral paracetamol as background treatment for the first 72 hours at the maximum recommended dosage of 4 g/d for body weight ≥ 66 kg and 2 g/d for body weight < 66 kg. For breakthrough pain, subjects could request rescue medication, which consisted of oral morphine 10 mg at a 1-hour interval or, if unable to tolerate oral intake, intravenous (IV) morphine 2 mg at 5-minute intervals. After 72 hours, subjects were allowed paracetamol and oral morphine on an as-needed basis. Subjects recorded pain intensity (PI) on movement (flexion of the shoulder to 90°) and the use of paracetamol and opioid rescue medication in an electronic diary. PI was rated on an 11-point numerical scale that ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable) and was assessed at scheduled intervals after surgery. On day 0 (day of surgery), PI scores were collected at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours postoperatively, and on days 1 to 7, they were assessed at 08:00, 12:00, 16:00, and 20:00.

The coprimary efficacy end points were the mean PI on movement from 1 to 72 hours after surgery (time-normalized area under the curve [nAUC 1–72]) and cumulative consumption of opioid rescue medication (IV morphine mg equivalents) from 0 to 72 hours after surgery, both compared with placebo. The time to first use of opioid rescue medication was a secondary end point. Other end points included PI at rest, opioid-related symptom distress scale scores, eligibility for discharge based on the postanesthesia discharge scoring system, satisfaction with pain treatment on day 4, and proportion of subjects returning to work by day 14.

Safety assessments consisted of spontaneously reported and solicited adverse events (AEs), which were rated for severity, causality, and outcome; surgical wound-healing assessments; electrocardiography; clinical laboratory evaluations; vital signs; and physical examination. Only treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), defined as AEs with onset after the administration of the study drug, were included in the safety analysis. Shoulder MRI and the Constant-Murley functionality assessmentwere conducted at baseline and at the 6-month follow-up. MRIs were centrally read by a blinded musculoskeletal radiologist after all subjects had completed the 6-month follow-up visit.

### Periarticular liposomal bupivacaine mixture injection vs. single-shot interscalene block for postoperative pain in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^caef404d]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The pain control efficacy, postoperative opioid requirements, and costs among patients undergoing major shoulder surgery using different perioperative analgesia modalities have been topics of active debate. Several studies have compared periarticular injection (PAI) to interscalene block (ISB) in shoulder arthroplasty, but there is a paucity of data comparing them in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

Methods

Patients aged 18–80 years with full-thickness rotator cuff tears and undergoing primary arthroscopic rotator cuff repair at 2 different shoulder centers were screened and subsequently randomized to receive either periarticular injection (PAI) of liposomal bupivacaine mixed with 0.25% bupivacaine (n = 41) or single-shot interscalene nerve block (ISB) (n = 36). Visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores, oral morphine equivalent (OME) use, Single Assessment Numerical Evaluation (SANE) scores, and costs were collected. Differences with P < .05 were considered statistically significant.

Results

Day of surgery VAS score and OME usage were significantly reduced with ISB vs. PAI (0.69 vs. 4.65, P < .001, and 18.66 vs. 34.39, P < .001, respectively). There were no significant differences between groups regarding VAS score on postoperative days (PODs) 1–3; however, OME usage on PODs 1 (50.5 vs. 38.8, P = 0.03) and 2 (48.1 vs. 37.8, P = 0.04) was significantly more in the ISB group. At POD 3, VAS score (4.13 vs. 3.97, P = 0.60) and OME use (28.60 vs. 31.16, P = 0.51) were similar. At 6 and 12 weeks, there were also no significant differences between groups regarding VAS and OME use. There was no difference in SANE score at 12 weeks following surgery between groups and no difference between average 12-week cumulative OME use between groups. The average charge for the PAI was $455, and the average charge for ISB was $745.

Conclusion

Both ISB and PAI provide acceptable pain control following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Patients have less pain on the day of surgery with ISB, but rebound pain is significant after the block wears off, resulting in substantially increased opioid use in the first 2 PODs. However, cumulative opioid use between groups was similar. There were also no significant differences at the end of the 12-week episode of care in any of the other variables studied. The charge per patient for PAI is approximately $300 less than ISB. Thus, PAI may offer surgeons and patients an effective postoperative analgesic modality as an alternative to ISB.

### Brachial plexus block with liposomal bupivacaine for shoulder surgery improves analgesia and reduces opioid consumption: results from a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial [^10830127]. Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Effective postsurgical pain relief facilitates rehabilitation after shoulder surgery and is associated with reduced postoperative adhesions, capsule retractions, and intraarticular deposits of fibrous tissue that contribute to shoulder stiffness, a common complication of shoulder repair. Opioid analgesics are routinely prescribed after orthopedic surgery, and orthopedic patients have some of the highest opioid prescription rates in the United States. Upper arm and shoulder surgeries are associated with the highest opioid consumption among upper-extremity procedures. Opioid-related adverse effects are associated with longer hospital stays, higher readmission rates, and increased cost. Moreover, reports indicate that approximately 6% of patients continue to use opioids long term after elective procedures.

To optimize analgesia after shoulder surgery, current practice favors multimodal approaches, including regional anesthesia using interscalene brachial plexus block (BPB). However, the effectiveness of single-injection BPB is limited by the short analgesia duration of traditional immediate-acting local anesthetics, breakthrough pain, and continued need for postoperative opioids. When combined with immediate-acting local anesthetics, adjuvants such as dexamethasone can prolong BPB by a mean of six to eight hours, resulting in a mean analgesia duration ranging from approximately three to 31 hours across studies. Continuous BPB with infusion pumps and interscalene catheters offers more prolonged analgesia but is time and resource intensive, delivers high total doses of local anesthetics, is associated with risk of complications such as device failure and infection, and is subject to user error. A 5% displacement rate has been reported for interscalene catheters within six hours postinsertion, and risk of displacement increases with duration of use. Thus, clinical need remains for longer-acting, simple-to-administer local anesthetics that can provide prolonged analgesia after major surgeries such as total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) and rotator cuff repair (RCR).

Standard General Anesthesia, Surgical Procedure, and Postoperative Care

None of the subjects took preemptive analgesics before surgery. After establishing intravenous access and applying standard monitors (electrocardiogram, noninvasive blood pressure cuff, continuous oxygen saturation), the participants were sedated with intravenous midazolam (1–2 mg). The lateral neck and supraclavicular fossa on the same side as the surgical site were cleansed with an isopropyl alcohol/chlorhexidine gluconate solution. An ultrasound-guided low-volume ISB (0.5% ropivacaine, 10 mL) was performed under sterile conditions by a staff regional anesthesiologist or a supervised regional anesthesia fellow using a 13–6 MHz 38 mm linear probe (MTurbo ®; SonoSite Inc. Bothell, WA, USA) at the C5 and C6 nerve root level via a posterior approach and a 22-gauge insulated 50 mm regional needle. Once the needle tip was correctly positioned and aspiration was negative, the local anesthetic was injected. General anesthesia was induced using a standardized technique with sufentanil 0.2μg/kg and propofol 1–3mg/kg. Tracheal intubation was facilitated with 0.6mg/kg rocuronium. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane at an end-tidal concentration of 1.4–2 vol%. During surgery, 5μg aliquots of sufentanil were administered when blood pressure or heart rate increased more than 20% from preoperative baseline values. Standard antiemetic prophylaxis with 4 mg ondansetron was intravenously administered before emergence.

All patients who underwent ARCR were performed by one of the three senior orthopedic surgeons (I, II, III). Standard posterior and anterior portals were created to inspect the glenohumeral joint. A lateral portal was established for acromioplasty, bursectomy, and rotator cuff repair. The average surgery duration for all patients was 55.4 ± 11.6 minutes. One or two suture anchors was applied during surgery. Single-row or double-row rotator cuff repair technique was utilized for all patients. Postoperatively, participants received 1 g oral paracetamol, 50 mg intravenous flurbiprofen axetil every 8 hours, and 100 mg intravenous tramadol every 12 hours. The nurses checked all the postoperative medications had been applied and followed by all patients. The patients were hospitalized for all the medications. The medications were administrated for 24 hours after surgery for all patients.

### Is It safe to inject corticosteroids into the glenohumeral joint after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair? [^9d3a011d]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Injection of intra-articular corticosteroids is effective for improving the recovery of range of motion (ROM) and pain in various conditions of the shoulder but its use is limited after rotator cuff repair owing to concern over the possible harmful effects of steroids on the repaired tendon.

Purpose

To evaluate the effect of intra-articular corticosteroid injections on the clinical outcomes and cuff integrity of patients after rotator cuff repair.

Study Design

Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods

Between March 2011 and April 2014, 80 patients with a small- to medium-sized rotator cuff tear were enrolled in this study and underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Forty patients received an injection of triamcinolone (40 mg) and lidocaine (1.5 mL) into the glenohumeral joint 8 weeks after surgery (group 1), while the remaining 40 patients received normal saline injection (group 2). Outcome measures-including ROM, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, Constant score, pain visual analog scale, and Simple Shoulder Test score-were evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery and at the last follow-up. The integrity of the repaired tendon was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and classified per Sugaya classification at 8 weeks (before injection) and 12 months after surgery.

Results

The mean follow-up period was 25.7 months. At 3 months postoperatively, patients in group 1 had a significantly higher ROM with respect to forward flexion (P = 0.05), external rotation at the side (P = 0.05), and external rotation at abduction (P = 0.04) as compared with group 2, whereas no significant difference was noted between the groups for internal rotation behind the back (P = 0.65). Patients in group 1 had significantly lower visual analog scale pain scores (P = 0.02) and higher ASES scores (group 1, 68.90; group 2, 60.28; P = 0.02) at 3-month follow-up. However, there was no significant difference after 6 months with respect to ROM and ASES scores (group 1, 77.80; group 2, 75.88; P = 0.33). Retears (Sugaya classification IV and V) were determined by MRI at 12 months and observed in a total of 7 patients (8.8%): 3 from group 1 (7.5%) and 4 from group 2 (10%). No retears were observed on MRI in the remaining 73 patients (91.2%): 37 patients from group 1 and 36 patients from group 2. There was no statistically significant difference in rate of retears between groups (P = 0.69).

Conclusion

Intra-articular injection of corticosteroids after rotator cuff repair does not increase the risk of retears and is thus an effective and safe treatment method for increasing ROM (forward flexion, external rotation) and improving clinical score (ASES) during the early postoperative period of patients undergoing rotator cuff repair.

Introduction

Shoulder arthroscopy is one of the most commonly performed orthopedic procedures today, offering a minimally invasive approach to treating various shoulder pathologies. However, despite its minimally invasive nature, severe postoperative shoulder pain remains a major concern, necessitating effective pain management strategies to optimize patient recovery. Adequate pain control is a key component of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols, as it improves patient comfort, accelerates rehabilitation, and reduces hospital stays. Uncontrolled postoperative pain can delay physical therapy, prolong the duration of hospital stays, and negatively affect functional outcomes.

Regional anesthesia plays a crucial role in multimodal analgesia, as it provides superior pain relief with minimal opioid consumption, thereby reducing opioid-related side effects, such as nausea, respiratory depression, and delayed mobilization. Of the available regional anesthesia techniques, interscalene block (ISC) has been widely used for shoulder arthroscopy and is considered the gold standard because of its prolonged analgesic effect lasting up to 24 h. ISC block can also serve as the primary anesthetic for arthroscopic shoulder surgery, eliminating the need for general anesthesia in some cases. However, the ISC block is not without drawbacks. One major concern is phrenic nerve involvement, which occurs in nearly 100% of cases and can lead to hemidiaphragmatic paresis, making it unsuitable for patients with compromised respiratory function. Additionally, ISC block results in motor blockade of the upper extremity, preventing early postoperative rehabilitation, which is a key goal of rotator cuff surgery recovery.

Owing to these limitations, interest in alternative regional techniques that offer adequate analgesia while preserving motor function has increased. One such technique is the SHAC block, which was first described by Galluccio et al. This block involves the injection of local anesthetic at two key sites: (1) the interfascial plane between the deltoid and subscapularis muscles and (2), the pericapsular region around the humeral head. This approach targets the axillary nerve and branches of the subscapular nerve, which contribute to shoulder joint innervation. By avoiding suprascapular nerve blockade, SHAC block can provide postoperative analgesia with minimal effects on motor function, thus, facilitating earlier rehabilitation and mobilization. Although previous studies have shown that SHAC block can relieve pain in conditions, such as frozen shoulder or after closed shoulder reduction, these applications do not involve the same degree of surgical trauma as arthroscopic rotator cuff repair does. While some reports suggest that SHAC block provides postoperative analgesia, these studies are either noncomparative or case reports.
