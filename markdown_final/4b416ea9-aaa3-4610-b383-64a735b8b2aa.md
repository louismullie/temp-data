## Question

Vasoplegia

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about vasoplegia: definition, pathophysiology, etiologies, diagnostic approach, treatment including pharmacologic sequencing and nonpharmacologic options, special populations, monitoring, controversies, and a pragmatic bedside algorithm, with explicit reasoning steps and self-verification throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define vasoplegia in a clinically useful and hemodynamically coherent way. Then, I should verify the multifactorial pathophysiology and how it links to therapeutic targets. Next, I will categorize precipitating causes and quantify risk factors. After that, I need to outline diagnostic criteria and differentiate vasoplegia from mimics. Then, I will build a stepwise treatment framework anchored to norepinephrine and vasopressin, including catecholamine-sparing strategies and rescue agents. Finally, I should consider special populations, monitoring endpoints, controversies, and close with a concise bedside algorithm while checking that each step aligns with current guidelines and meta-analytic evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical definition so I don't gloss over ambiguity: vasoplegia is best described as a distributive shock state with low systemic vascular resistance causing refractory hypotension despite adequate preload, with normal or elevated cardiac output, typically necessitating vasopressors to maintain perfusion pressure; critically, this reflects loss of vasomotor tone rather than primary pump failure or absolute hypovolemia, though fluid-responsive relative hypovolemia is common early in the course [^111XJqmS] [^117Jx588] [^1129gWiK].

> Hold on, I should verify the pathophysiology before I tie it to therapy: the dominant mechanisms include overproduction of nitric oxide via iNOS, cGMP-mediated vascular smooth muscle relaxation, activation of KATP channels with hyperpolarization, catecholamine receptor desensitization, and neurohormonal deficits such as vasopressin and angiotensin II deficiencies; this translates clinically into profound vasodilation and vascular hyporesponsiveness that may persist even as macrohemodynamics appear "adequate" on monitors [^112RTkhG] [^115448NV] [^113AHKMD].

> Next, I should review the clinical contexts and quantify risks to guide vigilance: sepsis remains the most common cause in critical care, whereas cardiac surgery, particularly on cardiopulmonary bypass, is the next most frequent and may involve iatrogenic vasodilatory inotropes and extracorporeal inflammation; additional precipitants include major trauma, burns, pancreatitis, liver disease, and drug effects, with risk modifiers including transfusion burden, preoperative ACE inhibitors/ARBs, longer CPB time, pre-existing renal dysfunction, and LVAD support as a bridge to transplant; reported incidence varies widely due to heterogeneous definitions, but clinically relevant vasoplegia after cardiac surgery is often in the 5–30% range, higher in LVAD and transplant cohorts [^1173E31S] [^111j6qkm] [^1175cBXc] [^116nZi1t] [^114G6yGW].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach and not jump to conclusions: clinically, vasoplegia is suspected with persistent MAP less than about 65 mmHg despite fluids and increasing vasopressor requirements in the setting of a normal or high cardiac index and low SVR; a practical definition often uses CI greater than 2.2 L/min/m² with SVR less than 800–1000 dyne·s/cm⁵ and a norepinephrine requirement above roughly 0.1–0.2 μg/kg/min, recognizing that no universal definition exists and that time windows (e.g., within 24–48 hours post-CPB) further influence ascertainment; importantly, I need to exclude sepsis, bleeding, tamponade, and primary myocardial dysfunction before labeling vasoplegia [^111XJqmS] [^116vvYNV] [^1175cBXc] [^11676HM7].

> I will now examine first-line therapy and make sure it aligns with high-quality guidance: norepinephrine remains the first-line vasopressor for vasoplegia and septic shock because it efficiently restores perfusion pressure with less arrhythmia and metabolic cost than alternatives; in post–cardiac surgery vasoplegia, the VANCS randomized trial showed vasopressin reduced the composite of death or severe complications compared with norepinephrine, reinforcing vasopressin as a legitimate first-line alternative or early adjunct in this setting; I should double-check dosing anchors, where vasopressin is commonly initiated at 0.03 U/min and titrated within 0.01–0.06 U/min, with careful attention to ischemic risks and sodium balance [^11676HM7] [^113NMyT6] [^115WtEjw].

> Hold on, I should verify catecholamine-sparing principles and when to add a second agent: the concept is to limit adrenergic toxicity and receptor desensitization; many expert protocols recommend early addition of vasopressin when norepinephrine exceeds about 0.1–0.2 μg/kg/min, while recognizing the 0.5 μg/kg/min "trigger" is sometimes cited as a total vasopressor burden rather than norepinephrine alone; in post-cardiac surgery cohorts, adding vasopressin early has reduced atrial fibrillation and composite complications, supporting a catecholamine-sparing approach when vasoplegia is established [^113hBNAL] [^1119mZZr] [^115WtEjw].

> Next, I should review rescue agents and be cautious about overpromising outcomes: methylene blue (often 1–2 mg/kg IV) is a guanylate cyclase inhibitor that rapidly increases SVR and reduces catecholamine requirements in refractory vasoplegia; hydroxocobalamin acts as a nitric oxide scavenger and in observational data reduced norepinephrine requirements over the first 24 hours without clear mortality benefit; angiotensin II (starting 10–20 ng/kg/min) can restore MAP in catecholamine-refractory shock and may have renal protective effects in some contexts, but I need to ensure adequate cardiac output before use to avoid afterload mismatch; collectively, these non-adrenergic strategies can be layered onto norepinephrine/vasopressin when MAP targets remain unmet or toxicity emerges [^115HTegQ] [^111iNuwe] [^116zAD6A] [^115cTipY] [^113hBNAL].

> Let me consider adjuncts and ensure I'm not overextending the evidence: hydrocortisone (about 200 mg/day) can be considered in vasopressor-refractory shock or when relative adrenal insufficiency is suspected, though survival benefits are uncertain; vitamin C and thiamine combinations have intriguing physiologic rationale but inconsistent clinical data, so I should reserve them for select scenarios or within protocols rather than as routine; these choices should be individualized and reassessed frequently for efficacy and adverse effects [^113hBNAL] [^112dADKR].

> I need to ensure I cover special populations because the same hemodynamic labels can behave differently: in mechanical circulatory support, vasoplegia diagnosis is complicated by nonpulsatile flow and device-specific physiology; definitions tailored to cfLVAD cohorts emphasize high device flows with low SVR and vasopressor requirements over 6–48 hours, with prolonged vasoplegia linked to AKI and early mortality; after heart transplantation, ISHLT recommends norepinephrine first-line with early addition of vasopressin or methylene blue; in sepsis, vasopressin is often added when norepinephrine is inadequate, and recent meta-analyses suggest non-adrenergic strategies may reduce mortality in septic shock; in burns, expert guidance supports vasopressin early for refractory vasoplegia alongside norepinephrine when needed, acknowledging limited burn-specific RCTs [^114JBZyV] [^114gD1my] [^113NMyT6] [^111tui3j] [^117KLzVE].

> But wait, what if I am mischaracterizing "refractory" vasoplegia — let me reconsider and define escalation thresholds: many cardiac surgery protocols suggest layering non-catecholamines when norepinephrine approaches 0.2–0.5 μg/kg/min or when the total vasopressor burden reaches roughly 0.5 μg/kg/min, recognizing that exact cutoffs are not standardized; in truly refractory cases, mechanical circulatory support (e.g. VA-ECMO) can be considered to unload the heart, restore perfusion, and facilitate catecholamine sparing, although evidence is largely observational and should be integrated with ischemic risk assessment and institutional expertise [^113hBNAL] [^111qrzp1].

> Next, I should review monitoring targets and acknowledge limitations: beyond achieving MAP thresholds (commonly ≥ 65 mmHg), I need to track lactate trends, urine output, extremity temperature and mottling, mental status, and where available, cardiac output/SVR to confirm the vasoplegic phenotype; capillary refill time and diastolic pressure may help phenotype vasodilation and guide earlier vasopressor initiation in septic shock; however, microcirculatory dysfunction may persist despite "normalized" MAP, so I should avoid catecholamine escalation that raises MAP without improving tissue perfusion [^111VF4wL] [^117Jx588].

> I should double-check the strength of outcome data for non-adrenergic strategies to avoid overstating benefits: pooled randomized data show that non-adrenergic vasopressors, particularly vasopressin and methylene blue, reduce mortality in septic shock, whereas in cardiac surgery cohorts, benefits are more consistent for renal outcomes, arrhythmia reduction, and vasopressor sparing rather than mortality; angiotensin II reliably raises MAP and reduces catecholamine requirements but has thrombotic risk and should be reserved for carefully selected patients with adequate forward flow [^111tui3j] [^115YHT4F] [^116YeBw1].

> Let me summarize the key controversies so I don't overpromise any single pathway: there is no consensus definition of vasoplegia, which inflates heterogeneity in incidence and outcomes across studies; optimal timing and sequencing of vasopressors remain debated; and the long-term impact of catecholamine-sparing on hard outcomes still requires larger, rigorously controlled trials; these gaps justify early, protocolized multimodal therapy but also demand vigilant reassessment of benefit–risk at the bedside [^1175cBXc] [^1126nfz5].

> Finally, here is the practical bedside algorithm I would use, with built-in checkpoints: confirm the vasoplegic phenotype with CI and SVR where available and exclude alternative causes of hypotension; start norepinephrine and titrate to MAP ≥ 65 mmHg while optimizing preload; add vasopressin at 0.03 U/min when norepinephrine exceeds about 0.1–0.2 μg/kg/min or when pulmonary hypertension/right heart dysfunction is present; if MAP remains inadequate or toxicity emerges, add methylene blue 1–2 mg/kg or hydroxocobalamin 5 g and consider angiotensin II if cardiac output is adequate; reserve hydrocortisone for refractory shock or suspected relative adrenal insufficiency; escalate to VA-ECMO for refractory vasoplegia compromising perfusion; throughout, prioritize tissue perfusion markers over MAP alone and de-escalate agents that do not meaningfully improve perfusion or that cause harm [^11676HM7] [^113NMyT6] [^113hBNAL] [^111qrzp1].

Vasoplegia is a **vasodilatory shock** with low systemic vascular resistance and hypotension despite normal or high cardiac output, most often after cardiac surgery, sepsis, or trauma [^112fGZJX] [^117Jx588]. It is driven by nitric oxide, prostacyclin, and potassium-channel activation, with catecholamine receptor desensitization and vasopressin deficiency contributing to refractory hypotension [^112RTkhG] [^115448NV]. Management centers on **early norepinephrine** to restore perfusion pressure, with vasopressin added for catecholamine-resistant cases or right ventricular dysfunction [^113NMyT6] [^11676HM7]. Methylene blue, angiotensin II, and hydroxocobalamin are options for refractory vasoplegia, and early recognition with multimodal therapy improves outcomes [^1126nfz5] [^113idcV4].

---

## Pathophysiology

Vasoplegia arises from **multiple, converging mechanisms**:

- **Nitric oxide (NO)**: Excessive NO from iNOS increases cGMP, causing vascular smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation [^112RTkhG].

- **Prostacyclin**: Elevated prostacyclin increases cAMP, promoting vasodilation [^112RTkhG].

- **Potassium channels**: Activation of KATP channels hyperpolarizes vascular smooth muscle, reducing calcium influx and causing vasodilation [^112RTkhG].

- **Catecholamine receptor desensitization**: Downregulation and desensitization of adrenergic receptors blunt vasopressor responses [^115448NV].

- **Vasopressin deficiency**: Relative vasopressin deficiency contributes to persistent vasodilation [^115448NV].

---

## Clinical presentation

Vasoplegia is characterized by:

- **Hypotension**: Persistent low mean arterial pressure (MAP) despite adequate fluid resuscitation [^111XJqmS].

- **High cardiac output**: Normal or elevated cardiac index with low systemic vascular resistance (SVR) [^111XJqmS].

- **Vasopressor dependence**: Requirement for high-dose vasopressors to maintain perfusion pressure [^115LoesT].

- **Organ dysfunction**: Risk of renal, hepatic, and neurological dysfunction due to persistent hypotension [^notfound].

---

## Risk factors

Several factors predispose to vasoplegia, including **patient-specific** factors — older age, preoperative ACE inhibitor or beta-blocker use, chronic kidney disease, and low ejection fraction — and **procedure-related** factors — cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, prolonged bypass time, major trauma, sepsis, and extensive intraoperative transfusion [^112fGZJX] [^1175cBXc] [^111j6qkm].

---

## Diagnostic criteria

There is **no universal definition**, but commonly used criteria include:

- **Hypotension**: MAP < 65 mmHg despite adequate fluid resuscitation [^115WtEjw].

- **High cardiac output**: Cardiac index > 2.2 L/min/m² [^116vvYNV].

- **Low SVR**: SVR < 800 dynes·s/cm⁵ [^113BpzfQ].

- **Vasopressor requirement**: Need for high-dose vasopressors (e.g. norepinephrine > 0.1 µg/kg/min) [^116vvYNV].

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on restoring vascular tone and perfusion pressure while minimizing catecholamine toxicity:

- **First-line vasopressor**: Norepinephrine is the preferred initial agent [^113NMyT6] [^113idcV4].

- **Second-line vasopressor**: Vasopressin is added for catecholamine-resistant vasoplegia or right ventricular dysfunction [^113NMyT6] [^11676HM7].

- **Adjunctive therapies**: Methylene blue, angiotensin II, and hydroxocobalamin are options for refractory cases [^113idcV4] [^116GuM73].

- **Multimodal approach**: Combining agents with different mechanisms can reduce catecholamine requirements and improve outcomes [^115YHT4F] [^115cTipY].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

Vasoplegia is associated with **increased morbidity and mortality**, including higher risks of renal failure, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and longer ICU stay [^115H2SWt]. Mortality is particularly high in cardiac surgery patients and those requiring prolonged high-dose vasopressors [^113BpzfQ].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventive strategies include **preoperative optimization** — optimizing hemodynamics, minimizing preoperative ACE inhibitor or beta-blocker use, and identifying high-risk patients — and **intraoperative strategies** — limiting cardiopulmonary bypass time, maintaining adequate perfusion pressure, and avoiding excessive transfusion [^112HiRam] [^111j6qkm].

---

Vasoplegia is a severe vasodilatory shock with **multifactorial pathophysiology** and high morbidity and mortality. Early recognition and a multimodal vasopressor strategy — led by norepinephrine with vasopressin and adjuncts as needed — are essential to restore perfusion and improve outcomes [^112fGZJX] [^113NMyT6].

Conclusions

Although vasoplegia is a well-recognised phenomenon, it still suffers from the lack of a unifying clinical definition. This prevents clinical trialists and translational scientists from sharing the common language necessary to facilitate research and increase understanding of this phenomenon. Certainly, we believe that a uniform approach to describing vasoplegia would reap benefits and stimulate further investigation of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Vasoplegia is a complex phenomenon centred around vascular reactivity with multiple contributory potential mechanisms (outlined in Fig. 3). The advent of further alternatives to catecholamines, such as angiotensin II, may herald a new approach to treatment and the potential for alternative approaches — for further details, the reader is invited to consult the treatment article published in the same series. Optimum targets for systemic blood pressure remain contentious, and increasingly and appropriately, the pharmacological agents used to achieve these goals will be more closely scrutinised.

The main clinical causes of vasoplegia (top) and how they are perceived to relate to underlying aetiologies (bottom) — i.e. sepsis is predominantly a response to PAMPS (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) compared to burns or polytrauma where DAMPS (damage-associated molecular patterns) are the major cause

It is uncertain if it is justifiable to consider vasoplegia to be a pathophysiologically distinct entity representing uncontrolled failure of vascular homeostasis or to represent the end of a spectrum of vasodilatation.

Vasoplegic shock (VS), synonymous with distributive shock, is a more significant circulatory perturbation that is best described as vasoplegia with evidence of tissue hypoperfusion which may be accompanied with hyperlactataemia. The presence of a raised lactate portends a particularly grave prognosis in the presence of shock or indeed septic shock. This review describes the key mechanisms involved in the development of VS, a process that is mediated by a diverse set of pathways which combine and contribute to the evolution of the shock state. Advancing our understanding of these pathways and their role in the transition from adaptive physiological to maladaptive pathological response may provide novel diagnostic tools, prognostic insights and therapeutic targets to guide the management of vasoplegia.

To date, our treatment options are limited and do not target some of the main pathophysiological pathways. First-line vasopressor therapy is typically with catecholamines and resistance is referred to as catecholamine-resistant hypotension (CRH). Although vasopressor infusion is required in order to maintain an adequate MAP, significant variation remains in clinical practice, particularly with regard to personalised targets depending on premorbid characteristics, and current research efforts are addressing this issue. Moreover, it is well recognised that infused catecholamines are associated with a range of adverse effects on the metabolic, immune and coagulation systems.

The tools available to clinicians to monitor the severity and impact of vasoplegia are limited and existing treatment goals may not result in the desired tissue level effects on microvascular flow. Improved understanding of the pathophysiology of vasoplegia combined with new tools to monitor the impact of interventions on vessel function may lead to the development of the next generation of vasoactive therapies. The measurement of cardiac output, systemic blood pressure and central venous pressure allow derivation of the SVR, although targeting 'normal' values with insufficient consideration of their components may be hazardous.

Conclusions

Vasoplegia is a common feature of all advanced shock states, with norepinephrine remaining the cornerstone of vasoplegia-induced hypotension. However, given our improved understanding of vasoplegia, management is likely to evolve from a standardized therapy with norepinephrine alone to a multimodal strategy with two or more vasopressors. Based on new pathophysiological data, numerous potential drugs are currently being investigated. Nevertheless, these new potential treatments or therapeutic strategies should be evaluated not only for their ability to increase arterial pressure but also for their capacity to improve survival or decrease major morbidity as well as for their effectiveness/cost ratio.

### Definitions and pathophysiology of vasoplegic shock [^115ozaNF]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Vasoplegia is the syndrome of pathological low systemic vascular resistance, the dominant clinical feature of which is reduced blood pressure in the presence of a normal or raised cardiac output. The vasoplegic syndrome is encountered in many clinical scenarios, including septic shock, post-cardiac bypass and after surgery, burns and trauma, but despite this, uniform clinical definitions are lacking, which renders translational research in this area challenging. We discuss the role of vasoplegia in these contexts and the criteria that are used to describe it are discussed. Intrinsic processes which may drive vasoplegia, such as nitric oxide, prostanoids, endothelin-1, hydrogen sulphide and reactive oxygen species production, are reviewed and potential for therapeutic intervention explored. Extrinsic drivers, including those mediated by glucocorticoid, catecholamine and vasopressin responsiveness of the blood vessels, are also discussed. The optimum balance between maintaining adequate systemic vascular resistance against the potentially deleterious effects of treatment with catecholamines is as yet unclear, but development of novel vasoactive agents may facilitate greater understanding of the role of the differing pathways in the development of vasoplegia. In turn, this may provide insights into the best way to care for patients with this common, multifactorial condition.

### Definitions and pathophysiology of vasoplegic shock [^111XJqmS]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Vasoplegia is an abnormally low systemic vascular resistance (SVR) that is manifest as profound hypotension or the requirement for therapies to avoid this, in the presence of a normal or increased cardiac output (Fig. 1). Physiologically, a low SVR is defined as a low ratio of difference in blood pressure between arterial (MAP) and venous pressures (RAP) to the cardiac output [SVR = (MAP − RAP)/CO]. Clinically, vasoplegia is often recognised in the absence of such comprehensive haemodynamic data. The causes of vasoplegia are diverse, and several definitions have been described for specific causes; similarly, related terminologies are variably used. The absence of consensus clinically based definitions of vasoplegia impede progress in understanding the pathophysiology of vasoplegia; this is particularly true when considering the similarities between vasodilatory shock due to sterile or non-sterile causes — for example hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation in early burns injury versus early sepsis.

Fig. 1
The relationship between tone in resistance vessels, under conditions of equal cardiac output, and the systemic blood pressure — preserved vasomotor tone leading to normotension and loss of vasomotor tone leading to hypotension

Patients in hospitals most commonly experience hypotension due to vasodilatation because of the administration of general or neuraxial anaesthesia, and even when transient this has been associated with adverse outcomes; however, further discussion is beyond the scope of this review. Similarly, hypotension due to vasodilatation resulting from neurogenic shock has a discrete pathophysiology (loss of sympathetic innervation due to spinal cord injury) and is not considered further. This review focuses on the causes of vasoplegia that reflect a varied response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPS) (Fig. 2). The response to these stimuli generates a combination of vasodilatation and increased capillary permeability. Capillary leak, coupled with greater vessel capacitance mediated by vasoplegia may result in absolute, or more commonly relative, hypovolemia. Fluid resuscitation to treat this phenomenon is a standard of care, but this does not treat the underlying pathology and positive fluid balance is associated with harm.

### Vasoplegia treatments: the past, the present, and the future [^115LoesT]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Definition(s) of vasoplegia

Known as "vasodilatory shock", this condition includes multiple and diverse etiologies (e.g. septic, cardiogenic, neurogenic, and anaphylactic shock) and ultimately results in uncontrolled vasodilation, otherwise termed "vasoplegia". The pathophysiology of vasoplegia is multifactorial and includes activation of several intrinsic vasodilatory pathways and a vascular hyporesponsiveness to vasopressors. Vasoplegia occurring post-surgery is called postoperative vasoplegic syndrome or vasoplegic syndrome. In clinical practice, vasoplegia can be assessed clinically by the vasopressor dosage necessary to maintain mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and by the drop in diastolic blood pressure reflecting vasoplegia. Invariably, the necessity to use a high-dose vasopressor is highly indicative of vasoplegia, especially in the case of normal cardiac function. For further details, the reader is invited to consult the pathophysiological article published in the same series.

However, vascular responsiveness to vasopressors is probably better suited than vasoplegia for characterizing the state of vessels during shock. While the term vasoplagia refers to the static diameter of the vessel in response to specific intra-luminal and transmural pressures, vascular responsiveness to vasopressors refers to the dynamic response of the vessel to endogenous and/or exogenous vasoconstrictor agents.

The present review was written based on a critical and personal appraisal of the literature. It focuses only on treatment-based pathophysiology of vasoplegia and the benefits or drawbacks of each associated therapeutic option for all types of shock, irrespective of their origin. Nevertheless, there is a clear lack of data with regard to vasoplegia treatments in non-septic shock.

### Definitions and pathophysiology of vasoplegic shock [^1173E31S]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Causes of vasoplegia

Sepsis

The commonest cause of vasoplegia in critical care is sepsis. The incidence is dependent upon the definition used and the patient population under consideration. Receipt of vasopressors, where appropriate, is now recognised as a cardinal feature of septic shock and indeed the most recent definition of septic shock does not require the presence of persistent hypotension. However, it includes administration of vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mmHg (in the absence of hypovolaemia) and an elevated blood lactate level in the presence of sepsis. This contrasts with earlier definitions which required hypotension as reflected by a low MAP (< 60 mmHg) in the absence of hypovolaemia and other cause of hypotension.

Cardiac surgery

Vasoplegia and VS occurring in patients following cardiac surgery are the second commonest cause. Diagnosis is more complex as there is an ever-present risk of impaired cardiac output contributing to hypotension, the cause of which must be ascertained early — differentiating between reduced preload from bleeding, impaired myocardial contractility or the occurrence of cardiac tamponade. The second main complicating factor is the frequent use of vasodilatory inotropes that directly influence vascular tone. Therefore, although no consensus definition exists, there are several working definitions that combine i) hypotension in the absence of a low cardiac output state and ii) absence of infection; additional criteria may also include the absence of vasodilatory inotropes such as dobutamine or milrinone, or presence of evidence of tissue hypoperfusion. Clinical factors that predispose to the development of vasoplegia following cardiac surgery have been described and various treatment regimens considered, including the use of alternative vasoconstrictors. Although vasoplegia following cardiac surgery is often attributed to exposure to an extracorporeal circuit the evidence in support of this remains mixed.

### Vasoplegia syndrome after cardiac surgery: insights into mechanisms and treatment [^112fGZJX]. JACC: Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Vasoplegia syndrome is a specific form of vasodilatory shock encountered in patients who undergo cardiac surgery, most commonly with cardiopulmonary bypass, which is characterized by severe hypotension in the presence of normal or increased cardiac output with abnormal tissue perfusion. Although numerous risk factors have been identified, the pathophysiology remains incompletely understood, and the therapeutic strategies are limited with a consequent poor prognosis. Current research on mechanisms and treatment has focused on targeting disequilibrium in the biological mediators of vasodilation and vasoconstriction that leads to profound hypotension and end-organ malperfusion. The morbidity and mortality rates are high, making vasoplegia syndrome a clinical area of unmet need. Looking ahead, use of standardized definitions and reporting of prospective outcomes as well as investigations into new mechanisms will be critical to identifying novel therapeutic targets and reducing the burden of vasoplegia syndrome.

### Vasoplegic syndrome in cardiac surgery: a narrative review of etiologic mechanisms and therapeutic options [^1129gWiK]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Vasoplegic syndrome, a form of distributive shock that may manifest during or after cardiopulmonary bypass, is a serious complication that increases morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgery. No consensus definition exists, but vasoplegic syndrome is generally described as a state of pathologic vasodilation causing hypotension refractory to fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy, and resulting in organ malperfusion despite a normal or increased cardiac output. Diagnosis can be complex as there is a broad differential diagnosis for low systemic vascular resistance in the cardiac surgical patient. Interpretation of hemodynamic data can also be challenging in the setting of mixed shock states and mechanical support. This narrative review summarizes the pathophysiology of vasoplegic syndrome, the literature concerning its incidence and risk factors, the hemodynamic parameters important to the diagnosis of vasoplegic syndrome, a consensus definition of the syndrome, and a proposed goal-directed treatment framework.

### Vasoplegia treatments: the past, the present, and the future [^114VN5Gy]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Vasoplegia is a ubiquitous phenomenon in all advanced shock states, including septic, cardiogenic, hemorrhagic, and anaphylactic shock. Its pathophysiology is complex, involving various mechanisms in vascular smooth muscle cells such as G protein-coupled receptor desensitization (adrenoceptors, vasopressin 1 receptors, angiotensin type 1 receptors), alteration of second messenger pathways, critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency, and increased production of nitric oxide. This review, based on a critical appraisal of the literature, discusses the main current treatments and future approaches. Our improved understanding of these mechanisms is progressively changing our therapeutic approach to vasoplegia from a standardized to a personalized multimodal treatment with the prescription of several vasopressors. While norepinephrine is confirmed as first line therapy for the treatment of vasoplegia, the latest Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines also consider that the best therapeutic management of vascular hyporesponsiveness to vasopressors could be a combination of multiple vasopressors, including norepinephrine and early prescription of vasopressin. This new approach is seemingly justified by the need to limit adrenoceptor desensitization as well as sympathetic overactivation given its subsequent deleterious impacts on hemodynamics and inflammation. Finally, based on new pathophysiological data, two potential drugs, selepressin and angiotensin II, are currently being evaluated.

### Vasoplegic syndrome following cardiothoracic surgery-review of pathophysiology and update of treatment options [^1113aVyN]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Vasoplegic syndrome may occur in up to half of all patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery, with predisposing patient-specific risk factors combined with inflammatory response to CPB as precipitating causes. NO is believed to play a large role in refractory vasodilation and thus is a potential target for therapies. While catecholamines are considered first-line therapy in vasoplegic syndrome, non-catecholamine agents may be considered early or in place of catecholamines by virtue of their improved safety profile with regard to cardiac toxicity. Moreover, these agents may be associated with improved outcomes such as reduced kidney injury. Data is largely circumstantial and hypothesis-generating, but there is emerging consensus that catecholamine sparing may lead to improved clinical outcomes after CPB. In general, the treatment of vasoplegic syndrome should be rational and balanced, with the judicious use of catecholamine and non-catecholamine agents alike. Further efforts are required to validate the various protocols, including the one presented here, for effectiveness in patient-centered outcomes.

### Vasoplegia in cardiac surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis of current definitions and their influence on clinical outcomes [^1175cBXc]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To identify differences in the reported vasoplegia incidence, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), and 30-day mortality rates as influenced by different vasoplegia definitions used in cardiac surgery studies.

Design

A systematic review was performed covering the period 1977 to 2023 using PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Emcare and a meta-analysis (PROSPERO: CRD42021258328) was performed.

Setting and Participants

One hundred studies defining vasoplegia in cardiac surgery patients were systematically reviewed. Sixty studies with 20 or more patients, irrespective of design, reporting vasoplegia incidence, ICU LOS, or 30-day mortality were included for meta-analysis.

Interventions

Cardiac surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass.

Measurements and Main Results

Studies were categorized depending on the used mean arterial pressure (MAP) thresholds. Random intercept logistic regression models were used for meta-analysis of incidence and mortality. Random effect meta-analysis was used for ICU LOS. One hundred studies were reviewed systematically. MAP and cardiac index thresholds varied considerably (< 50–80 mmHg and 2.0–3.5 L·min -1 m -2, respectively). Vasopressor dosages also differed between definitions. The reported incidence (60 studies; mean incidence, 19.9%; 95% confidence interval, 16.1–24.4) varied largely between studies (2.5%-66.3%; I² = 97%; p < 0.0001). Meta-regression models, including the MAP-threshold, did not explain this heterogeneity. Similarly, the effect of vasoplegia on ICU LOS, and 30-day mortality was very heterogeneous among studies (I 2 = 99% and I² = 73%, respectively).

Conclusions

The large variability in vasoplegia definitions is associated with significant heterogeneity regarding incidence and clinical outcomes, which cannot be explained by factors included in our models. Such variations in definitions leads to inconsistent patient diagnosis and renders published vasoplegia research incomparable.

Vasoplegia occurs in all shock states

Although initially ascribed to septic shock, it is now apparent that the majority of mechanisms explaining or associated with vascular hyporesponsiveness to vasopressors (inflammation, nitric oxide (NO), potassium and calcium channels, adrenomedullin, and free radicals) are also common to hemorrhagic shock, cardiogenic shock (including in post-cardiopulmonary bypass patients), anaphylactic shock, and, more generally, during ischemia-reperfusion, such as cardiac arrest or multiple trauma.

### Adverse clinical effects associated with non-catecholamine pharmacologic agents for treatment of vasoplegic syndrome in adult cardiac surgery [^115H2SWt]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Vasoplegic syndrome is a relatively common complication that can happen during and after major adult cardiac surgery. It is associated with a higher rate of complications, including postoperative renal failure, longer duration of mechanical ventilation, and intensive care unit stay, as well as increased mortality. The underlying pathophysiology of vasoplegic syndrome is that of profound vascular hyporesponsiveness, and involves a complex interplay among inflammatory cytokines, cellular surface receptors, and nitric oxide (NO) production. The pharmacotherapy approaches for the treatment of vasoplegia include medications that increase vascular smooth muscle contraction via increasing cytosolic calcium in myocytes, reduce the vascular effects of NO and inflammation, and increase the biosynthesis of and vascular response to norepinephrine. Clinical trials have demonstrated the clinical efficacy of non-catecholamine pharmacologic agents in the treatment of vasoplegic syndrome. With an increase in their use today, it is important for clinicians to understand the adverse clinical outcomes and patient risk profiles associated with these agents, which will allow better-tailored medical therapy.

### Determinants and outcomes of vasoplegia following left ventricular assist device implantation [^1143Cd19]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Vasoplegia is a complication of surgery characterized by excessive vasodilation and low systemic vascular resistance that develops in 5% to 25% of patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). 1, 2 Although a number of studies have assessed vasoplegia in heart transplantation, data are sparse for advanced heart failure (HF) patients who receive a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Preliminary studies have shown that HF patients are at risk of developing vasoplegia after LVAD surgery, but nothing has been reported, to our knowledge, to classify vasoplegia according to severity in LVAD recipients or to assess its effect on surgical outcomes. For these reasons, we sought to identify modifiable risk factors and to describe the consequences of vasoplegia following LVAD implantation.

### Vasoplegia during cardiac surgery: current concepts and management [^115UuYR5]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Vasoplegic syndrome (VS) is a recognized and relatively common complication of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), appearing with an incidence ranging between 5% and 25%. It is characterized by significant hypotension, high or normal cardiac outputs and low systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and increased requirements for fluids and vasopressors during or after CPB. Patients developing VS are at increased risk for death and other major complications following cardiac surgery. This review will focus on the pathophysiology and contemporary strategies of treating VS encountered after CPB.

### Non-adrenergic vasopressors for vasodilatory shock or perioperative vasoplegia: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113idcV4]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Vasodilatory shock remains a clinical challenge in critically ill and perioperative patients. When fluid resuscitation alone fails to restore blood pressure, vasopressors represent the key intervention to correct hypotension. There are three major mechanisms to maintain blood pressure, i.e. the sympathetic nervous system, vasopressin system, and renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Each of them has the corresponding vasopressors (i.e. catecholamines, vasopressin and its derivatives, and angiotensin II). In addition, several vasoactive agents with distinct mechanisms of action (e.g. methylene blue and hydroxocobalamin) can also be used to restore blood pressure.

Noradrenaline is recommended as the first-line vasopressor; however, excessive exposure to catecholamines is associated with poor prognosis. Thus, the hypothesis has emerged that administration of non-adrenergic vasopressors may reduce the catecholamine burden and improve clinical outcomes. Consistent with this, a previous meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in 2015 showed potential survival benefits of non-adrenergic agents. Other meta-analyses have suggested that vasopressin and its derivatives may reduce arrhythmias in septic shock and that methylene blue might offer survival benefits in patients with septic shock and in those undergoing cardiac surgery. Moreover, angiotensin II, which became available for clinical use in 2017, has been tested in a clinical trial primarily involving septic shock patients and in two RCTs in cardiac surgical settings with promising findings. Finally, hydroxocobalamin was also tested in a recent RCT for septic shock. Given the heterogeneity of these studies in terms of patient population, comparator, type of non-adrenergic agent, and shock severity, a dedicated analysis appears desirable to account for these between-trial differences and provide an updated assessment of the outcome impact of non-adrenergic vasopressors.

Accordingly, we performed an updated systematic review and meta-analysis. We aimed to test the hypothesis that non-adrenergic vasopressors reduce mortality in adult patients receiving vasopressor therapy for vasodilatory shock or perioperative vasoplegia. To address the heterogeneity of treatment effects across different populations and different comparators, we separately analyzed studies according to patient group (septic shock, cardiac surgery, and non-cardiac surgery) and performed subgroup analyses according to the comparator (adrenergic agents or placebo).

### Diagnosis and management of vasoplegia in temporary mechanical circulatory support: a narrative review [^114JBZyV]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Refractory vasodilatory shock, or vasoplegia, is a pathophysiologic state observed in the intensive care unit and operating room in patients with a variety of primary diagnoses. Definitions of vasoplegia vary by source but are qualitatively defined clinically as a normal or high cardiac index and low systemic vascular resistance causing hypotension despite high-dose vasopressors in the setting of euvolemia. This definition can be difficult to apply to patients undergoing mechanical circulatory support (MCS). A large body of mostly retrospective literature exists on vasoplegia in the non-MCS population, but the increased use of temporary MCS justifies an examination of vasoplegia in this population. MCS, particularly extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, adds complexity to the diagnosis and management of vasoplegia due to challenges in determining cardiac output (or total blood flow), lack of clarity on appropriate dosing of noncatecholamine interventions, increased thrombosis risk, the difficulty in determining the endpoints of adequate volume resuscitation, and the unclear effects of rescue agents (methylene blue, hydroxocobalamin, and angiotensin II) on MCS device monitoring and function. Care teams must combine data from invasive and noninvasive sources to diagnose vasoplegia in this population. In this narrative review, the available literature is surveyed to provide guidance on the diagnosis and management of vasoplegia in the temporary MCS population, with a focus on noncatecholamine treatments and special considerations for patients supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, transvalvular heart pumps, and other ventricular assist devices.

### Vasoplegia after cardiovascular procedures-pathophysiology and targeted therapy [^116h4Qcu]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Vasoplegic syndrome, characterized by low systemic vascular resistance and hypotension in the presence of normal or supranormal cardiac function, is a frequent complication of cardiovascular surgery. It is associated with a diffuse systemic inflammatory response and is mediated largely through cellular hyperpolarization, high levels of inducible nitric oxide, and a relative vasopressin deficiency. Cardiopulmonary bypass is a particularly strong precipitant of the vasoplegic syndrome, largely due to its association with nitric oxide production and severe vasopressin deficiency. Postoperative vasoplegic shock generally is managed with vasopressors, of which catecholamines are the traditional agents of choice. Norepinephrine is considered to be the first-line agent and may have a mortality benefit over other drugs. Recent investigations support the use of noncatecholamine vasopressors, vasopressin in particular, to restore vascular tone. Alternative agents, including methylene blue, hydroxocobalamin, corticosteroids, and angiotensin II, also are capable of restoring vascular tone and improving vasoplegia, but their effect on patient outcomes is unclear.

### American Burn Association clinical practice guidelines on burn shock resuscitation [^117KLzVE]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). High credibility.

Vasopressin and norepinephrine during burn shock resuscitation — In severe burns, refractory vasoplegia is noted, and specific thresholds and agent sequences are described: when mean arterial pressure is ≤ 55 mm Hg with inadequate urine output, vasopressin (0.04 units/min) is the first vasoactive agent, with norepinephrine added if central venous pressure is 8–10 mm Hg; an international survey reported 80% would use norepinephrine as the primary agent. In the non-burn literature, randomized trials in trauma/septic shock showed no overall difference in 28-day mortality between vasopressin (35.4%) and norepinephrine (39.3%), with lower mortality in a less severe septic shock subgroup (26.5% vs 35.7%) and lower cytokine levels in survivors within the first 24 hours with vasopressin. Renal outcomes reported lower progression to failure or loss and lower serum creatinine over time for the RIFLE Risk category with vasopressin, and fewer patients required renal replacement therapy in vasopressin groups, with no differences in other RIFLE categories. Due to limited burn-specific data, the authors state they cannot make a recommendation on which vasopressor to use during burn resuscitation, and the panel is unable to form any recommendation on whether to use norepinephrine or vasopressin if a vasopressor is required.

### Methylene blue: magic bullet for vasoplegia? [^111iNuwe]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

Methylene blue (MB) has received much attention in the perioperative and critical care literature because of its ability to antagonize the profound vasodilation seen in distributive (also referred to as vasodilatory or vasoplegic) shock states. This review will discuss the pharmacologic properties of MB and review the critical care, liver transplantation, and cardiac anesthesia literature with respect to the efficacy and safety of MB for the treatment of shock. Although improved blood pressure has consistently been demonstrated with the use of MB in small trials and case reports, better oxygen delivery or decreased mortality with MB use has not been demonstrated. Large randomized controlled trials are still necessary to identify the role of MB in hemodynamic resuscitation of the critically ill.

### Vasoplegic syndrome following cardiothoracic surgery-review of pathophysiology and update of treatment options [^113BpzfQ]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Vasoplegic syndrome, a form of vasodilatory shock following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), may affect up to half of all patients undergoing major cardiovascular surgery. The pathophysiology of vasoplegic syndrome is similar to that of sepsis. A large number of patients require vasopressors post-operatively to maintain adequate tissue perfusion. The need for escalating vasopressors is associated with a higher incidence of morbidity and mortality. Research describing the use of agents in refractory vasoplegic syndrome is limited primarily to case series and case reports. The present review discusses the pathophysiology of vasoplegic syndrome and evaluates the various treatment options with insight from personal experience with novel non-catecholamine therapies.

Vasoplegia is characterized by a normal or augmented cardiac output with low systemic vascular resistance (SVR) causing organ hypoperfusion. The exact definition has varied but typically is considered when shock occurs within 24 h of CPB in the setting of a cardiac index (CI) is greater than 2.2 L/kg/m 2 and SVR less than 800 dyne s/cm 5. These criteria are relatively non-specific and found in other disease states such as sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, and hepatic failure, among others, with the distinction being the etiology of the shock (infection in the case of sepsis and exposure to extracorporeal circulation in the case of vasoplegia). Treatment of this syndrome is usually limited to the initiation of vasopressors to maintain adequate perfusion pressures via the targeting of a specific mean arterial pressure (MAP). Due to the similarity in between vasoplegic syndrome and sepsis, along with paucity in supporting evidence, many of the treatment options used in septic shock have been extrapolated to use in vasoplegic syndrome.

Vasoplegic syndrome following cardiovascular surgery accounts for less than 5% of all circulatory shock. Despite this, between 5 and 50% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery may experience vasoplegic syndrome with high morbidity and mortality rates in those patients. Incidence is higher in patients with preoperative risk factors including preoperative use of antihypertensive medications, a large number of comorbidities, warmer core temperatures while on bypass, and a longer duration on bypass.

### Vasoplegia following orthotopic heart transplantation: prevalence, predictors and clinical outcomes [^114G6yGW]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients undergoing heart transplant are at high risk for postoperative vasoplegia. Despite its frequency and association with poor clinical outcomes, there remains no consensus definition for vasoplegia, and the predisposing risk factors for vasoplegia remain unclear. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence, predictors, and clinical outcomes associated with vasoplegia in a contemporary cohort of patients undergoing heart transplantation.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing heart transplantation from January 2015 to December 2019. A binary definition of vasoplegia of a cardiac index of 2.5 L/min/m 2 or greater and requirement for norepinephrine (≥ 5 µg/min), epinephrine (≥ 4 µg/min), or vasopressin (≥ 1 unit/h) to maintain a mean arterial blood pressure of 65 mm Hg, for 6 consecutive hours during the first 48 hours postoperatively, was used in determining prevalence. Given the relatively low threshold for the binary definition of vasoplegia, patients were divided into tertiles based on their cumulative vasopressor requirement in the 48 hours following transplant. Outcomes included all-cause mortality, intubation time, intensive care unit length of stay, and length of total hospitalization.

Results

After exclusion of patients with primary cardiogenic shock, major bleeding, or overt sepsis, data were collected on 95 eligible patients. By binary definition, vasoplegia incidence was 66.3%. We separately stratified by actual vasopressor requirement tertile (high, intermediate, low). Stratified by tertile, patients with vasoplegia were older (52.7 ± 10.2 vs 46.8 ± 12.7 vs 44.4 ± 11.3 years, P = 0.02), with higher rates of chronic kidney disease (18.8% vs 32.3% vs 3.1%, P = 0.01) and were more likely to have been transplanted from left ventricular assist device support (n = 42) (62.5% vs 32.3% vs 37.5%, P = 0.03). Cardiopulmonary bypass time was prolonged in those that developed vasoplegia (155 min [interquartile range 135–193] vs 131 min [interquartile range 117–152] vs 116 min [interquartile range 102–155], P = 0.003). Intubation time and length of intensive care unit and hospital stay were significantly increased in those that developed vasoplegia; however, this difference did not translate to a significant increase in all-cause mortality at 30 days or 1 year.

Conclusions

Vasoplegia occurs at a high rate after heart transplantation. Older age, chronic kidney disease, mechanical circulatory support, and prolonged bypass time are all associated with vasoplegia; however, this study did not demonstrate an associated increase in all-cause mortality LAY SUMMARY: Patients undergoing heart transplantation are at high risk of vasoplegia, a condition defined by low blood pressure despite normal heart function. We found that vasoplegia was common after heart transplant, occurring in 60%-70% of patients after heart transplant after excluding those with other causes for low blood pressure. Factors implicated included age, poor kidney function, prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time and preoperative left ventricular assist device support. We found no increased risk of death in patients with vasoplegia despite longer lengths of stay in intensive care and in hospital.

### A novel clinical risk score to predict vasoplegia after adult cardiac surgery [^116vvYNV]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Vasoplegia is a morbid complication after cardiopulmonary bypass. Identifying patients at risk for vasoplegia may improve outcomes, but current assessment tools are limited by highly heterogeneous and static criteria for defining vasoplegia. Using a more rigorous definition, the study investigators developed a risk score that stratifies risk for vasoplegia after cardiopulmonary bypass.

Methods

Postoperative data were extracted from electronic health records of adult patients who underwent surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass at Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center (Houston, TX) from 2017 to 2022. Vasoplegia was defined as an hourly average mean arterial pressure ≤ 65 mm Hg, cardiac index ≥ 2.2 L/min/m 2, norepinephrine equivalents ≥ 0.1 μg/kg/min, and central venous pressure ≤ 15 mm Hg for at least 1 hour postoperatively. After merging electronic health record data with institutional elements of The Society of Thoracic Surgery registry, regression coefficients of significant variables were used to assign integer points to a risk score that was then internally validated.

Results

The overall incidence of postoperative vasoplegia was 16.7%. Vasoplegic patients had higher rates of in-hospital mortality (6.4% vs. 3.0%, p < 0.001) and major morbidity (51.5% vs. 23.4%, p < 0.001) compared to non-vasoplegic patients. We developed a risk score comprising the independent predictors of vasoplegia. Patients were divided into risk categories according to total score. The probability of vasoplegia was 3.9%, 14.8%, and 34.2% in patients with low, moderate, and high scores, respectively. The risk score performed well on internal validation (C-index: 0.68 [95% CI: 0.64–0.72]).

Conclusions

This clinical risk score has the potential to inform clinical decision-making by identifying high-risk patients and enabling timely intervention.

### Predictors and impact of prolonged vasoplegia after continuous-flow left ventricular assist device implantation [^114wrwFL]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Vasoplegia (vasoplegic shock) is characterized by high cardiac output with low systemic vascular resistance (SVR), resulting in refractory hypotension. Thought to arise as a severe systemic inflammatory response, vasoplegia is most frequently encountered in patients with sepsis, but it is also common after cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass. Depending on how vasoplegia is defined, its reported incidence ranges from 5% to nearly 50% among patients undergoing heart transplant, general cardiac surgery, or left ventricular assist device implantation. These studies consistently associate vasoplegia with poor outcomes, especially early morbidity and death. Nonetheless, little consensus exists on an appropriate definition of vasoplegia, and the literature is widely heterogeneous regarding risk factors and treatment strategies for vasoplegia in patients undergoing continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD) implantation (Supplemental Table 1).

We conducted a study to characterize vasoplegia in the CF-LVAD population, investigate the impact of vasoplegia on postoperative outcomes, and identify predictors of vasoplegia development. Objective definitions of postoperative vasoplegia were used to more accurately identify the patient cohort. Also, we characterized the duration of vasoplegia by identifying patients with transient vasoplegia and prolonged vasoplegia. We hypothesized that patients who developed vasoplegia, especially prolonged vasoplegia, after CF-LVAD implantation would have more adverse outcomes and poorer survival.

### Predictors and impact of prolonged vasoplegia after continuous-flow left ventricular assist device implantation [^112sXXeL]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Vasoplegia develops after CF-LVAD implantation in almost one-third of cases. Earlier recognition of this occurrence and identification of patients at higher risk for developing vasoplegia, including those with a higher MELD score, elevated BMI, or renal dysfunction, may allow for targeted therapeutic interventions to mitigate patients' risk of developing prolonged postoperative vasoplegia. Further investigation into early administration of aggressive treatments to mitigate the development of prolonged vasoplegia and reduce early mortality rates is warranted. Thoughtful patient selection and preoperative optimization should continue to be a focus.

PERSPECTIVES

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Recognizing risk factors for prolonged vasoplegia can allow earlier identification of higher-risk patients and earlier initiation of therapeutic interventions. Prolonged vasoplegia is strongly associated with the development of AKI. Targeted strategies to reduce renal injury (preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively) are worthwhile.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: This study represents a large series of patients who developed vasoplegia after left ventricular assist device implantation. Earlier identification of patients at higher risk for developing vasoplegia may allow for earlier intervention with pharmacological adjuncts, either preoperatively or intraoperatively, to curb the development of vasoplegia. Future directions include randomized trials using novel vasopressors or other adjuncts before vasoplegia develops to determine if prolonged postoperative vasoplegia can be mitigated.

### Vasoplegia in heart, lung, or liver transplantation: a narrative review [^111Z4eVD]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Vasoplegia is a pathophysiologic state of hypotension in the setting of normal or high cardiac output and low systemic vascular resistance despite euvolemia and high-dose vasoconstrictors. Vasoplegia in heart, lung, or liver transplantation is of particular interest because it is common (approximately 29%, 28%, and 11%, respectively), is associated with adverse outcomes, and because the agents used to treat vasoplegia can affect immunosuppressive and other drug metabolism. This narrative review discusses the pathophysiology, risk factors, and treatment of vasoplegia in patients undergoing heart, lung, and liver transplantation. Vasoplegia in this patient population is associated with acute kidney injury, hospital length of stay, and even survival. The mechanisms of vasoplegia in this patient population likely involve multiple pathways, including nitric oxide synthase, cyclic guanylate cyclase, cytokine release, hydrogen sulfide, adrenal axis abnormalities, and vasopressin deficiency. Contributors to vasoplegia in this population include mechanical circulatory support such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and cardiopulmonary bypass, organ ischemia time, preexisting infection, and medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and excessive sedation. Treatment of vasoplegia in this population begins with conventional catecholamines and vasopressin analogs. Occasionally, agents, including methylene blue, hydroxocobalamin, and angiotensin II, are administered. Though retrospective literature suggests a hemodynamic response to these agents in the transplant population, minimal evidence is available to guide management. In what follows, we discuss the treatment of vasoplegia in the heart, lung, and liver transplant populations based on patient characteristics and potential risk factors associated with non-catecholamine agents.

### Non-adrenergic vasopressors for vasodilatory shock or perioperative vasoplegia: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111tui3j]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Excessive exposure to adrenergic vasopressors may be harmful. Non-adrenergic vasopressors may spare adrenergic agents and potentially improve outcomes. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy of non-adrenergic vasopressors in adult patients receiving vasopressor therapy for vasodilatory shock or perioperative vasoplegia.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for RCTs comparing non-adrenergic vasopressors with adrenergic vasopressors alone or placebo in critically ill or perioperative patients. Each eligible study was categorized into septic shock, cardiac surgery, or non-cardiac surgery. Non-adrenergic vasopressors included vasopressin, terlipressin, selepressin, angiotensin II, methylene blue, and hydroxocobalamin. The primary outcome was mortality at longest follow-up. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis. We registered the protocol in PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42024505039).

Results

Among 51 eligible RCTs totaling 5715 patients, the predominant population was septic shock in 30 studies, cardiac surgery in 11 studies, and non-cardiac surgery in 10 studies. Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials version 2 identified 17 studies as low risk of bias. In septic shock, mortality was significantly lower in the non-adrenergic group (960/2232 [43%] vs. 898/1890 [48%]; risk ratio [RR], 0.92; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.86–0.97; P = 0.03; I² = 0%), with none of the individual non-adrenergic vasopressors showing significant survival benefits. No significant mortality difference was observed in patients undergoing cardiac surgery (34/410 [8.3%] vs. 47/412 [11%]; RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.55–1.22; P = 0.32; I² = 12%) or those undergoing non-cardiac surgery (9/388 [2.3%] vs. 18/383 [4.7%]; RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.31–1.41; P = 0.28; I² = 0%).

Conclusions

Administration of non-adrenergic vasopressors was significantly associated with reduced mortality in patients with septic shock. However, no single agent achieved statistical significance in separate analyses. Although the pooled effects of non-adrenergic vasopressors on survival did not reach statistical significance in patients undergoing cardiac or non-cardiac surgery, the confidence intervals included the possibility of both no effect and a clinically important benefit from non-adrenergic agents. These findings justify the conduct of further RCTs comparing non-adrenergic vasopressors to usual care based on noradrenaline alone.

### Selecting a vasopressor drug for vasoplegic shock after adult cardiac surgery: a systematic literature review [^111tsWP3]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

The choice of vasopressors to treat vasodilatory shock after cardiac surgery is a matter of controversy. We have systematically reviewed the literature and found that the data are insufficient to guide choice of agent. However, we found sufficient evidence that when a target blood pressure can not be achieved with a single agent, addition of another is more likely to help achieve the blood pressure target. We also found that there is no evidence that vasopressors induce organ ischemia. Finally, the lack of high quality data indicate that large multicenter trials are needed in this field.

### Vasoplegic syndrome following cardiothoracic surgery-review of pathophysiology and update of treatment options [^113hdXk4]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Vasoplegic syndrome is a common occurrence following cardiothoracic surgery and is characterized as a high-output shock state with poor systemic vascular resistance. The pathophysiology is complex and includes dysregulation of vasodilatory and vasoconstrictive properties of smooth vascular muscle cells. Specific bypass machine and patient factors play key roles in occurrence. Research into treatment of this syndrome is limited and extrapolated primarily from that pertaining to septic shock, but is evolving with the expanded use of catecholamine-sparing agents. Recent reports demonstrate potential benefit in novel treatment options, but large clinical trials are needed to confirm.

### Vasoplegia after implantation of a continuous flow left ventricular assist device: incidence, outcomes and predictors [^113bY58H]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Vasoplegia is characterized by severe hypotension due to lack in vasomotor tone refractory to catecholamine therapy. It occurs frequently after routine cardiac surgery (up to 27%) and is associated with severe postoperative complications and increased mortality. Vasoplegia is even more prevalent after advanced surgical treatment of heart failure. The incidence of vasoplegia after heart transplantation (HTx) ranged between 8.8 and 54%, depending on the definition used, and 42% after pulsatile left ventricular assist device (pLVAD) implantation. Less is known regarding vasoplegia after insertion of the newer generation of continuous flow LVADs (cfLVAD).

Published definitions for vasoplegia post-cardiac surgery vary markedly and include different hemodynamic parameters, vasoactive drugs, patient groups and variable observed time periods, which may lead to differences in reported incidences and associations with relevant clinical outcomes. Careful analysis of these definitions reveals that their application to the cfLVAD population is limited. Better identification of patients suffering from vasoplegia in this population and a better prediction of this critical condition might lead to improved optimization and result in improved outcomes. Therefore, for this specific patient population an appropriate and more unified definition taking into consideration high vasopressor requirements to maintain normal SVR and an extension of the time frame to the first 48 postoperative hours seems required.

As the newer generation of cfLVADs appears to improve postoperative survival, we hypothesized that their implantation might be associated with a reduced incidence of vasoplegia, contributing to a better clinical course especially in the early postoperative period compared to older generations of LVADs, such as pLVADs.

Based on these considerations, the first aim of the study was to uncover the incidence of vasoplegia using the unified definition and to compare this incidence to incidences obtained with three previously published definitions. In addition, we set out to define the association of vasoplegia with several clinical outcomes including mortality, and to identify independent preoperative predictors of vasoplegia.

### Should the norepinephrine maximal dosage rate be greatly increased in late shock? [^115yDAnt]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Any advanced shock eventually degenerates into vasoplegia, which responds weakly to vasopressors. The highest reported norepinephrine flow rate is 3μg/kg/min. We present the case of a young explosion victim, who was transferred in late haemorrhagic shock. Apart from usual treatment (hydration, mass transfusion protocol), single-agent norepinephrine was used to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of > 60–65mmHg. For several hours, norepinephrine flow was 7–10 times the aforementioned (highest reported) in order to achieve our goal; during which, further hydration or transfusion would not contribute to MAP elevation. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) severity score was 18 (expected mortality > 99%). The patient survived without underperfusion-related damage. We conclude that norepinephrine dosages could potentially be greatly increased in late shock. We must resist giving up flow escalation based on its numerical value.

### Vasoplegic syndrome following cardiothoracic surgery-review of pathophysiology and update of treatment options [^115r1N6U]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Approach to treatment

Currently, there are no data supporting one non-catecholamine therapy over the others. A balanced approach in the management of vasoplegic syndrome may be optimal, allowing for lower doses of both catecholamine and non-catecholamine therapies so as to avoid the dangers of toxicity. Current Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) guidelines refrain from addressing the treatment of vasoplegic syndrome, though there is a consensus statement recommending judicious use of epinephrine in post-surgical arrest. Of relevance, the authors of this consensus statement argue against excessive epinephrine so as to avoid hypertension, a concept not totally unrelated to the idea of catecholamine sparing. Based on the best available evidence, vasopressin may be considered as a first-line non-catecholamine agent in combination with catecholamines. While evidence is equivocal regarding the blood pressure effect of vitamin C, thiamine, and steroids, these agents should be considered when two or more vasopressors are required to maintain adequate perfusion pressures, considering the potential benefit and low risk associated with these therapies. The initiation of additional therapies is appropriate when perfusion goals cannot be met with norepinephrine and vasopressin alone. Attempts have been made to protocolize the approach to treatment of vasoplegia. Such algorithms highlight an emerging consensus regarding the dangers of excessive catecholamine use and feature lower doses of catecholamines as well as various non-catecholamine vasopressors. Whether this would lead to improved outcomes is to be determined. Because of the number of options available, protocols can become complicated, especially when including dose and titration recommendations, which anecdotally has been problematic vis-a-vis multiple titratable options. Importantly, no standard of care exists regarding the norepinephrine doses at which initiation of non-catecholamine therapy should begin. In a protocol by Ortoleva et al. non-catecholamine therapy is recommended to begin at norepinephrine doses of 0.5 μg/kg/min, which has been associated, at least in the distributive shock population, with an unacceptable level of mortality.

### Predictors and clinical outcomes of vasoplegia in patients bridged to heart transplantation with continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices [^117CSmcC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

For the first time, given the increasing numbers and complexity of LVAD recipients listed for HT, we sought to investigate whether there might be unique predictors of vasoplegia after HT that can be related specifically to LVAD bridging and to examine both short‐ and long‐term outcomes among this population. We hypothesized that the development of vasoplegia following HT is common after bridging with an LVAD and that it is associated with increased short‐ and long‐term morbidity and mortality. Consequently, identifying predictors of vasoplegia in this population can be clinically meaningful.

### Vasoplegia after implantation of a continuous flow left ventricular assist device: incidence, outcomes and predictors [^114zjxSU]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study has comprehensively evaluated the most commonly used vasoplegia definitions and explored a new unified definition for the special conditions of cfLVAD implantation. Using the unified definition, vasoplegia remains a prevalent (33%) and clinically important condition, that was associated with important adverse clinical outcomes, such as renal failure, reinterventions, prolonged ICU-LOS, increased ICU mortality and a diminished survival over time. Previous cardiothoracic surgery, preoperative treatment with dopamine, preoperative bilirubin levels and preoperative creatinine clearance appear as independent predictors of postoperative vasoplegia with a good discriminative ability.

### Hydroxocobalamin for vasoplegia in cardiac surgery: a retrospective cohort analysis [^116zAD6A]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Vasoplegia during cardiac surgery is common and associated with perioperative mortality. Hydroxocobalamin is a catecholamine-sparing approach for treating vasoplegia. However, there is currently limited evidence to inform its use.

Methods

We conducted a single-centre retrospective propensity-matched cohort study of patients who developed vasoplegia after cardiopulmonary bypass. Our primary outcome was vasopressor requirement, expressed as norepinephrine equivalents (NEE), at 1, 4, 24, and 48 h after treatment. Our secondary outcome was a collapsed composite of in-hospital complications comprising stroke, sternal wound infection, mesenteric ischaemia, renal failure, and death.

Results

We identified 2727 (11%) patients with vasoplegia from 2018 to 2024. The final analysis cohort included 229 matched pairs. Hydroxocobalamin administration was associated with a significant reduction in median NEE infusion rates of -0.04 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.07 to -0.02; P = 0.008) μg kg -1 min -1 at 1 h, -0.05 (95% CI: -0.07 to -0.02; P < 0.001) μg kg -1 min -1 at 4 h, and -0.04 (95% CI: -0.06 to -0.02; P = 0.004) μg kg -1 min -1 at 24 h, but not at 48 h, -0.02 (95% CI: -0.05 to 0.0; P = 0.220) μg kg -1 min -1. Over the initial 24 h, hydroxocobalamin reduced NEE by 14% compared with the reference group. The risk of in-hospital complications was similar in each group (odds ratio: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.74–1.54; P = 0.745).

Conclusions

Hydroxocobalamin administration was associated with reduced vasopressor requirement over 24 h, but not thereafter. Robust trials are needed to determine whether this relationship is causal, and whether a reduction in vasopressor use improves substantive clinical outcomes.

### Non-adrenergic vasopressors for vasodilatory shock or perioperative vasoplegia: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111UEvgU]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

The strengths of this meta-analysis include the pre-registered protocol, a statistical analysis which accounted for clinical heterogeneity, and comprehensive approach regarding non-adrenergic vasopressor types and clinical indications.

We acknowledge several limitations. First, we aggregated data of studies using different non-adrenergic agents and comparators. Furthermore, there was considerable heterogeneity in the way non-adrenergic agents were initiated, titrated, weaned, and terminated among the included studies. However, we performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate their impacts on the effect size. Moreover, it was reassuring that none of the sensitivity analyses found an increased mortality risk in the non-adrenergic vasopressor group. Second, mortality was reported at different time points. As a previous work showed that this approach does not affect the overall treatment effects in critical care settings, we synthesized mortality data at different time points. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis based on the timing found consistent results with the main analysis. Third, only one-third of the included studies were judged to be at low risk of bias or published in well-recognized journals. As a result, sensitivity analyses focused on such high-quality studies or studies published in high-impact journals did not find a statistically significant mortality reduction in any setting assessed. Nonetheless, the point estimates were similar to the overall results, suggesting potential positive effects on survival. Fourth, there is intense debate on whether nitric oxide scavengers are considered vasopressors or not. However, these agents have gained growing attention as a rescue therapy in refractory vasodilatory shock. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses assessing these agents separately or excluding them confirmed the findings of the main analysis, suggesting that our findings are likely robust. Fifth, standard of care outside use of vasopressors was not always well-defined. However, thanks to the randomized design, it seems plausible to assume that both groups were balanced regarding care outside the intervention of interest and that this limitation had little influence on the estimated effects. Sixth, the publication year of the included studies spanned 25 years. Complete data extraction was not always feasible in old studies. Standard intensive care may change over time. However, a sensitivity analysis according to the publication year did not find heterogeneity in effects on mortality. Finally, most studies failed to clarify which noradrenaline formulation was used and whether they reported the dose of noradrenaline base, which could result in inconsistent dosage comparison. Future trials should use a uniform dose reporting with noradrenaline base.

### Vasoplegia after implantation of a continuous flow left ventricular assist device: incidence, outcomes and predictors [^112uDkkX]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Vasoplegia after routine cardiac surgery is associated with severe postoperative complications and increased mortality. It is also prevalent in patients undergoing implantation of pulsatile flow left ventricular assist devices (LVAD). However, less is known regarding vasoplegia after implantation of newer generations of continuous flow LVADs (cfLVAD). We aim to report the incidence, impact on outcome and predictors of vasoplegia in these patients.

Methods

Adult patients scheduled for primary cfLVAD implantation were enrolled into a derivation cohort (n = 118, 2006–2013) and a temporal validation cohort (n = 73, 2014–2016). Vasoplegia was defined taking into consideration low mean arterial pressure and/or low systemic vascular resistance, preserved cardiac index and high vasopressor support. Vasoplegia was considered after bypass and the first 48h of ICU stay lasting at least three consecutive hours. This concept of vasoplegia was compared to older definitions reported in the literature in terms of the incidence of postoperative vasoplegia and its association with adverse outcomes. Logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors. Their ability to discriminate patients with vasoplegia was quantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

Results

The incidence of vasoplegia was 33.1% using the unified definition of vasoplegia. Vasoplegia was associated with increased ICU length-of-stay (10.5 [6.9–20.8] vs 6.1 [4.6–10.4] p = 0.002), increased ICU-mortality (OR 5.8, 95% CI 1.9–18.2) and one-year-mortality (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.5–10.2), and a higher incidence of renal failure (OR 4.3, 95% CI 1.8–10.4). Multivariable analysis identified previous cardiothoracic surgery, preoperative dopamine administration, preoperative bilirubin levels and preoperative creatinine clearance as independent preoperative predictors of vasoplegia. The resultant prediction model exhibited a good discriminative ability (AUC 0.80, 95% CI 0.71–0.89, p < 0.01). Temporal validation resulted in an AUC of 0.74 (95% CI 0.61–0.87, p < 0.01).

Conclusions

In the era of the new generation of cfLVADs, vasoplegia remains a prevalent (33%) and critical condition with worse short-term outcomes and survival. We identified previous cardiothoracic surgery, preoperative treatment with dopamine, preoperative bilirubin levels and preoperative creatinine clearance as independent predictors.

### Mixed cardiogenic-vasodilatory shock: current insights and future directions [^113BMDvm]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiogenic-vasodilatory shock

Definition

Patients with cardiogenic-vasodilatory shock have a primary cardiac disease process resulting in low CO and prototypical CS, and then subsequently develop inappropriately low vascular tone resulting in mixed shock. The defining criterion of this group is the initial development of pure CS with later development of vasodilation and mixed shock, recognizing that patients may present late to medical care with established mixed shock. Inappropriate vasodilation causing cardiogenic-vasodilatory shock counteracts the compensatory neurohormonal response and therapeutic response to vasopressors resulting in a maladaptive reduction in SVR and progressive hypotension in CS. The development of inappropriate vasodilation often represents an inflection point in the clinical course of CS, with delayed clinical worsening and initiation of the downward spiral which will progress to refractory shock with poor outcome if not addressed promptly. The greater the severity of CS, the more likely that mixed shock is present (particularly in refractory Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions stage E CS).,

Potential etiologies

Any condition causing CS can potentially evolve into mixed cardiogenic-vasodilatory shock from intercurrent infection or through noninfectious inflammatory disease mechanisms potentially aggravated by vasodilatory effects of medications. AMI serves as a prototypical example whereby acute myocardial injury causes pump failure and triggers a systemic inflammatory response provoking vasoplegia. Mirroring the overall epidemiology of CS, AMI and decompensated heart failure are the usual causes of mixed cardiogenic-vasodilatory shock. Acute myocarditis may present with an initial low-output state, but if excessive systemic inflammation occurs then cardiogenic-vasodilatory shock can occur, providing a clear link between inflammation and simultaneous cardiac and vascular dysfunction which may overlap with primary mixed shock.

### Definitions and pathophysiology of vasoplegic shock [^112CZi33]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Non-cardiac surgery

Hypotension due to vasodilatation in patients following major non-cardiac surgery is usually manifest as requirement for vasopressors to maintain an adequate MAP following appropriate resuscitation to restore euvolaemia, and its incidence is seldom reported. Reported risk factors include prolonged surgery and significant requirement for blood transfusion. Where postoperative admission to a critical care environment is routine, the use of vasopressors in the postoperative period to support blood pressure following optimisation of fluid status is commonplace. Although vasopressors may be required to counteract the systemic vasodilatory effects of neuraxial blockade, such as epidural analgesia, where requirements are significant in an adequately resuscitated patient then this should be considered to be vasoplegia.

Burns, trauma and pancreatitis

These are conditions united by significant tissue injury, with consequent hypermetabolism, systemic inflammation and predisposition to developing organ dysfunction. Vasoplegia could be considered to be one such organ dysfunction, and is a recognised complication of polytrauma, burns and, even in the absence of infection, severe pancreatitis — where vasoplegia is associated with adverse outcome.

### The clinical conundrum of vasoplegia with mechanical circulatory support devices [^113bsK2F]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

The recognition of damaging effects of cardiopulmonary bypass, known as "postperfusion syndrome", marked a significant early milestone in cardiac surgery. Evidence surfaced, suggesting systemic inflammation, coagulopathy, hemolysis, multisystem organ failure, and vasoconstriction as notable consequences, each leading to deleterious outcomes. However, a distinct syndrome began to emerge in the early 1990s, characterized by preserved cardiac output, low to normal filling pressures, and systemic hypotension unresponsive to fluid resuscitation. This syndrome, different from postperfusion syndrome, manifested as intense vasodilation, tissue hypoperfusion, and cellular dysfunction. Vasoplegia, as it came to be known, demanded high doses of catecholamines for correcting the low systemic vascular resistance and was often accompanied by oliguria, metabolic acidosis, and a high mortality rate. Progress in understanding the pathophysiology of this entity came through elucidating vasomotor tone determinants, endothelial dysfunction, and neurohormonal regulation in vascular homeostasis. Experimental models, such as endotoxin-induced shock in animals, shed light on inflammatory pathways and cytokine cascades implicated in vasoplegia. Its multifactorial underpinnings included oxidative stress-related endothelial dysfunction, dysregulation in renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and endothelin, upregulation of adenosine, nitric oxide (NO), cyclic guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate, increases in prostacyclin, and vasopressin deficiency.

### Predictors and clinical outcomes of vasoplegia in patients bridged to heart transplantation with continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices [^115BSJdR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients with and without vasoplegia following HT had similar 30‐day mortality rates. This finding can be explained by better LVAD and HT candidate selection; hemodynamic stabilization of critically ill patients with temporary and permanent MCS; improved postoperative course and survival with continuous‐flow LVADs compared with pulsatile devices; and, most important, earlier recognition and more effective management of vasoplegia after HT. Consistent with our observation, a retrospective single‐center study involving 240 HT recipients has shown that vasoplegia was associated with longer ICU stay but similar short‐term mortality in patients without PGD. 23 Because PGD and vasoplegia share common risk factors and pathogenic mechanisms, the occurrence of both conditions in some HT recipients portends adverse short outcomes. In the absence of PGD, the effects of vasoplegia on in‐hospital outcomes may be less deleterious. 23 However, prolonged intubation and increased requirements for administration of intravascular volume can adversely affect right ventricular function, worsen renal function, and prolong hospital stay of vasoplegic patients. Despite these explanations, because early splitting of the Kaplan–Meier curves was noted between vasoplegic and nonvasoplegic patients, it is likely that we were underpowered to find significant differences in mortality between groups given the small number of events that occurred during the first 30 days after HT. Consequently, adequately powered multicenter studies are needed to evaluate differences in short‐term mortality risk in association with development of vasoplegia following HT.

Accumulating evidence from prospective randomized blinded clinical trials and a meta‐analysis of these trials 24, 25 suggests that administration of vasopressin or a combination of vasopressin with catecholamines is associated with lower rates of atrial fibrillation 24, 25 and, in some studies, mortality 24 compared with administration of norepinephrine alone. In refractory vasoplegia cases, a single dose of intravenous methylene blue can improve SVR by reducing vascular response to nitric oxide. 26 However, its efficacy has not been validated in prospective randomized clinical trials. Adoption of minimally invasive surgical techniques (eg, left thoracotomy) may decrease incidence of right ventricular failure after LVAD implantation, 27 and the use of minimally invasive techniques in BTT LVAD patients may decrease CPB time, bleeding, and blood‐product requirement after sternotomy for HT. Other strategies to restore vascular function in refractory cases include corticosteroids, angiotensin II, vitamin B12, and prothrombin complex concentrate, 4 but their effects on perioperative outcomes have not been well studied.

### Vasoplegia after surgical left ventricular restoration: 2-year follow-up [^114shKRK]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Vasoplegia is a severe complication that can develop after surgical procedures for heart failure. The current study evaluated the effect of vasoplegia on survival, cardiac function, and renal function 2 years after surgical left ventricular restoration (SVR).

Methods

Heart failure patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 0.35 or less who underwent SVR in 2006 to 2014 were included. Vasoplegia was defined as the continuous need of vasopressors (norepinephrine ≥ 0.2 μg · kg -1 · min -1 or terlipressin [any dose], or both) combined with a cardiac index of 2.2 L · min -1 · m -2 or higher for at least 12 consecutive hours, starting within the first 3 days postoperatively. The effect of vasoplegia on mortality, New York Heart Association Functional Classification, LVEF, and creatinine clearance was assessed up to 2 years of follow-up.

Results

SVR was performed in 113 patients (80% men), aged 62 ± 10 years, and with an LVEF of 0.25 ± 0.06. Postoperative vasoplegia developed in 23%. Survival was lower in patients with vasoplegia compared with patients without vasoplegia at 6 months (62% vs 90%, p = 0.001) and at 2 years (50% versus 84%, p < 0.001). At the 2-year follow-up, New York Heart Association class and LVEF had improved and were similar in both groups (respectively, p = 0.319 and p = 0.444). Creatinine clearance was lower in patients with vasoplegia compared with patients without vasoplegia 2 years postoperatively (p < 0.001), even after correcting for baseline creatinine clearance (p = 0.009).

Conclusions

Vasoplegia after SVR is associated with decreased survival. Despite an improved and similar cardiac function, renal function was compromised in vasoplegic patients at the 2-year follow-up.

### Vasoplegic syndrome following cardiothoracic surgery-review of pathophysiology and update of treatment options [^113hBNAL]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

The authors' approach to vasoplegia is presented as Fig. 2. Non-catecholamine agents should be started at lower doses of catecholamines (0.1 mcg/kg/min), with the first-line non-catecholamine agent being vasopressin, followed by methylene blue. Thereafter, hydroxocobalamin and/or angiotensin II should be used once catecholamine doses reach 0.2 μg/kg/min. Care should be taken to identify potential risk factors for intolerance or adverse reaction, and avoidance or discontinuation of the offending agent should be made accordingly.

Fig. 2
An approach to the treatment of vasoplegia. Non-catecholamine agents should be started at low doses, followed by non-catecholamine agents, including vasopressin and methylene blue. Use of hydroxocobalamin and/or angiotensin II should be considered with increasing doses of catecholamines. Clinical judgment should guide avoidance of certain agents if there is undue risk of side effects. All agents can be associated with intolerance, and discontinuation of offending agent(s) should be made accordingly

Additionally, the response to each agent should be evaluated, with discontinuation of any agent which yields an ineffective response (such as lack of an increase in MAP or a concomitant up-titration of other agents). Finally, attention should be paid to titration of adjustable agents, so as to avoid excessive or prolonged use. A titration table is presented as Table 2.

### Vasoplegia during cardiopulmonary bypass: current literature and rescue therapy options [^114ZqXwF]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Vasoplegia syndrome in the cardiac surgical intensive care unit and postoperative period has been an area of interest to clinicians because of its prevalence and effects on morbidity and mortality. However, there is a paucity of evidence regarding the treatment of vasoplegia syndrome during cardiopulmonary bypass (on-CPB VS). This review aims to detail the incidence, outcomes, and possible treatment options for patients who develop vasoplegia during bypass. The pharmacologic rescue agents discussed are used in cases in which vasoplegia during CPB is refractory to standard catecholamine agents, such as norepinephrine, epinephrine, and phenylephrine. Methods to improve vasoplegia during CPB can be both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic. In particular, optimization of CPB parameters plays an important nonpharmacologic role in vasoplegia during CPB. Pharmacologic agents that have been demonstrated as being effective in vasoplegia include vasopressin, terlipressin, methylene blue, hydroxocobalamin, angiotensin II (Giapreza), vitamin C, flurbiprofen (Ropion), and hydrocortisone. Although these agents have not been specifically evaluated for vasoplegia during CPB, they have shown signs of effectiveness for vasoplegia postoperatively to varying degrees. Understanding the evidence for, dosing, and side effects of these agents is crucial for cardiac anesthesiologists when treating vasoplegia during CPB bypass.

### Predictors and impact of prolonged vasoplegia after continuous-flow left ventricular assist device implantation [^114gD1my]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Vasoplegia after cardiac surgery is associated with adverse outcomes. However, the clinical effects of vasoplegia and the significance of its duration after continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD) implantation are less known.

Objectives

This study aimed to identify predictors of and outcomes from transient vs prolonged vasoplegia after CF-LVAD implantation.

Methods

The study was a retrospective review of consecutive patients who underwent CF-LVAD implantation between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2017. Vasoplegia was defined as the presence of all of the following: mean arterial pressure ≤ 65 mm Hg, vasopressor (epinephrine, norepinephrine, vasopressin, or dopamine) use for > 6 hours within the first 24 hours postoperatively, cardiac index ≥ 2.2 L/min/m 2 and systemic vascular resistance < 800 dyne/s/cm 5, and vasodilatory shock not attributable to other causes. Prolonged vasoplegia was defined as that lasting 12 to 24 hours; transient vasoplegia was that lasting 6 to < 12 hours. Patient characteristics, outcomes, and risk factors were analyzed.

Results

Of the 600 patients who underwent CF-LVAD implantation during the study period, 182 (30.3%) developed vasoplegia. Mean patient age was similar between the vasoplegia and no-vasoplegia groups. Prolonged vasoplegia (n = 78; 13.0%), compared with transient vasoplegia (n = 104; 17.3%), was associated with greater 30-day mortality (16.7% vs 5.8%; P = 0.02). Risk factors for prolonged vasoplegia included preoperative dialysis and elevated body mass index.

Conclusions

Compared with vasoplegia overall, prolonged vasoplegia was associated with worse survival after CF-LVAD implantation. Treatment to avoid or minimize progression to prolonged vasoplegia may be warranted.

### Non-adrenergic vasopressors for vasodilatory shock or perioperative vasoplegia: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115YHT4F]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Key findings

In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 51 RCTs, we evaluated the effects of non-adrenergic vasopressors on clinical outcomes in three distinct populations. The use of non-adrenergic agents was associated with a reduced mortality risk in patients with septic shock. It was also associated with reduced RRT use and occurrence of atrial fibrillation both in patients with septic shock and in those undergoing cardiac surgery. Moreover, we observed shortened ICU and hospital stays in cardiac surgery settings. Finally, noradrenaline dose was decreased across all three settings.

Relationship with previous literature

To our knowledge, this systematic review is the most updated and comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy of non-adrenergic vasopressors in various etiologies. Unlike previous meta-analyses confined to specific vasopressors (vasopressin and its analogues, angiotensin II, or methylene blue) and specific populations (septic shock, septic shock and cardiac surgery, cardiac surgery, or any surgery), our review included all non-adrenergic agents available in three different settings (septic shock, cardiac surgery, and non-cardiac surgery). This inclusive approach increased the number of studies and sample size, while maintaining separate analyses according to study populations to take into account the heterogeneity of treatment effects in different settings.

Mortality

In patients with septic shock, we observed a mortality reduction, which was mainly driven by vasopressin and methylene blue. This finding aligns with previous meta-analyses. However, it should be noted that such significant mortality reduction was not confirmed when each non-adrenergic agent was analyzed separately. On the other hand, in cardiac and non-cardiac settings, similar to previous meta-analyses in surgical settings, mortality differences did not reach statistical significance. Nevertheless, the overall analysis and the vast majority of sensitivity analyses across three different populations found a pooled RR < 1 for mortality.

### Outcomes and risk factors in vasoplegic patients following left ventricular assist device implantation [^116YgFFJ]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe vasoplegia incidence, management strategies, and factors associated with vasoplegia in a HeartMate left ventricular assist device (LVAD) patient population.

Design

A retrospective, observational study was performed. The primary outcome was the incidence of vasoplegia (persistent hypotension requiring > 0.2 μg/kg/min norepinephrine equivalent for > 6 hours) following LVAD implantation. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine factors associated with the development of vasoplegia. A subgroup analysis was performed to compare patients who received and did not receive preoperative renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors to evaluate their impact on postoperative vasoplegia.

Setting

A single-center, quaternary care academic medical center.

Participants

Adult patients (N = 184) who will undergo LVAD implantation from 2019 to 2022.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

The incidence of vasoplegia was 33%. In patients who developed vasoplegia, the median maximum dosage of vasopressors was 0.28 μg/kg/min (0.24–0.34) norepinephrine equivalents with a median duration of 30 hours (18–50) on vasopressors. Mean arterial pressure immediately before the operating room (OR 0.961), duration on cardiopulmonary bypass (OR 1.012), preoperative renal dysfunction (OR 3.185), and postoperative inotrope use (OR 4.857) were independently associated with risk of vasoplegia based on multivariable logistic regression analysis. No differences in rates of vasoplegia were observed based on receipt of preoperative renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors. No mortality differences were observed between patients who did versus did not develop vasoplegia.

Conclusions

Vasoplegia following LVAD implantation is a common postoperative complication. Longer duration on cardiopulmonary bypass, preoperative renal dysfunction, and postoperative inotrope use following LVAD implantation were associated with an increased risk of developing postoperative vasoplegia.

### Definitions and pathophysiology of vasoplegic shock [^115sTZ3Y]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of vasoplegia

Normal physiology

SVR is determined by changes in arteriolar diameter, controlled by the contractile activity of the vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in the tunica media. The contractile state of the VSMC is referred to as the vascular 'tone' and is regulated through intracellular calcium (Ca 2+) concentration. VSMC contraction is driven by a rise in cytosolic Ca 2+ concentration through release of stored Ca 2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum as well as extracellular Ca 2+ influx through voltage-sensitive channels. Relaxation of the VSMC is driven by a fall in cytosolic Ca 2+, due to uptake of Ca 2+ by the sarcoplasmic reticulum and expulsion of potassium (K +) or Ca 2+ (via K + channels and Ca 2+ -ATPase pumps) into the extracellular space, resulting in cellular hyperpolarisation and vasodilation. Vascular tone is therefore dependent on the rate of Ca 2+ influx versus removal, which in turn is regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. Intrinsic regulators include:
i.e.ndothelial secretions (nitric oxide, prostacyclin, endothelin)
ii. vasoactive metabolites (acidosis, hypoxia, hydrogen peroxide)
iii. autacoids (serotonin, prostaglandins, thromboxane A 2)

Extrinsic regulation is largely mediated by sympathetic neural control and vasoactive hormones, which include adrenaline, angiotensin II and vasopressin.

### Relation of vasoplegia in the absence of primary graft dysfunction to mortality following cardiac transplantation [^112URaDK]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Vasoplegia following cardiac transplantation is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Previous studies have not accounted for primary graft dysfunction (PGD). The definition of vasoplegia is based on pressor requirement at 48 hours, many PGD parameters may have normalized after the initial 24 hours on inotropes. We surmised that the purported negative effects of vasoplegia following transplantation may in part be driven by PGD. We reviewed 240 consecutive adult cardiac transplants at our center between 2012 and 2016. The severity of vasoplegia was evaluated as a risk factor for 1-year survival, and the analysis was repeated for the subgroup of 177 patients who did not develop PGD. Overall, 63 (26%) of patients developed mild, moderate, or severe PGD. In those without PGD, vasoplegia was associated with length of stay but not with short- or long-term mortality. Moderate and/or severe vasoplegia occurred in 35 (15%) patients and was associated with higher short-term mortality, length of stay, and PGD. Multivariate logistic regression identified body mass index ≥ 35 kg/m 2, left ventricular assist device before transplantation, and use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as joint risk factors for vasoplegia. In patients without PGD, only left ventricular assist device before transplantation was associated with vasoplegia. In conclusion, our results show that, in the sizeable subgroup of patients with no signs of PGD, vasoplegia had a much more modest impact on post-transplant morbidity and no significant effect on 1- and 3-year survival. This suggests that PGD may be a confounder when assessing vasoplegia as a risk factor for adverse outcomes.

### Characterizing predictors and severity of vasoplegia syndrome after heart transplantation [^112bhuk5]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Vasoplegia is characterized as a severe vasodilatory shock after cardiac surgery, and can be associated with substantial morbidity. Increased systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, often related to prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass times, anesthesia, or mechanical circulatory support have been shown to be associated with the development of vasoplegia. We sought to identify risk factors and the impact of various degrees of vasoplegia after heart transplantation.

Methods

A retrospective review was conducted of 244 consecutive patients who underwent heart transplantation over a 3-year period. Patients were divided into three groups: no vasoplegia, mild vasoplegia (requiring one vasopressor), and moderate/severe vasoplegia (more than two vasopressors). One-year survival, freedom from rejection, and postoperative complication rates were assessed. Risk factors for vasoplegia subgroups were retrospectively identified.

Results

Vasoplegia syndrome was observed in 34.3% of patients after heart transplantation (mild, 74.1%; moderate/severe, 25.9%). Cardiopulmonary bypass time was significantly longer and pretransplant creatinine was significantly higher in the moderate/severe vasoplegia group. There was a strong trend toward greater use of mechanical circulatory support among moderate/severe vasoplegia patients compared with mild and no vasoplegia patients. After heart transplantation, 1-year survival, freedom from rejection, and need for hemodialysis were not significantly different between groups.

Conclusions

Vasoplegia syndrome is common after heart transplantation. Risk factors for increased severity include longer cardiopulmonary bypass times and elevated preoperative creatinine. Although higher rates of mortality or graft rejection were not detected, vasoplegia was associated with prolonged intubation, greater blood product usage, and lengthened hospital stay. Further studies involving larger cohorts are warranted.

Non-adrenergic vasopressors were associated with reduced risk of RRT (4 studies; RR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.48; I² = 0%), shortened days of ICU stay (6 studies; MD, − 0.66 days; 95% CI, − 1.22 to − 0.11; I² = 73%), shortened days of hospital stay (4 studies; MD, − 1.83 days; 95% CI, − 3.57 to − 0.09; I² = 86%), reduced risk of atrial fibrillation (6 studies; RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.87; I² = 0%), increased vasopressor-free days (3 studies; MD, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.42; I² = 0%), and reduced dose of noradrenaline (4 studies; SMD, − 2.24; 95% CI, − 3.90 to − 0.59; I² = 95%). No significant difference was observed in days of mechanical ventilation (Table 4, Figs. S16 – S22).

### Vasoplegia after implantation of a continuous flow left ventricular assist device: incidence, outcomes and predictors [^1128pXEX]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Justification of proposed definition

To comprehensively address the issue of vasoplegia, we applied three previous definitions used in various fields of cardiac surgery. We found that these definitions are based on different (cut-off values of) hemodynamic parameters at different time frames after surgery and consequently identified completely different patients as being vasoplegic. The definitions have major limitations in the setting of cfLVAD implantation. Argenziano's definition used a liberal MAP threshold measured 5 min after weaning from CPB. However, the immediate post-CPB period is characterized by rapid hemodynamic changes due to optimizing pump speed, changing ventricular geometry, adjusting inotropic support based on CO and RV function, and dynamic alterations in RV and LV preload following administration of fluids and/or blood products and protamine. The Levin's criteria include the requirement for very low CVP < 5 mmHg. This is problematic in the end stage heart failure patients due to ventricular interdependence, biventricular failure, tricuspid regurgitation, and the clinical need of adequate RV preload to fulfil adequate preload of the cfLVAD. Specifically, our study shows that almost all cfLVAD patients exhibit higher CVPs at all stages during their ICU stay. Our conclusion therefore is that the Levin definition is not suitable for the special situation of cfLVAD implantation to define vasoplegia. Moreover, both Argenziano and Levin stratified patients using a single snap shot of clinical conditions excluding late onset vasoplegia in the ICU. In contrast, Patarroyo included less stringent hemodynamic values, more stringent vasoactive drug requirements, but excluded early onset vasoplegia.

For these crucial reasons, we developed and proposed a unified definition to capture vasoplegic patients in the full postoperative period after cfLVAD implantation. We aimed at capturing those patients who had very low MAP and/or low SVR (identical to Levin and Patarroyo, but more stringent than Argenziano) in the setting of normal cfLVAD flow, requiring higher vasoconstrictor treatment. On this point of vasoconstrictor treatment, our unified definition is more stringent than Argenziano and Levin, but less stringent than Patarroyo, who included at least two high dose vasoconstrictors.

A role for genomics and pharmacogenomics?

Pharmacogenomics could be applied to enhance efficacy and safety of drugs used for sepsis and septic shock, including norepinephrine, epinephrine, vasopressin, and corticosteroids, since known genomic variants intersect with these drugs. For example, Nakada et al. demonstrated that β 2 adrenergic receptor gene polymorphism was associated with altered responses to adrenergic agonists and mortality in septic shock. Nevertheless, the variant was only present in 5 to 7% of the population, thereby rendering the elaboration of a specific test hazardous and likely very expensive.

### Vasoplegia after implantation of a continuous flow left ventricular assist device: incidence, outcomes and predictors [^111JRAvd]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Incidence of vasoplegia after cfLVAD implantation

According to our unified definition, one-third of the patients were vasoplegic. Applying the Argenziano definition to our study allowed direct comparison of early post bypass vasoplegia between the first generation LVAD implantation (Argenziano study) and the new generation of cfLVAD surgery (our current study). In such comparison, it appears that the insertion of the newer generation of cfLVADs is associated with a lower incidence of vasoplegia (24%) compared to vasoplegia after pLVAD implantation (42%). Moreover, it is remarkable that the incidence of vasoplegia after cfLVAD insertion is higher compared to the incidence of vasoplegia after routine cardiac surgery and HTx.

Vasoplegia and postoperative outcomes

While our study supports the recognition of improved outcomes after cfLVAD implantation compared to pLVADs, it clearly demonstrates that vasoplegia and its sequelae are associated with postoperative outcomes representing an importantly increased risk for mortality. Moreover, nearly all ICU outcomes including renal failure, ICU stay, bleeding/tamponade were higher in vasoplegic patients (unified definition) compared to patients without vasoplegia. Thus, vasoplegia may be one of the most important determinants of the perioperative course and recovery in patients requiring mechanical circulatory support. The exact reasons and (molecular) mechanisms for such inferior outcomes of vasoplegia remain to be fully explored.

### Definitions and pathophysiology of vasoplegic shock [^115448NV]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of vasoplegia: extrinsic regulators

Catecholamine resistance

The development of vasoplegia may also be driven by changes in the efficacy of circulating catecholamines in generating VSMC contraction. Animal models suggest that in later stages of sepsis, alpha-1 adrenoceptor expression falls, resulting in peripheral resistance to norepinephrine. In human studies, the expression of peripheral receptors appears to be related to illness severity, with increased expression in mild disease and reduced expression observed in severe sepsis, suggesting that in patients with vasoplegia, a similar pattern to that observed in rodent models may occur.

Corticosteroid response

Glucocorticoids drive diverse tissue responses in inflammation, including circulating immune cell function and cytokine release. These processes are driven by regulation of a number of intermediate pathways, including inducible NOS-mediated NO synthesis and COX2 activity. In the vasculature, steroid receptors are present in both endothelial and vascular smooth muscle and, under physiological conditions, potentiate the response to circulating catecholamines and angiotensin II. In addition, the rapid cellular actions of steroids can promote increased concentrations of second messengers such as inositol-3-phosphate and cAMP. Limited evidence suggests that critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency may develop in shock states. Causes of this insufficiency include relative insufficiency of the HPA axis, adrenal failure or necrosis, and in some cases peripheral resistance to corticosteroids. These factors may combine to exacerbate vascular dysfunction in shock and provide a mechanism for the proposed benefit of exogenous steroid administration to reduce the severity or duration of vasopressor dependence in septic shock.

Endogenous vasopressin

Vasopressin acts via specific V1 receptors on the VSMC surface to promote increased intracellular calcium via G protein-coupled receptors and phospholipase C, which in turn drives contraction. In septic shock, plasma concentrations of vasopressin increase in the early stages of shock; however, after 24 h levels fall to sub-normal levels, which may be a mechanism for loss of vascular tone. This may be associated with a reduction in peripheral receptor numbers, a phenomenon observed in animal models. In addition, V2 receptors on endothelial cells may provoke vasodilatation via the increased synthesis of NO.

### Non-adrenergic vasopressors for vasodilatory shock or perioperative vasoplegia: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115cTipY]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Secondary outcomes

Use of renal replacement therapy was significantly reduced in septic shock and in cardiac surgery, with a similar point estimate in non-cardiac surgery settings. Such benefits were mainly driven by vasopressin and angiotensin II. The renal protection associated with vasopressin was consistent with a previous meta-analysis and has been attributed to preferential post-glomerular vasoconstriction. Angiotensin II seems to exert its renoprotective effects through its specific vasoconstrictive effects on efferent arterioles, since dilatation of efferent arterioles is a key pathological finding of sepsis-associated AKI. Indeed, angiotensin II therapy might confer survival benefits in refractory vasodilatory shock patients on RRT.

Duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, and hospital stay appeared shortened with non-adrenergic vasopressor administration. Given the increased vasopressor-free days and reduced noradrenaline dose, it is plausible to think that adding a vasopressor with distinct mechanisms of action could restore blood pressure successfully while avoiding some of the complications related to adrenergic vasopressors or preventing excessive fluid administration. These assumptions are supported by the reduction of atrial fibrillation.

Implications for clinical practice and future research

Our meta-analysis implies that the administration of non-adrenergic vasopressors may reduce mortality in patients with septic shock. Since the annual sepsis-related deaths are estimated to be 11 million worldwide, the relative risk reduction of 0.08 would potentially translate into hundreds of thousands of lives saved every year. Moreover, avoidance of RRT and facilitated liberation from mechanical ventilation would not only prevent various complications attributable to such interventions but also save considerable healthcare resources and potentially improve long-term health-related quality of life.

Another important implication is that non-adrenergic vasopressors may reduce arrhythmia risks and noradrenaline dosage across different settings. This observation suggests hemodynamic safety and efficacy for non-adrenergic vasopressor strategy. Moreover, such observations were consistent irrespective of drug type or comparator.

From a research perspective, our meta-analysis implies that phase III clinical trials dedicated to each agent and setting are warranted to draw a definitive answer. Moreover, precision approach is highly needed to identify which patient subgroups would most benefit from a non-adrenergic vasopressor. For example, hyperreninemia might identify patients in whom angiotensin II might increase the chance of survival. Such personalized vasopressor therapy, rather than a one-size-fits-all strategy, should also be evaluated in future RCTs. Furthermore, cost-effectiveness analysis would help decision making in countries where non-adrenergic agents are considered too expensive or in resource-limited settings.

### Commentary: vasoplegia after aortic surgery: looking for options [^116ERrwf]. JTCVS Techniques (2020). Medium credibility.

The initial management for vasoplegic shock includes ruling out any other causes of refractory hypotension, including sepsis, bleeding, metabolic and/or electrolyte derangements, hypoxia, or cardiac failure. In thoracic aortic surgery, as in this case, the consequences of hypotension can be especially detrimental and permanent if they result in spinal cord ischemia. After a diagnosis of vasoplegia is made, the toolbox with which to address the high-output, low vascular resistance cardiovascular collapse must be evaluated and vasopressors and intravenous volume expansion become the first line in the tools of the trade. The algorithm presented by the authors in this case report summarizes the stepwise progression of vasopressor use. Over the years, several new tools have been added to the toolbox with which to address the difficult problem of vasoplegia. Several pharmacologic agents that have been demonstrated as being effective in vasoplegia include terlipressin, methylene blue, hydroxocobalamin, angiotensin II (Giapreza), vitamin C, flurbiprofen (Ropion), and hydrocortisone. As is evident by the plethora of options, no one option has proven to be the obvious superior agent. Within the circumstances of vasoplegia, by definition, the patients are rather unstable and we as clinicians try to use the "kitchen-sink" approach in this scenario to help alter the patient's clinical course. In this issue of the Journal, Chatterjee and colleaguesreport their experience in a patient undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair and their successful use of angiotensin II in this setting. The authors have one of the largest experiences with open thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair, and their efforts to optimize perioperative management in this critically ill cohort are to be commended.

### The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) guidelines for the care of heart transplant recipients [^116MgV4G]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

ISHLT Topic 4: Early postoperative care — treatment of postoperative vasoplegia notes that reduction in vascular tone after heart transplant is postulated to occur due to a general inflammatory response to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and dysregulation of the cGMP-NO pathway; risk factors include older recipient age, longer period of LVAD support, impaired renal function, prolonged CPB time, and prolonged ischemic time. Vasoplegia can be severe and refractory to conservative therapy and is associated with increased morbidity, with an underlying mechanism related to increased nitric oxide synthesis stimulating guanylatecyclase leading to cGMP production with subsequent vascular relaxation. Treatment involves titrating vasoactive pressors to improve vascular tone and restore adequate perfusion pressure; norepinephrine is considered the first-line agent for treatment of vasoplegia, followed by vasopressin and then only a single dose of methylene blue; other vasoactive medications include epinephrine, dopamine and oral midodrine, and there are case reports of successful treatment with a single dose of methylene blue, temporary ECMO support, and oral droxidopa and hydroxocobalamin.

### Reversal of vasodilatory shock: current perspectives on conventional, rescue, and emerging vasoactive agents for the treatment of shock [^114Pq9im]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Understanding the different mechanisms of vasoconstrictors is crucial to their optimal application to clinically diverse shock states. We present a comprehensive review of conventional, rescue, and novel vasoactive agents including their pharmacology and evidence supporting their use in vasodilatory shock. The role of each drug in relation to the Surviving Sepsis Guidelines is discussed to provide a context of how each one fits into the algorithm for treating vasodilatory shock. Rescue agents can be utilized when conventional medications fail, although there are varying levels of evidence on their clinical effectiveness. In addition, novel agents for the treatment of vasodilatory shock have recently emerged such as ascorbic acid and angiotensin II. Ascorbic acid has been used with some success in vasoplegia and is currently undergoing a more rigorous evaluation of its utility. Angiotensin II (Ang-2) is the newest available vasopressor for the treatment of vasodilatory shock. In addition to its catecholamine-sparing properties, it has been shown to hold promising mortality benefits in certain subsets of critically ill patients.

### Commentary: angiotensin II for vasoplegia: a desperate measure for desperate times [^116YeBw1]. JTCVS Techniques (2020). Medium credibility.

AngII is formed by cleavage of angiotensin I by angiotensin converting enzyme. The effects of AngII include arteriolar and venous constriction and promotion of salt and water reabsorption through stimulation of aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone release. Synthetic AngII received Food and Drug Administration approval for treatment of vasodilatory shock based on evidence from the randomized controlled Angiotensin II for the Treatment of High-Output Shock trial. Patients were eligible for enrollment at a relatively low norepinephrine-equivalent dosage of 0.2 μg/kg/min, which has been a source of criticism of the trial design. Among enrolled patients, sepsis was the leading cause of shock in enrolled patients (81%), whereas postoperative vasoplegia was present in only 6%. The primary end point, a mean arterial pressure response at hour 3 after initiating the study drug was achieved in 70% of the AngII group versus 23% of the placebo group. A higher incidence of venous and arterial thromboembolism was noted in the AngII group (13% vs 5% in placebo).

A major take-home message from the case presented by Chatterjee and colleaguesis that the armamentarium for managing vasodilatory shock is large. This single case does not allow us to make conclusions about efficacy or safety of AngII, and it highlights the challenge of identifying cause and effect when numerous drugs are used concomitantly. Because the Angiotensin II for the Treatment of High-Output Shock trial was conducted largely in patients with sepsis, one cannot necessarily extrapolate its findings to patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. Clearly, this is an area where more supportive evidence is needed.

### Determinants and outcomes of vasoplegia following left ventricular assist device implantation [^116aGF7c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The development of a reliable prediction tool is critical because vasoplegia has repeatedly been associated with poor surgical outcomes. Patients who developed vasoplegia following elective cardiac surgery, for example, had significantly worse 90‐day survival outcomes than those who did not develop vasoplegia (29% versus 9%). 7 Another study reported a mortality rate of 50% for dialysis‐dependent patients who underwent CPB and subsequently developed vasoplegia. 9 Our work reiterated the association between vasoplegia and mortality, as patients with moderate to severe vasoplegia had a > 2‐fold increase in risk of mortality. In addition, we observed higher rates of major bleeding episodes among vasoplegic patients. This confirms the work of Chan and colleagues, who found a similar trend among transplant recipients, and Patarroyo with blood transfusions. 20, 21 Although this finding may identify an area of confounding, the majority of bleeding events after LVAD implantation resolve within 24 hours. In our experience, 73% of the bleeding events resolved within 24 hours. Furthermore, patients developed respiratory failure at higher rates as vasoplegia severity worsened, and we found that those with moderate to severe vasoplegia developed RHF at ≈4 times the rate of those who did not have vasoplegia. As a result of these complications, the postoperative LOS for vasoplegic patients was significantly longer than for those without vasoplegia, a theme that has been reported previously. 22 Contrary to all other surgical outcomes, vasoplegia was inversely related to driveline infection. This may be coincidental, or those with vasoplegia may have received prolonged antibiotics due to concerns about sepsis, which could have subsequently lowered the risk of driveline infection development.

### Vasoplegic syndrome following cardiothoracic surgery-review of pathophysiology and update of treatment options [^112RTkhG]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Pathophysiology of vasoplegia. Physiologic contraction of vascular smooth muscle occurs in response to intracellular calcium, which cause myosin phosphorylation leading to myosin-actin filament crosslinking and vasoconstriction. Cytoplasmic calcium is increased through alpha-1 adrenergic receptor, vasopressin-1 receptor, and angiotensin type-1 receptor activation. Inflammatory mediators released during cardiopulmonary bypass can lead to adrenoreceptor desensitization, an immediate increase in vasoconstrictive mediators with subsequent depletion, and the production of nitric oxide (NO). NO leads to an increase in cGMP, which inhibits calcium into cells, leading to muscle relaxation. NO also activates ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP), leading to hyperpolarization and inhibited vasoconstriction

NO is produced from-arginine by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes. NOS enzymes are differentiated based on location and levels of activity. Constitutive endothelial NOS (eNOS) provides a baseline constant production of NO in endothelial cells which can rapidly diffuse into vascular smooth muscle cells and exert its effects. Inducible NOS (iNOS) is stimulated via inflammatory cytokines and can lead to significantly higher levels of NO compared to eNOS, up to 1000-fold. NO increases vasodilation via multiple methods. It activates guanalyl cyclase, an enzyme found in the vascular smooth muscle that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of guanosine triphosphate to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), by binding to the heme moiety of the enzyme. cGMP inhibits calcium entry via voltage-gated channels and activates cGMP-dependent protein kinases leading to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, leading to muscle relaxation. NO also activates ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K ATP), which creates a hyperpolarized state. In a hyperpolarized state, the secondary intracellular cascade leading to vasoconstriction is inhibited despite activation of G-protein coupled receptors.

### Transfusion increases the risk for vasoplegia after cardiac operations [^111j6qkm]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Perioperative vasoplegia is associated with increased morbidity. Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion increases plasma concentrations of inflammatory mediators, possibly contributing to the development of vasoplegia. We investigated the prevalence of mild and profound postoperative vasoplegia, identified factors associated with its development, and examined the role of RBC and component transfusion on the occurrence of postoperative vasoplegia.

Methods

Between January 1, 2000, and January 1, 2007, 25,960 patients underwent on-bypass cardiac surgical procedures. The incidence of vasoplegia was defined as (1) mild vasoplegia requiring norepinephrine infusion for blood pressure support on the day of operation and postoperative day 1, and (2) profound vasoplegia requiring vasopressin, with or without concomitant norepinephrine infusion, on the day of operation and postoperative day 1. Separate logistic regression models were used to model risk factors for development of mild and profound vasoplegia.

Results

RBC transfusion increased risk-adjusted odd ratios (ORs) of developing mild vasoplegia (1.07 [95% confidence limits (CL), 1.05, 1.10]; p < 0.001) and profound vasoplegia (1.38 [1.31, 1.46] p < 0.001). The risk-adjusted ORs (95% CL) for mild vasoplegia and profound vasoplegia were similarly increased by fresh-frozen plasma (OR, 1.24 [1.10, 1.41], p < 0.001; and OR, 1.20 [1.13, 1.29], p < 0.001) and platelet transfusion (OR, 1.39 [1.25, 1.54], p < 0.001; and OR, 1.22 [1.14, 1.31], p < 0.001), respectively.

Conclusions

Red blood cells, fresh-frozen plasma, and platelet transfusion increased the prevalence of vasoplegia. RBC transfusion exhibited a dose-dependent response for developing vasoplegia with each RBC unit transfused. Further investigation is necessary to determine whether prophylactic use of vasopressor support in the setting of transfusion can ameliorate risk and effect outcomes.

### Predictors and impact of prolonged vasoplegia after continuous-flow left ventricular assist device implantation [^111xu5KY]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

In our cohort, postoperative vasoplegia itself was not associated with early or long-term mortality, whereas prolonged vasoplegia was associated with both. Thus, studies that define vasoplegia according to hemodynamic parameters or vasopressors administered at the time of intensive care unit arrival may overestimate the incidence of vasoplegia or may actually be identifying transient vasoplegia, which has less clinical significance than prolonged vasoplegia. In addition, whereas others have investigated vasoplegia 48 to 72 hours after implantation, multiple investigators have shown that the first 12 to 24 hours — the focus of our study — is the critical period for developing vasoplegia after CF-LVAD implantation.

Identifying patients at risk for prolonged vasoplegia may allow early risk stratification and intervention. We found that BMI, MELD score, and preoperative renal status were directly associated with whether a patient developed both postoperative vasoplegia in general and prolonged vasoplegia in particular. We did not find an association between preoperative use of ACEIs or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and the development of vasoplegia after CF-LVAD implantation; whereas other investigatorshave found an association between ACEIs or ARBs and postimplantation vasoplegia, most others did not find an association, including Tecson et alafter CF-LVAD implantation and Patarroyo et aland Chan et alafter heart transplant. In our analysis, 56% of patients received ACEIs and 17% received ARBs preoperatively; we typically hold these medications in patients presenting with higher-acuity INTERMACS profiles because of hemodynamic considerations.

Preoperative dialysis was a risk factor for any vasoplegia and for prolonged vasoplegia. Similarly, de Waal et aland Chan et alfound that worsening renal function, as indicated by either the use of dialysis or increasing serum creatinine, was an independent predictor of vasoplegia development. Indeed, renal failure was the only preoperative risk factor for developing vasoplegia (OR: 1.47) identified by Dayan et alin a meta-analysis of 10 articles and more than 30,000 patients after cardiac surgery. It is not entirely clear whether the vasoplegia is exacerbating the AKI, the worsening AKI is prolonging the vasoplegia, or the renal replacement therapy is contributing to the ongoing vasopressor needs; in all likelihood, they are interrelated. Intraoperative strategies for reducing AKI in these patients include targeted perfusion strategies, such as goal-directed therapy, in addition to meticulous surgical technique to reduce the need for transfusions.

### Targeting the contributors to vasorelaxation during vasoplegia from cardiopulmonary bypass [^1177HTmT]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Vasoplegia, a syndrome of noncardiogenic, non-hypovolaemic vasodilatory hypotension is a common complication of cardiac surgery utilising cardiopulmonary bypass. Vasopressor-sparing strategies have been increasingly used in the management of vasoplegia to minimise the untoward ischaemic and arrhythmogenic effects of vasoconstrictors. A recent study found that hydroxocobalamin, a non-vasoconstricting modulator of nitric oxide pathways, provided a clinically meaningful vasopressor-sparing effect in the first 24 h of vasoplegia. We highlight the broad implications of hydroxocobalamin in the management of vasoplegia associated with on-pump cardiac surgery.

### Methylene blue reduces mortality and morbidity in vasoplegic patients after cardiac surgery [^111nv6E4]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The discovery of nitric oxide as mediator in cardiac postoperative vasoplegia encourages the use of inhibitory drugs such as methylene blue. This drug has been used with favorable results in isolated cases. The purpose of this article is to analyze the incidence of the postoperative vasoplegic syndrome, to consider its prognosis, and to evaluate the effect of intravenous methylene blue on mortality.

Methods

Cardiac surgery patients were consecutively included. Vasoplegic syndrome was defined by the presence of the following five criteria: (1) hypotension, (2) low filling pressures, (3) high or normal cardiac index, (4) low peripheral resistance, and (5) vasopressor requirements. Those with vasoplegia were randomized to receive 1.5 mg/Kg of methylene blue or a placebo. A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant.

Results

Six hundred thirty eight cardiac surgery patients were consecutively included in this study. Fifty-six of these patients fulfilled vasoplegia criteria (8.8%) resulting in higher mortality (10.7% or 6 of 56 patients vs 3.6% or 21 of 582 patients; p value = 0.02). Those treated with methylene blue showed morbidity and mortality reductions (0% versus 21.4% or 6 of 28 patients; p value = 0.01). The duration of the vasoplegic syndrome was shorter in those patients treated with the drug, lasting less than 6 hours in all patients. Patients in the control group showed a slower recovery, lasting more than 48 hours in 8 patients (p value = 0.0007).

Conclusions

Vasoplegic postoperative syndrome was seen in 8.8% of all patients. Outcome in patients with vasoplegia was worse with increased morbidity and mortality. The use of methylene blue reduced the high mortality in this population.

### Determinants and outcomes of vasoplegia following left ventricular assist device implantation [^111mFEBc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Approximately half of the 252 patients in this analysis developed vasoplegia following LVAD implantation. We found that the best combination of variables to predict the severity of vasoplegia was preoperative INTERMACS profile, CVP, SBP, and intraoperative CPB duration. In addition, bivariate analyses revealed that preoperative serum creatinine and LOS as well as intraoperative cross‐clamp use and volume removed via ultrafiltration were associated with the development of vasoplegia. The severity of vasoplegia was associated with longer postoperative LOS, major bleeding, and mortality. In comparison to patients without vasoplegia, those with moderate to severe vasoplegia had more than double the risk of 1‐year mortality.

Rates of vasoplegia vary and depend heavily on the type of surgery and the clinical characteristics of the patient sample as well as the definition of vasoplegia. For example, vasoplegia defined as norepinephrine ≥ 0.2 μg/kg per minute for 12 to 24 hours in the intensive care unit was observed in 20% of HF patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery compared with 0% of similarly matched patients without HF undergoing the same surgery. 6 A recent retrospective analysis reported a vasoplegia occurrence of 29%; however, only a small portion of that sample was comprised patients undergoing surgery for LVAD implantation (most had left ventricle restoration or CorCap [Acorn Cardiovascular] implantation). 7 Furthermore, that study defined vasoplegia as the need for norepinephrine ≥ 0.2 μg/kg per minute and/or any dose of terlipressin combined with a cardiac index ≥ 2.2 L/min per m 2 for at least 12 consecutive hours within the first 3 postoperative days. In another study, ≈48% and 34% of patients undergoing CPB developed vasoplegia immediately and 24 hours following surgery, respectively, based on mean arterial pressure < 50 mm Hg and the need for noradrenaline perfusion > 0.08 μg/kg per minute. 8 Another study reported a rate of 31% among heart transplant patients, with vasoplegia defined as "global systemic hypotension within 48 hours of heart transplantation with concurrent requirement of vasopressor administration (eg, vasopressin, epinephrine, or norepinephrine infusion of > 5 μg/min) for > 24 hours to maintain MAP [mean arterial pressure] > 70 mm Hg". 3 Similarly, in the Esmailian heart transplant study, 34% developed vasoplegia (with the majority categorized as mild). 4 We adopted Chan and colleagues' definition of vasoplegia and observed a rate of 49%, which was the highest of the studies reviewed and may be explained by the greater severity of illness in LVAD patients compared with heart transplantation patients.

### Non-adrenergic vasopressors for vasodilatory shock or perioperative vasoplegia: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114PPAqS]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was mortality at the longest available follow-up, given that mortality is the most frequently reported patient-important primary outcome in critical care RCTs. Secondary outcomes included renal replacement therapy (RRT), days of mechanical ventilation, days of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, days of hospital stay, atrial fibrillation, vasopressor-free days at day 28, and dose of noradrenaline. Dose of noradrenaline refers to the noradrenaline equivalent dose observed at the longest follow-up available.

Statistical analysis

Initially, we categorized all the included RCTs into one of three distinct groups — septic shock, cardiac surgery, or non-cardiac surgery — based on the majority population in each study. Meta-analysis was performed separately for these three groups. Subgroup analysis was conducted according to type of non-adrenergic agents (vasopressin, terlipressin, selepressin, angiotensin II, methylene blue, and hydroxocobalamin), comparator (placebo and adrenergic agents), baseline vasopressor dose (above or below the median value in septic shock), exclusion of studies assessing nitric oxide scavengers (methylene blue and hydroxocobalamin), and studies with overall low risk of bias. We also performed the following sensitivity analyses for the primary outcome: timing of assessment (< 28 days, 28 or 30 days, and > 30 days), exclusion of a study using dopamine as control treatment, exclusion of studies using selepressin as the intervention, timing of administration (first-line versus second- or third-line therapy), studies published in high-impact journals (the complete journal selection is detailed in the Table S1), and studies published before versus after 2014.

Throughout this study, we calculated individual and pooled effects estimate (risk ratio [RR] for binary variables and mean difference [MD] or standardized mean difference [SMD] for continuous variables) with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a Mantel–Haenszel random-effects model for all the outcomes assuming heterogeneity of treatment effects due to clinical heterogeneity among studies. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistics, and publication bias was evaluated by visual inspection of funnel plots. We used Review Manager 5.4 and considered two-sided p values < 0.05 statistically significant.

To assess the possible effect modification for mortality by baseline vasopressor dose, we performed a meta-regression analysis using a mixed-effects model. A noradrenaline equivalent score was used to calculate the total vasopressor dose. The analysis was performed using R 4.0.1.

### Predictors and clinical outcomes of vasoplegia in patients bridged to heart transplantation with continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices [^1142F7n3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This retrospective single‐center study demonstrates the following salient findings: (1) approximately half of the patients bridged with LVAD before HT developed vasoplegia following HT; (2) vasoplegic patients were significantly older and had longer LVAD support time, higher preoperative creatinine, longer CPB time, more comorbidities, and higher rates of combined organ transplantation; (3) older age, longer LVAD support, pre‐HT renal function, and CPB time were independent predictors of vasoplegia; (4) vasoplegic patients had longer ICU LOS, and required longer duration of vasopressors and mechanical ventilatory support; and (5) patients who developed vasoplegia following HT were at significantly increased risk of long‐term mortality compared with patients without vasoplegia.

Previous studies have focused on predictors of vasoplegia after HT in the general HT population, and, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to specifically address the question of whether there might be unique predictors of vasoplegia among patients supported by an LVAD as a bridge to HT. We limited our analysis to the LVAD population because patients supported by continuous‐flow LVAD before HT represent a unique and growing cohort of patients with potentially different underlying mechanisms for the development of post‐HT vasoplegia. This difference is due to the continuous‐flow circulation physiology associated with the LVAD function, which may persistently affect post‐HT vasomotor activity even after LVAD explantation. Moreover, LVAD patients may develop LVAD‐related complications, including stroke, chronic infection, and pump dysfunction, that may have chronic systemic consequences and thus increase the risk of vasoplegia after HT. In this setting, we hypothesized that a unique set of predictors of vasoplegia (eg, LVAD parameters, LVAD‐related complications, and the length of LVAD support) may exist in comparison with the previously tested predictors in the general HT population, which is more heterogeneous (eg, patients on chronic inotropes and others on temporary MCS devices). Given the growing number of patients undergoing HT after LVAD support and the decreased long‐term survival of patients with post‐HT vasoplegia, detailed assessment of the preoperative risk factors of vasoplegia found in our study is clinically important. First, we confirmed that previously reported risk factors for vasoplegia in the general HT population, including advanced age and prolonged CPB time, are still associated with increased risk of vasoplegia after LVAD bridging; therefore, they are not unique to the LVAD population. Second, we found that the length of LVAD support was a significant predictor of post‐HT vasoplegia, independent of other risk factors including reoperative status, CPB time, and combined organ transplantation, supporting specific LVAD‐driven factors contributing to the development of vasoplegia syndrome. Consequently, the duration of LVAD support is an important factor that should be considered in the evaluation and preparation of patients supported by LVADs for HT. Based on our results, other LVAD‐related parameters and complications were not found to be significantly associated with vasoplegia after HT, but larger studies are necessary to confirm these findings.

### The clinical conundrum of vasoplegia with mechanical circulatory support devices [^112HiRam]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the lack of confirmatory evidence, clinicians employ several practices to limit the incidence of post operative vasoplegia. These tactics include withholding beta-blockers (inconsistent association) and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (through their bradykinin enhancing effect), avoiding use of perioperative inotropic-vasodilator drugs such as the phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor milrinone (through smooth muscle relaxation), and reducing the use of drugs such as amiodarone (which may mediate their negative effects through thyroidal dysregulation) are considered as candidate risk mediators for vasoplegia. None of these practices have been conclusively established and generally are directed towards clinician comfort. One area of increasing activity relates to transition from temporary to durable mechanical circulatory support. In such cases, we believe that the risk for vasoplegia may be heightened due to ongoing hemolysis and oxidative stress with a consequent systemic inflammatory response and endothelial dysfunction with devices such as trans-aortic micro axial flow pumps or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation systems often used in support of circulations as a prelude to definitive surgical therapy. In such cases, the intraoperative use of CPB should be limited as far as possible and early targeted treatment of vasodilatory shock may be useful. In some circumstances, the use of systemic hemoadsorption devices designed to remove circulating cytokines has been suggested as a useful tactic, but this too remains largely anecdotal. This device, akin to dialysis systems can be added to the CPB circuit and includes a cartridge containing biocompatible copolymer beads capable of removing molecules of medium molecular weight by using a combination of hydrophobic or ionic interactions as well as hydrogen bonding. Studies, mostly in sepsis syndromes, have been of low yield although this technology was utilized in dealing with the hyperinflammation syndrome observed during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, most studies have not shown a benefit to support widespread use.

### Mixed cardiogenic-vasodilatory shock: current insights and future directions [^112GEA2j]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

This state-of-the-art review describes the potential etiologies, pathophysiology, and management of mixed shock in the context of a proposed novel classification system. Cardiogenic-vasodilatory shock occurs when cardiogenic shock is complicated by inappropriate vasodilation, impairing compensatory mechanisms, and contributing to worsening shock. Vasodilatory-cardiogenic shock occurs when vasodilatory shock is complicated by myocardial dysfunction, resulting in low cardiac output. Primary mixed shock occurs when a systemic insult triggers both myocardial dysfunction and vasoplegia. Regardless of the etiology of mixed shock, the hemodynamic profile can be similar, and outcomes tend to be poor. Identification and treatment of both the initial and complicating disease processes is essential along with invasive hemodynamic monitoring given the evolving nature of mixed shock states. Hemodynamic support typically involves a combination of inotropes and vasopressors, with few data available to guide the use of mechanical circulatory support. Consensus definitions and novel treatment strategies are needed for this dangerous condition.

### Vasopressin versus norepinephrine in patients with vasoplegic shock after cardiac surgery: the VANCS randomized controlled trial [^115WtEjw]. Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

The study VANCS was published by Hajjar LA and colleagues in 2017 in the journal Anesthesiology. This study is related to the following diseases: Post-cardiac surgery care. In the VANCS study, the trial question was: is vasopressin superior to norepinephrine in reducing postoperative complications in patients with vasoplegic syndrome? In the VANCS study, the study design was: single center, double blinded, RCT. In the VANCS study, the population was: 300 patients (138 female, 162 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with vasoplegic shock (mean arterial pressure < 65 mmHg resistant to fluid challenge and cardiac index > 2.2 L/min/m²) after cardiac surgery. The key exclusion criteria were aortic surgery, heart transplantation, preoperative use of vasopressor therapy, presence of a ventricular assist device other than an intraaortic balloon pump, severe hyponatremia, acute coronary syndrome, acute mesenteric ischemia, history of Raynaud disease, pregnancy and neoplasm. In the VANCS study, the interventions were: n = 149 vasopressin (0.01–0.06 U/min) n = 151 norepinephrine (10–60 mcg/min). In the VANCS study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in the rate of death or severe postoperative complications within 30 days (32% vs. 49%; HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.8). In the VANCS study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in the rate of AF by day 30 (63.8% vs. 82.1%; OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.64). In the VANCS study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in adverse events including digital ischemia, mesenteric ischemia, hyponatremia, and myocardial infarction. In the VANCS study, the conclusion was: in patients with vasoplegic shock (mean arterial pressure < 65 mmHg resistant to fluid challenge and cardiac index > 2.2 L/min/m²) after cardiac surgery, vasopressin was superior to norepinephrine with respect to the rate of death or severe postoperative complications within 30 days.

### Comment on "Vasoplegic syndrome following cardiothoracic surgery-review of pathophysiology and update of treatment options" [^1119mZZr]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

We read with great interest the article by Bousse et al. on vasoplegic syndrome after cardiothoracic surgery. It provides an excellent review of alternative pharmacologic interventions when vasodilatory shock becomes refractory to usual measures of catecholamines and vasopressin. In the article by Busse et al. the following statement is made: "In a protocol by Ortoleva et al. non-catecholamine therapy is recommended to begin at norepinephrine doses of 0.5μg/kg/min, which has been associated, at least in the distributive shock population, with an unacceptable level of mortality". We wish to provide a clarification on this reference to our algorithm on the management to vasoplegia.

Our article recommends the initiation of alternate therapy at the equivalent of 0.5 μg/kg/min of norepinephrine (or other agreed upon limit) and not when the norepinephrine dose by itself has reached that level. Our article also states that "The use of vasopressin, norepinephrine, or phenylephrine are left to the discretion of the clinician". While we believe vasopressin is a valuable addition in vasodilatory shock, the recent price increase on vasopressin has sanctioned use at our and other institutions. Hence, we did not specifically mention the use of vasopressin and instead elected to use a norepinephrine equivalent dose of 0.5 μg/kg/min which, for example, could be 0.3 μg/kg/min of norepinephrine and 0.08 U/min of vasopressin, among other possible combinations.

### Methylene blue: the drug of choice for catecholamine-refractory vasoplegia after cardiopulmonary bypass? [^115amEVR]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

Vasoplegia is a frequent complication after cardiopulmonary bypass that often requires the application of norepinephrine. In a number of cases, however, vasoplegia is refractory to norepinephrine. The guanylate cyclase inhibitor methylene blue could be an attractive treatment alternative in such cases. This study examines the results of methylene blue therapy for norepinephrine-refractory vasoplegia after cardiopulmonary bypass.

Methods

A total of 54 patients with norepinephrine-refractory vasoplegia after cardiopulmonary bypass were treated with methylene blue (2 mg/kg) administered intravenously through a period of 20 minutes. The effects on hemodynamics, norepinephrine dosage, and clinical outcome were evaluated.

Results

Three patients (5.6%) died during the hospital stay. A clinically relevant increase in systemic vascular resistance and a decrease in norepinephrine dosage were observed in 51 patients within 1 hour after methylene blue infusion. Four patients (7.4%) had no response to methylene blue. No adverse effects related to methylene blue were observed.

Conclusions

A single dose of methylene blue seems to be a potent approach to norepinephrine-refractory vasoplegia after cardiopulmonary bypass for most patients, with no obvious side effects. Guanylate cyclase inhibitors could be a novel class of agents for the treatment of norepinephrine-refractory vasoplegia after cardiopulmonary bypass. A controlled clinical trial is now needed to evaluate the role of methylene blue in this situation.

### Determinants and outcomes of vasoplegia following left ventricular assist device implantation [^117PK3jy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Vasoplegia is associated with adverse outcomes following cardiac surgery; however, its impact following left ventricular assist device implantation is largely unexplored.

Methods and Results

In 252 consecutive patients receiving a left ventricular assist device, vasoplegia was defined as the occurrence of normal cardiac function and index but with the need for intravenous vasopressors within 48 hours following surgery for > 24 hours to maintain a mean arterial pressure > 70 mm Hg. We further categorized vasoplegia as none; mild, requiring 1 vasopressor (vasopressin, norepinephrine, or high-dose epinephrine [> 5 μg/min]); or moderate to severe, requiring ≥ 2 vasopressors. Predictors of vasoplegia severity were determined using a cumulative logit (ordinal logistic regression) model, and 1-year mortality was evaluated using competing-risks survival analysis. In total, 67 (26.6%) patients developed mild vasoplegia and 57 (22.6%) developed moderate to severe vasoplegia. The multivariable model for vasoplegia severity utilized preoperative Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) profile, central venous pressure, systolic blood pressure, and intraoperative cardiopulmonary bypass time, which yielded an area under the curve of 0.76. Although no significant differences were noted in stroke or pump thrombosis rates (P = 0.87 and P = 0.66, respectively), respiratory failure and major bleeding increased with vasoplegia severity (P < 0.01). Those with moderate to severe vasoplegia had a significantly higher risk of mortality than those without vasoplegia (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–4.18; P = 0.03).

Conclusions

Vasoplegia is predictive of unfavorable outcomes, including mortality. Risk factors for future research include preoperative INTERMACS profile, central venous pressure, systolic blood pressure, and intraoperative cardiopulmonary bypass time.

### Vasoplegic syndrome following cardiothoracic surgery-review of pathophysiology and update of treatment options [^115HTegQ]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

The dosing and administration of MB for post-CPB vasoplegia varies widely in the available literature, with some patients receiving the drug prior to CPB initiation, some during CPB, and yet others postoperatively. The preoperative administration of MB was formally evaluated by Ozal et al. in 2005 in a cohort of 100 high-risk patients undergoing CABG who were randomized to either MB 2 mg/kg given 1 h prior to surgery, or control. SVR significantly improved, norepinephrine requirements were significantly reduced, and clinical signs of vasoplegia were less common in the MB group versus control. ICU/hospital length of stay was also reduced. Of note, this trial excluded patients with LVEF < 35%, a substantial limitation as this criterion is an independent risk factor for post-CPB vasoplegia development.

Intraoperative MB administration has been more extensively defined in the literature. Ribeiro et al. prospectively examined intraoperative MB use in a 60-patient cohort randomized to MB 2 mg/kg administered over 6 h or control. The MB group had significantly higher diastolic blood pressures and SVR at 3 and 6 h respectively. They also noted lower TNF-alpha and NO levels post-CPB, suggesting reduced inflammation and vasodilation. Maslow et al. examined a 30-patient cohort taking ACE inhibitors randomized to MB 3 mg/kg given after initiation of CPB versus placebo. A significant rise in MAP and reduced phenylephrine use was noted in the MB group versus placebo, and lower lactate levels would seem to indicate a favorable effect on peripheral tissue perfusion. No significant difference in PaO 2 was noted, indicating that MB did not impair gas exchange in the patients examined. Most recently, Mehaffey et al. retrospectively examined 118 patients who received MB for vasoplegia in the setting of CPB and noted that mortality rates overall are high in patients who receive MB, but that early administration of the drug (given intraoperatively) demonstrated favorable outcomes in reduced mortality and incidence of renal failure when compared with late administration (post-operatively). Finally, Habib et al. evaluated MB use retrospectively in 28 patients matched to historical controls and found an improvement in mortality and time to discontinuation of all vasopressors in the MB group. Importantly, no dose-finding studies have ever evaluated different doses of MB in patients with vasoplegia. The commonly utilized dose for shock of 2 mg/kg is extrapolated from methemoglobinemia treatment (one intravenous infusion of 1–2 mg/kg).

Association of vasoplegia with clinical outcomes

Vasoplegia was associated with higher risks of postoperative adverse events, such as renal failure, stroke, bleeding and mortality, regardless of the definition used (Additional file 1: Table S1). For instance, patients with vasoplegia using the Argenziano definition developed renal failure more often (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.3–8.0) and showed a higher VIS on the first postoperative day (OR 1.0, 95% CI 1.0–1.0). There were no significant differences in outcome using the Levin definition. Vasoplegic patients according to the Patarroyo definition developed renal failure more often (OR 4.4, 95% CI 1.1–17.8), had increased requirements for continuous veno-venous hemofiltration CVVH (OR 7.3, 95% CI 1.8–30.0), and developed more often a stroke (OR 11.7, 95% CI 2.5–53.3) and gastrointestinal bleeding (OR 5.0, 95% CI 1.1–22.9) during ICU stay. Moreover, the ICU mortality (OR 6.5, 95% CI 1.5–27.4) and 30-days mortality (OR 7.9, 95% CI 1.8–34.3) were higher in the vasoplegia group. Patients meeting the criteria of our unified definition of vasoplegia developed renal failure more often (OR 6.0, 95% CI 2.4–15.0), had increased requirements for CVVH (OR 7.9, 95% CI 2.6–23.6) and showed a higher VIS on the first and second postoperative day. They also required resternotomy for bleeding/tamponade more frequently in the first 48 postoperative hours (OR 3.0, 95%CI 1.2–7.8). Moreover, the ICU-LOS and the Post-ICU-Hospital-LOS were significantly longer. The crude ICU mortality (OR 5.8, 95%CI 1.9–18.2) and one-year mortality (OR 3.9, 95%CI 1.5–10.2) were higher in the vasoplegia group. Long-term patient survival after cfLVAD implantation censored at device removal or HTx was significantly worse in patients with vasoplegia compared to no vasoplegia patients (Log-Rank p < 0.01 (Fig. 2 a and b) and remained statistically significant when patients were stratified according to their Intermacs score (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2 c1 and Fig. 2 c2).

### Vasoresponsiveness in patients with heart failure (VASOR): protocol for a prospective observational study [^112NZhcM]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Vasoplegia is a result of failure of the vascular smooth muscle cells to constrict to normal endogenous and exogenous stimuli. Normally, a vascular smooth muscle cell constricts due to binding of a ligand (e.g. arginine vasopressin or norepinephrine) to a receptor on the vascular smooth muscle cell surface (Fig. 1). This activates a signal transduction pathway, resulting in an increase of the calcium concentration in the cytosol due to release of intracellular calcium and an influx of extracellular calcium through voltage-gated calcium channels. Binding of calcium to calmodulin leads to phosphorylation of myosin light chain kinase, which activates myosin light chain, leading to vasoconstriction. In contrast, vasodilators (e.g. nitric oxide, atrial natriuretic peptide) increase cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) concentrations in the vascular smooth muscle cell. This leads to the activation of myosin light chain phosphatase, which deactivates myosin light chain, introducing vasodilatation. The mechanism that causes vasoplegia is thought to be multifactorial. It seems to involve activation of vasodilator pathways and inactivation of vasoconstrictor pathways resulting in a resistance to vasopressors, but the precise etiology remains subject of debate. Vasodilatory shock due to sepsis is the most studied etiology, but it is likely that the pathophysiological mechanisms differ depending on the underlying etiology. However, Landry and Oliver propose three mechanisms that contribute to all types of vasodilatory shock.

### The clinical conundrum of vasoplegia with mechanical circulatory support devices [^112dADKR]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Once vasoplegia becomes manifest, and after filling pressures have been adequately optimized, use of catecholamine and non–catecholamine-based drugs are necessary, often in high doses. However, it is not known nor well studied what sequence or combination of such drugs ought to be employed for successful outcomes. While this represents an area for scientific inquiry, until such evidence can be forthcoming, clinicians have employed distinctive tactics, but their effects on outcomes are uncertain. The primary mode of treatment uses catecholamines, preferably norepinephrine, which has been shown to be associated with the least hemodynamic and physiological stress in this clinical scenario. As an example, in comparative effectiveness studies, norepinephrine has fewer toxic effects compared to dopamine, and in other shock states epinephrine is associated with greater expression of lactic acidosis than norepinephrine. A useful strategy to limit high doses of catecholamines posits use of concomitant vasopressin, an agent that exploits a known deficiency of this hormone in this situation and one that in combination with catecholamines may avoid the deleterious tissue effects of high doses of a single agent. Vasopressin (or its analogs) predominantly acts by binding to the arginine vasopressin receptor A1 (with other effects on oxytocin) which in turn suppresses cyclic guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate activation due to NO. Other noncatecholamine drugs include angiotensin II (which acts via vasoconstrictive effects of the angiotensin type 1 receptor on smooth muscles, increases in sympathetic drive and also influences vasopressin release from the posterior pituitary), methylene blue (which suppresses NO and cytokine cascade effects), hydroxycobalamine (which acts as a NO scavenger) and the "HAT" combination which includes hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, and thiamine. The hypothesis of "HAT" use is based on the demonstration of marked vitamin C deficiency due to CPB as well as in the potential restorative function of this combined supplementation on endothelial disruption. However, most studies in vasodilatory shock (mostly due to sepsis) have not shown benefit and such use remains experimental or anecdotal.

The study of vasoplegia warrants more thoughtful integration of prevention and treatment strategies to mitigate its negative pathophysiological consequences. Standardized nomenclature and identification of precise pathophysiological targets are crucial for progress. As Confucius said, "There is never a case when the root is in disorder and yet the branches are in order".

Table 3
Postoperative Sample Characteristics by Vasoplegia Severity

Within 30 days of LVAD implantation, only 1 patient (0.79%) without vasoplegia died, 6 (9.0%) with mild vasoplegia died, and 10 (17.5%) with moderate to severe vasoplegia died. The survival rates and curves differed significantly across the vasoplegia categories at 30 days (P < 0.01). One‐year mortality rates increased across severity (23.3%, 29.6%, and 36.0%); however, the trend did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.10). When considered as a time‐to‐event outcome, those with moderate to severe vasoplegia had a significantly higher risk of mortality than those without vasoplegia (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.12; 95% CI, 1.08–4.18; P = 0.03). Alternatively, the risk of mortality for those with mild vasoplegia did not differ from those without vasoplegia (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.28; 95% CI, 0.67–2.45; P = 0.45; Figure 2, Table 4).

### Vasopressor therapy in cardiac surgery-an experts' consensus statement [^11676HM7]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Hemodynamic conditions with reduced systemic vascular resistance commonly are observed in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and may range from moderate reductions in vascular tone, as a side effect of general anesthetics, to a profound vasodilatory syndrome, often referred to as vasoplegic shock. Therapy with vasopressors is an important pillar in the treatment of these conditions. There is limited guidance on the appropriate choice of vasopressors to restore and optimize systemic vascular tone in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. A panel of experts in the field convened to develop statements and evidence-based recommendations on clinically relevant questions on the use of vasopressors in cardiac surgical patients, using a critical appraisal of the literature following the GRADE system and a modified Delphi process. The authors unanimously and strongly recommend the use of norepinephrine and/or vasopressin for restoration and maintenance of systemic perfusion pressure in cardiac surgical patients; despite that, the authors cannot recommend either of these drugs with respect to the risk of ischemic complications. The authors unanimously and strongly recommend against using dopamine for treating post-cardiac surgery vasoplegic shock and against using methylene blue for purposes other than a rescue therapy. The authors unanimously and weakly recommend that clinicians consider early addition of a second vasopressor (norepinephrine or vasopressin) if adequate vascular tone cannot be restored by a monotherapy with either norepinephrine or vasopressin and to consider using vasopressin as a first-line vasopressor or to add vasopressin to norepinephrine in cardiac surgical patients with pulmonary hypertension or right-sided heart dysfunction.

### Mixed cardiogenic-vasodilatory shock: current insights and future directions [^111ELARa]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Pure vasoconstrictors can be used as adjunctive catecholamine-sparing vasopressors for patients with significant vasoplegia, including vasopressin, angiotensin-II, and phenylephrine. The main limitation of these drugs is the reduction in CO that can occur via increased afterload and sympathetic withdrawal, and they should only be used after CO is normalized. Phenylephrine and vasopressin are particularly useful in vasodilated patients with hyperdynamic LV function and LVOT obstruction. For other patients with mixed shock and severe vasoplegia, addition of a pure vasoconstrictor can be considered when high-dose norepinephrine (eg, > 0.2 μg/kg/min) is ineffective or associated with arrhythmias. In general, vasopressin is the preferred second-line vasopressor for most vasoplegic states including sepsis and the postcardiotomy syndrome. Limited studies suggest that vasopressin may be able to improve MAP in patients with severe CS, implying a role in mixed cardiogenic-vasodilatory shock. We rarely use phenylephrine, which tends to cause excessive vasoconstriction and tissue ischemia and has less hemodynamic efficacy. Angiotensin-II can increase MAP in vasodilatory shock with high norepinephrine requirements but is contraindicated in patients with a low-output syndrome. Addition of angiotensin-II to norepinephrine and vasopressin may have favorable effects on the kidneys in patients with severe vasoplegia but can increase RV afterload unlike vasopressin.

When combination vasopressor therapy is inadequate to restore vascular tone and MAP, adjunctive agents are considered. While several of these therapies have been shown to improve MAP in patients with cardiogenic or septic shock, none has been shown to improve survival and they are understudied in mixed shock leaving uncertainty about when they should be utilized. The most commonly described adjunct for vasoplegia is stress-dose hydrocortisone (eg, 200 mg/day), which can improve MAP and reduce vasopressor requirements in patients with severe septic shock; however, improvement in patient-centered outcomes remains uncertain. Given the potential for relative adrenal insufficiency in patients with CS, it is possible that stress-dose corticosteroids might improve vasoplegia in mixed cardiogenic-vasodilatory shock. There is uncertainty about how to identify patients who are likely to respond to corticosteroids, making empiric therapy reasonable for patients with mixed shock who require high vasopressor doses or multiple vasopressors.

### Vasoresponsiveness in patients with heart failure (VASOR): protocol for a prospective observational study [^115rCqXN]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The incidence and prevalence of chronic heart failure is increasing. Despite the expansion of therapeutic options, including the development of new pharmacological therapies and cardiological interventions, overall survival and quality-of-life remains poor. When optimal medical therapy and cardiological interventions have failed to improve a patient's condition, surgical intervention may be a valid option in order to improve cardiac function. Surgical treatment of end-stage chronic heart failure encompasses different treatment modalities like surgical revascularization of ischemic territories using coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), alleviating functional mitral valve insufficiency (using restrictive mitral annuloplasty) and reconstructing left ventricular geometry and thereby improving contractility in patients that suffered from a large myocardial infarction resulting in a scarred and dilated left ventricle. Ultimately, left ventricular function can be replaced by performing orthotopic heart transplantation or by implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). These surgical options have improved clinical outcome. Unfortunately, heart failure surgery is associated with an increased risk on vasoplegia, also named vasodilatory shock. This syndrome is characterized by hypotension and the continuous need of vasopressors, despite a normal or high cardiac index. The incidence of vasoplegia ranges from 11 to 31% in patients undergoing heart failure surgery. The prognosis of vasoplegia is poor. Prolonged hypotension and the accompanying hypoperfusion lead to end-organ dysfunction and is associated with an increased morbidity. An earlier study showed that the 90-day survival rate after heart failure surgery is decreased in vasoplegic patients compared with non-vasoplegic patients (71% vs 91%, P < 0.001).

### Mixed cardiogenic-vasodilatory shock: current insights and future directions [^113NfpTP]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Due to the involvement of excessive NO release as a core driver of vasoplegia, the use of NOS inhibitors has been examined in both septic and cardiogenic shock. While these agents were effective at increasing MAP and decreasing vasopressor requirements, they did not improve survival and a signal of potential harm was suggested. Nonselective NOS inhibition reduces the harmful effects of excessive systemic NO production on the macrocirculation, at the cost of blocking the potentially beneficial effects of local NO production on the microcirculation and immune function. Accordingly, systemic NO inhibition is not an accepted strategy for patients with septic or cardiogenic shock. Nonetheless, the use of contemporary NO inhibitors such as methylene blue and hydroxycobalamin is well described in patients with vasoplegia, particularly after cardiac surgery. Like their predecessors studied in septic and cardiogenic shock, these drugs can increase MAP and SVR; however, data on improving survival outcomes are lacking. Therefore, NO inhibitors are a third-line strategy when adequate vascular tone cannot be restored with multiple vasopressors at doses that do not elicit toxicity, and further data are needed to determine their safety. Correction of severe metabolic alkalosis (eg, with alkali therapy) or severe ionized hypocalcemia (eg, with calcium chloride) can transiently improve MAP in shock without clear effects on survival.

Mechanical circulatory support

The rationale for the use of MCS devices in CS is centered on their ability to improve systemic and coronary perfusion, reduce cardiac filling pressures, facilitate revascularization, reduce vasoactive medication doses, all in order to interrupt the downward shock spiral of tissue hypoperfusion, end-organ failure, and death. In patients with CS, MCS devices increase CO which increases MAP, although the effect on MAP may limited by vasoplegia in mixed shock. The intra-aortic balloon pump in particular functions by reducing effective LV afterload and tends to be ineffective in patients who are vasoplegic, have low SVR, and/or require high vasopressor doses (ie, those with mixed shock).MCS devices such as percutaneous ventricular assist devices or VA ECMO generate a fixed amount of flow, which may be inadequate to restore MAP for patients who are vasoplegic.

Vasoplegic syndrome is an unusual cause of refractory hypotension under general anesthesia. It is commonly described in the setting of cardiac surgery, but rarely seen in noncardiac setting. We describe successful management of vasoplegic syndrome during Whipple procedure with vasopressin infusion. A high index of suspicion and prompt treatment with vasopressin can be lifesaving in patients with risk factors for vasoplegic syndrome who present with severe refractory hypotension and who respond poorly to fluid administration and routine vasopressor infusion.

### Vasoplegic syndrome: an update on perioperative considerations [^115pgNue]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Vasoplegic syndrome (VS) is increasingly recognized as an important clinical entity in perioperative medicine. VS is characterized by significant arterial hypotension, normal or high cardiac output, low systemic vascular resistance, and increased requirements for intravenous volume and vasopressors. Tremendous variations exist regarding incidence reported in the literature and management at different institutions; and the incidence of VS is likely significantly higher than many anesthesiologists believe. Thus the aims of this article are to review the pertinent aspects related to VS and alert clinical anesthesiologists to this under-recognized yet very challenging clinical condition. The potential risk factors include blood transfusion, cardiopulmonary bypass, organ transplantation, trauma and sepsis, and use of specific medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, Angiotensin-II antagonist, heparin, amiodarone, aprotinin, and protamine. The pathogenesis of VS may have several mechanistic pathways, overproduction of inducible nitric oxide, activation of ATP-dependent K channels, vasopressin V1A-receptor down-regulation, and nuclear factor-κB activation. Current management strategies include intravenous administration of volume and catecholamines, vasopressin, methylene blue and high dose hydroxocobalamin. Other treatment could include ATP-sensitive K channel blocker, nuclear factor-κB inhibitor, indigo carmine, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. VS is still associated with significantly increased perioperative morbidity and mortality.

### Mixed cardiogenic-vasodilatory shock: current insights and future directions [^113AHKMD]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Regardless of the trigger, the systemic inflammatory response can produce uncontrolled vasodilation through cytokine-driven excessive inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activation resulting in toxic levels of nitric oxide (NO), which produces vasoplegia, microvascular dysfunction, oxidative stress, and abnormal mitochondrial oxygen utilization. Endothelial dysfunction and microvascular dysfunction may aggravate tissue hypoperfusion and result in capillary leak and compromised tissue perfusion despite restoration of acceptable macrohemodynamic parameters. Abnormalities of the microcirculation are increasingly recognized as important contributors to the pathogenesis of both CS and septic shock and thus presumably contribute strongly to vasoplegia and organ injury in mixed shock. An inadequate vascular response to catecholamines (either endogenous or exogenous) is a central mechanism contributing to vasoplegia via acidemia, reduction of intracellular calcium, elevated intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate/cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels and activation of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels. As in critically ill patients with sepsis, nearly one-third of patients with CS may develop critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency; relative deficiencies of vasopressin and angiotensin-II have been proposed in septic shock and might potentially contribute to refractory vasoplegia in mixed cardiogenic-vasodilatory shock. Sedative and analgesic medications commonly used for mechanically ventilated patients have vasodilatory and cardioinhibitory properties that can induce or aggravate a mixed shock state, as can guideline-directed medical therapies for heart failure. Finally, metabolic derangements from sustained organ hypoperfusion can compromise myocardial and vascular function, impairing the response to vasoactive medications; this has been termed hemo-metabolic shock.

### Determinants and outcomes of vasoplegia following left ventricular assist device implantation [^116nZi1t]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The use of CPB in cardiac surgery has been frequently linked with vasoplegia, with the rate of vasoplegia being higher for patients who have CPB than for those who have off‐pump coronary artery bypass surgery. 9 Our study also reflected this inflammatory cascade, with worsening vasoplegia as CPB duration increased. The rates of concomitant procedures also increased across the vasoplegia severities, which may partly explain the increased CPB durations. In addition, both valvular surgery and surgery for the treatment of HF have been associated with the development of vasoplegia. 10 Consequently, all participants in our study (having advanced HF and LVAD) were already susceptible to developing vasoplegia. Having a prior sternotomy has also been associated with the development of vasoplegia among heart transplant patients; however, this relation was not detected in our LVAD recipient cohort. 4 Vasoplegia development has been directly associated with angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors and heparin, 11 whereas the use of β‐blockers exhibits an indirect relation (ie, a protective effect). 7 We did not confirm the associations between those drugs and vasoplegia; however, patients in the previous studies were treated with angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors and β‐blockers at much different rates than in our study. The use of amiodarone did trend toward significance in our study (P = 0.08) and has been previously associated with vasoplegia in the heart transplantation population. 12 In addition, the use of vasopressors before LVAD implantation has been associated with poor outcomes and RHF; we found that those with vasopressor dependence before surgery had > 3 times the risk of developing vasoplegia. 13 Our study revealed preoperative kidney dysfunction as being associated with vasoplegia, with those with moderate to severe vasoplegia having a median serum creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL compared with 1.3 mg/dL among those without vasoplegia. Also found to be predictive of vasoplegia severity in this study were CVP and SBP, which may be modified during the days of hospitalization before surgery. Relatedly, those who develop vasoplegia are less likely to have baseline hypertenstion. 7, 11 Alternatively, another study failed to detect a difference in baseline CVP; however, it utilized patients with congenital heart defects and only 10 patients had vasoplegia, which raises concerns about statistical power and the appropriateness of generalization to the advanced HF population of interest. 14

### The additional use of methylene blue has a decatecholaminisation effect on cardiac vasoplegic syndrome after cardiac surgery [^115izxrP]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Cardiac vasoplegia patients suffer from a severe systemic disease accompanied by operative stress and a high requirement of catecholamines. Additional MB administration to the standard treatment of CVS and over the first hours after admission to the ICU was accompanied by an increase in blood pressure followed by a decrease in vasopressor requirement. Early MB administration (during operation) in cardiac vasoplegic syndrome may be even more effective. A norepinephrine dose of 0.8 mg/h (0.15 μg*kg-1*min-1) followed by the need to ramp up the dose (≥ 0.1 mg*h-1) may serve as criteria for early MB administration. More prospective and randomized studies are necessary to further investigate the potential of MB administration on CVS after cardiac surgery.

### Hemodynamic effects of methylene blue vs hydroxocobalamin in… [^113BusL9]. ClinicalTrials (2018). Low credibility.

Hemodynamic Effects of Methylene Blue vs Hydroxocobalamin in Patients at Risk of Vasoplegia During Cardiac SurgeryClinicalTrials. gov ID. The patient will undergo routine monitoring for all cardiac surgical patients at DHMC, which includes: arterial line mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, cardiac output by pulmonary artery catheter thermodilution, serum pH, pCO2 and lactate by blood gas sampling during the pre-CPB period, during CPB and after separation from CPB, and transesophageal echocardiography. Vasopressor will be initiated and titrated to maintain MAP > 60mmHg in the pre- and post-CPB period, MAP > 50mmHg while on CPB, and vasopressor doses will be recorded on the anesthesia record by the providing team. After the induction of cardiopulmonary bypass, all patients will undergo non-pulsatile hypothermic CPB with a membrane oxygenator and an arterial line filter.
- 15 minutes after the initiation of CPB, the study drug will be administered intravenously through the central venous line by the anesthesia providers.
- The study endpoints will be recorded from the anesthesia record above: MAP, CVP, CO, serum pH, pCO2 and lactate, vasopressor requirements, LVEF by TEE and end-tidal isoflurane dose at the following time points: 30 minutes after the induction of anesthesia.
- **From the above measurements, calculated endpoints are derived**: cardiac index calculated by CI = CO/body surface area, and systemic vascular resistance = /CO x 800, and SVR index = /CI x 800.

who have 2 or more preoperative risk factors for vasoplegia1–6:
- angiotensin-converting enzyme -inhibitor, beta-blocker or amiodarone use within 24 hours of surgery
- anticipated CPB duration greater than 120minutes
- baseline left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 40%.

### Hemodynamic phenotype and capillary refill time-targeted resuscitation strategy (A2) [^111VF4wL]. ClinicalTrials (2021). Medium credibility.

Many patients remain hypovolemic after initial resuscitation. Others present very low diastolic arterial pressures reflecting profound vasoplegia and may benefit from early norepinephrine instead of fluids. Administering fluids in this setting could increase the risk of fluid overload. In addition, relevant myocardial dysfunction is present in a significant number of patients. Pulse pressure and DAP evaluation may help clinicians to individualize initial management sparing unnecessary fluid loading. From a hemodynamic point of view, several pathogenic mechanisms determine a progressive circulatory dysfunction. While loss of vascular tone and relative hypovolemia predominate in early phases, more complex mechanisms such as endothelial and microcirculatory dysfunction, progressive vasoplegia, and myocardial dysfunction may be involved later.

In effect, from a clinical point of view, many patients despite been fluid loaded in pre-intensive care unit settings, are still evidently hypovolemic and benefit from further administration of fluid boluses. Others, however, present very low diastolic arterial pressures reflecting profound vasoplegia, and recent data suggest that these patients may benefit from early norepinephrine instead of fluids on the contrary, administering fluids may fail to correct vascular tone and increase the risk of fluid overload. In addition, a recent echocardiography-based study confirmed that a relevant myocardial dysfunction is present in a significant number of patients and that several cardiovascular phenotypes with a potentially different therapeutic approach may be recognized.

Clinical hemodynamic phenotyping Hypotension assessed by mean arterial pressure is the hallmark of sepsis-related acute circulatory dysfunction, and since duration of hypotension is related to morbidity and mortality, current guidelines recommend fluids and vasopressors administered in a stepwise fashion to increase MAP levels to > 65 mmHg to ensure minimal organ perfusion pressure. Thus, rapid assessment of severity of vasodilation could influence therapeutic decisions such as the early introduction of NE, which theoretically may avoid unnecessary fluid administration while promptly restoring tissue perfusion. A low DAP may impair myocardial perfusion of the left ventricle, especially in the case of tachycardia where diastolic time is limited.
