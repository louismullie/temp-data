## Question

If a bunny comes out of its burrow 3 times per minute, calculate the combined number of times 20 bunnies at the same pace will have come out of their burrows in 10 hours.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many times 20 bunnies will come out of their burrows in 10 hours if each bunny comes out 3 times per minute. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the rate per bunny and how to scale it to 20 bunnies. Then, I should convert the time window from hours to minutes. Next, I will multiply the per-bunny rate by the number of bunnies and by the total minutes to get the total exits. Finally, I should double-check the arithmetic and consider whether any assumptions might change the result, like whether the bunnies act independently and at a constant rate.

> Let me first confirm the base rate and scaling. Each bunny exits 3 times per minute, so 20 bunnies at the same pace would exit 20 × 3 = 60 times per minute collectively, assuming independence and no interference with each other's timing, which seems reasonable for this thought experiment [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the time conversion so I don't misstate the total minutes. Ten hours equals 10 × 60 = 600 minutes, and I should keep that explicit to avoid a careless error later on [^notfound].

> I will now examine the total calculation. Total exits equal the collective per-minute rate times the total minutes: 60 exits per minute × 600 minutes = 36,000 exits. Hold on, I should verify that multiplication: 60 × 600 is indeed 36,000, so the arithmetic checks out [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the question is subtly different, like asking for the number of unique exit events across the colony rather than summed individual exits? Let me reconsider. The phrasing "combined number of times" aligns with summing each bunny's exits, so 36,000 remains the correct interpretation unless otherwise specified, and I should not overcomplicate it by introducing dependencies or coordination effects that aren't described [^notfound].

> Final answer: 20 bunnies, each exiting 3 times per minute, will collectively exit their burrows 36,000 times in 10 hours [^notfound].

---

The total number of times 20 bunnies emerge from their burrows in 10 hours is **36,000**. This is calculated by multiplying the individual rate (3 times per minute) by the number of bunnies (20) and the total minutes in 10 hours (600), giving 3 × 20 × 600 = 36,000.

---

## Step-by-step calculation

- **Individual bunny rate**: 3 times per minute.
- **Number of bunnies**: 20.
- **Total time**: 10 hours = 10 × 60 = 600 minutes.
- **Total emergences**: 3 × 20 × 600 = 36,000.

---

## Explanation

Each bunny emerges 3 times per minute, so 20 bunnies emerge 3 × 20 = 60 times per minute. Over 600 minutes, the total emergences are 60 × 600 = 36,000.

---

## Final answer

The total number of times 20 bunnies emerge from their burrows in 10 hours is **36,000**.

Typical Inclusion/ Exclusion Criteria

Preoperative Inclusion/ Exclusion (I/E) Criteria

Bunionectomy programs seek to enroll subjects who are:
Relatively healthy
Appropriate candidates for surgery (unilateral Austin bunionectomy) and anesthesia
Unlikely to be allergic or intolerant to the investigational product or the protocol-mandated rescue medications, and
Likely to provide non-confounded analgesic assessments.

In order to achieve point 4, subjects are excluded if they (1) have additional underlying painful conditions beyond bunion pain or (2) are currently taking opioids (eg >15 mg hydrocodone on any single day in the 2 months prior to surgery and any opioid within 10 days of surgery).

Postoperative Inclusion Criteria

In addition to the I/E criteria performed at the screening visit, studies using a postoperative dosing paradigm must specify a set of postoperative criteria to be assessed after the subject wakes up from surgery and begins experiencing pain. Namely, subjects must report postoperative pain that is: A) moderate or severe on a 4-point categorical scale (none, mild, moderate, or severe) and B) ≥4 or 5 on an 11-point NPRS (see Efficacy Assessments).

Efficacy Assessments

The most common efficacy assessments used in bunionectomy studies are as follows:

NPRS

The numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) is an 11-point scale that requires the subject to select a whole number (between 0 and 10) that best reflects their current pain intensity. A 0 represents “no pain” and a 10 represents “the worst pain imaginable”.

Assessment schedules in bunionectomy studies typically call for a scheduled NPRS to be captured at the following time points (in hours): 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, and then every 4 hours until Hour 48 (or end of study). In addition to scheduled NPRS assessments captured at specified time points, unscheduled NPRS assessments are also recorded A) immediately prior to use of any analgesic rescue medication and B) prior to subject discontinuation if it occurs before the end of the treatment period. Unscheduled NPRS assessments allow imputation of data that is confounded due to rescue or missing due to early discontinuation.

Rescue Table (Table 6)

All studies from the main search for which sufficient information related to rescue medication was available are included in Table 6. These studies had Studies publicly-available details on A) protocol-allowed rescue medication and B) the rate of early terminations due to lack of efficacy in the placebo arm.

Demographics Table (Table 7)

The 5 most recent publications were reviewed and common demographic data was compiled in a table Weighted averages were obtained within an individual study and then a weighted average was calculated across all studies. A limited number of recent studies were reviewed for Table 7 as the table is simply meant to provide a brief qualitative overview of demographic data. Additionally, data from recent available manuscripts may better reflect current demographic patterns in bunionectomy trials than data from older studies.

Demographic Characteristics of Bunionectomy Subjects

Analysis

Rescue Medication

Rescue analgesics are ethically required in acute pain studies, but they confound experimental data. In bunionectomy studies rescue is frequent in both the placebo arm (≈95% of placebo subjects receive at least one dose of rescue) and the active arm (≈85% of active subjects receive at least one dose of rescue).As such, the choice of rescue is an important study design element. An ideal rescue regimen is a balance between:
Strict rescue, which can give rise to unacceptably high terminations due to lack of efficacy (resulting in a high degree of missing data), and
Liberal rescue, which can excessively confound study data (Figure 6).

Figure 6 
Balancing rescue regimens *Ethical considerations around rescue medication are important, and are discussed in other sources.

The optimal way to interrogate a rescue regimen is to examine the placebo arm of past bunionectomy studies and calculate the rate of early terminations due to lack of efficacy. If a rate is too high (greater than ≈20%) then the experiment used too strict a rescue regimen (ie, not enough rescue). On the other hand, if there were very few efficacy terminations in the placebo arm (less than ≈2%), then the experiment likely used too liberal a rescue regimen (ie, too much rescue).

Table 6 shows rescue regimens and placebo dropout rates due to lack of efficacy in bunionectomy studies.

### Healthy housing reference manual [^3fe4030a]. CDC (2006). Medium credibility.

Pool content turnover rate—definition, 6-hour standard, and calculation are detailed. The turnover rate is the number of times a pool’s contents can be filtered though its filtration equipment in a 24-hour period, and a 6-hour turnover rate will result in 98% clarification if the pool is properly designed. A typical-use pool should have a pump and filtration system capable of pumping the entire contents of the pool though the filters every 6 hours; to determine compliance, use Turnover rate = pool volume (gallons)/flow rate×60 (minutes in hour). A sample calculation shows Turnover rate = 90,000 (gallons in pool)/ 180 gallons per minute×60 (minutes in hour), yielding an 8.3-hour turnover rate = 90,000 (pool volume in gallons)/10,800, which would not meet the required turnover rate of 6 hours.

D. Postoperative Dosing, Day 1

First dose of study drug is given the morning after the day of surgery.
A popliteal catheter is inserted during surgery to continuously numb the foot (see Popliteal Block). On the morning after surgery, the catheter is removed and the numbness recedes.

Subjects must then report adequate pain for randomization postoperatively (see Postoperative Inclusion Criteria). The qualifying pain score is considered to be the subject’s baseline pain. A baseline pain score allows use of SPID as a primary endpoint (see Endpoints).
Speed of onset measures such as the 2-stopwatch technique can be employed.

The Postoperative Day 1 design is by far the most common in bunionectomy clinical trials (see Summary Table of Bunionectomy Acute Pain Clinical Trials). The use of a popliteal catheter on the day of surgery allows pain from the surgical insult to partially recede overnight, such that when the patient is ready for randomization on the day after surgery, their pain trajectory is not as severe as it would have been on the day of surgery. This pain signal is an appropriate match for intermediate potency oral analgesics (investigational agents with potency similar to ibuprofen, hydrocodone, or acetaminophen). See Figure 2 re: matching the experimental pain signal to the study drug.

Figure 3 provides a timeline of key events for each dosing approach.

Figure 3 
Timelines for each dosing paradigm.

Sedation and Anesthesia

Anesthetic protocols can vary depending on the needs of a given study. One key asset of the bunionectomy model in clinical trials is the ability to adjust anesthesia and immediate postoperative analgesia to influence the onset and duration of a subject’s pain trajectory (see Popliteal Block for one example). From an experimental viewpoint, the ideal anesthetic regimen utilizes short-acting drugs that dissipate quickly and as such do not have carryover effects that would confound the efficacy evaluation period. The following anesthetic protocol is typical of modern bunionectomy studies:
Propofol at approximately 50–150 µg per kilogram per minute is titrated to achieve light sedation appropriate for monitored anesthesia care (MAC).
1–2 mg of midazolam may be given for preoperative sedation.
Muscle relaxants are not used.
Surgical anesthesia is generally achieved with a Mayo block (see Mayo Block below).
50–100 ug of fentanyl is allowed for intraoperative analgesia.

### Time is brain – quantified [^b7c8c22b]. Stroke (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The phrase "time is brain" emphasizes that human nervous tissue is rapidly lost as stroke progresses and emergent evaluation and therapy are required. Recent advances in quantitative neurostereology and stroke neuroimaging permit calculation of just how much brain is lost per unit time in acute ischemic stroke.

Methods

Systematic literature-review identified consensus estimates of number of neurons, synapses, and myelinated fibers in the human forebrain; volume of large vessel, supratentorial ischemic stroke; and interval from onset to completion of large vessel, supratentorial ischemic stroke.

Results

The typical final volume of large vessel, supratentorial ischemic stroke is 54 mL (varied in sensitivity analysis from 19 to 100 mL). The average duration of nonlacunar stroke evolution is 10 hours (range 6 to 18 hours), and the average number of neurons in the human forebrain is 22 billion. In patients experiencing a typical large vessel acute ischemic stroke, 120 million neurons, 830 billion synapses, and 714 km (447 miles) of myelinated fibers are lost each hour. In each minute, 1.9 million neurons, 14 billion synapses, and 12 km (7.5 miles) of myelinated fibers are destroyed. Compared with the normal rate of neuron loss in brain aging, the ischemic brain ages 3.6 years each hour without treatment. Altering single input variables in sensitivity analyses modestly affected the estimated point values but not order of magnitude.

Conclusions

Quantitative estimates of the pace of neural circuitry loss in human ischemic stroke emphasize the time urgency of stroke care. The typical patient loses 1.9 million neurons each minute in which stroke is untreated.

Equilibrated Kt/V (eKt/V)—adjustment for postdialysis rebound and benchmarking—states that allowance for solute disequilibrium can be made by adjusting spKt/V for the rebound in urea concentration at the end of dialysis, yielding eKt/V with a time-dependent factor; the Daugirdas “rate equation” was fit to rebound blood urea nitrogen measured 30 or 60 minutes after dialysis. The guideline notes that many would like to convert the dose benchmark from spKt/V to eKt/V for hemodialysis, that for peritoneal dialysis eKt/V and spKt/V are identical, and that after debate the KDOQI HD Work Group unanimously decided to disallow shortened dialysis for treatments 3 times per week, while clarifying that use of eKt/V as a benchmark does not prohibit ultrashort dialysis provided the clearance can be increased.

Summary

Prehospital emergency care is an important part of trauma systems across the USA and the world. From a once ‘load and go’ service, the provider’s skillsets and scope of practice have evolved to include multiple procedures that can be performed in the field. It is still debated if performing some prehospital procedures contributes to improved patient outcomes after traumatic injury and saves lives. The topic was debated at the 40th Annual Point/Counterpoint Acute Care Surgery Conference.

Typical Secondary Endpoints

Measures of Analgesic Onset

A Kaplan-Meier methodology is utilized to analyze the following endpoints that are derived from 2-stopwatch data:
Time to Perceptible Pain Relief: an endpoint derived from the median time at which study subjects stop the first stopwatch (which is labeled “Perceptible Relief”).
Time to Meaningful Pain Relief: an endpoint derived from the median time at which study subjects stop the second stopwatch (which is labeled “Meaningful Relief”). Subjects are considered to have achieved meaningful pain relief only if they hit the meaningful pain relief stopwatch before (1) receiving any dose of rescue analgesic or (2) receiving their 2 nd scheduled dose of study drug.
Time to Onset, also known as Time to Confirmed Perceptible Pain Relief: a derived endpoint that considers the time to perceptible pain relief only among subjects who also eventually achieve meaningful pain relief.

An additional method of analyzing analgesic onset is to determine the first time point at which the NPRS scores begin to diverge by a prespecified amount between treatment arms (generally referred to as time-specific pain intensity differences).

Measurement of Rescue Analgesics

Rescue analgesics are provided to study subjects only when needed/requested. As such, the amount of rescue analgesics consumed by the study subject can serve as a surrogate measure for how much pain that subject is experiencing.It is therefore common to tabulate and compare the total number of doses of rescue drug received in each study arm and report rescue-related efficacy endpoints.If the rescue analgesic regimen involves multiple opioids, an opioid equivalence chart can be used to facilitate the analysis.

The time elapsed between the administration of the first dose of study drug and the request/receipt of the first dose of rescue drug is commonly calculated and compared between treatment groups. This measure can provide information about analgesic offset.

### Physical activity profiles (...) [^213c2c9c]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Participants with valid data had a mean body mass index of 38. 3; were mostly African American; and reported an annual household income of $25 000 or less. They wore the accelerometers for a mean of 13. 6 h/d. Most of the time was spent sedentary or in light activity. Most of the time spent in light activity was spent in the lowest quartile. The women spent a mean duration of less than 1 min/d in moderate PA and none in vigorous PA. No participant met the 2008 US Department of Health and Human Services PA guideline. The participants’ body mass indexes were positively associated with time spent being sedentary, and employed participants were significantly less sedentary than those who were not employed.

Participants interrupted their sedentary behavior for at least 1 minute 79 times per day. Of those breaks, almost two-thirds lasted at least 2 minutes. However, data showed a mean of only 9. 5 interruptions per day of at least 10 minutes and only
3. 0 interruptions of at least 20 minutes. Those participants who were employed interrupted their sedentary behavior for more than 1 minute more often than those who were not. More overweight participants had fewer 10- and 20-minute interruptions of sedentary behavior than those with a lower body mass index. To our knowledge, this study is one of the first to obtain accelerometer data on PA levels among a relatively large sample of low-income, predominantly African American overweight and obese female patients of FQHCs in rural Georgia and to show extremely sedentary behavior in this population.

Participants spent a negligible amount of time in moderate activity, and the time spent in nonsedentary activity was mostly of very low intensity and short duration.

### Cutting edge or blunt instrument: how to decide if a stepped wedge design is right for you [^471f52f2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

When might I consider doing a stepped wedge trial?

Research designs are shaped as much by practical constraints as by abstract schemes, and it is always a good idea to start with the constraints and work towards a design, rather than start with a design and try to fit it to constraints. These constraints will be unique to each research context, and box 1 lists some areas to think about. Still, there are some common features of settings where a stepped wedge trial might be considered as a possible design, and we now review these.

Box 1 
Practical constraints on the design of a longitudinal cluster randomised trial

Are there limits on the time available to complete the evaluation, on the number of clusters, or on the number of participants (or the rate at which you can recruit participants) at each cluster? These constraints put limits on the overall scale of the evaluation, or force trade-offs between different design characteristics.
How will participants and their data be sampled in your study: as a series of cross-sectional surveys, as a continuous stream of incident cases, as a cohort followed over time, or some other way? Does the timescale divide into cycles, seasons or milestones that influence how you will sample participants and data?
Is there a limit on how many clusters can implement the intervention at the same time in the evaluation? If this is constrained by research resources (eg, if there are only enough trained research staff to implement the intervention one cluster at a time) then implementation must be staggered in some way.
If implementation is to be staggered, is there a minimum ‘step length’? If the same team delivers the intervention in different clusters at different steps, then bear in mind it may take some time to get the intervention fully operational at a site, and the team will also need time to relocate from one cluster to the next.

2.10.2 Propensity score matching

To create a balanced sample for model development and ensure unbiased comparisons between AD and the general population, we applied propensity score matching (PSM).Propensity scores were calculated using logistic regression, with group membership (AD or general population) as the dependent variable and demographic characteristics (age and sex) as predictors. Each AD participant was matched with up to 10 individuals from the general population with the most similar propensity scores, resulting in a matched dataset with equal representation of both groups (MATCHED).

2.10.3 Descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis

Descriptive statistics were calculated for the engineered features to summarize the characteristics of sleep behavior across age groups and individuals with dementia. The correlation between time to bed and wake‐up time was assessed using circular statistics, and bootstrap confidence intervals were computed. The median and interquartile range (IQR) were reported for all sleep metrics.

2.10.4 Filtering of extreme values

After the exploratory data analysis (EDA) stage, nights with invalid or extreme values were excluded based on predefined criteria. These included limiting the number of bed exits to 20, the in‐bed proportion to 0.6 to 1.0, heart rate between 45 and 85 beats per minute, respiratory rate between 10 and 25 cycles per minute, average exit duration to 60 minutes, out of bed time < 180 minutes; in bed time < 4 hours or > 16 hours were also excluded. People who went to bed before 5:20 pm or after 3:00 am and people who woke up before 2:40 am or after 11:45 pm were also excluded. This was done to allow us to focus on subtle sleep disruptions specific to AD rather than converge on extreme values that were more prevalent in the AD population, as shown by the EDA stage (see CONSORT Diagram in Figure S1).

### Midodrine hydrochloride [^959303a6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In a 2-day study, after open-label midodrine, known midodrine responders received midodrine 10 mg or placebo at 0, 3, and 6 hours. One-minute standing systolic blood pressures were increased 1 hour after each dose by about 15 mmHg and 3 hours after each dose by about 12mmHg; 3-minute standing pressures were increased also at 1, but not 3, hours after dosing. There were increases in standing time seen intermittently 1 hour after dosing, but not at 3 hours.

In a 1-day, dose-response trial, single doses of 0, 2.5, 10, and 20 mg of midodrine were given to 25 patients. The 10- and 20-mg doses produced increases in standing 1- minute systolic pressure of about 30 mmHg at 1 hour; the increase was sustained in part for 2 hours after 10 mg and 4 hours after 20 mg. Supine systolic pressure was ≥200 mmHg in 22% of patients on 10mg and 45% of patients on 20 mg; elevated pressures often lasted 6 hours or more.

Special Populations

A study with 16 patients undergoing hemodialysis demonstrated that Midodrine hydrochloride is removed by dialysis.

### Physical activity and exercise during pregnancy and the postpartum period: ACOG committee opinion, number 804 [^7aa306cd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Recommended weight limits for lifting at work during pregnancy—an on-page algorithm and stepwise method describe how to determine a recommended weight limit (RWL). The algorithm asks, “At work do you perform lifting tasks more than once every 5 minutes?” and, if yes, “Do you lift more than three times per minute?”, then queries “How many hours per day do you spend lifting at work?” with categories “Less than 1 continuous hour” or “1 or more hours per day,” corresponding to infrequent, repetitive short duration, or repetitive long duration lifting panels. Steps instruct to “select the one graphic (A, B, or C) that best describes the lifting frequency or frequency/duration pattern,” then “When less than 20 weeks pregnant, select the image on the left of the graphic; when pregnant for 20 weeks or more, select the image on the right,” to underline all relevant numerical values along the lift path and circle the lowest, and that “The number circled in step 3 is the RWL (in pounds)” with a proviso that the short-duration category can include multiple hours per day provided each continuous bout is less than 1 hour and followed by at least 1 hour of nonlifting before resuming; the figure presents “Provisional recommended weight limits for lifting at work during pregnancy.”

Introduction

In our daily life, we constantly deal with problems, ranging from the most mundane (e.g. what to cook for dinner given the ingredients at our disposal), to professional activities (e.g. how to reorganize our current plans to meet a new deadline), up to major societal challenges (e.g. how to find innovative solutions against global warming). How do we find new solutions to problems? While the ability to solve problems is a critical skill for adapting to new situations and innovating, the mechanisms underlying the problem-solving process remain largely unknown.

Among the new problems we face each day, some are well-defined (e.g. playing a jigsaw puzzle). The initial state (i.e. the number of independent pieces) and goal state (i.e. assembling the pieces so it looks like the picture model) are clear, and the solver can apply a set of operations (i.e. interlocking the pieces as a function of their shape) to reach the goal. However, for many of our problems (e.g. organizing work activities during the COVID-19 pandemic), the problem space is ambiguous. No heuristics or existing rules could be applied to transform the initial state into the goal state. Such “ill-defined” problemsthus require additional mental processes, which have been tightly linked to creative thinking –. Ill-defined problem-solving (or creative problem-solving) is often referred to as insight solving, where the solution comes to mind suddenly and effortlessly, with a “Eureka” phenomenon –. According to the Representational Change Theory, solving such problems involves restructuring the initial problem mental representational space,, which presumably entails combining elements related to the problem in a new way. In theory, restructuring allows one to change perspective, reframe the problem, or escape its implicitly imposed constraints, leading to creative associations,. For instance, consider the following problem: “A man walks into a bar and asks for a glass of water. The bartender points a shotgun at the man. The man says, ‘Thank you,’ and walks out”. The problem is ill-defined because the path to finding the solution is to be discovered, and the goal state is vague. Solving this problem first requires asking the right question: in which context would a shotgun and a glass of water help somebody? Rather than relying on obvious associations (e.g. a glass of water is related to thirst), solvers must fill the missing link between the relevant elements of the problem (a shotgun induces fear, and fear can be a remedy for hiccups, as can drinking a glass of water). Hence, restructuring the initial representation of a given problem would allow one to see this link and find its solution.

### Crowding in the emergency department: challenges and best practices for the care of children [^f0e48672]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Emergency department (ED) boarding and output contributors—The hours in the decision-to-departure time interval for patients admitted from the ED appear to be intimately tied to ED crowding, and in EDs where boarding occurs, average wait time to see an ED provider is 61 minutes, as opposed to 44 minutes in EDs where boarding does not occur. The key output factor related to crowding at the end of ED evaluation is boarding, primarily because of the lack of staffed inpatient beds. Patients requiring psychiatric inpatient admission have longer average LOS in the ED, and pediatric patients with mental–behavioral health emergencies awaiting bed placement are among some of the longest-boarded patients. As mentioned previously, access to primary and specialty care affects ED crowding and also affects ED output when ED and inpatient providers are unable to efficiently arrange adequate follow-up for patients being discharged. An often-unanticipated factor in the competition for inpatient beds is operating room scheduling and efficiency.

Disposition in the emergency department (ED)—pediatric-focused studies reporting safe discharge and observation times indicate: A prospective study of primarily pediatric patients included follow-up phone interviews with 33 patients who were either released on the scene or discharged from the ED within 1 to 6 h of arrival and found that none of these patients experienced delayed effects. A retrospective review of 48 pediatric drowning patients with Glasgow Coma Scale score 13 or above reported that all patients who deteriorated did so within 4 h of ED arrival and concluded that patients could be safely discharged home if normalized and if there was no deterioration in respiratory function after 4 to 6 h of observation in the ED. A retrospective review of hospitalized pediatric patients found that symptoms developed within 4.5 h in all but 1 patient and did so within 7 h in the final patient.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^61261dd3]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

KDOQI hemodialysis adequacy—dose targets and mortality context: In the United States, the average single-pool fractional urea clearance Kt/V (spKt/V) per dialysis given 3 times per week was 1.52, which continues to be significantly greater than the minimum of 1.2 established in 1994. The HEMO Study showed that the minimum dose established by the previous KDOQI guidelines is appropriate when dialysis is performed 3 times per week for 2.5 to 4.5 hours. Despite dose increases, the yearly mortality rate for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5 remains unacceptably high in the United States (>20% per year in 2002, and 17% per year in the HEMO Study), whereas in Japan annual mortality rates are less than 10%, and Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS) analyses show that these differences are not caused by different methods for gathering statistics. Recent data from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) show a reduction in mortality rates during the past 2 decades. Dialysis providers no longer need to focus on providing more dialysis by using bigger dialyzers and higher flow rates.

### A problem of persistence: still more questions than answers? [^1078e4fd]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2013). Medium credibility.

The current antibiotic resistance crisis has led to increased pressure to prioritize strategies to tackle the issue, with a strong focus being placed on the development of novel antimicrobials. However, one major obstacle that is often overlooked is persister cells, which are refractory to antibiotic treatment. Tackling persistence is a challenge because these cell types are extremely difficult to study and, consequently, little is known about their physiology and the factors that lead to their emergence. Here, four experts contemplate the main physiological features that define persistence and the implications of persistence for antibiotic treatment regimens, and consider what the study of bacterial persistence has taught us about the heterogeneity of bacterial populations.

### Midodrine hydrochloride (proAmatine) [^7ccd81f9]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

In a 2-day study, after open-label midodrine, known midodrine responders 
received midodrine 10 mg or placebo at 0, 3, and 6 hours. One-minute standing 
systolic blood pressures were increased 1 hour after each dose by about 15 mmHg 
and 3 hours after each dose by about 12mmHg; 3-minute standing pressures were 
increased also at 1, but not 3, hours after dosing. There were increases in 
standing time seen intermittently 1 hour after dosing, but not at 3 hours.

In a 1-day, dose-response trial, single doses of 0, 2.5, 10, and 20 mg of 
midodrine were given to 25 patients. The 10- and 20-mg doses produced increases 
in standing 1- minute systolic pressure of about 30 mmHg at 1 hour; the increase 
was sustained in part for 2 hours after 10 mg and 4 hours after 20 mg. Supine 
systolic pressure was =200 mmHg in 22% of patients on 10mg and 45% of patients 
on 20 mg; elevated pressures often lasted 6 hours or more.

### A model for the fragmentation kinetics of crumpled thin sheets [^a2bca16c]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

As a preliminary step, we derive the final displacement of the strip when folded at each break, in the absence of confinement. This problem can be mapped to the displacement of a walker performing a one-dimensional random walk with gamma-distributed steps. To enforce the concept of folding, the walker’s steps occur in alternating directions. The distribution f Z (z) of position Z after 2 k steps accurate for all k is derived in full in Supplementary Note 2. However, the salient trends may be likewise observed by applying the central limit theorem and considering the position Z valid for large k, or small step size, which givesand describes a normal distribution of zero mean and variance L 0 θ.

If a confinement is now introduced at the locations ∣ z ∣ = w, we next ask with what likelihood the walker steps beyond this confinement. One approach to approximate this probability is to integrate Eq. (16) for all ∣ z ∣ > w, producing a two-sided survival function of Eq. (16). Although this is not equivalent to our initial question, as intermediate steps may also have landed past ∣ z ∣ > w, it proves an acceptable estimate as the last step has the greatest variance. A more accurate calculation would be to evaluate the likelihood that a given walk escapes the confinement at any step; however, looking at the last step is useful for its simplicity in analytical form, and still captures the anticipated behavior. A comparison to the more accurate formulation is made numerically and provided in Supplementary Fig. 9. Once again, we pursue here the simpler form of the survival function valid for large k, and refer to Supplementary Note 2 for the exact derivation valid at all k. The survival function of Eq. (16), S Z (w ; θ) = P (∣ Z ∣ > w ; w ≥0), for a threshold confinement w, is given bywhere erf(z) is the error function. In order for walkers at ∣ z ∣ > w to be restored within the limits of confinement, one or more of their steps must fragment, thereby increasing the number of steps taken and decreasing the overall average, which drives the evolution of fragmentation. This articulates our key claim: considering our original, cylindrically shaped sheets as a statistical ensemble of one-dimensional random walks, we suggest that the progression of fragmentation measured by a change d t, over a single crumpling iteration d n, should be proportional to the fraction of walks in the ensemble which leave the confinement imposed at ∣ z ∣ = w : d t /d n ~ S Z (w ; θ). Equivalently, this is the likelihood that a single random walk leaves the critical confinement. We note that this resulting fragmentation rate describes an average fragmentation likelihood given only a confinement w and current temporal parameter t = 1/ θ describing the maturity of the fragmentation process thus far; it does not enforce direct correlations between successive crumpling iterations, whereby new folds should occur preferentially along previous ones. Instead, the decrease in fragmentation rate with n is encoded through the decreasing mean facet area with t. Moreover, while stronger correlation is expected between walks representing nearby transects of the sheet, here we consider the statistical behavior of the sheet as a whole, and account for the increased fragmentation likelihood for facets with larger horizontal extent through the weighting introduced in Eq. (15). At present, Eq. (17) gives the likelihood that new creases will form; however, it does not yet describe how much new damage is created, for which two additional factors should be considered: (1) When the sheet is strongly confined in closely packed layers, the layers tend to collectively fragment, as alluded to by Sultan and Boudaoudand Gottesman et al. thus contributing a factor p ~ 1/ L such that halving the final height doubles the number of additional ridges. (2) In the opposite limit of low compaction, facets are not in close proximity and need not behave cooperatively; thus, new damage scales linearly with the amount of compression L 0 − L, as argued in Gottesman et al. With these additional considerations, we propose that the evolution of the fragmentation process with crumpling iteration behaves aswhere α is a fitted constant of proportionality. We indicate the explicit dependence on t here, as t and θ are inversely related. The critical width w is determined by the geometry of the imposed confinement, as illustrated in Fig. 6 d; a complete derivation is provided in Supplementary Note 4 :where R is the radius of the container. By consequence of Eq. (14) we can directly relate Eqs. (18) and (12) asand obtain a fit to the proportionality constant α. By performing an asymptotic approximation in the limit of large t, detailed in Supplementary Note 3, Eq. (18) may be analytically integrated to provide a scaling relationwhich bears similarity toof Eq. (11):where,, and L 0 and R are the sheet length (equivalently the confining container height) and container radius, respectively. Taken together, Eqs. (14) and (21) thereby provide a theoretically motivated expressionbased on properties of fragmentation kinetics and a simple mechanism for re-fragmentation formulated as a random walk. Figure 7 compares the agreement of the empirical relations δ ℓ empir. and ℓ empir. as well as the derived models δ ℓ model and, with the measured quantitiesand ℓ meas. for various n. Collectively, the results of Figs. 4 and 7 demonstrate clear consistency of the fragmentation model with the anticipated logarithmic growth.

### 'Between-time stories': waiting, war and the temporalities of care [^0fadb9e7]. Medical Humanities (2020). Medium credibility.

But following this presence and contact there is the inevitable rupture of triage: “No, not that one. He can wait”. 52 Borden frequently describes her nursing of bodies in domestic terms: sewing, mending, laundry. Of one man waiting under electric light bulbs she writes, blankly: ‘leave him to cook there’. She necessarily turns her mind elsewhere, stepping out of the fantasy that there is no gap between need and fulfilment, but a voice calls out:

Sister! Oh, my sister, where are you?

[…] It is the blind man calling. I had forgotten him. I had forgotten he was there. He could wait. The others could not wait. So I had left and forgotten him.

She runs to him:

You are not alone, I lied. There are many of your comrades here and I am here, and there are doctors and nurses. […]

I thought, he murmured in that faraway voice, that you had gone away and forgotten me, and that I was abandoned here alone.

My body rattled and jerked like a machine out of order. I was awake now and seemed to be breaking to pieces. 53

The experience of being an oiled machine, of being ‘locked together’ that paradoxically produces a feeling of humane ‘life’, jams. Borden cowers behind a screen. The fullness of time is ruptured by the reality of the insufficiency of her care and attention and the violence as she is forced, by the brute presence of finite bodies and a production line of injuries, to drop the fantasy of a perfect fit between need and resources that would allow her to wait fully with these men. In the face of this rupture of care, however, a small repair is offered back—another domestic gesture—that is minimally inclined towards a future that can only be meagrely inhabited, but that exists nevertheless. In a gesture of making do, of all one can do, one of the old orderlies sticks his grizzled head around the corner of the screen: ‘He held his tin cup in his hands. It was full of hot coffee. He held it out, offering it to me. He didn’t know of anything else he could do for me’. 54

### Role of the intensity of habitual physical activity in the maintenance of normal blood pressure: findings from the SUN longitudinal cohort study [^99ee42ee]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

The baseline questionnaire asked, “How much do you usually walk each day?” (answer choices: <10 minutes/10–20 minutes/21–30 minutes/30 minutes–1 hour/1–2 hours/>2 hours) and “How many flights of stairs do you climb each day?” (≤2/3–4/5–9/10–14/≥15). We converted the number of flights of stairs into time climbing stairs (≤2 flights=30 s, 3–4 flights=1 minute 45 s, 5–9 flights=3 minutes 30 s, 10–14 flights=6 minutes, ≥15 flights=8 minutes 45 s).

The question set used to assess LTPA has been validated in our cohort.Participants were asked, “Do you exercise?” (yes/no), then directed to complete a 17‐item LTPA question set titled, “During the last year, how much time on average did you spend doing the following activities?.” Specified activities were “walking”; “jogging”; “running”; “cycling”; “stationary bike”; “swimming”; “racket sports”; “soccer and indoor soccer”; “other team sports (eg, basketball, handball)”; “dance and aerobics”; “hiking and rock‐climbing”; “gym‐based work outs”: “gardening, yard maintenance, pool maintenance and renovations”; “skiing, ice‐skating and rollerblading”; “judo, karate and martial arts”; “sailing” and “other sports or activities not listed.” The seasonal variation of LTPA was also taken into account: for each activity, participants answered, “Average time per week” (Never/1–4 minutes/5–19 minutes/20–59 minutes/<1 hour/1–1.5 hours/2–3 hours/4–6 hours/7–10 hours/≥11 hours) as well as “Months per year” (<3 months/3–6 months/>6 months). Reported time per week was multiplied by 0.125 for <3 months, or 0.375 for 3 to 6 months, or 0.75 for >6 months. Nonresponse for an activity was interpreted as nonparticipation, whereas partial response—that is, answering only “hours per week” or “months per year” but not both—was considered an incomplete answer. Participants with incomplete data for incidental PA or LTPA were excluded from the analysis. PA data were explored for plausibility and no data were identified as implausible.

### A review of current and emerging approaches to address failure-to-rescue [^d83dfdc5]. Anesthesiology (2011). Low credibility.

Failure-to-Rescue, defined as hospital deaths after adverse events, is an established measure of patient safety and hospital quality. Until recently, approaches used to address failure-to-rescue have been focused primarily on improvement of response to a recognized patient crisis, with limited success in terms of patient outcomes. Less attention has been paid to improving the detection of the crisis. A wealth of retrospective data exist to support the observation that adverse events in general ward patients are preceded by a significant period (on the order of hours) of physiologic deterioration. Thus, the lack of early recognition of physiologic decline plays a major role in the failure-to-rescue problem.

Study Assessments

Pain intensity (NPRS), vital signs, and oxygen saturation were assessed just prior to the first dose and at 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes, and 2, 3, 4, 6, and 48 hours (or at early discontinuation) after the first dose of study medication. Pain intensity was rated by subjects just prior to and 1 hour after each dose of study medication, and just prior to administration of supplemental analgesia (if needed) throughout the 48-hour treatment period. Pain relief (5-point pain relief scale) was assessed at the same time points as pain intensity with the exception of the baseline determination.

A responder at 24 and at 48 hours of treatment was defined as subjects who either rated 3 (good) or 4 (excellent) using the Subject Global Assessment scale and/or had at least a 30% improvement in the NPRS score from baseline to 24 or 48 hours. The number and proportion of subjects using rescue medication, the dose, and the time to first use were recorded.

AEs were recorded by study staff throughout the study, including time of onset, intensity, duration, causality, action taken, and outcome. The definitions for the severity of AEs were as follows: “awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated” (mild), “discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities” (moderate), or “incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities” (severe). Other safety assessments included physical examinations, electrocardiogram, vital signs (i.e. pulse, blood pressure, and respiratory rate), and laboratory testing at different study time points.

### Clustering knowledge and dispersing abilities enhances collective problem solving in a network [^77613a31]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Here, however, we find quite different results: intermixing hampers systemic performance. Furthermore, there is a tradeoff in systemic performance over time, as seen in Fig. 6b. Networks with some form of intermixing perform better in the short-run. However, the network with the minimal possible intermixing performs worse in the short-run but best in the long-run. In other words, this suggests an “all or nothing” trade-off over time: the configuration with the least amount of intermixing possible (minimal) performs worse in the short-run, but better in the long-run, while any gradation of increased intermixing yields the same rank-ordering in performance as their counterpart networks in the diversity of ability simulations.

Agents in the intermixed network setups explore for solutions early on in the simulation, which is a double-edged sword. In the short-run, with more intermixing, agents quickly turn to exploitation, as they merely take solutions that are marginally better relative to other setups but are still mediocre in absolute terms. Said differently, agents in setups with at least some intermixing quickly coalesce to whatever the few agents that did explore the problem space found, which are often not the best solutions possible. So, exploring the problem space using worse solutions often leads to modest gains. However, the agents in setups with minimal intermixing are more commonly exploring, rather than exploiting, because their neighbors’ initial solutions are less optimal than their counterparts in intermixed networks. This is because there is minimal exposure to diversity in these minimal setups, which inadvertently produces poor solutions in the short-run but allows for more exploration to find better solutions in the long-run. In other words, by finding better solutions through exploration, agents more often uncover pathways to better solutions earlier on. The end result is that the long-run performance of setups with minimal intermixing is best.

### Long-distance exploration in insightful problem-solving [^b11f65b1]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Insight is a sudden and often unexpected realization or understanding of a problem’s solution. This phenomenon is closely linked to the concept of the “Aha” moment, which describes the moment of clarity when an individual experiences a breakthrough in thinking that leads to a novel solution. The phenomenon of insight significantly contributes to many pivotal discoveries, and exploring its underlying mechanisms can help devise techniques to enhance creativity and advance artificial intelligence development. Insightful problem-solving, as opposed to the step-by-step analytical approach of non-insight solutions, is marked by the sudden realization of an answer, a strong conviction in its correctness, and the positive emotions that accompany it,–. However, despite these distinct phenomenological characteristics, the mechanisms underlying the insightful search process during problem-solving remain a subject of debate.

Several mechanistic theories have been proposed to elucidate how a problem solver navigates the solution space to reach an initially elusive solution. The constraint relaxation theory proposes that an effective search process for insightful solutions may involve the relaxation or elimination of certain counterproductive constraints, subsequently opening up new areas of the solution space for exploration –. Furthermore, the progress monitoring theory suggests that the progress of the search is constantly assessed, and insight involves the detection of insufficient progress and a consequent strategic shift,. The former theory describes a de-fixation process aimed at dissolving mental blockages, while the latter theory suggests an exploration process that allows a variety of alternative strategies to be considered. To avoid confusion, it is important to clarify that exploration is a key implication of the progress monitoring theory, but it is not equivalent to monitoring itself.

Hydrogen peroxide—microbicidal activity and effective concentrations/times: A 0.5% accelerated hydrogen peroxide demonstrated bactericidal and virucidal activity in 1 minute and mycobactericidal and fungicidal activity in 5 minutes, and organisms with high cellular catalase activity required 30–60 minutes of exposure to 0.6% hydrogen peroxide for a 108 reduction in cell counts whereas organisms with lower catalase activity required only 15 minutes’ exposure. For spores, a complete kill of 106 spores occurred with a 10% concentration and a 60-minute exposure time, while a 3% concentration for 150 minutes killed 106 spores in six of seven exposure trials. A 10% hydrogen peroxide solution resulted in a 103 decrease in B. atrophaeus spores and a ≥105 decrease when tested against 31 other pathogens in 30 minutes at 20°C. A 3.0% hydrogen peroxide solution was ineffective against VRE after 3 and 10 minutes exposure times and caused only a 2-log10 reduction in the number of Acanthamoeba cysts in approximately 2 hours. A 7% stabilized hydrogen peroxide proved to be sporicidal (6 hours of exposure), mycobactericidal (20 minutes), fungicidal (5 minutes) at full strength, virucidal (5 minutes) and bactericidal (3 minutes) at a 1:16 dilution, and the 7% solution was sporicidal (>7 log10 reduction in 6 hours).

### Crowding in the emergency department: challenges and best practices for the care of children [^67a9c163]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Emergency department (ED) crowding metrics and national measures—ambulance diversion and standardized indicators include that another metric that reflects degree of ED crowding is hours on ambulance diversion and, annually, more than 500 000 ambulances are diverted from the closest ED because of crowding. To establish common definitions, Welch et al and the American College of Emergency Physicians developed the first set of definitions and quality metrics for emergency care in 2006, and in 2010, the group reconvened and clarified definitions and time metrics. Length of stay (LOS), arrival-to-provider time interval, and left-without-being-seen rate have been endorsed by the National Quality Forum as quality measures, in 2013 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began requiring hospitals to report these same crowding measures, and the Joint Commission included median LOS and decision-to-departure (dwell) time for admitted patients in national hospital inpatient quality measures.

### The origin of a primordial genome through spontaneous symmetry breaking [^d2359709]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Fig. 4 
Evolutionary trajectories of the catalytic activities of the plus and minus strands (k P and k M, respectively). The values of k P and k M were averaged over all replicators at each time point. The arrows indicate different initial conditions; grey circles indicate equilibria. The values of V are shown above each graph: a. V = 100; b. V = 562; c. V = 900; d. V = 3500. The other parameters were the same as in Fig. 2. The data were obtained with the model in which kinetic symmetry is imposed (i.e. k PP = k PM and k MP = k MM) so that evolutionary trajectories can be depicted in a plane

To confirm the above hypothesis, we examined the effect of removing conflicting multilevel evolution. Specifically, we modified the model by assuming that replication occurs in one step instead of two (i.e. assuming that replication is instantaneous). Under this model, serving as a catalyst no longer incurs an immediate fitness cost to a replicator. Therefore, molecular-level evolution neither minimises nor maximises k xy values (i.e. neutral), whereas cellular-level evolution still tends towards maximising k xy values; i.e. evolution at the two levels are not in conflict with each other. This model displays no symmetry breaking for the examined range of V (V ≤ 10 5), confirming that conflicting multilevel evolution is a key cause of the symmetry breaking (Supplementary Fig. 3).

Functional symmetry breaking induces kinetic symmetry breaking

To investigate the mechanisms of the symmetry breaking, we sought to disentangle its functional and kinetic aspects. To this end, we imposed either functional or kinetic symmetry on the model. Specifically, kinetic symmetry was imposed by setting k PP = k PM and k MP = k MM for each replicator so that the plus strand and minus strand were replicated at identical rates. This constraint causes correlations between k xy values and, thereby, increases the amount of variation generated by mutation. However, this effect was cancelled out by modifying mutation step-size distributions (for details, see Methods section under ‘The correction for mutation step-size distributions’). Even with this constraint, we found that replicators still undergo functional symmetry breaking if V is sufficiently large (Fig. 2b, V ≥ 800). This result indicates that the functional symmetry breaking is independent of kinetic symmetry breaking.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING YOUR WALLET

Please Read Me!

□   Sunday Start

or

□   Day 1 Start

There are two ways to start taking birth control pills: Sunday Start or Day 1 Start.

Your healthcare provider will tell you which to use.

Save these instructions.

1 If this is the first time you are taking birth control pills, or if you have not taken birth control pills for 10 days or more, your first step is to wait until the first day you get your menstrual period. Then, follow these instructions for either Sunday Start or Day 1 Start.

2 When you get your period:

▪   You will use a Sunday Start if your doctor told you to take your first pill on a Sunday. Take pill "1" on the Sunday after your period starts. If your period starts on a Sunday, take pill "1" that day.

▪   You will use a Day 1 Start if your doctor told you to take pill "1" on the first day of your period.

3 Set the day:

▪   Pick the day label strip that starts with the first day of your period. Place this day label strip over the area that has the days of the week (starting with Sunday) pre-printed on the wallet (Refer figure below).

4. Remove pill "1" by pushing down on the pill. The pill will come out through a hole in the back of the strip.

5. Swallow the pill. You will take one pill each day. If you use a Sunday Start and you are taking the pill for the FIRST TIME, YOU MUST USE A BACK-UP METHOD OF BIRTH CONTROL FOR THE FIRST 7 DAYS. If you use a Day 1 Start, you are protected from becoming pregnant as soon as you take your first pill.

6.000000000000000e+00 Wait 24 hours to take your next pill. Continue to take one pill each day until all the pills have been taken.

7. Take your pill at the same time every day. It is important to take the correct pill each day and not miss any pills. To help you remember, take your pill at the same time as another daily activity, like turning off your alarm clock or brushing your teeth.

8. When your wallet is empty. You will start a new wallet on the day after pill "28."

9.000000000000000e+00 THE FIRST PILL IN EVERY WALLET WILL ALWAYS BE TAKEN ON THE SAME DAY OF THE WEEK, NO MATTER WHEN YOUR NEXT PERIOD STARTS.

### 2025 ACC / AHA / ACEP / NAEMSP / SCAI guideline for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^8e3870c2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes—ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with cardiogenic shock emergency revascularization is time-sensitive and favors rapid percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI): Among patients randomized to revascularization in the SHOCK trial, 64% underwent PCI and 36% coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and the median time from randomization to revascularization was 0.9 hours for PCI and 2.7 hours for CABG; observational data show that for every 10-minute delay in PPCI after 60 minutes from first medical contact (FMC) there are an additional 3 to 4 deaths per 100 with >80% mortality beyond 6 hours of delay. Therefore, it is recommended that PCI should be performed in patients with STEMI and cardiogenic shock as soon as possible, ideally within 90 minutes, to reduce mortality, and emergency CABG remains a treatment option when patients are not amenable to primary revascularization with PCI or when PCI is unsuccessful.

### Cutting edge or blunt instrument: how to decide if a stepped wedge design is right for you [^b279e70d]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

If we go further, and abandon the idea that all clusters must begin in the control condition and end in the intervention condition, we arrive at the design in figure 1D, in which all the clusters are randomised to one condition or the other for the duration of the trial—that is, a ‘parallel groups’ design conducted over the same timescale as our stepped wedge design. This turns out to be the most statistically powerful design we have yet considered. Not all of the clusters receive the intervention within 10 months, but we do not have to leave things like that: we could have an agreement with sites to roll out the intervention to all of them immediately after the 11-month trial period, while we get on with analysing and publishing our results.

But what about that excess power? Could we get away with collecting less data? Figure 1E–G shows designs run over a 6-month interval, still divided into 1 month periods. This shows that we can achieve 86% power with a design that randomises half the clusters to the intervention for 6 months, and half to control (figure 1G). With a bit more tweaking it may be possible to uncover even more powerful alternative designs,but this is not the point of the present exercise. The point is this: given 10 clusters and a step length of 1 month we might have jumped to the naïve conclusion that we should run a stepped wedge trial lasting 11 months. But this fixed idea would have prevented us from seeing in this instance that we could get the evidence we needed in a much shorter time and with a simpler design—randomising half the clusters to the intervention for 6 months, and half to control—with all sites then being free to receive the intervention (preferentially perhaps) or to go and seek it for themselves.

### Mastering diverse control tasks through world models [^a46dd543]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Break speed

In Minecraft, breaking blocks requires keeping the left mouse button pressed continuously for a few seconds, corresponding to hundreds of time steps at 20 Hz. For an initially uniform categorical policy with 25 actions, the chance of breaking a wood block that is already in front of the player would thus be. This makes the behaviour impossible to discover from scratch without priors of how humans use computers. Although this challenge could be overcome with specific inductive biases, such as learned action repeat, we argue that learning to keep the same button pressed for hundreds of steps does not lie at the core of what makes Minecraft an interesting challenge for artificial intelligence. To allow agents to learn to break blocks, we therefore follow previous work and increase the block-breaking speed, so that blocks break within a few time steps depending on the material. As can be seen from the tuned baselines, the resulting environment still poses a significant challenge to current learning algorithms.

Other environments

Voyager uses the substantially more abstract actions provided by the high-level MineFlayer bot scripting library, such as predefined behaviours for exploring the world until a resource is found and for automatically mining specified materials within a 32-m distance. It also uses high-level semantic observations instead of images. Unlike the Voyager environment, the MineRL competition environment requires visual perception and low-level actions for movement and the camera, such as having to jump to climb onto a block or rotate the camera to face a block for mining. VPTuses mouse movement for crafting and does not speed up block breaking, making it more challenging than the MineRL competition action space but easier to source corresponding human data. To learn under this more challenging set-up, its authors leverage significant domain knowledge to design a hierarchical action space composed of 121 actions for different foveated mouse movements and 4,230 meaningful key combinations. In summary, we recommend the MineRL competition environment with our categorical action space when a simple set-up is preferred, the Voyager action space for prompting language models without perception or low-level control, and the VPT action space when using human data.

### Frequent overcrowding in U.S. emergency departments [^5ca2b8f2]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the definition, extent, and factors associated with overcrowding in emergency departments (EDs) in the United States as perceived by ED directors.

Methods

Surveys were mailed to a random sample of EDs in all 50 states. Questions included ED census, frequency, impact, and determination of overcrowding. Respondents were asked to rank perceived causes using a five-point Likert scale.

Results

Of 836 directors surveyed, 575 (69%) responded, and 525 (91%) reported overcrowding as a problem. Common definitions of overcrowding (>70%) included: patients in hallways, all ED beds occupied, full waiting rooms >6 hours/day, and acutely ill patients who wait >60 minutes to see a physician. Overcrowding situations were similar in academic EDs (94%) and private hospital EDs (91%). Emergency departments serving populations < or =250,000 had less severe overcrowding (87%) than EDs serving larger areas (96%). Overcrowding occurred most often several times per week (53%), but 39% of EDs reported daily overcrowding. On a 1-5 scale (+/-SD), causes of overcrowding included high patient acuity (4.3 +/- 0.9), hospital bed shortage (4.2 +/- 1.1), high ED patient volume (3.8 +/- 1.2), radiology and lab delays (3.3 +/- 1.2), and insufficient ED space (3.3 +/- 1.3). Thirty-three percent reported that a few patients had actual poor outcomes as a result of overcrowding.

Conclusions

Episodic, but frequent, overcrowding is a significant problem in academic, county, and private hospital EDs in urban and rural settings. Its causes are complex and multifactorial.

### Forecasting emergency department crowding: an external, multicenter evaluation [^8a86216b]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We apply a previously described tool to forecast emergency department (ED) crowding at multiple institutions and assess its generalizability for predicting the near-future waiting count, occupancy level, and boarding count.

Methods

The ForecastED tool was validated with historical data from 5 institutions external to the development site. A sliding-window design separated the data for parameter estimation and forecast validation. Observations were sampled at consecutive 10-minute intervals during 12 months (n=52,560) at 4 sites and 10 months (n=44,064) at the fifth. Three outcome measures-the waiting count, occupancy level, and boarding count-were forecast 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours beyond each observation, and forecasts were compared with observed data at corresponding times. The reliability and calibration were measured following previously described methods. After linear calibration, the forecasting accuracy was measured with the median absolute error.

Results

The tool was successfully used for 5 different sites. Its forecasts were more reliable, better calibrated, and more accurate at 2 hours than at 8 hours. The reliability and calibration of the tool were similar between the original development site and external sites; the boarding count was an exception, which was less reliable at 4 of 5 sites. Some variability in accuracy existed among institutions; when forecasting 4 hours into the future, the median absolute error of the waiting count ranged between 0.6 and 3.1 patients, the median absolute error of the occupancy level ranged between 9.0% and 14.5% of beds, and the median absolute error of the boarding count ranged between 0.9 and 2.8 patients.

Conclusion

The ForecastED tool generated potentially useful forecasts of input and throughput measures of ED crowding at 5 external sites, without modifying the underlying assumptions. Noting the limitation that this was not a real-time validation, ongoing research will focus on integrating the tool with ED information systems.

### Suvorexant (Belsomra) [^5805c9e7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Use the lowest dose effective for the patient (2.1).
Recommended dose is 10 mg, no more than once per night taken within 30 minutes of going to bed, with at least 7 hours remaining before the planned time of awakening. If the 10 mg dose is well-tolerated but not effective, the dose can be increased, not to exceed 20 mg once daily (2.1, 2.2).
Time to effect may be delayed if taken with or soon after a meal (2.1).

2.1 Dosing Information

Use the lowest dose effective for the patient. For all BELSOMRA doses, take no more than once per night within 30 minutes of going to bed (with at least 7 hours remaining prior to planned awakening). Time to effect of BELSOMRA may be delayed if taken with or soon after a meal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

The recommended dose for BELSOMRA is 10 mg, taken no more than once per night. If the 10 mg dose is well-tolerated but not effective, the dose can be increased. The maximum recommended dose of BELSOMRA is 20 mg taken no more than once per night.

2.2 Special Populations

Exposure to BELSOMRA is increased in obese compared to non-obese patients, and in women compared to men. Particularly in obese women, the increased risk of exposure-related adverse effects should be considered before increasing the dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

2.3 Use with CNS Depressants

When BELSOMRA is combined with other CNS depressant drugs, dosage reduction of BELSOMRA and/or the other drug(s) may be necessary because of potentially additive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] .

2.4 Dosage Adjustments with CYP3A Inhibitors

When used with moderate CYP3A inhibitors, the recommended dosage of BELSOMRA is 5 mg taken no more than once per night (the dose generally should not exceed 10 mg). BELSOMRA is not recommended for use with strong CYP3A inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.2)] .

### Crowding in the emergency department: challenges and best practices for the care of children [^5caeacb1]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Emergency department crowding—safety risks, boarding effects, and patient experience—In the face of ED crowding, provider and staff engagement and its impact on patient safety cannot be ignored, and the ED is already a high-stress, high-risk area. The addition of boarded patients, unsatisfied patients, and inadequate equipment and human resources for the volume of patients adds to the risk of medical errors, reduction in educational time in academic centers, and ultimately detriments in job satisfaction and well-being for all. Boarding is believed to be one of the primary reasons for ED crowding and affects the care of all patients in the ED, because an ED filled with boarding patients has fewer open care areas in which to evaluate new patients who are presenting to the ED. General and PEDs are not designed to provide the ongoing care needed by admitted patients, and the ED is not staffed or resourced to provide ongoing critical care, leading to resource strain for other patients who continue to arrive for care in the ED. Numerous studies have identified the deleterious clinical outcomes for patients who are boarded in the ED, including treatment delays, increased medication errors, and ultimately longer lengths of hospital stay and increased morbidity and mortality. ACEP supports monitoring metrics that help establish benchmarks for rapid transport of admitted pediatric patients to inpatient beds and instituting processes to improve flow. Patient and family and provider experience are greatly affected by ED crowding; longer wait times are associated with decreased patient experience scores, and patients and families who choose to leave before seeing a provider are likely to report a less favorable patient experience.

### Potassium citrate (Urocit-K) [^8e3ef16a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Mild to Moderate Hypocitraturia

In patients with mild to moderate hypocitraturia (urinary citrate > 150 mg/day) therapy should be initiated at 30 mEq/day (15 mEq two times/day or 10 mEq three times/day with meals or within 30 minutes after meals or bedtime snack). Twenty-four hour urinary citrate and/or urinary pH measurements should be used to determine the adequacy of the initial dosage and to evaluate the effectiveness of any dosage change. Doses of Urocit-K greater than 100 mEq/day have not been studied and should be avoided.

Objective: To restore normal urinary citrate (greater than 320 mg/day and as close to the normal mean of 640 mg/day as possible), and to increase urinary pH to a level of 6.0 to 7.0.

Severe hypocitraturia (urinary citrate < 150 mg/day): therapy should be initiated at 60 mEq per day; a dose of 30 mEq two times per day or 20 mEq three times per day with meals or within 30 minutes after meals or bedtime snack (2.2)

Mild to moderate hypocitraturia (urinary citrate >150 mg/day): therapy should be initiated at 30 mEq per day; a dose of 15 mEq two times per day or 10 mEq three times per day with meals or within 30 minutes after meals or bedtime snack (2.3)

### Ready or not … [^66f9e54e]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

When I returned to reality equipped with my game plan, I quickly realized that my mental calisthenics were all theory, and I was far from ready.

I had no idea how to monitor and adjust her electrolytes when I could only check the baby’s laboratories, at best, once per day. I had no frame of reference for having nothing more than glucose and insulin to manage her initial hyperkalemia.

Dealing with her worsening respiratory distress was another beast all together. The piecemeal face mask that I held in place seemed to have more moving parts than a pinball machine. Holding the breathing apparatus together took both hands, leaving me defenseless to ward off a kamikaze bird that found its way into the treatment room of our pediatric ward and was feverishly trying to exit. I stood there, desperately trying to help the baby breathe, while avoiding the dive-bombing bird and waiting for the intern to traverse the hospital property to find our lone continuous positive airway pressure machine and mask.

The lost battle to the reckless bird was only an omen of things to come.

When the sun came up and my tiny patient’s condition was not improving, I was reluctantly ready to transfer her to the Big City Hospital (BCH) for a higher level of care. I had never been in a position of needing to send a patient to another facility. I had always worked for the hospital that provided the higher level of care. Now the shoe was on the other foot. Knowing we did not have much time, I quickly got over my pride and was ready to send her to BCH.

However, there was no separate ambulance and team to take her, as there would have been in the United States. I was not ready to ride in the back of a hulled-out old Land Cruiser, holding the baby in my arms for the entire 4-hour journey. Because there was no stretcher, isolette, or seat belts, holding the baby myself seemed like the best option. I wished I could have shared this duty with the kind nurse who volunteered to go with me, but the windy mountain road and her proclivity for car sickness resulted in 4 hours of violent vomiting.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^56b81d2a]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion—surveillance of chronic OME: Clinicians should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-mo intervals, children with chronic OME until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected (Recommendation).

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute carbon monoxide poisoning [^93686330]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Acute carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning—epidemiology, kinetics, and sequelae in emergency department populations include substantial burden and measurable benefits of oxygen therapy. There are approximately 50,000 emergency department visits per year, with an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 annual deaths from severe toxicity. CO binds hemoglobin with an affinity approximately 220 times that of oxygen, producing an elimination half-life of 4 to 5 hours without therapy; oxygen therapy decreases the elimination half-life to 85 minutes (range, 26 to 148 minutes) with normobaric oxygen and to 20 minutes with hyperbaric oxygen. Neurologic sequelae can be delayed by 2 to 21 days and have been described in 12% to 68% of poisoned patients, and mortality risk can be up to a 3-fold increase at a median follow-up of 7.6 years after exposure.

### Distal radius fracture rehabilitation [^f8745204]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Distal radius fracture rehabilitation—IPC versus cold packs (CPs) in the first postoperative week favored IPC for edema and finger motion by day 7. In an RCT after surgical fixation, the CP group used 20-minute applications 10 times/day over 7 days, while the IPC group received high-velocity impulses at 130 mmHg (2 sec long, 3 times per minute) for 1 hour, 5 times daily over 7 days; by the seventh day, significant differences favored the IPC group for edema (MD, 3 cm; P = .01) and digital total active motion (P = .001).

### Early prediction model of patient hospitalization from the pediatric emergency department [^7ca25c19]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Emergency departments (EDs) in the United States are overcrowded and nearing a breaking point. Alongside ever-increasing demand, one of the leading causes of ED overcrowding is the boarding of hospitalized patients in the ED as they await bed placement. We sought to develop a model for early prediction of hospitalizations, thus enabling an earlier start for the placement process and shorter boarding times.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of all visits to the Boston Children's Hospital ED from July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2015. We used 50% of the data for model derivation and the remaining 50% for validation. We built the predictive model by using a mixed method approach, running a logistic regression model on results generated by a naive Bayes classifier. We performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact of the model on overall resource utilization.

Results

Our analysis comprised 59033 patient visits, of which 11975 were hospitalized (cases) and 47058 were discharged (controls). Using data available within the first 30 minutes from presentation, our model identified 73.4% of the hospitalizations with 90% specificity and 35.4% of hospitalizations with 99.5% specificity (area under the curve = 0.91). Applying this model in a real-time setting could potentially save the ED 5917 hours per year or 30 minutes per hospitalization.

Conclusions

This approach can accurately predict patient hospitalization early in the ED encounter by using data commonly available in most electronic medical records. Such early identification can be used to advance patient placement processes and shorten ED boarding times.

### Committee opinion no. 680 summary: the use and development of checklists in obstetrics and gynecology [^6d342952]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

A Checklist for Checklists—development, drafting, and validation prompts provide concrete design and testing considerations. Development prompts include “Do you have clear, concise objectives for your checklist?” Drafting prompts ask whether a checklist will “Utilize natural breaks in workflow (pause points)?”, “Fit on one page?”, and “Is the font: Sans serif? Upper and lower case text? Large enough to be read easily? Dark on a light background?”, and whether “Are there fewer than 10 items per pause point?” and “Is the date of creation (or revision) clearly marked?” Validation prompts include “Trialed the checklist with frontline users (either in a real or simulated situation)?”, “Modified the checklist in response to repeated trials?”, and whether it will “Fit the flow of work?” and “Detect errors at a time when they can still be corrected?”, with attention to planning for future revision; additionally, “Please note: A checklist is NOT a teaching tool or algorithm.”
