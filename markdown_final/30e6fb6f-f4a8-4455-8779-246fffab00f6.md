## Question

What is the optimal oral antibiotic for cellulitis resulting from an insect bite?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which oral antibiotic is optimal for cellulitis resulting from an insect bite, including whether antibiotics are indicated, which agent to choose, the treatment duration, and when to add MRSA coverage. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing true bacterial cellulitis from a sterile insect bite reaction. Then, I should identify the likely pathogens if cellulitis is confirmed. Next, I will select a first-line oral antibiotic and dosing strategy, determine the evidence-based duration, define indications for MRSA-active therapy and the right combinations, outline non-antibiotic management for uncomplicated bites, and set reassessment criteria and safety netting plans.

> Let me first confirm whether this is cellulitis or a noninfectious insect bite reaction, because unnecessary antibiotics are common here and most bites do not require them. Wait, let me verify recent primary care data: UK practice-based studies show antibiotics were prescribed in roughly three-quarters of first-time insect bite consultations despite very low fever rates and limited systemic features, suggesting overdiagnosis and overtreatment; NICE guidance, as summarized in these reports, emphasizes that most insect bites do not need antibiotics and favors symptomatic care, which should temper premature antibiotic use in the absence of progressive spreading erythema or systemic signs [^116UCxDV] [^116uDnSW] [^115x7zLb]. Hold on, I should also remember how often cellulitis is misdiagnosed; pseudocellulitis is common, and early dermatology input reduces inappropriate antibiotics, so I need to ensure the diagnosis fits the pattern of spreading, tender warmth rather than predominant itch around a punctum without progression [^112bQrDj] [^114AhEfn].

> Next, I should review the likely pathogens if nonpurulent cellulitis is truly present after an insect bite. I need to check the dominant microbiology: for nonpurulent cellulitis, β-hemolytic streptococci predominate, with occasional MSSA, while MRSA is uncommon unless there are specific risk factors; prospective data in cellulitis cohorts show a high proportion due to β-hemolytic streptococci and a very low rate of MRSA, guiding us toward β-lactam therapy as first-line [^114LP8SG] [^112hv8YA] [^116Nd4xN]. But wait, what if there is purulence or an abscess present? That shifts the differential toward S. aureus and changes empiric coverage, so I should confirm nonpurulence and absence of drainage before applying standard non-MRSA regimens [^114LP8SG].

> I will now choose the first-line oral antibiotic for confirmed nonpurulent cellulitis without MRSA risk factors. Let me verify guideline concordance: a first-generation cephalosporin such as cephalexin is preferred for streptococci and MSSA coverage; cephalexin 500 mg orally four times daily is the commonly studied and guideline-supported regimen and serves as the control arm in the pivotal RCT for uncomplicated cellulitis, with dicloxacillin as an alternative where available or amoxicillin if staphylococcal coverage is less critical and streptococci are the main concern [^116aZEV3] [^116PoWQe] [^1112uFJm] [^115Bo85M]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; if there is beta-lactam allergy or regional resistance patterns suggest otherwise, I should adapt accordingly, but in most typical nonpurulent cases cephalexin is optimal [^116PoWQe].

> Now, I should confirm the treatment duration. I need to ensure we do not overtreat: high-quality guidance supports shorter courses with clinical follow-up; a 5 to 6 day course is recommended for nonpurulent cellulitis when the patient can self-monitor, with extension only if the clinical response is inadequate; the RCT comparing cephalexin with or without TMP-SMX used 7 days and provides a practical upper bound for uncomplicated cases [^111gsSaf] [^116PoWQe] [^1112uFJm]. Hmm, wait a minute, if improvement is slow but steady, extending to 7 days is reasonable, but routine 10–14 day courses are unnecessary unless the response is delayed or there are complicating factors [^116PoWQe].

> Next, I should review when to add MRSA coverage, because I need to avoid both under- and over-treatment. I should double-check the indications: purulent drainage or abscess, penetrating trauma, prior MRSA infection or colonization, injection drug use, systemic toxicity, or failure of appropriate β-lactam therapy within 48–72 hours are triggers to cover MRSA; otherwise, routine MRSA coverage is not recommended for typical nonpurulent cellulitis and adding TMP-SMX to cephalexin did not improve outcomes in the JAMA trial [^111zAoE9] [^116PoWQe] [^1112uFJm]. If MRSA coverage is indicated, I need to ensure streptococcal coverage: acceptable oral MRSA agents include TMP-SMX, doxycycline, clindamycin, or linezolid, but because TMP-SMX and doxycycline have unreliable streptococcal activity, they should be combined with a β-lactam such as cephalexin unless using clindamycin or linezolid monotherapy, per consensus and guideline recommendations [^111aNudS] [^1166kUD4] [^115M76PW].

> I will now emphasize non-antibiotic management when the presentation is consistent with a sterile insect bite reaction rather than cellulitis. Let me reconsider symptom predominance: itch with a visible punctum and limited local inflammation favors a bite reaction; in such cases, antihistamines for pruritus, topical corticosteroids for inflammation, local antiseptic care if skin is broken, and observation with clear return precautions are recommended strategies to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use while safely capturing early infection if it develops [^116UCxDV] [^117YTD4M] [^115x7zLb]. Hold on, I should verify patient instructions include marking the border of erythema and advice to return for rapidly spreading redness, fever, or new purulence, aligning with good stewardship and early detection principles [^115x7zLb] [^117YTD4M].

> Finally, I should set reassessment criteria and contingency plans. I need to check that we see early improvement by 48–72 hours with decreased erythema, swelling, and tenderness; if not, I should verify the diagnosis, consider pseudocellulitis mimics, perform ultrasound to exclude an occult abscess, and escalate to MRSA-active therapy when indicated or extend duration if the trajectory is improving but slow; culture is reserved for purulent infections, severe systemic illness, or suspected clusters [^1112uFJm] [^11689GoD] [^116PoWQe] [^112m3gRJ]. But wait, let's not jump to conclusions if erythema appears larger at 24 hours; early inflammatory flare does occur, so decisions should be anchored at the 48–72 hour mark unless there is clear clinical deterioration or sepsis [^116PoWQe].

> Putting this together, for confirmed nonpurulent cellulitis after an insect bite without MRSA risk factors, the best-supported oral regimen is cephalexin 500 mg four times daily for 5–7 days with close follow-up; routine MRSA coverage is unnecessary and adding TMP-SMX to cephalexin confers no benefit, while most simple insect bite reactions require no antibiotics and should be managed symptomatically with vigilant return precautions [^116PoWQe] [^111gsSaf] [^1112uFJm] [^116UCxDV]. I should confirm purulence, risk factors, and early response; if purulent or high risk, use TMP-SMX or doxycycline plus a β-lactam for streptococcal coverage, clindamycin alone, or linezolid in select cases, individualized to patient factors and local resistance patterns [^111aNudS] [^1166kUD4] [^115M76PW].

---

For uncomplicated cellulitis from an insect bite, the best oral antibiotic is **cephalexin 500 mg every 6 hours for 5–7 days** [^111gsSaf] because it reliably covers streptococci and MSSA, the usual pathogens [^112hv8YA] [^116aZEV3]. If MRSA risk is present [^111aNudS], add **doxycycline 100 mg twice daily** or **TMP-SMX 1–2 DS tablets twice daily** to cephalexin, or use clindamycin 300–450 mg every 6–8 hours alone [^115M76PW]. Use **amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg twice daily** if Pasteurella is suspected (e.g. cat bites). Treat for 5–7 days [^111gsSaf], extending to 10–14 days [^116PoWQe] if slow response or severe disease.

## Recommended oral antibiotics for cellulitis from insect bites

### First-line therapy (no MRSA risk)

In the absence of MRSA risk, **cephalexin (first-generation cephalosporin) 500 mg orally every 6 hours for 5–7 days** [^111gsSaf] is recommended [^116aZEV3] [^112hv8YA]; dicloxacillin (antistaphylococcal penicillin) 500 mg orally every 6 hours for 5–7 days is an alternative [^113EYPpq]. These agents cover streptococci and MSSA, the typical pathogens in nonpurulent cellulitis from insect bites [^112hv8YA].

---

### MRSA coverage (if risk factors present)

MRSA coverage is indicated for patients with a **history of MRSA** [^111aNudS], **recent hospitalization**, or where **community prevalence exceeds 20%**.

- **Clindamycin**: 300–450 mg orally every 6–8 hours for 5–7 days (covers MRSA and streptococci) [^1166kUD4].

- **Doxycycline**: 100 mg orally twice daily for 5–7 days (add amoxicillin 500 mg orally three times daily to cover streptococci) [^115M76PW].

- **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)**: 1–2 double-strength tablets orally twice daily for 5–7 days (add amoxicillin or cephalexin to cover streptococci) [^115M76PW].

---

### Special considerations (Pasteurella coverage)

Use **amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg orally twice daily for 5–7 days** when Pasteurella multocida is suspected (e.g. cat bites).

---

## Duration of therapy

Standard duration is **5–7 days** for uncomplicated cellulitis [^111gsSaf]; extend to **10–14 days** [^116PoWQe] for slow clinical response, severe infection, or immunocompromised hosts [^114Z8V8r].

---

## Clinical response and follow-up

Clinical improvement is expected within **48–72 hours**; reassess if there is no improvement or if symptoms worsen. Follow-up should confirm adherence, monitor for adverse effects, and adjust therapy based on response and any available culture results [^112m3gRJ].

### Cellulitis: A review of current practice guidelines and differentiation from pseudocellulitis [^112hv8YA]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Cellulitis, an infection involving the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, is the most common reason for skin-related hospitalization and is seen by clinicians across various disciplines in inpatient, outpatient, and emergency room settings. However, diagnosing and treating cellulitis can be a challenge. It is primarily diagnosed based on the history of present illness and physical examination, as there is no gold standard for diagnosis. The typical clinical presentation includes an acute onset of redness, warmth, swelling, tenderness, and pain.

Diagnosing cellulitis can be complicated by various infectious and non-infectious clinical mimickers, such as venous stasis dermatitis, contact dermatitis, eczema, lymphedema, and erythema migrans. Microbiological diagnosis is often difficult due to the poor sensitivity of culture specimens.

Most non-purulent, uncomplicated cases of cellulitis are caused by β-hemolytic streptococci or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. In these cases, appropriate targeted coverage with oral antibiotics such as penicillin, amoxicillin, and cephalexin is sufficient. Even with rising rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coverage for non-purulent cellulitis is generally not recommended.

### 2018 WSES/SIS-E consensus conference: Recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^111aNudS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). High credibility.

What oral antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs)? What intravenous antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections?

- **Oral antibiotic recommendations**: For oral antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: linezolid (recommendation 1A), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (recommendation 1B), a tetracycline (doxycycline or minocycline) (recommendation 1B), or tedizolid (recommendation 1A).

- **Intravenous antibiotic recommendations**: For intravenous (IV) antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: daptomycin (10 mg/kg/dose IV once daily) (recommendation 1A), IV linezolid (recommendation 1A), IV ceftaroline (recommendation 1A), IV dalbavancin (recommendation 1A), IV vancomycin (recommendation 1A), IV tigecycline (recommendation 1A), or IV tedizolid (recommendation 1A).

- **Duration and transition of therapy**: Seven to 14 days of therapy is recommended but should be individualized on the basis of the patient's clinical response (recommendation 1A). IV to oral switch should occur when criteria of clinical stability have been reached (recommendation 1C).

- **Community-associated MRSA**: For CA-MRSA, recommended oral agents are clindamycin, although clindamycin resistance is now very common, tetracyclines, TMP-SMX, linezolid, tedizolid, and occasionally, fluoroquinolones. Several observational studies and one small randomized trial suggest that TMP-SMX, doxycycline, and minocycline are effective for such infections. If coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired for oral therapy, options include clindamycin alone, or the combination of either TMP-SMX or doxycycline with an additional agent.

### Effect of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole vs cephalexin alone on clinical cure of uncomplicated cellulitis: A randomized clinical trial [^1112uFJm]. JAMA (2017). High credibility.

The importance of this study is highlighted by the increased number of emergency department visits for skin infections in the United States, particularly with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In cases of cellulitis without purulent drainage, β-hemolytic streptococci are generally presumed to be the predominant pathogens. It remains uncertain if antimicrobial regimens that possess in vitro MRSA activity provide improved outcomes compared with treatments that lack MRSA activity.

The objective of this study was to determine whether the combination of cephalexin with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole would result in a higher clinical cure rate for uncomplicated cellulitis than cephalexin alone.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This multicenter, double-blind, randomized superiority trial was conducted in 5 US emergency departments. It involved outpatients older than 12 years with cellulitis, and no wound, purulent drainage, or abscess. Participants were enrolled from April 2009 through June 2012, and all underwent soft tissue ultrasound at enrollment to exclude abscess. The final follow-up was in August 2012.

- **Interventions**: Participants received cephalexin, 500 mg, 4 times daily, plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 320 mg/1600 mg, twice daily for 7 days (n = 248), or cephalexin plus placebo for 7 days (n = 248).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome, determined a priori for the per-protocol group, was clinical cure. Clinical cure was defined as the absence of the following clinical failure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (> 25%), swelling, or tenderness (days 3–4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or tenderness (days 8–10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness (days 14–21).

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices [^113swjNC]. Family Practice (2023). Low credibility.

- **Recorded features of bites**: Time from the presentation was recorded in 79.2% of cases, with the mode of presentation being 1–3 days post-bite in 42.5% of the cohort. There was a range of presentations from within 1 day to over 3 weeks. Single bite presentations occurred in 58.3% of cases, multiple bites in 38%, and 3.7% were unrecorded. The site was not recorded in 58% of cases, perhaps due to image use, but when recorded, the bites were mainly on the lower limb (27%), while 2.3% were recorded as facial, and 0.9% involving the eye area.

- **Recorded symptoms and signs**: These were reported by patients or general practice clinicians (GPCs) during the consultation. Redness was noted in 77.7%, itch in 45.4%, heat in 36.9%, and pain in 31.5% of the cases. Swelling was recorded in 19.7% and discharge in 6.8%. Systemic symptoms such as malaise were recorded in 10.7% of cases, with 8.1% of malaise reported in phone-only consultations. Pyrexia (> 37.5°C) was found in 1.4% and other vital signs, such as pulse, in 7.6% of the cohort. We cannot report on comorbidities as it was unclear if these were used by GPCs accessing "digital problem screens", nor could we analyze the size of bites due to uncertainty if size included areas of surrounding inflammation. No systemic allergic reactions or other insect-borne diseases, such as Lyme disease, were presented, as Lyme disease cases had already been excluded.

### Patients' understanding of cellulitis and views about how best to prevent recurrent episodes: Mixed-methods study in primary and secondary care [^1166SdXy]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute, painful, and potentially serious bacterial infection of the skin and underlying tissue that can have a substantial impact on patients. Pain, feeling very unwell, and the need for elevation of the affected limb can result in reduced quality of life and substantial periods of work absence among people with cellulitis. Cellulitis also places a considerable burden on the National Health Service (NHS). Between 2015 and 2016, 123,644 patients were admitted to hospitals in England for cellulitis. While even a single episode of cellulitis can have a substantial impact on quality of life, approximately one-third of people with cellulitis suffer recurrent episodes. Risk factors for the recurrence of cellulitis include previous episode(s) of cellulitis, lymphoedema, obesity, diabetes, and skin disorders producing breaks in the skin (e.g. fungal foot disease, dry skin, or insect bites).

The only treatment shown to reduce the risk of recurrence is long-term, low-dose antibiotics. This strategy has not been widely implemented, possibly because of growing pressure to reduce antibiotic prescribing amidst fears of antibiotic resistance and possible side effects. The risk of further episodes may also be reduced by the use of emollients for the prevention of dry, cracked skin, checking for and treating tinea pedis, and managing lymphoedema using compression garments.

There has been little research into the role of skin care in the prevention of cellulitis, but a role for dry skin has been hypothesized, and the regular application of emollient has been shown to reduce dry skin.

### Prevention and treatment of recurrent cellulitis [^111e2hiG]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Recurrent cellulitis is a challenging clinical condition affecting up to 47% of patients after the first episode, especially those with predisposing risk factors. The purpose of this review is to describe the state of the art of literature evidence and to highlight recent developments in its management.

- **Recent findings**: Recurrent cellulitis can occur after successful treatment of cellulitis. Conditions that commonly increase the risk include local and systemic, modifiable and nonmodifiable factors. A rigorous approach to managing risk factors and treating acute infection is important, as the risk of recurrence rises with repeated episodes. Risk factors, if present, need to be targeted in association with antibiotic prophylaxis. Penicillin V is the preferred antibiotic for prevention, but other antibiotics and new drugs can be considered in cases of β-lactam allergy, intolerance, or failure.

- **Summary**: Recurrent cellulitis is associated with short-term and long-term morbidity, as well as significant healthcare costs. Managing underlying predisposing conditions is crucial to prevent recurrence. This should be accompanied by an evaluation of pharmacological measures, but specialized and multidisciplinary skills are needed. More efforts are needed to prevent and treat this underestimated problem.

### Patients' understanding of cellulitis and views about how best to prevent recurrent episodes: Mixed-methods study in primary and secondary care [^1131R2RH]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common and painful infection of the skin and underlying tissues, recurring in approximately one-third of cases. The only proven strategy to reduce recurrence risk is long-term, low-dose antibiotics. Due to concerns about antibiotic resistance and the pressure to reduce antibiotic prescribing, alternative prevention strategies are necessary.

A study was conducted to explore patients' views on cellulitis and different ways to prevent recurrent episodes. Adults aged 18 years and older, with a history of first-episode or recurrent cellulitis, were invited through primary care, hospitals, and advertising to complete a survey, participate in an interview, or both.

Thirty interviews were conducted between August 2016 and July 2017, with 240 surveys completed, resulting in a response rate of 17%. The triangulation of quantitative and qualitative data revealed that individuals who have experienced cellulitis hold diverse beliefs about its causes. They are often unaware of the recurrence risk or strategies to prevent it. Enhanced foot hygiene, applying emollients daily, exercising, and losing weight emerged as more popular potential strategies compared to the use of compression stockings or long-term antibiotics. Participants expressed caution regarding long-term oral antibiotics, especially those who had only experienced one cellulitis episode.

In conclusion, individuals who have had cellulitis are eager to learn about possible ways to prevent further episodes. Enhanced foot hygiene, applying emollients daily, exercising, and losing weight were generally favored over other strategies.

### A double-blind randomized controlled trial of ibuprofen compared to placebo for uncomplicated cellulitis of the upper or lower limb [^113L5GLg]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2017). High credibility.

Cellulitis is a common skin infection resulting in inflammation that may take weeks to resolve despite appropriate antibiotics. It is unclear whether the adjunctive use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs hastens the resolution of inflammation in patients with cellulitis.

- **Objectives**: We conducted a double-blind, randomized controlled trial comparing ibuprofen 400 mg three times daily for 5 days with an identical placebo in adults with uncomplicated cellulitis of the upper or lower limb who were treated with intravenous cefazolin via an outpatient parenteral antibiotic treatment service at one of two Australian hospitals. Participants were assessed twice daily by a study nurse. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with regression of inflammation 48 hours after the first effective dose of parenteral antibiotics (trial registration ANZCTR 12611000515998).

- **Results**: Fifty-one patients were enrolled; 48 had sufficient data available to be included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. Inflammation had begun to regress at 48 hours in 20 participants (80%) in the ibuprofen group compared to 15 (65%) in the placebo group (absolute risk difference +15%; 95% confidence interval -10 to +40; p > 0.05). There was no significant difference in any secondary outcome. Ibuprofen appeared safe, with no patients developing renal impairment or necrotizing fasciitis.

- **Conclusions**: This trial demonstrated no significant benefit of adjunctive ibuprofen in adults with uncomplicated cellulitis. The trial was powered to detect a large effect, and hence it is concluded that ibuprofen did not significantly contribute to the resolution of inflammation.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cellulitis, specifically with respect to the management of recurrent cellulitis and hygiene practices, the IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend offering preventive educational messages on personal hygiene and appropriate wound care for all patients with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). Counsel regarding the following:

- **Keep draining wounds covered**: Ensure they are covered with clean, dry bandages.
- **Maintain good personal hygiene**: Regularly bathe and clean hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand gel, especially after touching infected skin or an item that has directly contacted a draining wound.
- **Avoid reusing or sharing personal items**: Do not reuse or share items such as disposable razors, linens, and towels that have contacted infected skin.

### Clinical response to antibiotic regimens in lower limb cellulitis: A systematic review [^111DTneb]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

There is variation in the treatment of lower limb cellulitis (LLC) with no agreement on the most effective antibiotic regimen. Many patients with cellulitis fail to respond to first-line antibiotics. This can negatively affect patient care and result in unnecessary hospital admissions. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the clinical response and safety of antibiotic regimens for the management of LLC. A systematic review for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted using OVID MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in January 2019. Outcomes of interest included the clinical response to antibiotic regimens (type, dose, route, duration) and the safety of antibiotics in LLC. Trial quality was identified using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.

Four RCTs were included. All included studies showed no significant differences between the clinical response to different antibiotic types, administration routes, treatment durations, or doses. LLC may be overtreated, and shorter courses of oral antibiotics, possibly with lower doses, may be more suitable. There is a lack of published data on the clinical response and safety of antibiotics in LLC. Three studies were high risk for bias overall. Further high-quality studies may help determine whether less intensive antibiotic regimens can effectively treat LLC.

### Patients' understanding of cellulitis and views about how best to prevent recurrent episodes: Mixed-methods study in primary and secondary care [^111Qn923]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

We explored differences among survey respondents in their willingness to adopt cellulitis prevention behaviors, comparing participants who had experienced one episode of cellulitis with participants who had experienced recurrent episodes. Only willingness to take antibiotics daily to prevent cellulitis showed a statistically significant difference between the two groups. Participants who had experienced two or more episodes of cellulitis reported they were more willing to take antibiotics daily (47%) compared with participants who had only experienced one episode (27%). This was reflected in the qualitative data. Some interviewees with recurrent cellulitis who were already taking low-dose antibiotics appeared happy with this, and those who were already taking several other medications felt that adding something else in would not bother them.

"Well, I take quite a lot of medication, so it wouldn't bother me, because it is another tablet, just adding on to that, so it doesn't bother me".

### Empiric outpatient therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cephalexin, or clindamycin for cellulitis [^114ha5U7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Limited data exist on optimal empiric oral antibiotic treatment for outpatients with cellulitis in areas with a high prevalence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections.

- **Methods**: We conducted a 3-year retrospective cohort study of outpatients with cellulitis empirically treated at a teaching clinic of a tertiary-care medical center in Hawaii. Patients who received more than one oral antibiotic, were hospitalized, or had no follow-up information were excluded. Treatment success rates for empiric therapy were compared among commonly prescribed antibiotics in our clinic: cephalexin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and clindamycin. Risk factors for treatment failure were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis.

- **Results**: Of 544 patients with cellulitis, 405 met the inclusion criteria. The overall treatment success rate of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was significantly higher than the rate of cephalexin (91% vs. 74%; p < 0.001). Clindamycin success rates were higher than those of cephalexin in patients who had subsequently culture-confirmed MRSA infections (P = 0.01), had moderately severe cellulitis (P = 0.03), and were obese (P = 0.04). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus was recovered in 72 of 117 positive culture specimens (62%). Compliance and adverse drug reaction rates were not significantly different among patients who received these three antibiotics. Factors associated with treatment failure included therapy with an antibiotic that was not active against community-associated MRSA (adjusted odds ratio 4.22; 95…).

### Management of cellulitis in a pediatric emergency department [^112AAE7s]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were twofold. First, it aimed to determine the antibiotic choices, route of administration, and outcomes of children treated as outpatients with noncomplicated, nonfacial cellulitis at a tertiary care center. Second, it sought to determine the number of visits and time spent in the emergency department (ED) for treatment.

This study was a descriptive case-control study conducted in a tertiary care pediatric ED at an academic medical center. Medical records of all otherwise healthy children (aged 1–16 years) presenting with noncomplicated, nonfacial cellulitis over a 3-year period (January 1, 2001-December 31, 2003) were reviewed. Data extracted included demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory and microbiology results, and management, including choice, dose, and route of antibiotic(s). Treatment failures and time spent in the ED were also analyzed.

In total, 269 patients met the inclusion criteria, and their charts were selected for review. The oral antibiotic most often prescribed was cephalexin (N = 105). Treatment failure occurred in 10 (8.9%) of the cases. The intravenous antibiotic most often prescribed was cefazolin (N = 124), with 39 receiving cefazolin alone and 85 receiving cefazolin and probenecid. The cefazolin-only group had 12 (31%) treatment failures, whereas the cefazolin and probenecid group had 7 (8.1%) treatment failures. Patients in the intravenous group spent more time in the ED (521 ± 287 minutes) and had more visits (3.4 ± 2.8) compared to the oral group (time in ED, 164 ± 139 minutes; visits, 1.4 ± 1).

### Effectiveness of oritavancin for management of skin and soft tissue infections in the emergency department: A case series [^112nXmdk]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections, such as cellulitis, are commonly diagnosed in the emergency department. These patients are often admitted to the hospital for intravenous antibiotic therapy. Oritavancin is a novel antibiotic approved for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections and is administered as a one-time infusion. While oritavancin has demonstrated comparable efficacy with multi-dose parenteral antibiotics in clinical trials and has been proposed as an alternative to admission for emergency department patients, there is a paucity of available real-world effectiveness data.

In this case series, we describe the characteristics and outcomes of ten patients with high-risk skin and soft tissue infections who received oritavancin and were discharged from the emergency department.

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices [^116UCxDV]. Family Practice (2023). High credibility.

These results highlight a mean incidence of first presentation to general practices of insect bites of 8 per 100,000 population weekly over the six months of the study. A study from 1999–2003 exploring both insect bites and impetigo reported an incidence of 5.4 per 100,000 population in England as well as Wales over 12 months. As insect bite incidence reduces in the winter, our figure is comparable but does not represent additional consultations by alternative primary care providers.

In contrast to NICE guidance, 74% of our patients received an oral or topical antibiotic, most commonly flucloxacillin. This choice adheres to guideline recommendations for cellulitis, and some prescribing reflected reported patient adverse reactions or allergies. Flucloxacillin for insect bites is, therefore, a small contributor to the rise in flucloxacillin practice prescribing over the summer months. We found a difference between the previously reported idealisation of practice by surveyed GPs and practice-based clinician activity; for example, vital signs were not prime factors in antibiotic prescribing. Either there is a high incidence of cellulitis, or there is overprescribing, with scope to improve antibiotic stewardship by exploring management as the next stage of quality improvement. Although a small effect at the level of ten practices, the potential impact on antibiotic stewardship at the UK level is significant.

In addition, most patients still contact their general practices first but meet an expanded clinical team with nurses over a third of consulters. Almost 70% of consultations start by phone.

### Top 10 myths regarding the diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis [^111CRrQw]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is commonly treated in the emergency department (ED). Patients who present with cellulitis incur significant healthcare costs and may be overtreated with antibiotics. The accurate diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis play an important role in cost-effective, high-quality medical care, as well as appropriate antibiotic utilization.

- **Objective**: We aim to describe common fallacies regarding cellulitis. We present 10 myths that result in misdiagnosis, overtreatment, or inappropriate empiric management of cellulitis. Clinical presentation, including swelling and redness, is explored in depth, along with the incidence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, management of tick bites, and effective antibiotic therapy for cellulitis.

- **Discussion**: Patients are often treated for cellulitis unnecessarily or inappropriately. Awareness of these myths will help guide providers in clinical decision-making in order to effectively tailor treatment for these infections.

- **Conclusions**: Cellulitis is not as simple as it might seem, and is commonly misdiagnosed in the ED. Noninfectious causes of local symptoms, including lymphedema, venous stasis, and deep vein thrombosis need to be considered. Cellulitis should be treated with empiric antimicrobial therapy based on patient risk factors and regional susceptibility patterns. This review will assist providers in managing cellulitis and avoiding treatment errors that lead to high costs, unwanted side effects for patients, and overuse of antibiotics.

Regarding medical management for cellulitis, specifically in relation to antibiotic therapy and MRSA coverage, the IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend considering the administration of a β-lactam antibiotic, such as cefazolin, in hospitalized patients with nonpurulent cellulitis. This should be modified to MRSA-active therapy if there is no clinical response. Treatment should continue for 7–14 days while individualizing based on the patient's clinical response.

### Outcomes of early dermatology consultation for inpatients diagnosed with cellulitis [^112bQrDj]. JAMA Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Many inflammatory skin dermatoses mimic cellulitis (pseudocellulitis) and are treated with antibiotics and/or hospitalization, leading to unnecessary patient morbidity and substantial health care spending. To evaluate the impact of early dermatology consultation on clinical and economic outcomes associated with misdiagnosed cellulitis, a prospective cohort study was conducted.

The study enrolled patients with a presumed diagnosis of cellulitis in the emergency department, in the emergency department observation unit, or within 24 hours of admission to an inpatient unit of a large urban teaching hospital between February and September 2017. Patients were provided with telephone and clinic follow-up during the 30-day post-discharge period. We screened 165 patients with the primary concern of cellulitis, excluding 44 who required antibiotics for cutaneous, soft-tissue, and deeper-tissue and/or bone infections irrespective of cellulitis status, and 5 who were scheduled to be discharged by the emergency department.

- **Interventions**: Early dermatology consultation for presumed cellulitis.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Primary outcomes were patient disposition and rates of antibiotic use.

Of 116 patients (63 [54.3%] women; 91 [78.4%] non-Hispanic white; mean [SD] age, 58.4 [19.1] years), 39 (33.6%) were diagnosed with pseudocellulitis by dermatologists. Of these, 34 (87.2%) had started using antibiotics for presumed cellulitis as prescribed by the primary team at the time of enrollment. The dermatology team recommended discontinuing antibiot

### Cellulitis and erysipelas [^117YVujD]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common problem, caused by spreading bacterial inflammation of the skin, with redness, pain, and lymphangitis. Up to 40% of affected people have systemic illness. Erysipelas is a form of cellulitis with marked superficial inflammation, typically affecting the lower limbs and the face. The most common pathogens in adults are streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. Cellulitis and erysipelas can result in local necrosis and abscess formation. Around a quarter of affected people have more than one episode of cellulitis within 3 years.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for cellulitis and erysipelas? What are the effects of treatments to prevent recurrence of cellulitis and erysipelas? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to May 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 14 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, comparative effects of different antibiot…

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in adults and children [^113PEzgy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cellulitis, specifically in the management of recurrent skin and soft tissue infections (reSSTIs), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) 2011 guidelines recommend considering environmental hygiene measures in patients with reSSTIs in household or community settings. Counsel patients on the following:

- **Focus on high-touch surfaces**: Clean surfaces that frequently come into contact with people's bare skin, such as counters, door knobs, bathtubs, and toilet seats. These surfaces may come into contact with bare skin or uncovered infections.
- **Use appropriate cleaning products**: Employ commercially available cleaners or detergents suitable for the surface being cleaned. Follow the label instructions for routine cleaning of surfaces.

These guidelines aim to reduce the risk of infection transmission through improved hygiene practices.

### Effect of dermatology consultation on outcomes for patients with presumed cellulitis: A randomized clinical trial [^1114XDHs]. JAMA Dermatology (2018). High credibility.

Each year, cellulitis leads to 650,000 hospital admissions and is estimated to cost $3.7 billion in the United States. Previous literature has demonstrated a high misdiagnosis rate for cellulitis, which results in unnecessary antibiotic use and health care costs.

The objective was to determine whether dermatologic consultation decreases the duration of hospital stay or intravenous antibiotic treatment duration in patients with cellulitis.

This randomized clinical trial was conducted in a large urban tertiary care hospital between October 2012 and January 2017, with a 1-month follow-up duration. Patients were randomized into the control group, which received the standard of care (i.e. treatment by the primary medicine team), or the intervention group, which received dermatology consultation. Medical chart reviews of demographic information and hospital courses were performed. Adult patients hospitalized with a presumed diagnosis of cellulitis were eligible. A total of 1300 patients were screened, with 1125 being excluded and 175 included. Statistical analysis was employed to identify significant outcome differences between the two groups.

- **Interventions**: Dermatology consultation within 24 hours of hospitalization.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Length of hospital stay and duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment.

Of the 175 participants, 70 (40%) were women, and 105 (60%) were men. The mean age was 58.8 years. Length of hospital stay was not statistically different between the two groups. The duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment (< 4 days: 8

### Prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of cellulitis (erysipelas) of the leg: Results of the UK Dermatology Clinical Trials Network's PATCH II trial [^11788AUH]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Cellulitis, also known as erysipelas, of the leg is an acute, painful, and potentially serious infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue associated with significant morbidity and health costs. Inpatient admission costs alone amounted to £96 million in 2009/2010. It is usually due to streptococcal infection. Risk factors for cellulitis of the leg include previous episodes of cellulitis, lymphoedema, toe web maceration, obesity, and diabetes. Many patients experience recurrent episodes (30–50%), which can lead to subsequent lymphoedema and ulceration.

Evidence for the use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent further episodes is very limited. Three small randomized controlled trials (RCTs) hint at possible benefit, involving 16, 40, and 58 participants, respectively. Some clinical guidelines recommend long-term antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with predisposing conditions. However, such recommendations are largely based on empirical evidence, and clinical opinion is mixed.

Two trials of cellulitis prophylaxis have been initiated by the UK Dermatology Clinical Trials Network. PATCH I has recruited to target and is due to report in 2012, assessing the impact of 12 months of prophylactic phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V) in patients with recurrent cellulitis (at least two previous episodes). The PATCH II trial, reported here, assesses whether 6 months of prophylaxis with penicillin V is effective in reducing repeat episodes of cellulitis of the leg in patients who have had one or more episodes.

Regarding the medical management of cellulitis, particularly in the context of antibiotic therapy, the Infectious Diseases Society of America's 2014 guidelines recommend administering vancomycin or another antimicrobial agent effective against both MRSA and streptococci. This is advised for patients with cellulitis who present with any of the following conditions:

- **Associated penetrating trauma**: Patients exhibiting trauma should receive MRSA coverage.
- **Evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere**: A history or presence of an MRSA infection in another part of the body warrants appropriate coverage.
- **Nasal colonization with MRSA**: Individuals colonized with MRSA in the nasal passages require the mentioned antibiotic therapy.
- **Injection drug use**: Those with a history of injection drug use are at increased risk and should receive MRSA coverage.
- **Sepsis syndrome**: Antibiotic therapy is critical for patients showing signs of sepsis syndrome.

### Interventions for the prevention of recurrent erysipelas and cellulitis [^1139Z69g]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

Erysipelas and cellulitis (hereafter referred to as 'cellulitis') are common bacterial skin infections usually affecting the lower extremities. Despite their significant burden of morbidity, the evidence for different prevention strategies remains unclear.

The primary objective was to assess the beneficial and adverse effects of antibiotic prophylaxis or other prophylactic interventions for the prevention of recurrent episodes of cellulitis in adults aged over 16.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to June 2016: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. Additionally, we searched five trials registry databases, the reference lists of included studies, and reviews for further references to relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Searches were also conducted in two sets of dermatology conference proceedings and BIOSIS Previews.

- **Selection criteria**: We considered randomized controlled trials evaluating any therapy for the prevention of recurrent cellulitis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently performed study selection, data extraction, assessment of risks of bias, and analyses. The primary prespecified outcome was the recurrence of cellulitis during and after the treatment. Secondary outcomes included incidence rate, time to next episode, hospitalization, quality of life, development of resistance to antibiotics, adverse reactions, and mortality.

- **Main results**: We included six trials with a total of 573 evaluable participants, whose average age ranged between 50 and 70. There were no further details provided on the main results.

### Prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of cellulitis (erysipelas) of the leg: Results of the UK dermatology clinical trials network's PATCH II trial [^115ovTke]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Recruitment took place in 20 hospitals between August 2006 and August 2008. Patients were identified either at presentation in secondary care (through emergency departments, medical admissions units, medical wards, and outpatient clinics) or retrospectively via discharge coding or poster adverts.

Eligible participants had a diagnosis of cellulitis of the leg within the last 12 weeks (index episode). Cellulitis was defined as a confirmed diagnosis of cellulitis by the recruiting dermatologist. If the patient was not seen by the recruiting clinician during the acute phase, validation of the diagnosis was sought from medical case notes in combination with patient discussion. In this case, the following criteria were met: (i) local warmth and tenderness or acute pain, (ii) unilateral erythema or asymmetrical erythema with the more severe side having a temporal relationship to the symptoms, and (iii) unilateral oedema. Any doubt over the certainty of the diagnosis was grounds for exclusion.

Patients were excluded from the trial if: (i) they had taken antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of cellulitis within 6 months of the index episode, (ii) it was longer than 12 weeks since the start of treatment for the index episode to the date of the baseline visit, (iii) they had a known allergy to penicillin V, (iv) they had preceding leg ulceration, surgery, or major penetrating trauma, because these cases were more likely to be caused by staphylococcal infection, which is not susceptible to penicillin V, and (v) the recruiting clinician was unwilling.

Regarding the medical management of cellulitis, particularly concerning antibiotic therapy and MRSA coverage, the IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend considering the administration of any of the following agents for hospitalized patients with complicated SSTIs, such as deeper soft tissue infections, surgical or traumatic wound infections, major abscesses, cellulitis, or infected ulcers and burns, pending culture results, alongside surgical debridement and broad-spectrum antibiotics:

- **IV vancomycin**: Administer as directed based on the severity and type of infection.
- **IV or PO linezolid**: 600 mg BID to ensure effective bactericidal concentration.
- **IV daptomycin**: 4 mg/kg/dose once daily for potent bactericidal activity.
- **IV telavancin**: 10 mg/kg/dose once daily, especially in resistant cases.
- **IV or PO clindamycin**: 600 mg TID for coverage of streptococcal and staphylococcal species.

These recommendations are integral to addressing MRSA infections in both adult and pediatric populations efficiently.

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices [^116uDnSW]. Family Practice (2023). Low credibility.

Insect bite inflammation may mimic cellulitis and promote unnecessary antibiotic usage, contributing to antimicrobial resistance in primary care. We wondered how general practice clinicians assess and manage insect bites, diagnose cellulitis, and prescribe antibiotics.

- **Method**: This is a quality improvement study in which 10 general practices in England as well as Wales investigated patients attending for the first time with insect bites between April and September 2021 to their practices. Mode of consultation, presentation, management plan, and reattendance or referral were noted. Total practice flucloxacillin prescribing was compared to that for insect bites.

- **Results**: A combined list size of 161,346 yielded 355 insect bite consultations. Nearly two-thirds were female, ages 3–89 years old, with July as the peak month and a mean weekly incidence of 8 per 100,000. GPs still undertook most consultations; most were phone consultations, with photo support for over half. Over 40% presented between days 1 and 3, and common symptoms were redness, itchiness, pain, and heat. Vital sign recording was not common, and only 22% of patients were already taking an antihistamine despite 45% complaining of itch. Antibiotics were prescribed to nearly three-quarters of the patients, mainly orally and mostly as flucloxacillin. Reattendance occurred for 12% and referral to hospital for 2%. Flucloxacillin for insect bites contributed a mean of 5.1% of total practice flucloxacillin prescriptions, with a peak of 10.7% in July.

- **Conclusions**: Antibiotics are likely to be overused in our insect bite consultations.

### Assessment of antibiotic treatment of cellulitis and erysipelas: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111PYrVi]. JAMA Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

The optimum antibiotic treatment for cellulitis and erysipelas lacks consensus. The available trial data do not demonstrate the superiority of any specific agent, and data are limited regarding the most appropriate route of administration or duration of therapy. This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotic therapy for non-surgically acquired cellulitis.

Various databases were searched through June 28, 2016, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2016, issue 5), Medline (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Information System (LILACS) (from 1982). Additional searches were conducted in five trial databases and the reference lists of included studies, as well as further searches on PubMed and Google Scholar from June 28, 2016, to December 31, 2018.

Randomized clinical trials comparing different antibiotics, routes of administration, and treatment durations were included. Data collection and analysis utilized the standard methodological procedures of the Cochrane Collaboration. For dichotomous outcomes, the risk ratio and its 95% confidence interval were calculated. A summary of findings table was created for the primary endpoints, adopting the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence.

The primary outcome measured was the proportion of patients cured, improved, recovered, or symptom-free, or those who experienced symptom reduction by the end of treatment, as reported by the trials. The secondary outcome involved any adverse events. A total of 43 studies with relevant data were included.

### Prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of cellulitis (erysipelas) of the leg: Results of the UK Dermatology Clinical Trials Network's PATCH II trial [^1153LvBf]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Penicillin has been used as long-term medication for many years in other conditions such as rheumatic fever, and group A streptococcus has remained susceptible to penicillin for over 60 years without signs of developing resistance. It represents a very cost-effective intervention (£18 per 6-month course) with the potential for substantial health savings. Assuming a number needed to treat (NNT) of 8, this equates to a treatment cost of £144 per episode of cellulitis prevented.

It is disappointing that the trial failed to achieve its recruitment target of 400 participants and thus failed to provide sufficient evidence on which to base firm conclusions. Nevertheless, the trial suggests a potentially large protective effect that was consistent throughout the follow-up period and robust in sensitivity analysis.

Future cellulitis trials can benefit from the experiences of the PATCH II trial in designing trials that might recruit patients with cellulitis more successfully. The PATCH I trial, due to report in early 2012, introduced modifications to the trial design and conduct as a result of experiences with PATCH II. This trial successfully recruited 274 participants (105% of the original sample size requirement). Changes to the protocol included:

- **Eligibility criteria**: Amending so that patients who had an episode of cellulitis within the last 6 months (rather than 3 months) were able to take part.
- **Case report forms**: Allowing recruiting clinicians to concentrate on essential medical information, with more routine clinical trial data being collected more efficiently.

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices [^117Vjmbe]. Family Practice (2023). High credibility.

The practice-based management of insect bites was examined using a quality improvement (QI) approach, aiming to enhance patient care by first understanding the problem within its context. The systematic approach involved examining, proposing, and implementing changes before assessing their impact. Our study aimed to assess and understand the incidence of insect bite presentation, the management protocols, and whether clinicians are following NICE guidelines. Additionally, we investigated whether insect bite management contributes to the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing. We intend that our findings will inform practice improvement activities to address prescribing practices.

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices [^111zMpSj]. Family Practice (2023). High credibility.

Our novel approach seeks to generate real-world practice-based evidence using quality improvement (QI) approaches. The Insect Bite Group (IBG) is a professionally led group based within the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) using practice-based research to exchange knowledge with colleagues, analyze patient healthcare use, explore management dilemmas, and define future research activity. This is the first reporting on management of a cohort of primary care insect bite practice, to our knowledge.

QI approaches create some limitations as insect bites were selected by searching on coded data; some may therefore be missing from the data set. The number of total bites occurring in the population and self-managed, versus the number presenting to all primary care providers versus those presenting to general practices, is unknown. Patients may also attend walk-in clinics, out-of-hours services, community pharmacists, and A&E departments for insect bite concerns. Our practices were not randomized, and practice list size varied greatly, introducing possible bias.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, a study reported an overall unchanged prescribing of antibiotics compared to that forecast, but a reduction of flucloxacillin prescribing of 12.7% compared to forecasts for the month of July 2020. We do not know how this may have affected our study. Reduced social contact and reduced travel abroad, but increased exercise in local open spaces will have created some changes in patients' behavior and also in pandemic prescribing. Our study reflects insect bite issues from England as well as Wales, rather than travel abroad, which was much more common before the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Efficacy of oral beta-lactam versus non-beta-lactam treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis [^113egLwA]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The preferred therapy for purulent skin and soft tissue infections is incision and drainage, but many infections cannot be drained. Empiric therapies for these infections are ill-defined in the era of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

- **Methods**: A multicenter retrospective cohort study of outpatients treated for cellulitis was conducted to compare clinical failure rates of oral beta-lactam and non-beta-lactam treatments. Exclusion criteria included purulent infection requiring incision and drainage, complicated skin and soft tissue infection, chronic ulceration, and intravenous antibiotics. Failure rates were compared using logistic regression to adjust for both covariates associated with failure and a propensity score for beta-lactam treatment.

- **Results**: Of 2,977 patients, 861 met inclusion criteria and were classified by treatment: beta-lactam (n = 631) or non-beta-lactam therapy (n = 230). Failure rates were 14.7% versus 17.0% (odds ratio [OR] 0.85, 95% confidence interval, 0.56–1.31) for beta-lactam and non-beta-lactam therapy, respectively. Failure was associated with age (P = 0.02), acute symptom severity (P = 0.03), animal bites (P = 0.03), Charlson score > 3 (P = 0.02), and histamine-2 receptor antagonist use (P = 0.09). The relative efficacy of beta-lactam therapy was greater after adjustment for factors associated with failure but remained statistically insignificant (adjusted OR 0.81, 95% CI, 0.53–1.24); adjusted including propensity score covariate (OR 0.71, 95% CI, 0.45–1.13). Discontinuation due to adverse effects differed between the two groups.

### Cellulitis: Diagnosis and management [^113EYPpq]. Dermatologic Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute infection of the dermal and subcutaneous layers of the skin, often occurring following a local skin trauma. It is a common diagnosis in both inpatient and outpatient dermatology, as well as in the primary care setting. Cellulitis classically presents with erythema, swelling, warmth, and tenderness over the affected area. There are many other dermatologic diseases that can present with similar findings, highlighting the need to consider a broad differential diagnosis. Some of the most common mimics of cellulitis include venous stasis dermatitis, contact dermatitis, deep vein thrombosis, and panniculitis. History, local characteristics of the affected area, systemic signs, laboratory tests, and, in some cases, skin biopsy can be helpful in confirming the correct diagnosis. Most patients can be treated as an outpatient with oral antibiotics, with dicloxacillin or cephalexin being the oral therapy of choice when methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is not a concern.

### Diagnosis and management of cellulitis and abscess in the emergency department setting: An evidence-based review [^11689GoD]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Cellulitis and abscess are common reasons for presentation to the emergency department, although there are several nuances to the care of these patients.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this narrative review article was to provide a summary of the background, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of cellulitis and abscesses with a focus on emergency clinicians.

- **Discussion**: The most common bacteria causing cellulitis are *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Streptococcus pyogenes*, and other β-hemolytic streptococci, while methicillin-resistant *S. aureus* is most common in abscesses. The history and physical examination are helpful in differentiating cellulitis and abscess in many cases, and point-of-care ultrasound can be a useful tool in unclear cases. Treatment for cellulitis typically involves a penicillin or cephalosporin, and treatment of abscesses is incision and drainage. Loop drainage is preferred over the traditional incision and drainage technique, and adjunctive antibiotics can be considered. Most patients can be managed as outpatients.

- **Conclusions**: It is essential for emergency physicians to be aware of the evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of patients with cellulitis and abscess.

### Alcaligenes faecalis cellulitis following a DOG bite: Case report and literature review [^111ZNrUr]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

Alcaligenes faecalis is a gram-negative organism commonly found in the environment and is also a part of the normal fecal flora in humans. Although various infections with this bacterium have been described in the pediatric population, it has not been previously identified as the pathogen in infections following a dog bite. Here, we present a case involving a 19-month-old boy who developed cellulitis secondary to a dog bite, which did not respond to oral antibiotic therapy and led to worsening fever and swelling. Ultimately, the patient required hospitalization, intravenous antibiotics, and incision and drainage. The wound culture grew A. faecalis, confirmed through recombinant DNA sequence analysis. Although A. faecalis has been identified in cat bite wounds, it has not been cited in the literature previously as an infection following a dog bite.

### Clinical overview of vibriosis [^1171ENWw]. CDC (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for cellulitis, particularly in patients with Vibrio vulnificus infection, the CDC 2024 guidelines recommend administering doxycycline PO/IV 100 mg BID for 7–14 days alongside a third-generation cephalosporin, such as ceftazidime 1–2 g IV/IM every 8 hours, as first-line therapy. It is important to recognize that a single-agent regimen with a fluoroquinolone, such as levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, or gatifloxacin, has been reported to be at least as effective as a regimen combining doxycycline and a cephalosporin in animal studies.

### Prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of cellulitis (erysipelas) of the leg: Results of the UK Dermatology Clinical Trials Network's PATCH II trial [^114FmLXa]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Data collection was achieved through routine telephone follow-up calls from the coordinating centre, which occurred 3-monthly during the treatment phase and 6-monthly during the follow-up phase. Participants were asked to complete a study diary to record adverse events and health service resource use. If participants experienced a repeat episode of cellulitis, they were instructed to inform the trial staff immediately. Any repeat episodes not reported were captured during the regular telephone interviews.

Health service resource use was assessed using diaries, which included data on inpatient admissions, outpatient visits, GP consultations, other prescribed drugs for cellulitis, and time away from normal daily activities.

The primary outcome measure for the trial was time to the next episode of cellulitis. The next confirmed episode was defined as the next episode of cellulitis in either leg that had been reported by the participant and confirmed by a medical practitioner. The episode was considered to have begun on the first day of symptoms reported by the participant. Episodes that were reported by the participant and resulted in antibiotic treatment, but were not confirmed by a medical professional, were documented as self-reported cases and included in the sensitivity analysis.

Secondary outcome measures included:

- **Repeat episodes of cellulitis**: The proportion of participants with repeat episodes at the end of the treatment phase and at the end of the non-intervention follow-up phase.
- **Number of repeat episodes**: The total number of repeat episodes of cellulitis.
- **New oedema and/or ulceration**: The proportion of participants with new oedema and/or ulceration at the end of the study.

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices [^115x7zLb]. Family Practice (2023). High credibility.

Evidence shows that general practice flucloxacillin prescribing increases in the summer months, peaking in July. A specialist Insect Bite Group (IBG) within the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) has been considering whether this seasonal effect might be due to increased presentations with insect bites and, if so, whether increased prescribing is appropriate. This IBG falls under the RCGP overdiagnosis special interest group (OD), which focuses on the inappropriate medicalization of self-limiting illnesses and the overuse of antibiotics. The group includes general practitioners (GPs), educators, and researchers. We employed Quality Improvement (QI) methodologies to conduct an initial analysis and assessment of this issue.

Best practices in the management of insect bites are not as clearly defined as they are for other infective conditions, such as tonsillitis. Guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on insect bites and stings state that "most will not require antibiotics" and recommend the use of antihistamines. General practice clinicians (GPCs) may also refer to allied guidance. For instance, NICE guidance on impetigo recommends using an antiseptic (hydrogen peroxide 1% cream) for patients with localized non-bullous impetigo. If unsuitable, topical antibiotics are advised. For more widespread or severe non-bullous impetigo, and all bullous impetigo, a course of oral antibiotics is recommended with flucloxacillin as the first line. Finally, NICE provides guidance on erysipelas and cellulitis, recommending taking a swab from broken skin and marking the area with a pen for monitoring.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^114AhEfn]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the dermis and associated subcutaneous tissue, with 60% of cases affecting the lower limb. Erysipelas is a form of cellulitis that presents with more marked superficial inflammation.

The diagnosis of cellulitis can be challenging, with 31% of patients who present with suspected lower-limb cellulitis in the emergency department (ED) subsequently being given a diagnosis other than cellulitis. Routine biochemical and hematological blood tests and blood cultures are not specific for cellulitis, resulting in avoidable hospital admissions and unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics. Definitive diagnostic criteria could potentially improve clinical care and the validity of clinical research on cellulitis by ensuring appropriate case definition. However, there are currently no agreed diagnostic criteria for cellulitis.

Patients with cellulitis commonly present to primary care services or the ED. A recent U.K. cellulitis research priority-setting partnership ranked questions on 'diagnostic criteria' as important for future cellulitis research.

The aim of this systematic review was to identify and conduct a critical appraisal of the quality of studies that have developed or validated diagnostic criteria or tools for lower-limb cellulitis. Diagnostic criteria or tools are defined as the inclusion of a minimum of one variable that has been tested against at least one clinical feature. In this paper, 'cellulitis' refers to lower-limb cellulitis only, with lower-limb erysipelas included as it is clinically in scope.

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices [^112ktUGx]. Family Practice (2023). Low credibility.

Insect bite inflammation may mimic cellulitis and promote unnecessary antibiotic usage, contributing to antimicrobial resistance in primary care. We wondered how general practice clinicians assess and manage insect bites, diagnose cellulitis, and prescribe antibiotics.

This is a quality improvement study involving 10 general practices in England as well as Wales. These practices investigated patients attending for the first time with insect bites between April and September 2021. Key data points included the mode of consultation, presentation, management plan, and any reattendance or referral. Total practice flucloxacillin prescribing was compared to prescriptions for insect bites.

A combined list size of 161,346 resulted in 355 insect bite consultations. Nearly two-thirds of patients were female, ages ranged from 3 to 89 years, with July being the peak month. The mean weekly incidence was 8 per 100,000. General practitioners conducted most consultations, with the majority being phone consultations and photo support provided in over half the cases. Over 40% of patients presented between days 1 and 3 with common symptoms like redness, itchiness, pain, and heat. Vital sign recording was uncommon, with only 22% of patients already taking an antihistamine, despite 45% complaining of itch. Antibiotics were prescribed to nearly three-quarters of the patients, mainly orally, with flucloxacillin being the most common. Reattendance occurred for 12% of patients, and 2% were referred to the hospital. Flucloxacillin for insect bites contributed a mean of 5.1% of total practice flucloxacillin prescriptions, peaking at 10.7% in July.

Regarding medical management for cellulitis, specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy and MRSA coverage, the IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend administering any of the following oral agents for empirical coverage of community-acquired MRSA in outpatients with SSTI:

- **Clindamycin**: An antibiotic for treating various types of bacterial infections.
- **TMP/SMX**: Commonly known as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, an antibiotic used for a variety of infections.
- **Doxycycline or minocycline**: Tetracycline antibiotics effective against a range of infections.
- **Linezolid**: An antibiotic used for treating serious bacterial infections, including MRSA.

### Best evidence topic report. Are antibiotics indicated following human bites [^115uMrnS]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

A short-cut review was conducted to determine whether antibiotics are indicated for human bites. Eighty-nine papers were found using the reported search, of which two represent the best evidence to address the clinical question. The author, date, and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results, and study weaknesses of these best papers are tabulated. Prophylactic antibiotics should be given to all patients with human bites to the hands, feet, and skin overlying joints or cartilaginous structures, and to all patients with bites that penetrate deeper than the epidermal layer.

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices [^117YTD4M]. Family Practice (2023). High credibility.

Our data suggests there could be scope to change and improve the management of insect bites, with greater use of non-antibiotic management. To help detect early cellulitis, swabbing of purulent discharge and drawing around the erythema to monitor spread may be helpful. Exploration of antihistamine, topical steroid, and topical antiseptics in insect bite management may reduce antibiotic use. Our findings highlight the next steps needed in a quality improvement approach to generate practice-based evidence on optimal management of insect bites, specifically focusing on alternatives to antibiotic prescribing.

The James Lind Alliance has worked with patients to identify research questions related to the management of cellulitis, including: "What are the early signs and symptoms of cellulitis that can help to ensure speedy treatment?" For insect bites in general practice, we suggest the following research questions: "What early symptoms and signs in insect bite reactions do not require antibiotics?" and "What non-antibiotic treatments reduce inflammation and cellulitis?" These questions should guide changes in design and implementation as the next step in a quality improvement model to develop practice-based evidence.

Regarding the medical management of cellulitis, particularly concerning antibiotic therapy and MRSA coverage, the IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend administering any of the following regimens if coverage for both β-hemolytic streptococci and community-acquired MRSA is desired:

- **Clindamycin alone**: This option is effective for targeting MRSA while also covering β-hemolytic streptococci.

- **TMP/SMX**: This combination provides robust MRSA coverage and is often used when both types of infection are a concern.

- **A tetracycline in combination with a β-lactam, such as amoxicillin**: Combining these agents allows for effective coverage against both MRSA and β-hemolytic streptococci.

- **Linezolid alone**: This is a potent option that covers resistant strains and is reserved for more complex cases.

### Microbiological and clinical features of patients with cellulitis in tropical Australia: Disease severity assessment and implications for clinical management [^114GHBWg]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Low credibility.

Australian guidelines for the treatment of cellulitis are informed by data from temperate, metropolitan centers. It is uncertain if these guidelines are equally applicable in tropical Australia, where the population, access to healthcare, and array of potential pathogens are quite different.

This retrospective study examined adults admitted to Cairns Hospital in tropical Queensland, Australia, who were treated with intravenous antibiotics for a principal diagnosis of cellulitis in 2019. The study aimed to describe the epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological findings in these cases and the resulting implications for patient management.

There were 305 episodes of cellulitis; a potential pathogen was identified in 93 out of 305 cases (30%), most commonly Staphylococcus aureus (45 out of 93, 48%) or Group A Streptococcus (16 out of 93, 17%). There was one case of Burkholderia pseudomallei. Initial treatment was most commonly with narrow spectrum β-lactam antibiotics, with flucloxacillin prescribed in 170 out of 305 cases (56%) and cefazolin prescribed in 74 out of 305 cases (26%).

Overall, 4 out of 305 patients (1%) died or were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) within 30 days, 123 out of 305 patients (40%) had an inpatient stay longer than 48 hours, and 63 out of 305 patients (21%) were readmitted to the hospital within 30 days. Every patient who subsequently died or required ICU admission had an elevated early warning score (EWS ≥ 3) on admission. An EWS ≥ 3 on admission also predicted an inpatient stay of more than 48 hours (odds ratio [OR]: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.7–6.0; P < 0.001) and 30-day readmission (OR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.2–4.6; P = 0.01).

### Low risk of infection in selected human bites treated without antibiotics [^113zD73b]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). High credibility.

To assess the need for antibiotics in low-risk human bite wounds, a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 127 patients was conducted over 2 years at a major academic emergency department with 40,000 visits per year. Low-risk bites were defined as those that penetrated only the epidermis and did not involve the hands, feet, skin overlying joints, or cartilaginous structures. Exclusion criteria included age less than 18 years, puncture wounds, immunocompromise, allergy to penicillin or related compounds, or bites greater than 24 hours old. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a cephalexin/penicillin combination or a placebo. A total of 125 patients completed the study. Infection developed in 1 of 62 patients receiving placebo (1.6%, 95% confidence interval, 0–7.3%). Infection developed in 0 of 63 patients receiving the cephalexin/penicillin combination (0%, 95% CI, 0–4.6%). The study suggests that antibiotic treatment of some low-risk human bite wounds could be unnecessary. Infection rates appear similar in low-risk human bite wounds whether treated with antibiotics or placebo.
