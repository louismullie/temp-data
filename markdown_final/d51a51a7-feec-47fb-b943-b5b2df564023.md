## Question

Elevated phosphate levels in chronic kidney disease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step approach to managing elevated phosphate levels in chronic kidney disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how hyperphosphatemia is defined and what targets are recommended across CKD stages. Then, I should review why phosphate matters pathophysiologically and prognostically. Next, I will anchor management to KDIGO 2017 guidance, followed by a stepwise algorithm encompassing diet, binders, dialysis strategies, and control of secondary hyperparathyroidism. After that, I need to appraise the quality of evidence and controversies, and finally consider special scenarios like pseudohyperphosphatemia and adherence, closing with practical monitoring and a concise synthesis of the plan [^111LkLtv].

> Let me first confirm definitions and targets, and I need to ensure I distinguish KDIGO's language from UK-based numeric ranges. Hyperphosphatemia is commonly defined as serum phosphorus above about 1.45 mmol/L, roughly 4.5 mg/dL, although guideline targets vary with stage and philosophy of care, and KDIGO 2017 advises maintaining phosphate levels close to the normal range in CKD G3a-G5D rather than prespecifying a strict numeric target, whereas UKKA 2011 suggested 0.9–1.5 mmol/L for CKD 3b–5 and 1.1–1.7 mmol/L pre–short-gap dialysis for hemodialysis patients, so I should not conflate these frameworks when setting goals in practice [^114BkbND] [^111LkLtv] [^113iChHS] [^112wKEJQ]. Hold on, I should verify stage timing too, because overt hyperphosphatemia typically emerges from CKD stage 3b onward as GFR declines and compensatory signals like FGF-23 and PTH have been elevated for some time already, which aligns with the clinical observation that phosphate retention precedes overt biochemical elevation in many patients [^112d9gBw] [^112VPAAG].

> Next, I should review why phosphate control matters, and I need to check both mechanistic and outcomes data. Elevated phosphate is not a bystander; it is linked to vascular calcification, endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness, left ventricular hypertrophy, and mortality in CKD and related populations, with experimental and epidemiologic data supporting direct toxicity of phosphate, which strengthens the rationale to lower elevated levels, even though definitive trial evidence for hard outcomes remains limited in some areas [^112d9gBw] [^116aKjt5] [^111znjxM]. I should double-check the importance of exposure over time, and yes, the magnitude and time spent above target ranges are associated with worse cardiovascular outcomes, underscoring the need to reduce and maintain phosphate toward normal rather than react intermittently to peaks [^116PVc8q].

> Now, I will anchor the management framework in KDIGO 2017 and I need to be precise about their wording. KDIGO recommends deciding on phosphate-lowering therapy in CKD G3a–G5D based on progressively or persistently elevated serum phosphate, aiming to lower levels toward the normal range, with three major levers to pull: limit dietary phosphate intake, restrict the dose of calcium-based binders when pharmacotherapy is used, and in dialysis patients increase dialytic phosphate removal as needed, alongside avoidance of chronic aluminum-containing binders and selection of dialysate calcium in the 1.25–1.50 mmol/L range, while evaluating rising or persistently elevated PTH for modifiable factors, including hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, high phosphate intake, and vitamin D deficiency [^117LZ5De] [^117Uz1kj] [^114B7Qt4] [^115joFRj] [^116EeCMw] [^112ayQyf] [^113dpRoH] [^11143scZ] [^113pQnhF]. Wait, I almost asserted numeric KDIGO targets earlier, but to correct that, KDIGO's emphasis is on trending toward the normal range rather than using fixed numeric bands outside dialysis-specific contexts, which is important for individualized decision-making [^111LkLtv].

> I will now examine diet as the foundation, and I need to ensure that guidance is practical and nutritionally safe. Dietary phosphate control should prioritize source and bioavailability rather than blunt protein restriction, emphasizing avoidance of phosphate additives with near 100% absorption, preference for plant-based phosphorus with lower bioavailability due to phytate, and use of cooking methods such as boiling to reduce phosphorus content, all embedded within structured nutrition education that translates nutrient targets into food-based advice, while guarding against protein-energy wasting in advanced CKD and dialysis [^115gm3mN] [^116urgUM] [^111gwaXx] [^115qwapQ]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about cutting protein too aggressively; evidence cautions that excessive protein restriction may worsen nutrition and outcomes in maintenance dialysis, so diet should be individualized with dietitian support, integrating binders to preserve adequate protein intake where needed [^111rfys2] [^117GTF9m].

> Next, I should review when to initiate phosphate binders and how to choose among them, and I must be careful not to overstate mortality benefits. When dietary measures are insufficient and serum phosphate remains persistently elevated, binders are reasonable, with selection individualized to calcium balance, pill burden, side effect profile, and cost; calcium-based binders are inexpensive and effective but KDIGO advises restricting their dose due to concerns about positive calcium balance and calcification risk, while non-calcium binders like sevelamer and lanthanum avoid calcium load, reduce hypercalcemia, and in the case of sevelamer may reduce hospitalizations, though definitive mortality benefit vs calcium binders has not been consistently proven in randomized data, which I should explicitly acknowledge [^114B7Qt4] [^115joFRj] [^111JjcNn] [^116qFuqH]. Wait, let me verify lanthanum's clinical utility; randomized and real-world data support efficacy with manageable gastrointestinal adverse effects and potentially lower pill burden, which can help adherence, but long-term clinical outcome superiority remains unproven, and aluminum-containing binders should be avoided long term due to toxicity concerns, reserving them, if used at all, for short-term rescue [^1112xX8F] [^114JRt7U] [^113dpRoH].

> For dialysis patients, I need to check how to intensify dialytic removal, and I should confirm the limits of standard prescriptions. Standard thrice-weekly hemodialysis often removes insufficient phosphorus to offset typical intake, so for persistent hyperphosphatemia KDIGO suggests increasing dialytic phosphate removal, which in practice may involve extending dialysis time, increasing frequency, or optimizing other parameters, recognizing the physiologic constraints that make dietary and pharmacologic strategies essential adjuncts [^116EeCMw] [^112ayQyf] [^112d9gBw]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should ensure that dialysate calcium is also considered in the broader mineral management, and KDIGO's recommended dialysate calcium range supports balancing calcium load and PTH dynamics during intensified dialysis prescriptions [^11143scZ].

> I should now address secondary hyperparathyroidism, because phosphate and PTH regulation are tightly linked, and I need to verify modifiable contributors first. In the setting of progressively rising or persistently high PTH, I should correct hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, excess dietary phosphate intake, and vitamin D deficiency, and consider vitamin D analogs or calcimimetics when indicated, while avoiding oversuppression that could precipitate low-turnover bone disease, aligning with KDIGO's evaluation framework for CKD-MBD [^113pQnhF] [^1137CjVb]. But wait, what if PTH is already low while phosphate is high; in that case, I should be particularly cautious with calcium-based binders to avoid exacerbating positive calcium balance and adynamic bone, which reinforces the rationale to limit calcium binder dosing [^114B7Qt4] [^115joFRj].

> Next, I should review the quality of evidence and ongoing controversies, and I must correct any overinterpretation. Observational studies suggest phosphate binders are associated with improved survival, but randomized trials have not conclusively demonstrated superiority of one class for hard outcomes; for example, the LANDMARK trial did not show cardiovascular event reduction with lanthanum versus calcium carbonate in high-risk hemodialysis patients, while meta-analyses suggest sevelamer reduces hypercalcemia and hospitalizations but mortality benefits remain nonsignificant overall, so binder choice should be individualized rather than presuming class-wide outcome dominance [^113ZvymP] [^112c23Wq] [^111JjcNn]. I should double-check the non-dialysis CKD space; at stages 3–4, higher phosphate associates with mortality, but interventional data are limited, and at least one RCT with calcium acetate lowered phosphate yet accelerated vascular calcification versus placebo, so in earlier stages I should weigh risks and benefits carefully and align with KDIGO's recommendation to treat persistently elevated phosphate rather than chasing isolated values [^112PnG9w] [^112tytDi] [^1175XXm9] [^117LZ5De].

> I will now examine special clinical scenarios, and I need to ensure I do not treat spurious lab abnormalities. Pseudohyperphosphatemia can occur with paraprotein interference in colorimetric assays, particularly in monoclonal gammopathies, so if the clinical context is discordant, I should confirm with deproteinization or alternative methods and avoid unnecessary binders in spurious cases, which is a classic pitfall worth remembering [^111XyBX7]. Hold on, I should also verify adherence and pill burden, because real-world control is often limited by the number and size of binder tablets, gastrointestinal side effects, and hidden dietary phosphorus in processed foods; addressing education, regimen simplification, and newer strategies to reduce pill burden may improve phosphate control in practice [^1131kQ6F] [^111ZuKbW] [^112YuFEu] [^114rYJ3h].

> Next, I should review how to monitor and make decisions over time, and I need to consider phosphate's diurnal variation. Phosphate exhibits circadian fluctuation, so serial, pre-specified time point measurements and attention to trends and time above target provide a more accurate picture than isolated readings, and contemporary analyses emphasize that both the extent and duration of hyperphosphatemia relate to adverse cardiovascular outcomes, reinforcing sustained control as a goal rather than episodic correction [^116aKjt5] [^116PVc8q]. Let me reconsider targets one more time to avoid a mistake; for dialysis patients, older KDOQI bands exist, but KDIGO's emphasis remains to move toward normal, which I should integrate with individualized clinical factors, including PTH trajectory, calcium balance, and vascular calcification risk, rather than rigidly applying a single numeric threshold across all stages [^111LkLtv] [^116PVc8q].

> Pulling this together, I need to ensure the algorithm is coherent and KDIGO-concordant. Define elevated phosphate in context of CKD stage and trends, confirm it is true hyperphosphatemia, initiate dietary phosphate restriction focused on source and bioavailability with dietitian support, consider binders when phosphate remains persistently high with careful limitation of calcium-based binder dose and avoidance of chronic aluminum exposure, intensify dialytic removal in CKD G5D when needed, and concurrently evaluate and treat secondary hyperparathyroidism drivers, all while monitoring longitudinally for sustained control and tailoring binder choice to patient-specific factors and adherence realities [^117Uz1kj] [^117LZ5De] [^114B7Qt4] [^116EeCMw] [^113pQnhF] [^113dpRoH]. Wait, let me verify one last point before concluding; yes, this approach aligns with KDIGO 2017 and integrates pathophysiologic rationale and the current evidence base, while being cautious not to overpromise outcome benefits beyond what trials have shown, which is the clinically balanced stance to take [^111LkLtv] [^112d9gBw] [^111JjcNn].

---

Hyperphosphatemia in CKD is driven by **reduced renal phosphate excretion** [^112d9gBw] and linked to vascular calcification [^111iCxvM], cardiovascular events, and mortality [^112PnG9w]. Management centers on **dietary phosphate restriction** [^117Uz1kj], phosphate binders, and dialysis; KDIGO 2017 recommends lowering phosphate toward normal [^111LkLtv] and limiting calcium-based binders [^114B7Qt4]. Non-calcium binders (sevelamer, lanthanum, iron-based) are preferred when hypercalcemia or vascular calcification risk is present [^115joFRj] [^116qFuqH]; aluminum binders are avoided long term [^113dpRoH]. Persistent hyperphosphatemia despite therapy warrants intensifying dialysis [^116EeCMw] and reassessing adherence [^1131kQ6F] and secondary hyperparathyroidism [^113pQnhF].

---

## Pathophysiology

- **Reduced renal excretion**: As GFR declines, phosphate retention increases, causing hyperphosphatemia [^112d9gBw] [^116aKjt5].
- **Secondary hyperparathyroidism**: Elevated phosphate stimulates PTH, worsening bone disease and vascular calcification [^113pQnhF].
- **Vascular calcification**: High phosphate promotes vascular smooth muscle osteogenic transformation, increasing cardiovascular risk [^111iCxvM].

---

## Clinical consequences

Hyperphosphatemia is associated with **cardiovascular disease**, including vascular calcification, arterial stiffness, and increased cardiovascular events [^116aKjt5]. It contributes to renal osteodystrophy and fractures [^111LkLtv]. Higher phosphate correlates with increased all-cause and cardiovascular **mortality** [^112PnG9w] [^116PVc8q].

---

## Management strategies

### Dietary phosphate restriction

Dietary counseling focuses on **limiting phosphate intake** — especially from processed foods with additives — and the **phosphorus pyramid** is a visual tool to guide dietary choices and reduce phosphate load [^117Uz1kj] [^114rYJ3h] [^111gwaXx].

---

### Pharmacological interventions

- **Phosphate binders**: Calcium-based (calcium acetate, calcium carbonate), non-calcium-based (sevelamer, lanthanum carbonate), and iron-based (ferric citrate, sucroferric oxyhydroxide) [^111JjcNn].
- **Calcium-based binders**: Effective but risk hypercalcemia and vascular calcification [^111JjcNn].
- **Non-calcium-based binders**: Preferred when hypercalcemia or calcification risk exists [^115joFRj] [^112c23Wq].
- **Iron-based binders**: Effective and may improve iron parameters [^114UG4U3].

---

### Dialysis

In dialysis, **dialytic phosphate removal** is essential in CKD stage 5D; clinicians should consider increasing dialysis frequency or duration for persistent hyperphosphatemia [^112ayQyf] [^116PVc8q].

---

## Clinical guidelines

KDIGO 2017 recommends **lowering phosphate toward normal** in CKD G3a-G5D, limiting calcium-based binders, avoiding long-term aluminum binders, and increasing dialytic removal if needed [^111LkLtv] [^115joFRj] [^113dpRoH] [^116EeCMw]. UKKA 2011 advises maintaining serum phosphate **0.9–1.5 mmol/L** in CKD 3b-5 and **1.1–1.7 mmol/L** in hemodialysis [^113iChHS] [^112wKEJQ].

---

## Challenges and limitations

- **Adherence**: High pill burden and dietary restrictions reduce adherence [^1131kQ6F].
- **Side effects**: Gastrointestinal symptoms and hypercalcemia limit therapy [^111JjcNn].
- **Cost**: Non-calcium binders are expensive and may limit access [^1134f6jD].

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging therapies include **phosphate absorption inhibitors** targeting intestinal phosphate transport (e.g. NaPi-IIb inhibitors) and **novel binders**, such as magnesium-containing agents and other investigational compounds [^116urgUM] [^112tytDi] [^114Xvbny].

---

Hyperphosphatemia in CKD is a **key driver of cardiovascular and bone complications** [^116aKjt5]. Management requires **dietary restriction**, phosphate binders, and dialysis, with therapy individualized to balance efficacy, safety, and adherence [^111DsCDh].

The main advantage of calcium-based binders is that they are inexpensive. The 2013 NICE guideline on hyperphosphataemia management suggests using a calcium-based binder as first-line treatment in the management of hyperphosphataemia in adults with CKD stages 4–5 and on dialysis. It further advises either combining with or switching to a non-calcium-based binder if hypercalcaemia develops, if serum parathyroid hormone levels are low, or if hyperphosphataemia persists despite adherence to the maximum recommended or tolerated dose of a calcium-based phosphate binder. In that document, calcium acetate is the preferred calcium-based binder, while sevelamer hydrochloride or lanthanum carbonate are the preferred non-calcium-based binders. An additional non-calcium-containing binder, sucroferric oxyhydroxide, was the subject of a NICE evidence summary in 2015, as it was not available when NICE published the 2013 guideline.

Previous UK Renal Association guidelines did not provide specific recommendations on the choice of phosphate binder, stating that there are insufficient data from randomized controlled trials that any specific oral phosphate binder impacts individual patient outcomes. However, the guideline acknowledged that, given the strong association between high-dose calcium supplementation and worse outcomes, even in the general population, it would be reasonable to minimize calcium exposure in CKD and dialysis patients. This group continues to endorse the view that the choice of oral phosphate binder is best made by involving both the patient and the multi-disciplinary team, taking into account palatability and other factors.

### The challenge of controlling phosphorus in chronic kidney disease [^112d9gBw]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). High credibility.

The pathogenesis and management of chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorders (CKD-MBD) have undergone significant changes, yet the control of serum phosphorus at all stages of CKD remains crucial for improving clinical outcomes. High serum phosphorus is a critical uremia-related, non-traditional risk factor associated with vascular calcification in CKD patients and the general population. Phosphorus may also play a key role in linking vascular calcification with low bone turnover.

The main hormones and factors contributing to kidney regulation of phosphorus and calcium include parathyroid hormone, FGF-23, klotho, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D). Notably, serum phosphorus levels do not begin to rise until CKD stage 3b, in contrast to earlier changes observed with fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), klotho, calcitriol, and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Although FGF-23 and PTH have synergistic effects on phosphorus removal, they exert opposite effects on 1,25(OH)2D3. At the same stages of CKD where phosphorus retention occurs, calcium retention is also evident.

An important unresolved question is determining the optimal serum phosphorus level-range to maintain at different stages of CKD to improve clinical outcomes. Phosphate homeostasis management can be approached through four main strategies: reducing dietary phosphorus intake, administering phosphate binder agents, effectively controlling hyperparathyroidism, and ensuring an adequate dialysis scheme, particularly in the CKD 5D setting.

### Serum phosphate and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease [^112PnG9w]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Higher phosphate is associated with mortality in dialysis patients, but few prospective studies assess this in nondialysis patients managed in an outpatient nephrology clinic. This prospective longitudinal study examined whether phosphate level was associated with death in a referred population.

- **Design, setting, participants & measurements**: Patients (1203) with nondialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Standards Implementation Study were assessed. Survival analyses were performed for quartiles of baseline phosphate relative to GFR, 12-month time-averaged phosphate, and baseline phosphate according to published phosphate targets.

- **Results**: Mean (SD) eGFR was 32 (15) ml/min per 1.73 m², age 64 (14) years, and phosphate 1.2 (0.30) mmol/L. Cox multivariate adjusted regression in CKD stages 3 to 4 patients showed an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in the highest quartile compared with the lowest quartile of phosphate. No association was found in CKD stage 5 patients. Patients who had values above recommended targets for phosphate control had an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death compared with patients below target. The highest quartile compared with the lowest quartile of 12-month time-averaged phosphate was associated with an increased risk of mortality.

- **Conclusions**: In CKD stages 3 to 4 patients, higher phosphate was associated with a stepwise increase in mortality. As phosphate levels below published targets (as opposed to within them) are associated with better survival rates, managing phosphate levels is crucial in these patients.

### Dialysis: Phosphorus binders and survival: need for randomized trials [^113ZvymP]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

An observational study suggests that administration of phosphorus binders dramatically improves survival rates in patients on incident hemodialysis — even in those without hyperphosphatemia. Randomized clinical trials should drive changes in the relevant clinical practice.

### Pro: Should phosphate binders be used in chronic kidney disease stage 3–4 [^1175XXm9]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

Convincing epidemiological data have repeatedly shown that increased phosphate levels and generous phosphate intakes are associated with unfavorable outcomes in both normal and chronically impaired kidney disease (CKD) individuals. Evidence suggests that impaired phosphate metabolism is associated with markers of cardiovascular damage such as left ventricular hypertrophy, arterial stiffness, vascular calcification, and mortality. Although guidelines suggest phosphate control in CKD, evidence on the impact of different approaches to minimize phosphate burden on clinically meaningful outcomes is still lacking. How to manipulate phosphate metabolism, when to start in the course of CKD, and to what extent control is needed remain to be addressed by properly designed clinical studies. Treatment decisions should be based on a risk-benefit assessment to avoid unnecessary exposure to potentially harmful side effects of available compounds. The focus and ambition of this review are to summarize evidence and provide a point-of-care suggestion on the use of phosphate binders in CKD stage 3 and 4 patients.

### Cost-effectiveness of phosphate binders among patients with chronic kidney disease not yet on dialysis: A long way to go [^1134f6jD]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia is consistently and independently associated with increased morbidity and mortality among end-stage renal disease patients and results in financial burdens for health systems. Although this issue was explored to a lesser extent among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), results from large studies suggest an independent association between elevated serum phosphorus levels and increased patient mortality risk. The association between hyperphosphatemia and progression to dialysis initiation has also been suggested. However, this association was inconsistent across studies and was not statistically significant when potential confounders were accounted for in the analysis. Despite this, serum phosphorus management in CKD patients has gained increasing importance in contemporary nephrology practice, and tight targets for serum phosphorus levels have been set for these patients. Up to now, we still lack conclusive evidence — such as prospective interventional studies — to demonstrate that a reduction in serum phosphate improves CKD patient outcomes.

Concerns about the high cost of hyperphosphatemia's consequences are offset by concerns about the high treatment cost of hyperphosphatemia, especially with novel pharmaceuticals like non-calcium-based phosphate binders. Within this scope, economic evaluations — studies providing evidence for the value of money spent — are now being increasingly used by public health decision-makers to guide the allocation of scarce resources.

### Hyperphosphatemia and risks of acute kidney injury, end-stage renal disease, and mortality in hospitalized patients [^111znjxM]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia has received considerable attention in the field of CKD - mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) because of its association with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Even upper-normal serum phosphate levels could exacerbate the status of CKD, potentially leading to ESRD. Based on these features, this study addressed the relationships between hyperphosphatemia and the risks of AKI, ESRD, and mortality among hospitalized patients, and showed that hyperphosphatemia was significantly associated with poorer renal outcomes, irrespective of baseline kidney function.

In addition to patients with CKD-MBD, some studies have examined the relationship between serum phosphorus and morbidity or mortality, particularly in critically ill patients. Patients admitted to the emergency department with serum phosphorus levels > 4.5 mg/dl showed high 28-day in-hospital mortality. Furthermore, higher time-weighted phosphorus levels (i.e. area under the curve divided by total time between first and last phosphorus levels) were related to mortality risk in patients with mechanical ventilation. Hyperphosphatemia was also shown to affect the risk of mortality in patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy. However, the relevance of hyperphosphatemia among heterogeneous patients admitted to the hospital remains unclear. Furthermore, AKI and ESRD have rarely been considered as the primary outcomes in previous studies.

### The "phosphorus pyramid": A visual tool for dietary phosphate management in dialysis and CKD patients [^111gwaXx]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Phosphorus retention plays a pivotal role in the onset of mineral and bone disorders (MBD) in chronic kidney disease (CKD). This retention commonly occurs when net intestinal absorption exceeds renal excretion or dialysis removal. The dietary phosphorus load is crucial from the early stages of CKD, throughout the course of the disease, up to dialysis-dependent end-stage renal disease.

Agreement exists regarding the need for dietary phosphate control; however, it is quite challenging in real-life settings. Effective strategies for controlling dietary phosphorus intake include restricting phosphorus-rich foods, preferring phosphorus sourced from plants, using boiling as the preferred cooking method, and avoiding foods with phosphorus-containing additives. Nutritional education is crucial in this regard.

Based on existing literature, we developed the "phosphorus pyramid", a novel, visual, user-friendly tool for nutritional education of patients and healthcare professionals. The pyramid consists of six levels in which foods are arranged based on their phosphorus content, phosphorus-to-protein ratio, and phosphorus bioavailability. Each level has a colored edge (from green to red) corresponding to the recommended intake frequency, ranging from "unrestricted" to "avoid as much as possible".

The aim of the phosphorus pyramid is to support dietary counseling to reduce phosphorus load, a crucial aspect of integrated CKD-MBD management.

### The role of phosphate in kidney disease [^116aKjt5]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The importance of phosphate homeostasis in chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been recognized for decades, but novel insights, which are frequently relevant to everyday clinical practice, continue to emerge. Epidemiological data consistently indicate an association between hyperphosphatemia and poor clinical outcomes. Moreover, compelling evidence suggests direct toxicity of increased phosphate concentrations. Importantly, serum phosphate concentration has a circadian rhythm that must be considered when interpreting patient phosphate levels.

A detailed understanding of dietary sources of phosphate, including food additives, can enable phosphate restriction without risking protein malnutrition. Dietary counseling provides an often underestimated opportunity to target the increasing exposure to dietary phosphate of both the general population and patients with CKD. In patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism, bone can be an important source of serum phosphate, and adequate appreciation of this fact should impact treatment.

Dietary and pharmotherapeutic interventions are efficacious strategies to lower phosphate intake and serum concentration. However, strong evidence that targeting serum phosphate improves patient outcomes is currently lacking. Future studies are, therefore, required to investigate the effects of modern dietary and pharmacological interventions on clinically meaningful endpoints.

### Hyperphosphatemia in patients with ESRD: Assessing the current evidence linking outcomes with treatment adherence [^1131kQ6F]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

In recent years, the imbalance in phosphate homeostasis in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has been the subject of much research. It appears that, while hyperphosphatemia may be a tangible indicator of deteriorating kidney function, lack of phosphate homeostasis may also be associated with the increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality that has become a hallmark of ESRD. The need to maintain phosphorus concentrations within a recommended range is reflected in evidence-based guidelines; however, these do not reflect serum phosphorus concentrations achieved by most patients in clinical practice. Given this discrepancy, it is important to consider ways in which dietary restriction of phosphorus intake and, in particular, use of phosphate binders in patients with ESRD can be made more effective.

Poor adherence is common in patients with ESRD and has been associated with inadequate control of serum phosphorus concentrations. Studies indicate that, among other factors, major reasons for poor adherence to phosphate binder therapy include high pill burden and patients' lack of understanding of their condition and its treatment. This review examines available evidence, seeking to understand fully the reasons underlying poor adherence in patients with ESRD and consider possible strategies for improving adherence in clinical practice.

### The role of dietary phosphorus restriction in the conservative management of chronic renal disease [^113QftVy]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Evidence exists that phosphate retention plays a major role in causing secondary hyperparathyroidism, cardiovascular morbidity, and loss of residual renal function in chronic renal disease patients, and that a subtle elevation in serum phosphate occurs at early stages in the course of renal insufficiency. The implementation of a low-phosphorus, low-protein dietary regimen plays a special role in the conservative management of chronic renal disease patients for the prevention and correction of secondary hyperparathyroidism, and for renal and cardiovascular protection.

However, the success and safety of dietary phosphate restriction largely depend on good compliance with dietary recommendations, which must represent a major goal to be regularly pursued in clinical practice. To this aim, it is crucial that dietitians expert in renal nutrition provide education and personalized dietary advice to enhance the patient's adherence to nutritional prescriptions.

### Use of phosphate binders in chronic kidney disease [^112tytDi]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia is a paradigmatic finding in late-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is consistently associated with adverse outcomes. Preclinical and epidemiological studies strongly support a causative role of hyperphosphatemia in cardiovascular complications, particularly regarding vascular, valvular, and soft-tissue calcifications, leading to subsequent mortality. Therefore, phosphate management is crucial for the health and longevity of CKD patients. In this context, phosphate binders are considered the primary option, though dietary phosphate restriction and intensified dialysis are also valuable supportive tools.

Studies on available calcium-free phosphate binders demonstrate potential interference with phosphate regulatory factors, such as fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23). Magnesium-containing phosphate binding may possess pleiotropic potential due to its calcification inhibitory properties. Novel phosphate-lowering compounds, including colestilan, iron-containing binders, and nicotinamide, are underway to expand the arsenal of phosphate-lowering strategies. An open question remains regarding when to therapeutically counteract phosphate retention using binders. A recent prospective randomized trial in patients with moderate CKD (stages 3b-4) and phosphate levels in the upper normal range demonstrated only moderate reductions in serum phosphate levels, no effects on FGF23, but increased progression of vascular calcification with active treatment compared to placebo.

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder, more specifically with respect to treatment targets, UKKA 2011 guidelines recommend considering maintaining serum phosphate measured before a 'short-gap' dialysis session in the range of 1.1–1.7 mmol/L in patients on hemodialysis.

### The role of the gastrointestinal tract in phosphate homeostasis in health and chronic kidney disease [^116urgUM]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

For a number of years, there has been increasing interest in the concept of directly targeting intestinal phosphate transport to control hyperphosphatemia in chronic kidney disease. However, progress has been slow due to the paucity of information on the mechanisms involved in intestinal phosphate absorption. This editorial highlights the most recent developments in our understanding of this process and the role of the intestine in the maintenance of phosphate balance.

- **Recent findings**: Recent studies in NaPi-IIb knockout mice have confirmed that this transport protein plays a significant role in intestinal phosphate absorption and is critical in the proposed feed-forward mechanism between the small intestine and kidney, which helps to maintain normal phosphate balance and steady-state plasma phosphate concentrations. In addition, renal failure-induced hyperphosphatemia is attenuated in NaPi-IIb knockout mice, confirming that NaPi-IIb is a suitable target in the prevention and treatment of hyperphosphatemia.

- **Summary**: Recent findings suggest that the consumption of processed foods containing phosphate preservatives may lead to excessive phosphate exposure, toxicity, and cardiovascular disease in the general population, as well as in patients with declining renal function. Therefore, establishing more effective ways of targeting the intestine to limit dietary phosphate absorption could have wide-reaching health benefits.

### Development and validation of a nomogram for predicting hyperphosphatemia in non-dialysis patients with chronic kidney disease [^114BkbND]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

According to the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as any abnormality of kidney structure or function with a negative health impact, persisting for at least 3 months. Kidney disease is categorized based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values, correlating with the progression risk: G1 (eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m²), G2 (60–89 mL/min/1.73 m²), G3a (45–59 mL/min/1.73 m²), G3b (30–44 mL/min/1.73 m²), G4 (15–29 mL/min/1.73 m²), and G5 (< 15 mL/min/1.73 m²). Cystatin C was used to calculate eGFR in the hospital laboratory.

Hyperphosphatemia was diagnosed when serum phosphorus exceeded 1.45 mmol/L. For patients with G3a–G5 stage CKD, the 2017 KDIGO guidelines recommend maintaining blood phosphorus levels close to the normal range.

Regarding medical management of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder, specifically the management of hyperphosphatemia, KDIGO 2017 guidelines recommend considering the use of a dialysate calcium concentration in the range of 1.25–1.50 mmol/L (2.5–3.0 mEq/L) in patients with CKD stage G5D.

### Mineral metabolism and outcomes in chronic kidney disease stage 2–4 patients [^1166vc2q]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Marked hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency are associated with mortality in dialysis patients. However, such data in the chronic kidney disease stage 2–4 population are limited. It has been suggested that high-normal serum phosphate levels predict worse renal and patient outcomes. Data regarding parathyroid hormone levels and outcomes in this population are also limited. This study examines mineral metabolism and its association with the development of end-stage renal disease and mortality in stage 2–4 chronic kidney disease patients.

- **Methods**: This is a prospective cohort study that included 466 non-dialysis chronic kidney disease stage 2–4 patients. Mineral parameters were obtained at the time of enrollment, and the patients were followed prospectively for 25 (1–44) months or until they reached the endpoints of end-stage renal disease or mortality.

- **Results**: Hyperparathyroidism and 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency began to occur in the early stages of chronic kidney disease, whereas significant hyperphosphatemia only developed in the later stages. High-normal and mildly elevated serum phosphate levels (> 4.2 mg/dL) predicted the composite outcome of end-stage renal disease or mortality, after adjustments for cardiovascular risk factors, chronic kidney disease stage, and other mineral parameters. Parathyroid hormone levels above the upper limit of normal (> 65 pg/mL) predicted the future development of end-stage renal disease and the composite outcome of end-stage renal disease or mortality after adjustments. 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency (< 15 ng/mL) was also observed in the study.

### A 90-year-old man with hyperphosphatemia [^111XyBX7]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia is a common condition in patients with decreased kidney function, and without treatment, it can lead to a variety of clinical consequences. However, the presence of hyperphosphatemia in patients with normal kidney function may be true or spurious. We present a case of pseudohyperphosphatemia in a patient with monoclonal gammopathy. An increased paraprotein level can lead to colorimetric interference in the assay of phosphate measurement and result in spurious hyperphosphatemia. The epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of paraprotein-associated pseudohyperphosphatemia are also reviewed here. Ultrafiltration of paraproteins or deproteinization can help correct the measuring error. Patients with spurious hyperphosphatemia should not be treated with phosphate binders. Clinicians treating patients with monoclonal gammopathy should be aware of this relatively common clinical phenomenon and avoid inappropriate treatment of spurious hyperphosphatemia.

### Design and rationale of HiLo: A pragmatic, randomized trial of phosphate management for patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis [^113C1DNd]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia is a ubiquitous complication of kidney failure that is associated with increased risks of cardiovascular disease and death in observational studies. Experimental data suggest that hyperphosphatemia contributes to arterial calcification, which itself is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events and death. Arterial stiffness due to calcification promotes left ventricular hypertrophy, which is associated with heart failure, arrhythmia, and death.

Hyperphosphatemia also exacerbates kidney failure–associated increases in circulating levels of parathyroid hormone and fibroblast growth factor 23, each of which are associated with left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, arrhythmias, and infectious mortality in patients with kidney failure.

### State-of-the-art management of hyperphosphatemia in patients with CKD: An NKF-KDOQI controversies perspective [^111DsCDh]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Phosphate binders are among the most commonly prescribed medications for patients with kidney failure receiving dialysis and are often used in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). In patients with CKD glomerular filtration rate category 3a (G3a) or worse, including those with kidney failure who are receiving dialysis, clinical practice guidelines suggest "lowering elevated phosphate levels towards the normal range" with possible strategies including dietary phosphate restriction or use of binders. Additionally, guidelines suggest restricting the use of oral elemental calcium often contained in phosphate binders. Nutrition guidelines in CKD suggest a daily calcium intake of less than 800–1,000 mg, whereas CKD bone and mineral disorder guidelines do not provide clear targets; however, less than 1,500 mg in maintenance dialysis patients has been previously recommended.

Many different classes of phosphate binders are now available, and clinical trials have not definitively demonstrated the superiority of any class of phosphate binders over another with regard to clinical outcomes. The use of phosphate binders substantially contributes to patients' pill burden and out-of-pocket costs, with many binders having side effects. This has led to uncertainty regarding the use and best choice of phosphate binders for patients with CKD or kidney failure. In this controversies perspective, we discuss the evidence base around binder use in CKD and kidney failure, focusing on comparisons of available binders.

### Effect of treating hyperphosphatemia with lanthanum carbonate vs calcium carbonate on cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing hemodialysis: the LANDMARK randomized clinical trial [^112c23Wq]. JAMA (2021). High credibility.

Among patients with hyperphosphatemia undergoing dialysis, it is unclear whether non-calcium-based phosphate binders are more effective than calcium-based binders for reducing cardiovascular events.

- **Objective**: To determine whether lanthanum carbonate reduces cardiovascular events compared with calcium carbonate in patients with hyperphosphatemia at risk of vascular calcification undergoing hemodialysis.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Open-label, randomized, parallel-group clinical trial with blinded end point adjudication performed in 2374 patients with chronic kidney disease from 273 hemodialysis facilities in Japan. Eligible patients had hyperphosphatemia and one or more risk factors for vascular calcification (i.e. ≥ 65 years, postmenopausal, diabetes). Enrollment occurred from November 2011 to July 2014; follow-up ended June 2018.

- **Interventions**: Patients were randomized to receive either lanthanum carbonate (n = 1154) or calcium carbonate (n = 1155) and titrated to achieve serum phosphate levels of between 3.5 mg/dL and 6.0 mg/dL.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was a composite cardiovascular event (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke, unstable angina, transient ischemic attack, or hospitalization for heart failure or ventricular arrhythmia). Secondary outcomes included overall survival, secondary hyperparathyroidism-free survival, hip fracture-free survival, and adverse events.

- **Results**: Among 2309 randomized patients (median age, 69 years; 40.5% women), 1851 (80.2%) completed the trial. After a median follow-up of…

### New directions in phosphorus management in dialysis [^114Xvbny]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2023). Low credibility.

Phosphate management strategies in end-stage renal disease, including dietary phosphate restriction, dialysis, and phosphate binders, are inadequate to maintain target phosphate levels in most patients. Dietary phosphate restriction is challenging due to hidden phosphates in processed foods, and dialysis and phosphate binders are insufficient to match average dietary phosphate intake. As phosphate binders must be taken with each meal, patients need to ingest many large pills several times a day, negatively impacting quality of life. Recent advances in our understanding of phosphate absorption pathways have led to the development of new nonbinder therapies that block phosphate absorption.

This review describes the limitations of phosphate management strategies and discusses new therapies in development that inhibit phosphate absorption pathways. These new therapies present an opportunity to rethink phosphate management, potentially by prescribing phosphate absorption inhibitors as a primary therapy and adding phosphate binders if needed.

### Hyperphosphatemia and risks of acute kidney injury, end-stage renal disease, and mortality in hospitalized patients [^1121UQhX]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia is associated with vascular calcification and bone mineral disorders and is a major concern among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the relationship between hyperphosphatemia and renal outcome in non-CKD patients has not been studied. Furthermore, the clinical implications of hyperphosphatemia in relation to the risks of acute kidney injury (AKI), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and mortality after hospitalization remain unresolved.

- **Methods**: A total of 20,686 patients (aged ≥ 18 years) admitted to Seoul National University Bundang Hospital from January 2013 to December 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into quartiles according to serum phosphorus level at the time of admission. The odds ratios (ORs) for AKI and hazard ratios (HRs) for ESRD and all-cause mortality were calculated after adjustment of multiple covariates.

- **Results**: AKI developed in 2,319 patients (11.2%), with higher ORs for patients in the third and fourth quartiles (1.4 [1.24–1.68] and 2.8 [2.44–3.22], respectively) compared with the first quartile group. During a median follow-up period of 4.0 years, 183 patients (0.88%) developed ESRD and 3,675 patients (17.8%) died. Patients in the fourth quartile had higher risks of ESRD and mortality than patients in the first quartile (HRs, 2.3 [1.46–3.75] and 1.4 [1.22–1.49], respectively). These trends remained consistent in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate > 60 ml/min/1.73 m².

- **Conclusions**: Hyperphosphatemia is related to the risks of AKI, ESRD, and mortality.

### Phosphate meeting cholesterol-consequences for cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease [^1177LdbM]. Kidney International (2021). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is highly prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease. Hyperphosphatemia is associated with subclinical atheromatosis in chronic kidney disease. Phosphate-induced endothelial dysfunction and vascular calcification are thought to be key inducers of atherosclerosis in this condition. Zhou et al. now demonstrate that phosphate promotes de novo cholesterol synthesis in vascular smooth muscle and macrophages through increased 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activation. This observation may change concepts of atherosclerosis development and management in chronic kidney disease.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of calcium acetate on serum phosphorus concentrations in patients with advanced non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease [^115JdP2w]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major global health problem, affecting an estimated 5 to 10 percent of the total world population. In the United States, the prevalence of CKD has increased from 10% in 1988–1994 to 13.1% in 1999–2004, with an estimated 26 million individuals affected. Of these, more than 8 million are estimated to have a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 mL/minute/1.73 m². Chronic kidney disease is associated with increased costs and poor clinical outcomes. In addition to the progressive loss of kidney function over time and the eventual need for renal replacement therapy, patients with CKD have a high mortality rate, with cardiovascular disease accounting for almost 50% of deaths. Patients with CKD are more likely to die than progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

Strong evidence from experimental and clinical studies has documented a major role of elevated serum phosphorus in the pathogenesis of several clinical disorders in patients with CKD. Hyperphosphatemia contributes to abnormal bone metabolism and cardiovascular calcification (CVC), components of the syndrome of CKD-Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD). Ample evidence now exists for the role of hyperphosphatemia in the pathogenesis of CVC, a risk factor for death from cardiovascular disease. In vitro studies showed that phosphorus directly stimulates vascular smooth muscle cells to undergo osteoblastic differentiation and expression of bone-related proteins that are involved in the development and progression of CVC.

### A blueprint for randomized trials targeting phosphorus metabolism in chronic kidney disease [^112fdhrT]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) confers dismal clinical outcomes regardless of whether patients are initiating dialysis and face a median survival of only 2–3 years or they have earlier-stage CKD and face a risk of death that is greater than the risk of progression to dialysis. These poor outcomes are driven by extraordinarily high rates of cardiovascular disease that historically have not responded to risk-factor modification strategies proven to attenuate risk in the general population.

Nor have measures aimed at increasing the dose or quality of dialysis made an appreciable dent in mortality. Still worse, interventions that were expected to be beneficial resulted in increased mortality in recent trials. Although this apparent lack of progress in advancing the care of CKD is discouraging, resignation is not an option. On the contrary, with the rising rates of CKD worldwide, there is an urgent need to rigorously test novel therapeutic strategies in randomized trials.

The breadth of accumulating evidence linking disordered phosphorus metabolism to adverse outcomes spans in vitro, animal, and human studies and positions phosphorus management as an attractive target for intervention. Although opinion-based practice guidelines promote phosphorus management strategies that are widely accepted in dialysis patients, there is a clear need to perform randomized controlled trials to prove or disprove the benefits of therapy. Perhaps even more important, the discovery of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and its potential as a novel diagnostic to identify disordered.

### Dietary phosphorus restriction in advanced chronic kidney disease: merits, challenges, and emerging strategies [^117GTF9m]. Seminars in Dialysis (2010). Low credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia is an independent risk factor for mortality in patients on maintenance dialysis. Since phosphorus clearance by standard three times-weekly dialysis is insufficient to balance ongoing dietary phosphorus intake, strategies to prevent absorption of dietary phosphorus are essential for attenuating increased serum levels. Dietary phosphorus binders are used widely for this purpose, but dietary phosphorus restriction is relatively underutilized. This is most likely due to the logistical complexity of instituting and monitoring a low phosphorus diet and the fear of worsening protein-energy wasting, which is itself a potent risk factor for mortality.

In this review, we propose sustainable strategies for reducing phosphorus intake while avoiding exacerbation of protein-energy wasting. The approach is based on recognition of the dissociation between protein and phosphorus content in phosphorus-rich processed foods and the varying phosphorus bioavailability in different dietary sources. Controlling serum phosphate levels is among the most challenging aspects of day-to-day dialysis care, but the integration of sensible dietary interventions will likely improve phosphorus control.

### The efficacy and safety of sevelamer and lanthanum versus calcium-containing and iron-based binders in treating hyperphosphatemia in patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111JjcNn]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

It remains unclear which phosphate binders should be preferred for hyperphosphatemia management in chronic kidney disease (CKD).

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing sevelamer or lanthanum with other phosphate binders in CKD.

- **Results**: Fifty-one trials (8,829 patients) were reviewed. Compared with calcium-based binders, all-cause mortality was nonsignificantly lower with sevelamer [risk ratio (RR) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35–1.08] and lanthanum [RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.18–3.00], but the risk of bias was concerning. Compared with calcium-based binders, sevelamer reduced the risk of hypercalcemia [RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.17–0.42], as did lanthanum [RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.05–0.32]. Sevelamer reduced hospitalizations [RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.31–0.81], but not lanthanum [RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.34–1.93]. The presence or absence of other clinically relevant outcomes was infrequently reported. Compared with calcium-based binders, sevelamer reduced serum calcium, low-density lipoprotein, and coronary artery calcification, but increased intact parathyroid hormone. The clinical relevance of these changes is unknown since corresponding clinical outcomes were not reported. Lanthanum had less favorable impact on biochemical parameters. Sevelamer hydrochloride and sevelamer carbonate were similar in three studies. Sevelamer was similar to lanthanum (three studies) and iron-based binders (three studies).

- **Conclusion**: Sevelamer was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in mortality and significantly lower hospitalization rates and hypercalcemia.

### Phosphate metabolism in chronic kidney disease: From pathophysiology to clinical management [^113Sh4gd]. Seminars in Dialysis (2009). Low credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia is considered an independent risk factor for surrogate clinical endpoints such as vascular calcification (VC) and bone disease, as well as hard clinical outcomes like cardiovascular events. At the time of writing, various treatment options for phosphate removal or reduction are available. The great expectations placed on calcium-based phosphate binders were mitigated due to their possible contribution to progressive VC, particularly in patients treated simultaneously with active vitamin D derivatives. Thus, a paradigm shift occurred whereby the main clinical concern shifted from avoiding hypocalcemia to addressing the consequences of a positive calcium balance.

Sevelamer-HCl treatment allowed comparable control of hyperphosphatemia with a lower risk of hypercalcemia than calcium-based phosphate binders and a slower progression of VC. However, convincing evidence of improved clinical outcomes in dialysis patients is lacking. Although data on the safety and efficacy of lanthanum carbonate in the treatment of hyperphosphatemia have been provided in long-term clinical studies, there remains an ongoing scientific debate about its potential long-term toxicity. Moreover, there are no data from randomized clinical trials demonstrating beneficial effects of lanthanum carbonate treatment on VC or cardiovascular outcomes.

In the absence of convincing clinical trials testing the effects of non-metal-based phosphate binders on cardiovascular and global outcomes, it appears reasonable to maintain bone health and mineral homeostasis by mainly relying on adaptations of standard therapies.

### Hyperphosphatemia in patients with ESRD: Assessing the current evidence linking outcomes with treatment adherence [^111ZuKbW]. BMC Nephrology (2013).

In recent years, the imbalance in phosphate homeostasis in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has been the subject of much research. It appears that, while hyperphosphatemia may be a tangible indicator of deteriorating kidney function, lack of phosphate homeostasis may also be associated with the increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality that has become a hallmark of ESRD. The need to maintain phosphorus concentrations within a recommended range is reflected in evidence-based guidelines; however, these do not reflect serum phosphorus concentrations achieved by most patients in clinical practice.

Given this discrepancy, it is important to consider ways in which dietary restriction of phosphorus intake and, in particular, the use of phosphate binders in patients with ESRD can be made more effective. Poor adherence is common in patients with ESRD and has been associated with inadequate control of serum phosphorus concentrations. Studies indicate that, among other factors, major reasons for poor adherence to phosphate binder therapy include high pill burden and patients' lack of understanding of their condition and its treatment.

This review examines available evidence, seeking to understand fully the reasons underlying poor adherence in patients with ESRD and consider possible strategies for improving adherence in clinical practice.

### Lanthanum carbonate for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in CKD 5D: Multicenter, double blind, randomized, controlled trial in mainland China [^1112xX8F]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Serum phosphorus control is critical for chronic kidney disease (CKD) 5D patients. Currently, a clinical profile for an oral phosphorus binder in the mainland Chinese population is not available.

- **Objective**: To establish the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of lanthanum carbonate in CKD 5D patients.

- **Design**: Multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study. A central randomization center used computer-generated tables to allocate treatments.

- **Setting**: Twelve tertiary teaching hospitals and medical university-affiliated hospitals in mainland China.

- **Participants**: Overall, 258 hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) adult patients were enrolled.

- **Intervention**: After a 0–3-week washout period and a 4-week lanthanum carbonate dose-titration period, 230 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive lanthanum carbonate (1500 mg-3000 mg) or placebo for a further 4-week maintenance phase.

- **Main outcome measures**: Efficacy and safety of lanthanum carbonate to achieve and maintain target serum phosphorus concentrations were assessed.

- **Results**: In the titration phase, serum phosphorus concentrations of all patients decreased significantly. About three-fifths achieved target levels without significantly disturbing serum calcium levels. At the end of the maintenance period, the mean difference in serum phosphorus was significantly different between the lanthanum carbonate and placebo-treated groups (0.63 ± 0.62 mmol/L vs. 0.15 ± 0.52 mmol/L, P < 0.001). The drug-related adverse effects were mild and mostly gastrointestinal in nature.

Conclusion: Lanthanum carbonate is effective in reducing serum phosphorus concentrations in CKD 5D patients, with manageable adverse effects.

### Translation of nutrient level recommendations to control serum phosphate into food-based advice [^115qwapQ]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2021). Low credibility.

The control of hyperphosphatemia is key to the management of chronic kidney disease mineral and bone disorder. Dietary restriction of phosphorus is essential to control hyperphosphatemia. Guidelines for chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease generally provide high-level guidance on whether a nutrient should be restricted, e.g. restrict dietary phosphorus. Dietitians translate such guidance into nutrient-based strategies and finally into food-based practical dietary advice for patients to follow.

The practical aspects of dietary advice are not well described in the literature, nor are the challenges of concurrently altering one nutrient, e.g. phosphorus, while continuing to restrict others, e.g. potassium, while maintaining overall nutritional adequacy and quality of life. In this article, we describe how we translated updated nutrient level recommendations into practical dietary advice to be delivered at the bedside.

### Phosphate control in end-stage renal disease: Barriers and opportunities [^115Q3iG5]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia is a nearly universal complication of end-stage renal disease and is widely recognized as one of the most important and challenging clinical targets in the care of dialysis patients. Left untreated, it can lead to bone pain, pruritus, and worsening secondary hyperparathyroidism. Data from observational studies demonstrate that an elevated serum phosphorus level is an independent risk factor for mortality and that treatment with phosphate binders is independently associated with improved survival. Experimental studies provide support for the epidemiologic findings: phosphate excess promotes vascular calcification, induces endothelial dysfunction, and may contribute to other emerging chronic kidney disease-specific mechanisms of cardiovascular toxicity. On the basis of this evidence, clinical practice guidelines recommend specific targets for serum phosphorus levels in the dialysis population. The purpose of this review is to summarize common challenges in meeting these targets and to identify potential opportunities for improvement.

### The "phosphorus pyramid": A visual tool for dietary phosphate management in dialysis and CKD patients [^112oEZjq]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Phosphorus retention plays a pivotal role in the onset of mineral and bone disorders (MBD) in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Phosphorus retention commonly occurs as a result of net intestinal absorption exceeding renal excretion or dialysis removal. The dietary phosphorus load is crucial from the early stages of CKD, throughout the whole course of the disease, up to dialysis-dependent end-stage renal disease.

Agreement exists regarding the need for dietary phosphate control, but it is quite challenging in the real-life setting. Effective strategies to control dietary phosphorus intake include restricting phosphorus-rich foods, preferring phosphorus sourced from plant origin, boiling as the preferred cooking procedure, and avoiding foods with phosphorus-containing additives. Nutritional education is crucial in this regard.

Based on the existing literature, we developed the "phosphorus pyramid", a novel, visual, user-friendly tool for the nutritional education of patients and health-care professionals. The pyramid consists of six levels in which foods are arranged based on their phosphorus content, phosphorus-to-protein ratio, and phosphorus bioavailability. Each level has a colored edge (from green to red) that corresponds to recommended intake frequency, ranging from "unrestricted" to "avoid as much as possible".

The aim of the phosphorus pyramid is to support dietary counseling to reduce the phosphorus load, a crucial aspect of integrated CKD-MBD management.

### Dietary phosphate and the forgotten kidney patient: A critical need for FDA regulatory action [^114rYJ3h]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Careful dietary management that reduces high phosphate intake is recommended to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and prevent complications of CKD and may help reduce chronic disease risks such as incident CKD associated with high phosphate intake in the healthy general population.

For patients treated with maintenance dialysis, control of serum phosphorus levels is considered a marker of good care and requires a coordinated plan that limits dietary phosphate intake, uses oral phosphate binders, and provides an adequate dialysis prescription. Even with traditional thrice-weekly hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, use of phosphate binders, and a concerted effort to limit dietary phosphate intake, adequately controlled serum phosphorus levels are not possible in all dialysis patients.

Efforts to limit phosphate intake are thwarted by the underestimated and unquantified phosphate content of processed foods and some medications due to the hidden presence of phosphate additives or excipients added during processing or drug formulation. Effectively limiting phosphate intake could potentially be achieved through simple US Food and Drug Administration regulatory actions.

Mandatory labeling of phosphate content on all packaged foods and drugs would enable identification of healthy low-phosphate foods and medications and permit critically important control of total phosphate intake. Simple changes in regulatory policy and labeling are warranted and would enable better management of dietary intake of phosphate at all stages of kidney disease, as well as potentially improve patient outcomes.

### Secondary hyperparathyroidism: pathophysiology and treatment [^1137CjVb]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a frequently encountered problem in the management of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Its pathophysiology is mainly due to hyperphosphatemia and vitamin D deficiency and resistance. This condition has a high impact on the mortality and morbidity of dialysis patients. Early diagnosis of secondary hyperparathyroidism is crucial in the management of patients with CKD. The treatment remains a challenge for patients and their clinicians. It should include a combination of dietary phosphorus restriction, phosphate binders, vitamin D analogues, and calcimimetics.

### Hyperphosphatemia in patients with ESRD: Assessing the current evidence linking outcomes with treatment adherence [^112NSc2G]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

In order for us to update guidelines and optimize patient care, some gaps in the evidence base need to be addressed. Although available data demonstrate the association between hyperphosphatemia and increased risk of mortality, it remains a challenge in the clinic to achieve and maintain recommended serum phosphorus concentrations. A major obstacle to doing so is the problem of patient adherence to diet and phosphate binders.

We suggest that an approach to improve patient adherence should comprise three components:

- **Standardization of methods**: Methods for measuring and monitoring adherence between studies in ESRD need to be standardized.
- **Scientific validation of strategies**: Validation of strategies to improve adherence, such as patient reminders and comprehensive patient education, is essential.
- **Continued clinical research**: Research into the development of new formulations and/or phosphate binders with a reduced pill burden should be ongoing.

### Phosphate management in chronic kidney disease [^11129E7W]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

The review focuses on the rationale and evidence behind management strategies for hyperphosphatemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Optimal management of phosphate in CKD remains an area of uncertainty, but multiple studies now point to a clinical benefit from the use of phosphate binders. Evidence of improved survival is particularly strong with sevelamer, though it remains unclear whether the absence of calcium or other properties of sevelamer are responsible for this relationship. Newer agents, such as iron-based binders or niacin compounds to inhibit phosphorus absorption, may have additional benefits which will be better defined with additional experience. A reduced pill count may be a particularly beneficial characteristic of newer agents and has been associated with improved response to therapy. Increased use of frequent nocturnal hemodialysis is an additional tool to help ameliorate phosphate control. Data on the reduction of fibroblast growth factor 23 through use of phosphate binders remain weak.

An improved understanding of phosphate regulation and the development of new therapeutic agents have reinvigorated a once stagnant field, but significant changes to practice cannot yet be justified. There is increasing support for using sevelamer in place of calcium-based binders, though economic practicability remains challenging.

### Hyperphosphatemia in patients with ESRD: Assessing the current evidence linking outcomes with treatment adherence [^115LbxGA]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), progressive deterioration of kidney function results in elevated phosphorus concentrations in tissue and serum. This condition has been linked to numerous clinical complications. Several studies have demonstrated the connection between dysregulated phosphate homeostasis and increased mortality and morbidity. For instance, analysis of data from 40,538 hemodialysis patients using adjusted models revealed a stepwise increase in the relative risk of mortality associated with serum phosphorus concentrations exceeding 5 mg/dL.

In the retrospective United States (US) Renal Data System Waves 1, 3, and 4 study, which included 14,829 patients on hemodialysis, an association between phosphorus concentrations and the primary outcome of first cardiovascular (CV) events was observed starting from phosphorus concentrations of 4.5–5.3 mg/dL. Phosphorus concentrations above 6.4 mg/dL were associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality. Additionally, prospectively collected data from a 2-year historical cohort of 58,058 patients on maintenance hemodialysis demonstrated that hyperphosphatemia (over 6 mg/dL) consistently correlated with an increased risk of death.

### The "phosphorus pyramid": A visual tool for dietary phosphate management in dialysis and CKD patients [^115gm3mN]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Phosphorus restriction is a mainstay of the nutritional treatment of mineral and bone disorders in chronic kidney disease (CKD-MBD). CKD-MBD is a clinical and physiopathological component that dramatically influences the survival and quality of life of renal patients, with significant impacts on healthcare costs. Changes in calcium, calcitriol, PTH, and FGF-23 levels are highly prevalent, but increased serum phosphorus levels are the main trigger for CKD-MBD. In CKD patients, phosphorus retention occurs due to the net intestinal absorption exceeding renal excretion and/or dialysis removal. This highlights the role of the diet in controlling the effective phosphorus load, starting from the early CKD stages.

Phosphorus is ingested both as a natural component and as a food additive. As a natural food component, phosphorus is available as inorganic phosphate salts or as a constituent of phosphoproteins, membrane phospholipids, ATP, ADP, DNA, and RNA. On average, about 60% of dietary phosphorus is absorbed in the intestine as inorganic phosphorus, reaching up to 80% in the presence of high calcitriol levels, while the bioavailability of phosphorus of plant origin, namely phytates, is very low (< 40%).

Conversely, the net gastrointestinal absorption of phosphorus is maximal (approaching 100%) for phosphate salts added as food preservatives. Unfortunately, dietary phosphorus control is quite challenging in real-life settings. Therefore, information, education, and counseling are needed to effectively integrate dietary interventions.

### Mineral metabolism and outcomes in chronic kidney disease stage 2–4 patients [^112VPAAG]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Marked hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency are associated with mortality in dialysis patients. However, such data in the chronic kidney disease stage 2–4 population are limited. It has been suggested that high-normal serum phosphate levels predict worse renal and patient outcomes. The data regarding parathyroid hormone and outcomes in this population are limited. This study examines mineral metabolism and its association with the development of end-stage renal disease and mortality in stage 2–4 chronic kidney disease patients.

- **Methods**: This is a prospective cohort study that included 466 non-dialysis chronic kidney disease stage 2–4 patients. Mineral parameters were obtained at the time of enrollment, and the patients were followed prospectively for 25 (1–44) months or until they reached the endpoints of end-stage renal disease or mortality.

- **Results**: Hyperparathyroidism and 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency began to occur in the early stages of chronic kidney disease, whereas significant hyperphosphatemia only developed in the later stages. High-normal and mildly elevated serum phosphate (> 4.2 mg/dL) predicted the composite outcome of end-stage renal disease or mortality after adjustments for cardiovascular risk factors, chronic kidney disease stage, and other mineral parameters. Parathyroid hormone levels above the upper limit of normal (> 65 pg/mL) predicted the future development of end-stage renal disease and the composite outcome of end-stage renal disease or mortality after adjustments. 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency (< 15 ng/mL) was associated with similar outcomes.

### Prevention and treatment of hyperphosphatemia in chronic kidney disease [^114dbP6F]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia has consistently been shown to be associated with dismal outcomes in a wide variety of populations, particularly in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Compelling evidence from basic and animal studies elucidates a range of mechanisms by which phosphate may exert its pathological effects and motivates interventions to treat hyperphosphatemia. These interventions consist of dietary modifications and phosphate binders. However, the beneficial effects of these treatment methods on hard clinical outcomes have not been convincingly demonstrated in prospective clinical trials. In addition, exposure to high amounts of dietary phosphate may exert untoward actions even in the absence of overt hyperphosphatemia.

Based on this concept, it has been proposed that the same interventions used in CKD patients with normal phosphate concentrations be applied in the presence of hyperphosphatemia to prevent the rise of phosphate concentration and as an early intervention for cardiovascular risk. This review describes conceptual models of phosphate toxicity, summarizes the evidence base for treatment and prevention of hyperphosphatemia, and identifies important knowledge gaps in the field.

### Management of hyperphosphatemia in end-stage renal disease: A new paradigm [^112mrWSt]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2021). Low credibility.

Bone and mineral metabolism becomes dysregulated with the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and increasing levels of parathyroid hormone serve as an adaptive response to maintain normal phosphorus and calcium levels. In end-stage renal disease, this response becomes maladaptive, and high levels of phosphorus may occur. We summarize strategies to control hyperphosphatemia based on a systematic literature review of clinical trial and real-world observational data on phosphorus control in hemodialysis patients with CKD-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD).

- **Management options**: Diet and lifestyle changes, regular dialysis treatment, and use of phosphate binders, vitamin D, and calcimimetics have their own benefits and limitations with variable clinical outcomes. A more integrated approach to phosphorus control in dialysis patients may be necessary. This includes incorporating the measurement of multiple biomarkers of CKD-MBD pathophysiology (calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone) and correlating diet adjustments with CKD-MBD drugs, which may facilitate improved patient management.

### Phosphate binders and targets over decades: Do we have it right now [^114KCdqv]. Seminars in Dialysis (2017). Low credibility.

In advanced renal disease, the kidney is unable to maintain phosphate balance due to decreased urinary excretion, as well as the imbalance of the bone metabolic axis. It is well established that hyperphosphatemia is associated with increased cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, there are no randomized controlled trials that demonstrate a clear benefit on hard outcomes in lowering serum phosphate levels to recommended targets in the CKD or dialysis population. While calcium-based phosphate binders have traditionally been the standard of care in the treatment of hyperphosphatemia, data regarding the increased risk of vascular mineralization continues to emerge.

Clinicians continue to search for new phosphate-lowering therapies and investigate novel nutritional perspectives. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes is currently revising the guidelines on phosphate goals in CKD. This review outlines the history of phosphate targets and phosphate binders and explores innovative phosphate-lowering therapies. Based on data, clinicians moving forward should continue to treat end-stage renal disease patients with hyperphosphatemia based on individual risk factors for vascular mineralization.

### Effectiveness of phosphate binders on mortality and cardiovascular disease in end-stage renal disease patients with hyperphosphatemia: A multicenter real-world cohort study [^1156mZ1Q]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) commonly leads to hyperphosphatemia. If untreated, hyperphosphatemia increases the risk of bone disorders such as osteoporosis or fractures, secondary hyperparathyroidism, vascular calcification, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and premature mortality. Clinical practice guidelines recommend the use of phosphate binders (PBs) for ESRD patients when serum phosphate levels exceed 4.5 mg/dl. Calcium-based PBs (CBPBs) are the recommended primary treatment option. If CBPBs are ineffective or contraindicated, non-calcium-based PBs (NCBPBs), such as sevelamer or lanthanum carbonate, or aluminum hydroxide can be considered as secondary treatments.

In real-world clinical practice, national PB prescribing practices vary between countries due to healthcare provision, affordability, accessibility, and availability of medications. In high-income countries (HICs), many of these medications are more commonly available, affordable, and reimbursable as primary treatment options. In contrast, several of the newer NCBPBs are expensive (except aluminum hydroxide) and not widely funded in developing or upper-middle-income countries (UMICs), including Thailand. Consequently, only a minority of patients can afford sevelamer or lanthanum carbonate. Therefore, aluminum hydroxide is more commonly used instead.

### Simultaneous management of disordered phosphate and iron homeostasis to correct fibroblast growth factor 23 and associated outcomes in chronic kidney disease [^114UG4U3]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia, iron deficiency, and anemia are powerful stimuli of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) production and are highly prevalent complications of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In this manuscript, we put in perspective the newest insights on FGF23 regulation by iron and phosphate and their effects on CKD progression and associated outcomes. We especially focus on new studies aiming to reduce FGF23 levels, and we present new data that suggest major benefits of combined corrections of iron, phosphate, and FGF23 in CKD.

- **Recent findings**: New studies show that simultaneously correcting iron deficiency and hyperphosphatemia in CKD reduces the magnitude of FGF23 increase. Promising therapies using iron-based phosphate binders in CKD might mitigate cardiac and renal injury and improve survival.

- **Summary**: New strategies to lower FGF23 have emerged, and we discuss their benefits and risks in the context of CKD. Novel clinical and preclinical studies highlight the effects of phosphate restriction and iron repletion on FGF23 regulation.

### Hyperphosphatemia and risks of acute kidney injury, end-stage renal disease, and mortality in hospitalized patients [^113z5ZsS]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia is associated with the risks of AKI, ESRD, and mortality among hospitalized patients. Accordingly, serum phosphorus monitoring may help to identify patients at high risk of kidney function deterioration or mortality. Further studies are needed to explore the mechanisms underlying these observations.

### Development and validation of a nomogram for predicting hyperphosphatemia in non-dialysis patients with chronic kidney disease [^114v5dQ6]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

The four main independent risk factors for hyperphosphatemia are all physiological measures directly linked to kidney function. For example, elevated Scr levels reflect aggravated impairment of kidney function, specifically a lower phosphorus-filtering capacity that hampers blood phosphorus excretion. As GFR progressively declines, mechanisms related to maintaining phosphorus homeostasis are compromised, increasing the risk of hyperphosphatemia. Our results are consistent with those of previous studies that report a correlation between hyperphosphatemia and Scr.

Furthermore, our findings align with previous research establishing a substantial association between hyperphosphatemia and BUN. Similar to Scr, this association is likely not a direct causal relationship but a reflection of severe kidney impairment. BUN and Scr are clinically established biomarkers for renal function, serving as key parameters in estimating GFR and nephron impairment. To summarize, when patients with CKD develop renal impairment or even renal failure, the decreased ability of kidneys to expel phosphorus greatly increases hyperphosphatemia risk while elevating Scr and BUN levels.

The association of HGB and PTH levels with hyperphosphatemia is also consistent with prior reports. Fluctuations in HGB are also a clinical marker of anemia severity, and the association between anemia and hyperphosphatemia is well-established. Recent studies indicate that low hemoglobin levels may reflect an underlying inflammatory state, which could disrupt fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) regulation and impair phosphorus balance.

### Balancing nutrition and serum phosphorus in maintenance dialysis [^111rfys2]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Elevated serum phosphorus levels are common in patients with chronic kidney disease and are associated with heart and vascular disease, conditions that in turn are associated with increased mortality. Accurately managing phosphorus intake by restricting dietary protein alone can prove challenging because protein from different sources can contain varying amounts of available phosphorus. Additives used in processed foods frequently are high in inorganic phosphorus, which is readily absorbed, compounding this difficulty.

Recent evidence suggests that dietary protein restriction in some cases may do more harm than good in some patients treated with maintenance hemodialysis because protein restriction can lead to protein-energy wasting, which is associated with increased mortality. Accordingly, phosphorus binders are important for managing hyperphosphatemia in dialysis patients. Managing hyperphosphatemia in patients with late-stage chronic kidney disease requires an individualized approach, involving a combination of adequate dietary advice, phosphate-binder use, and adjustments to dialysis prescription.

We speculate that increased use of phosphate binders could allow patients to eat more protein-rich foods and that communicating this to patients might increase their perception of their need for phosphate binders, providing an incentive to improve adherence. The aim of this review is to discuss the challenges involved in maintaining adequate nutrition while controlling phosphorus levels in patients on maintenance hemodialysis therapy.

### Conversion to lanthanum carbonate monotherapy effectively controls serum phosphorus with a reduced tablet burden: a multicenter open-label study [^114JRt7U]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia is a serious consequence of advanced kidney failure. A majority of patients with ESRD/stage 5 chronic kidney disease require a phosphate binder as part of their treatment regimen, and in some cases, treatment may be required as early as stage 3. In the study described here, patients with ESRD were converted from previous treatments to lanthanum carbonate monotherapy in a clinical practice setting. Patients received prescriptions for the study medication from their nephrologist and obtained lanthanum carbonate tablets from local pharmacies. Compared with most other clinical trials in which patients receive study medication at the trial site, this study design more accurately represents routine clinical activities, thereby increasing the applicability of the results to standard practice. However, the study did not include active comparator or placebo arms, either of which may have strengthened the results.

Patients were converted to lanthanum carbonate monotherapy without a washout period from previous phosphate-binder regimens, which consisted of calcium-based phosphate binders (41.5%), sevelamer (38.0%), 'other' (combinations of different binders; 16.3%), and binder naïve (4.2%). The conversion to lanthanum carbonate (250-mg and 500-mg tablets) resulted in maintenance of serum phosphorus levels. The mean change from baseline was −0.06 ± 0.05 mg/dL at week 12 and 0.02 ± 0.05 mg/dL at week 16. At baseline, 41.8% of patients achieved the KDOQI-recommended level of control (≤ 5.5 mg/dL); 44.9% and 41.6% achieved control at treatment weeks 12 and 16.

### 'Phos'tering a clear message: The evolution of dietary phosphorus management in chronic kidney disease [^115jxQu1]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2023). Low credibility.

Phosphorus is a vital nutrient, but disturbances in phosphorus homeostasis are central to chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder. To minimize disturbances, traditional dietary guidance focused on a numerical phosphorus target, leading to the exclusion of many healthy foods and implementation challenges. Contemporary phosphorus guidance focuses on dietary source, avoiding additives, and emphasizing low-phosphorus bioaccessibility foods, leading to a more liberal approach. Additional work is needed to demonstrate the efficacy of these contemporary approaches and understand the influence of specific foods, processing, and cooking methods. Unfortunately, patient education using traditional and contemporary strategies may give mixed messages, particularly related to plant-based foods. Thus, greater clarity on the effects of specific foods and dietary patterns may improve phosphorus education. This review aims to discuss the evolution of dietary phosphorus management while highlighting areas for future research that can help move the field toward stronger evidence-based guidance to prevent and treat hyperphosphatemia.

### Hyperphosphatemia in patients with ESRD: Assessing the current evidence linking outcomes with treatment adherence [^112YuFEu]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

A typical phosphorus-restricted diet for hemodialysis patients includes approximately 900 mg of phosphorus per day, of which about 371 mg are absorbed. Therefore, additional means of reducing serum phosphorus load are necessitated, and most patients require the use of phosphate binders. Phosphate binders can provide the patient with greater nutritional freedom. However, different types of binders have different phosphate binding capacities. For example, in one study, lanthanum carbonate bound 135 mg of phosphate per tablet, whereas sevelamer carbonate bound 21 mg of phosphate per tablet. Different phosphate binders are, therefore, associated with varying pill burdens. A potential means of reducing pill burden would be if patients adjusted their phosphate binder intake according to the phosphorus content of each meal or snack.

It is important to note that the benefits of phosphate binder treatment should ideally extend beyond biochemical or laboratory parameters (such as serum phosphorus concentrations) to hard clinical outcomes such as cardiovascular events or prolonged survival. There are few placebo-controlled interventional studies examining the effect of phosphate binder treatment on survival. However, data from observational studies have accumulated that support the view that early treatment with phosphate binders is associated with prolonged survival. For example, a prospective cohort study compared the 1-year mortality rate of patients initiating outpatient hemodialysis who were treated with phosphate binders during the first 90 days (n = 3,555) with that of patients who did not.

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to the management of hyperphosphatemia, KDIGO 2017 guidelines recommend considering limiting dietary phosphate intake, alone or in combination with other therapeutic options, in the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in patients with CKD stages G3a-G5D.

### Pathogenesis of vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease [^111iCxvM]. Kidney International (2005). Low credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia and hypercalcemia are independent risk factors for higher incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease. In addition to increased calcium-phosphate product, hyperphosphatemia accelerates the progression of secondary hyperparathyroidism with concomitant bone loss, which may be linked to vascular calcium-phosphate precipitation.

The control of serum phosphate levels reduces vascular calcification not only by decreasing the degree of secondary hyperparathyroidism and calcium-phosphate product, but also by reducing the expression of proteins responsible for active bone mineral deposition in cells of the vasculature. Calcium and aluminum-free phosphate binders provide a new and effective therapeutic tool in preventing vascular calcifications in chronic kidney disease in animal models and in hemodialysis patients.

Additional investigations are necessary to examine the benefits of different phosphate binders in reducing mortality from cardiovascular disease.

### How to evaluate phosphate control in patients on dialysis [^116PVc8q]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Low credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia is associated with negative consequences, such as vascular calcification, and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) disease, which is the primary cause of mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Phosphate control to more normal levels of 4.5 mg/dL correlates with improved survival. Both the magnitude of phosphate elevation above the target range (2.5–4.5 mg/dL) and the time spent with above-target phosphate levels correspond to increased CV morbidity and mortality. Thus, reduction and maintenance of serum phosphate toward more normal levels are part of established clinical practice guidelines. The KDOQI guidelines recommend a target of 3.5–5.5 mg/dL in patients with CKD Stage 5 on dialysis, while the KDIGO guidelines recommend targeting phosphate toward normal levels.

Consistently achieving and maintaining phosphate levels below 5.5 mg/dL, let alone more normal levels, is an ongoing clinical challenge. Phosphate control in clinical practice has not improved in almost a decade. Novel approaches that more accurately assess phosphate control may allow clinicians to be more responsive to patients' needs, potentially improving patient outcomes.

### Hyperphosphatemia in patients with ESRD: Assessing the current evidence linking outcomes with treatment adherence [^113uDQEC]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Overall, there is a lack of long-term data from randomized, controlled studies evaluating the relative efficacy of specific phosphate binders on hard clinical outcomes such as mortality and musculoskeletal morbidity. Furthermore, available data have been somewhat contradictory. Results of the randomized, open-label Dialysis Clinical Outcomes Revisited study in 2,103 hemodialysis patients showed no difference in the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality among patients receiving sevelamer hydrochloride (HCl) compared with those receiving a calcium-based phosphate binder, although a significantly lower risk of mortality was reported in patients aged ≥ 65 years receiving sevelamer compared with those receiving a calcium-based binder (p = 0.02). These data contrast with results from the randomized, open-label Renagel In New Dialysis study in 148 patients new to hemodialysis who were randomized to receive calcium-based phosphate binders or sevelamer HCl. In this study, the 18-month coronary artery calcification score increased significantly in each treatment group but was significantly larger with calcium-based binders than with sevelamer (p = 0.01). After a median follow-up of 44 months, mortality was significantly higher in patients receiving calcium-based binders than in those receiving sevelamer (p = 0.05).
