## Question

What are all the drugs contraindicated in heart failure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medications are contraindicated in heart failure and which should be avoided. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing absolute contraindications from strong "avoid" recommendations. Then, I should categorize drugs by mechanism and evidence base. Next, I will extract specific drug classes and agents with clear labeling or guideline-based contraindications. After that, I should verify the nuances of "relative" versus "absolute" restrictions and highlight special cases. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, actionable summary with exceptions and caveats anchored to current guidelines and labels.

> Let me first confirm the framework so I don't conflate "do not use" with "absolutely contraindicated". I need to check guideline language that uses Class III "Harm" versus explicit labeled contraindications; ACC/AHA/HFSA guidance frequently lists agents that increase mortality or worsen HF as not recommended, while FDA labeling may state a formal contraindication in defined HF populations, so I should preserve that distinction explicitly [^113VkYST] [^114BFSA6].

> Next, I will examine antiarrhythmic drugs, since this is an area where both guideline warnings and FDA contraindications commonly appear. Class IC antiarrhythmics (for example, flecainide, propafenone) are not recommended in HFrEF because they can increase mortality; dronedarone is contraindicated in symptomatic HF with recent decompensation or NYHA Class IV, and also in permanent atrial fibrillation due to increased death, stroke, and HF hospitalization risk; amiodarone is generally the only antiarrhythmic considered acceptable in HF when needed, with careful monitoring [^116pyuiK] [^115hshp3] [^117MpNGP] [^111dVXtn].

> I will now examine thiazolidinediones (TZDs) because they have well-established fluid retention risk. Wait, let me verify the labeling details: pioglitazone and rosiglitazone carry boxed warnings and are contraindicated for initiation in patients with established NYHA Class III or IV HF; both FDA labeling and multiple guidelines advise avoiding TZDs in symptomatic HF or at risk of HF exacerbation due to dose-related edema and HF events [^116bJED9] [^111yzqM3] [^116qWsdV] [^112juJxU] [^113VkYST].

> Let me consider DPP-4 inhibitors next. I initially thought all DPP-4 inhibitors were contraindicated in HF, but hold on, I should verify that nuance: saxagliptin and alogliptin are specifically associated with increased HF hospitalization risk and should be avoided in HF, particularly in those with high cardiovascular risk; this is not a blanket contraindication for the entire DPP-4 class, but a targeted avoidance for these two agents based on outcome data and FDA guidance [^116YKmNZ] [^113VkYST] [^113NhWam].

> I need to check NSAIDs next because they are commonly overlooked. NSAIDs (nonselective COX inhibitors and COX-2 inhibitors) worsen HF symptoms via prostaglandin inhibition, promoting sodium and water retention, increasing systemic vascular resistance, and blunting diuretic response; guidelines recommend avoiding or withdrawing NSAIDs whenever possible in HFrEF [^116Rn9T2] [^114NE5za].

> Now, calcium channel blockers require careful differentiation. Nondihydropyridines (diltiazem, verapamil) are not recommended in HFrEF due to negative inotropy and risk of deterioration; among dihydropyridines, amlodipine is generally neutral and may be used for compelling indications like hypertension or angina, whereas other dihydropyridines (for example, nifedipine, nicardipine, nisoldipine) are not recommended for HF treatment; I should double-check that this aligns with both guideline phrasing and real-world data showing inappropriate CCB use in HFrEF with AF [^113VkYST] [^112ZdegJ] [^111KM7fQ].

> Let me review pulmonary and other vasodilators that can precipitate HF. Epoprostenol (prostacyclin) is contraindicated in HF due to reduced LVEF; bosentan has been associated with worsening HF in some contexts; and cilostazol, a PDE3 inhibitor, is contraindicated in HF patients due to proarrhythmic risk; I should confirm each of these against labeling and AHA statements to avoid overgeneralization [^112AQYdv] [^114CQVuj] [^1146BrU4].

> I should confirm the status of metformin because historical teaching differs from current guidance. Metformin is no longer absolutely contraindicated in HF; it can be used when renal function is adequate (generally eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) with dose reduction at eGFR < 45, and should be avoided in acute decompensated or unstable HF; this corrects the outdated notion that HF itself is a contraindication [^114QXqLR] [^116f1BS5].

> But wait, what about aspirin in chronic HF? Routine aspirin is not recommended solely for HF; it may be appropriate for compelling indications like recent MI or high atherosclerotic risk, yet observational and randomized data suggest possible harm in some HF contexts, so it should not be started for HF alone and may be avoided in refractory HF when risks outweigh benefits [^116x5L3N] [^112ZdegJ].

> Next, I should review alpha-1 blockers. Doxazosin and prazosin have been associated with increased HF risk and worsening outcomes in large antihypertensive trials; therefore, they should generally be avoided as antihypertensive choices in patients with HF when alternatives exist [^112ZdegJ].

> I will now synthesize the agents with explicit contraindications versus those strongly avoided. Absolute or labeled contraindications in defined HF populations include dronedarone in symptomatic HF with recent decompensation or NYHA Class IV, TZDs for initiation in NYHA III–IV HF, epoprostenol in HF due to reduced LVEF, and cilostazol in HF; strong "avoid" recommendations include class IC antiarrhythmics, saxagliptin and alogliptin, NSAIDs, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and non-amlodipine dihydropyridines for HF treatment, with amiodarone generally acceptable when antiarrhythmic therapy is necessary [^115hshp3] [^116bJED9] [^112AQYdv] [^1146BrU4] [^116pyuiK] [^116YKmNZ] [^116Rn9T2] [^113VkYST] [^111dVXtn].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and exceptions so I don't overstate. In HFpEF, the same "avoid" principles largely apply, with SGLT2 inhibitors now foundational therapy unless contraindicated; TZDs remain relatively contraindicated in HFpEF as well, and saxagliptin/alogliptin should still be avoided; amlodipine may be used for compelling indications like hypertension or angina, but other CCBs should be avoided for HF treatment; and metformin remains acceptable with renal function thresholds observed [^111x4dmo] [^113NhWam] [^114QXqLR].

> Finally, I need to ensure the practical takeaway is actionable. Clinicians should reconcile all medications at every visit, deprescribe harmful or non-indicated agents, and document contraindications when withholding GDMT; medication flow sheets and team-based approaches improve safety, and structured deprescribing protocols help prioritize agents with the lowest benefit–harm ratio for withdrawal, especially in polypharmacy [^114VQFPW] [^1157xMnw] [^115MHET5].

In heart failure, **avoid NSAIDs** [^116Rn9T2] due to fluid retention and renal dysfunction, and **avoid thiazolidinediones** (pioglitazone, rosiglitazone) [^112juJxU] because they cause or worsen fluid retention and are contraindicated in NYHA III–IV [^116bJED9] [^116qWsdV]. Dronedarone is **contraindicated in symptomatic HF or NYHA IV** [^115hshp3] due to increased mortality [^117MpNGP]. Class IC antiarrhythmics (flecainide, propafenone) [^111dVXtn] and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) [^113VkYST] are not recommended in HFrEF because they worsen HF. Saxagliptin and alogliptin [^116YKmNZ] increase HF hospitalization risk and should be avoided [^113NhWam]. Use caution with other agents that may exacerbate HF, and always confirm contraindications before prescribing [^116dYfKQ].

## Medications requiring caution or close monitoring

Several medications are **not absolutely contraindicated** but require caution and close monitoring due to potential adverse effects in heart failure patients:

- **Metformin**: Previously contraindicated, but recent guidelines suggest it can be used in stable HF patients with normal renal function. Caution is advised in patients with renal impairment or unstable HF [^114QXqLR] [^116f1BS5].

- **SGLT2 inhibitors**: Generally beneficial in HF, but caution is advised in patients with hypotension or renal impairment.

- **Antidepressants**: Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) should be avoided due to their anticholinergic and cardiotoxic effects. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are generally safer but still require monitoring for fluid retention and electrolyte disturbances.

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Given the extensive list of medications that may exacerbate heart failure, **clinicians should**:

- **Regularly review and reconcile medications**: Ensure that patients are not taking medications that may worsen HF symptoms [^114VQFPW].

- **Educate patients**: Inform patients about potential adverse effects of medications and the importance of adhering to prescribed therapies [^113ag1NH].

- **Monitor closely**: Regularly monitor renal function, electrolytes, and fluid status, especially when initiating or adjusting medications [^114Zxacr].

- **Consider alternatives**: When possible, substitute contraindicated medications with safer alternatives [^1157xMnw].

---

## Summary of key recommendations

- **Avoid NSAIDs**: Strongly discouraged due to fluid retention and renal dysfunction [^116Rn9T2].

- **Avoid thiazolidinediones**: Contraindicated in symptomatic HF or NYHA III–IV [^116bJED9].

- **Avoid dronedarone and class IC antiarrhythmics**: Contraindicated in symptomatic HF or NYHA IV [^115hshp3].

- **Avoid nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers**: Not recommended in HFrEF due to negative inotropic effects [^113VkYST].

- **Avoid saxagliptin and alogliptin**: Associated with increased HF hospitalization risk [^116YKmNZ].

- **Use caution with metformin**: Safe in stable HF with normal renal function, but avoid in unstable HF or renal impairment [^114QXqLR].

Several medications are contraindicated or strongly discouraged in heart failure patients due to their potential to exacerbate symptoms, worsen renal function, or increase mortality. Clinicians should **regularly review medications**, educate patients, and monitor closely to minimize risks and optimize outcomes [^114VQFPW].

### Is heart failure guideline adherence being underestimated? The impact of therapeutic contraindications [^117TRQCB]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Several studies based on claims data have reported underutilization of evidence-based heart failure (HF) therapies. The degree to which these estimates fail to account for therapeutic contraindications is unclear.

Methods

We identified patients with HF and left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 45% seen between January 1, 2010, and July 1, 2010, at a tertiary care Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Medical records were abstracted to evaluate utilization of and contraindications to β-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, aldosterone antagonist, anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, and cardiac resynchronization therapies.

Results

Of the 178 patients with HF and an ejection fraction ≤ 45%, 78 (44%) received every guideline-recommended therapy. After accounting for medical contraindications, 77 (72%) of 107 patients received every guideline-recommended therapy. Adherence to recommendations for β-blocker (98%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin blocker (95%), and anticoagulation (97%) were better than adherence to implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (82%), cardiac resynchronization therapy (59%), or aldosterone antagonist (51%) recommendations. In adjusted analysis, lower New York Heart Association functional class and care by a cardiologist were associated with improved guideline adherence (P < .001).

Conclusions

Many patients with HF have therapeutic contraindications, and a failure to account for these may lead to a large underestimation of the true guideline adherence rates.

### Misconceptions and facts about heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^11544xUj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is a significant driver of morbidity and mortality. There are common misconceptions regarding the disease processes underlying heart failure and best practices for therapy. The terms heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and left ventricular systolic dysfunction are not interchangeable terms. Key therapies for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction target the underlying disease processes, not the left ventricular ejection fraction alone. The absence of congestion does not rule out heart failure. Patients with cardiac amyloidosis can also present with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. A rise in serum creatinine in acute heart failure exacerbation is not associated with tubular injury. Guideline directed medical therapy should be continued during acute exacerbations of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and should be started in the same hospitalization in new diagnoses. Marginal blood pressure is not a relative contraindication to optimal guideline directed medical therapy. Guideline directed medical therapy should be continued even if ejection fraction improves. There are other therapies that provide significant benefit besides the four key medications in guideline directed medical therapy.

### Guideline for the management of heart failure caused by systolic dysfunction: part II. treatment [^114oSHnt]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Several large clinical trials conducted over the past decade have shown that pharmacologic interventions can dramatically reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with heart failure. These trials have modified and enhanced the therapeutic paradigm for heart failure and extended treatment goals beyond limiting congestive symptoms of volume overload. Part II of this two-part article presents treatment recommendations for patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The authors recommend that, if tolerated and not contraindicated, the following agents be used in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction: an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in all patients; a beta blocker in all patients except those who have symptoms at rest; and spironolactone in patients who have symptoms at rest or who have had such symptoms within the past six months. Diuretics and digoxin should be reserved, as needed, for symptomatic management of heart failure. Other treatments or treatment programs may be necessary in individual patients.

### Medication dosing for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction-opportunities and challenges [^116odxSF]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Multiple drug classes have shown incremental benefits in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Most of these trials were designed to achieve specific doses of the investigational agent. Clinical practice guidelines recommend using the same target dosing of therapies, as tolerated. However, with the increasing number of available therapies, clinicians face the challenge of simultaneously using several drugs, achieving target doses, and managing side effects that are often overlapping. Blood pressure, renal function, hyperkalaemia, and other factors may impede achieving target doses of all medications, leaving clinicians with dilemmas as to how to sequence and dose these various classes of drugs. The guideline-directed eligibility for certain drugs and devices requires stability on maximally tolerated doses of background therapies. However, significant variability exists in dosing achieved in clinical practice. We discuss the existing background data regarding the doses of heart failure medications in clinical trials and in practice, and provide recommendations on how to navigate this complex therapeutic decision-making.

### Are SGLT-2 inhibitors the future of heart failure treatment? The EMPEROR-preserved and EMPEROR-reduced trials [^115wuFpw]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Established Heart Failure Therapies Improve Mortality in HFrEF but not HFpEF

Heart failure practice guidelines advocate that all patients with HFrEF should be prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta blockers in the absence of any contraindication. In those patients with a moderately to severely impaired left ventricular ejection fraction, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists should be considered, to further improve prognosis. Following initiation and dose up-titration of these medications, clinicians should consider the use of medications such as hydralazine, sacubitril/valsartan, nitrites and ivabradine or, in some cases, device therapy such as cardiac resynchronization therapy.

The use of ACE inhibitors reduces renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) activity by inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which reduces systemic vasoconstriction, cardiac and vascular hypertrophy and the adrenal release of aldosterone, thereby modulating sodium and water retention. Likewise, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists impede the RAAS by directly inhibiting the effect of aldosterone in the kidney, reducing sodium and water retention and improving cardiac remodelling. Thus, there is good rationale for RAAS inhibition in people with HFrEF, and evidence from trials consistently demonstrates improved clinical outcomes in these patients. Additionally, overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system in people with HFrEF is responsible for systemic vasoconstriction, increased heart rate, increased left ventricular afterload, cardiac remodelling and fibrosis. Thus, beta blockers reduce the toxic effect of adrenergic excess by inhibiting the chronotropic and inotropic effect of adrenaline and noradrenaline on the heart, supporting a regression in myocardial mass and cardiac remodelling, again with favourable cardiovascular outcomes in people with HFrEF.

Unfortunately, little clinical trial evidence supporting RAAS inhibition or beta-blockade exists for people with HFpEF, often limiting treatment to risk factor management and diuresis to improve symptoms of fluid overload. Despite current management approaches, the natural history of the disease is to progress, often with significant morbidity and mortality. Indeed, people with heart failure have a projected 5-year mortality rate of 75%, and 82% require hospital readmission. Therefore, new drug therapies for people with HFpEF are essential, and the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors is attractive due to the significant number of patients with co-morbid diabetes.

### American college of cardiology / American Heart Association chronic heart failure evaluation and management guidelines: relevance to the geriatric practice [^115yovp1]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Heart failure (HF) is the only cardiovascular disease with increasing incidence and prevalence. Most HF patients are older adults. With the aging of the population and effective treatment of hypertension and coronary artery disease, the two major underlying causes of HF, the number of older Americans with HF is expected to rise significantly in the coming decades. HF is the number one hospital discharge diagnosis for older adults. It is one of the causes of frequent hospital readmissions, reflecting acute decompensation and compromised quality of life for patients and increased cost and resource use for the healthcare system. It is also associated with approximately 300,000 deaths annually, most in older adults. Advances in the management of HF in the past several decades have significantly decreased the mortality and morbidity associated with this condition. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and spironolactone on survival and quality of life of HF patients, but there is evidence of underuse of evidence-based care for HF. Several national guidelines have been published since 1994 that recommended evidence-based evaluation and management of HF. In 1995, the American College of Cardiologists (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) published their first HF guidelines that recommended left ventricular (LV) function evaluation for all patients presenting with HF and use of ACE inhibitors for all patients with LV systolic dysfunction (LVSD) unless contraindicated. The guidelines recommended the use of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate in patients who could not use ACE inhibitors. In addition, digoxin was recommended in patients with HF due to LVSD but not adequately responsive to ACE inhibitors and diuretics and in those with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular rates. Diuretic use was recommended for symptomatic patients with evidence of fluid overload. Use of anticoagulation was restricted to patients with atrial fibrillation or to those with a history of systemic or pulmonary embolism. Beta-blockers were reserved for HF patients after acute myocardial infarctions. Recent advances in the management of HF called for a revision of the guidelines.

Purpose

The purpose of revising the 1995 ACC/AHA guidelines was to incorporate recent advances in pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to HF treatment and to assist physicians in clinical decision-making in the management of HF.

Methods

The ACC/AHA invited representatives from the American College of Chest Physicians, the Heart Failure Society of America, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine to participate in the preparation of the guidelines. The writing committee searched pertinent medical literature in English using computerized databases such as MEDLINE and EMBASE and manually searching the bibliographies of the selected articles. The writing committee classified HF into four stages, including patients who are at high risk for developing HF. According to this new classification, Stage A and B represent asymptomatic patients, the former at high risk for developing HF but no structural disorder, the latter with structural disorders of the heart. Stage C encompasses patients with underlying structural heart disorders who are symptomatic, either currently or in the past. Stage D includes end-stage HF patients. This new classification is intended to complement the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification of HF into Class I (asymptomatic), Class II (symptomatic on less than ordinary exertion), Class III (symptomatic on ordinary exertion), and Class IV (symptomatic at rest).

Results

The recommendations are categorized into those for evaluation and management.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^117TPoVW]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Given the current state of affairs, most practitioners who claim that patients are receiving 'guideline‐directed medical therapy' are making a judgment that is not based on objective criteria. 8 No set of standards has been developed to define 'optimal medical therapy'. Anyone who asserts that their patients are being managed appropriately is providing a well‐intentioned (but personal) opinion, since no one has defined what combination of treatments should be considered 'optimal', 'acceptable', 'adequate', 'reasonable' or 'guideline‐directed'.

Practical use of ACE inhibitors — selection, co-therapy, and cautions: Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors should be prescribed to all patients with HF due to LV systolic dysfunction with reduced LVEF unless they have a contraindication or have been shown to be unable to tolerate these drugs, and treatment with an ACEI should not be delayed until resistance to other drugs is demonstrated. In general, ACEIs are used together with a beta-blocker, and ACEIs should not be prescribed without diuretics in patients with a current or recent history of fluid retention. ACEIs are often preferred over ARBs or direct-acting vasodilators because of the greater experience and weight of evidence in support of their effectiveness. Patients should not be given an ACEI if they have experienced life-threatening adverse reactions (angioedema or anuric renal failure) during previous exposure or if they are pregnant. ACEIs should be taken with caution when very low systemic blood pressure is present (systolic blood pressure less than 80 mm Hg), when serum creatinine is markedly increased (greater than 3 mg per dL), with bilateral renal artery stenosis, or when serum potassium is elevated (greater than 5.5 mmol per liter). Treatment with an ACEI should not be initiated in hypotensive patients who are at immediate risk of cardiogenic shock; such patients should first receive other forms of treatment for HF and then be re-evaluated for ACE inhibition once stability has been achieved.

### Who enrolls in the Medicare part D prescription drug benefit program? Medication use among patients with heart failure [^112p7i5c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Results

We identified 81 874 eligible beneficiaries with prevalent heart failure as of January 1, 2010. Among eligible beneficiaries, 49 252 (60.2%) were enrolled in a Medicare Part D plan as of January 1, 2010, and 44 218 were alive and enrolled as of April 30, 2010. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the study population by Medicare Part D enrollment status. Mean age was 80 years among both enrollees and nonenrollees. Nearly 2 of every 3 enrollees were women. Enrollees were more frequently black than nonenrollees. They also more frequently had a portion of their Medicare Part A and Part B premiums paid by the state (ie, state buy‐in), an indication of low socioeconomic status.

Table 1.
Baseline Characteristics of Medicare Beneficiaries With Heart Failure by Part D Enrollment Status*

Like nonenrollees, enrollees tended to have multiple comorbid conditions (Table 2). Hypertension was the most frequently documented comorbid condition (> 90% of beneficiaries, regardless of Medicare Part D enrollment status). More than two‐thirds of enrollees had a history of coronary heart disease, more than half had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and more than half had diabetes mellitus. Nearly half had prevalent atrial fibrillation. A considerable number of beneficiaries had other noncardiovascular comorbid conditions, including cancer and dementia.

Table 2.
Comorbid Conditions Among Medicare Beneficiaries With Heart Failure by Part D Enrollment Status *

Table 3 shows the percentage of Medicare Part D enrollees with heart failure who filled prescriptions for medications potentially indicated or contraindicated for patients with heart failure. Enrollees more frequently filled prescriptions for loop diuretics than for ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. Approximately 1 in 10 enrollees with heart failure filled prescriptions for aldosterone antagonists; nearly one‐third of enrollees filled a prescription for potentially contraindicated diabetic medications, such as thiazolidinediones and metformin. In addition to potassium supplements, enrollees were frequently prescribed antibiotics and medications indicated as treatment for chronic pain, hypothyroidism, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (Table 4).

### Determinants of guideline-directed medical therapy implementation during heart Failure hospitalization [^114DnZD1]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Pharmacologic treatment of patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) has evolved considerably since the initial publication of the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) management guidelines in 1995. In addition to diuretics, major guidelines, now provide Class I recommendations for use of beta-blockers, inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system [angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs)], mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, hydralazine with nitrate in Black patients, and most recently, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2Is), all of which improve outcomes in patients with HFrEF. The cumulative effects of these medications result in mortality reductions of up to 70 to 80%. Unfortunately, guideline-directed medical therapies (GDMTs) are not optimally utilized in the HFrEF population. Because socially vulnerable populations have particularly poor HF outcomes, attention has focused on variability in GDMT utilization related to socioeconomic characteristics. Available information, however, is discordant with some studies finding evidence of discrepancies in treatment between racial and ethnic groups, while others have failed to detect differences in GDMT utilization.,

An important limitation of many prior studies of GDMT implementation is that medication classes were assessed individually, without consideration of dose, or accounting for contraindications to specific drug classes. In clinical practice, however, avoidance of some GDMTs with continued use of others is determined on an individualized basis according to patient-specific contraindications. Thus, a measure that assesses GDMT for HFrEF in combination, while considering specific contraindications in individuals, would provide more accurate insights regarding GDMT utilization in clinical practice. Accordingly, we quantified GDMT optimization by modifying the Heart Failure Collaboratory's optimal medical therapy (OMT) score, which considers the use of multiple agents in combination, to account for indications and contraindications of specific drugs used to treat an individual patient.

### 2023 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^113NhWam]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and diabetes — antihyperglycemic therapy selection and avoidance: Sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) "should be first-line therapy for individuals with HFpEF and T2DM and add-on or alternate therapy in those already on other agents", and clinicians "should consider stopping or adjusting the dose of other hypoglycemic agents in order to accommodate an SGLT2i". Metformin "is recommended as first-line therapy for glycemic control in individuals with T2DM and HF, including HFpEF, with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m²", with observational data "suggesting a 20% relative risk reduction in mortality in individuals with HF, including HFpEF". Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) trials "included 10% to 23% of individuals with HF in the study population", and these drugs "should be considered in individuals with HFpEF with coexisting T2DM and high risk for ASCVD or with pre-existing ASCVD". Agents to avoid include the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor saxagliptin, which "was associated with an increased risk of HF hospitalization (3.5% vs 2.8%; HR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.07–1.51)", and the FDA "contraindicates the use of saxagliptin and alogliptin in individuals with HF". Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are linked to "increased incidence of fluid retention, weight gain, and HF events", the risk rises with insulin coadministration and "this combination should be avoided", and "TZDs are relatively contraindicated in individuals with HFpEF".

### Should antidiabetic treatment of type 2 diabetes in patients with heart failure differ from that in patients without? [^115eHaRZ]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

Patients with type 2 diabetes are at high risk for developing heart failure. Evidence-based treatment recommendations with respect to the specific benefits or possible hazards of antidiabetic treatment are scarce.

Methods and Results

In a systematic search we only identified randomized, controlled trials for thiazolidinediones. Further evidence is largely based on subgroup analyses of larger intervention studies in mostly systolic heart failure, on observational studies, or on registries. Acknowledging this lack of data, hyperglycaemia should be treated to appropriate guideline-recommended targets and hypoglycaemia avoided until this evidence becomes available. Thiazolidinediones should not be used because of an increased event rate in diabetic patients with established heart failure and a large increase in incident heart failure. All other glucose-lowering strategies might be used in patients with diabetes and heart failure, but specific precautions must be considered.

Conclusions

The documented lack of data calls for specific trials, as diabetes and heart failure as well as their co-morbidities are highly prevalent and are becoming even more important with an increasing prevalence of obesity and an ageing population.

Concluding remarks and future directions

Despite compelling evidence that several neurohormonal antagonists used in combination have a striking effect to prolong survival in patients with chronic heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, most eligible patients are not receiving all recommended classes of drugs, and treated patients are usually prescribed subtarget doses. Typically, patients are receiving doses that are used for initiation of treatment; these doses are maintained for long periods of time, and no or little attempt is made to achieve target doses or show that patients are intolerant of higher doses. As a result, the vast majority of patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction in clinical practice are receiving treatments that have been demonstrated to exert meaningful effect on the natural history of the disease.

The failure of physicians to treat patients with trial‐proven regimens has numerous complex causes. However, an important contributor to the current state of affairs is the fact that physicians can readily claim that the use of subtarget doses is fully compatible with recommendations of current guidelines. Practice guidelines do not describe what regimens are acceptable, adequate or reasonable; thus, most treatments can be labelled as consistent with 'guideline‐directed medical therapy'.

Perhaps, adherence to the trial‐proven regimens might be markedly improved if physicians were asked to document the degree to which a patient's treatment adheres to or deviates from the strategies that were used to demonstrate the benefits of the neurohormonal antagonists that have demonstrated survival benefits. All of the landmark trials were 'strategy trials', i.e. the studies mandated a standardized forced‐titration treatment plan to a target dose. Investigators were required to increase the dose at specified increments and intervals to achieve a target dose, even if the patient experienced asymptomatic but unwanted changes in vital signs or laboratory tests. Investigators were also required to make repeated efforts to achieve and maintain target doses, often adjusting concomitant medications to improve the likelihood of tolerance. 'Forced‐titration strategies' were an essential element of every trial that demonstrated a survival benefit.

### Advanced (stage D) heart failure: a statement from the Heart Failure Society of America guidelines committee [^1158PXTt]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2015). Low credibility.

We propose that stage D advanced heart failure be defined as the presence of progressive and/or persistent severe signs and symptoms of heart failure despite optimized medical, surgical, and device therapy. Importantly, the progressive decline should be primarily driven by the heart failure syndrome. Formally defining advanced heart failure and specifying when medical and device therapies have failed is challenging, but signs and symptoms, hemodynamics, exercise testing, biomarkers, and risk prediction models are useful in this process. Identification of patients in stage D is a clinically important task because treatments are inherently limited, morbidity is typically progressive, and survival is often short. Age, frailty, and psychosocial issues affect both outcomes and selection of therapy for stage D patients. Heart transplant and mechanical circulatory support devices are potential treatment options in select patients. In addition to considering indications, contraindications, clinical status, and comorbidities, treatment selection for stage D patients involves incorporating the patient's wishes for survival versus quality of life, and palliative and hospice care should be integrated into care plans. More research is needed to determine optimal strategies for patient selection and medical decision making, with the ultimate goal of improving clinical and patient centered outcomes in patients with stage D heart failure.

### Polypharmacy and guideline-directed medical therapy initiation among adults hospitalized with heart Failure [^112drTBt]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Contraindications

Contraindications to beta-blockers included hypotension (defined as systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg) or bradycardia (defined as heart failure < 60) on admission or discharge and reported allergy or intolerance to beta blockers. Contraindications to ACEI/ARBs/ARNIs included acute kidney injury (defined as an increase in creatinine by 50% or 0.3 from admission to discharge), hyperkalemia (defined as K > 5.5) at admission or discharge, hypotension at admission or discharge, reported allergy or intolerance to ACEI/ARB, and being on dialysis. Contraindications to HYD-ISD included hypotension at admission or discharge and concurrent phosphodiesterase inhibitor use at discharge. Contraindications to MRAs included creatinine ≥ 2.5 in men or creatinine ≥ 2 in women on admission or discharge, acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia at admission or discharge, and hypotension at admission or discharge. Contraindications to antiplatelet agents included history of peptic ulcer disease/gastrointestinal bleed, history of hemorrhagic stroke, thrombocytopenia documented in chart, and reported allergy or intolerance to aspirin. Contraindication to statins included an intolerance or allergy to statins. Contraindications to anticoagulation included peptic ulcer disease, gastrointestinal bleed, history of hemorrhagic stroke, thrombocytopenia, and a history of falls. Supplemental Table 1 summarizes these contraindications. Although many of the listed contraindications are not absolute, we selected these criteria conservatively to determine the presence of potential contraindications.

Indicated medication eligible for initiation

We defined indicated medications eligible for initiation as indicated medications (guideline recommended for HFrEF/HFmrEF, CAD, and/or atrial fibrillation) that were not present on admission and had no contraindications.

### 2016 ESC and ACC / AHA / HFSA heart failure guideline update-what is new and why is it important? [^111KwTB5]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a global epidemic affecting millions of individuals worldwide. Although important progress has been made in the management of HF, this condition remains a common cause of morbidity and death. Since the publication of the previous sets of guidelines for the management of HF, new diagnostic and therapeutic options for HF have emerged. Now, both the ESC and the ACC/AHA/HFSA have simultaneously published an update of their guidelines incorporating, among others, recommendations for the use of new pharmacological therapies for the treatment of HF. For this Viewpoint article, we have asked the chairs of the ESC Task Force, the chairs of the ACC/AHA/HFSA Writing Committee, and an independent opinion leader in the field to offer their expert insight into the new guidelines, highlighting what is new, what the main differences are between the two sets of guidelines, and what steps should be taken to improve the guidelines in future updates.

### Advanced heart failure: a position statement of the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^111e3UuP]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

This article updates the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2007 classification of advanced heart failure and describes new diagnostic and treatment options for these patients. Recognizing the patient with advanced heart failure is critical to facilitate timely referral to advanced heart failure centres. Unplanned visits for heart failure decompensation, malignant arrhythmias, co-morbidities, and the 2016 ESC guidelines criteria for the diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction are included in this updated definition. Standard treatment is, by definition, insufficient in these patients. Inotropic therapy may be used as a bridge strategy, but it is only a palliative measure when used on its own, because of the lack of outcomes data. Major progress has occurred with short-term mechanical circulatory support devices for immediate management of cardiogenic shock and long-term mechanical circulatory support for either a bridge to transplantation or as destination therapy. Heart transplantation remains the treatment of choice for patients without contraindications. Some patients will not be candidates for advanced heart failure therapies. For these patients, who are often elderly with multiple co-morbidities, management of advanced heart failure to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life should be emphasized. Robust evidence from prospective studies is lacking for most therapies for advanced heart failure. There is an urgent need to develop evidence-based treatment algorithms to prolong life when possible and in accordance with patient preferences, increase life quality, and reduce the burden of hospitalization in this vulnerable patient population.

### How to handle polypharmacy in heart failure. A clinical consensus statement of the heart failure association of the ESC [^115MHET5]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Revision of therapy: deprescribing

Drug–drug interactions as well drug–disease interactions, and other drug‐related specific issues, are very common when patients are prescribed multiple treatments (Table 1). Inappropriate prescribing warrants careful consideration by specialists and requires timely review for each patient during every medical encounter. Several medications may cause or exacerbate HF, and should therefore represent the first‐choice targets for deprescribing. However, in daily clinical practice, such drugs are often not discontinued at discharge in patients hospitalized for HF. The use of over‐the‐counter (OTC) products and the access to self‐care medications are also extremely frequent in the HF population and contribute to polypharmacy. Eighty‐eight percent of HF patients use products not requiring any prescription, and this is also often not reported by the patient to the treating physicians.

Table 1
Potential safety/tolerability issues related to the main cardiovascular and non‐cardiovascular comorbidities treatments and potential solutions in patients with heart failure

The core principle of prescribing medications only when the potential benefits exceed the risks has recently been complemented by a paradigm shift towards proactive deprescribing when the harms outweigh the benefits.

A comprehensive definition of deprescribing should include: (1) a structured process of medication withdrawal, especially of inappropriate and unnecessary medications, or dose reduction; (2) oversight of the deprescribing process by a member of the healthcare team; (3) the goal of improving one or more specific outcomes (e.g. mortality, morbidity, quality of life, disease relapse); and (4) consideration of the patient's overall physiological status, stage of life, and goals of care.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^115wzxmU]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Which strategies are effective for the use of life‐prolonging drugs in patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction?

In the landmark trials with neurohormonal antagonists, investigators were required to follow a forced‐titration strategy to achieve and maintain treatment with specified target doses for long periods of time. Therapy was initiated at a low dose, and the doses were progressively increased in planned increments at specific time intervals, until the target dose was achieved or unless patients experienced clinically meaningful or serious adverse events, which persisted or recurred despite adjustment of other medications. In general, asymptomatic changes in vital signs and laboratory tests were not considered to represent events that would prevent uptitration to target doses. If the study medication was discontinued or the dose was decreased, these were considered to be temporary events, and investigators were strongly encouraged to reinstitute treatment and achieve target doses. Importantly, in most trials, the target dose was the same for every patient in the study, and a large majority achieved and were continued on target doses for the duration of the trial. Patients were maintained on subtarget doses only if the use of higher doses had been shown to threaten clinical stability. This 'forced‐titration' strategy ensured that few patients were maintained for long periods on the doses that had been used for initiation of treatment.

However, in clinical practice, these forced‐titration strategies are followed very infrequently. As a result, most patients are not receiving all mandated classes of drugs, and when treated, they commonly receive doses that were prescribed at the time of initiation of treatment. 3, 4, 5 Although these subtarget dosing regimens may have benefits, their ability to prolong life has not been established.

### Guideline-directed therapy at discharge in patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation [^115FJcf4]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

The ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines recommend each therapy unless they are contraindicated or not tolerated. Several methods have been developed to estimate adherence to clinical guidelines. The performance measures developed by the American College of Cardiology Foundation/AHA/American Medical Association-Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement is the ratio of patients prescribed each medication to patients with LV systolic dysfunction and without contraindications for medication. The patients with contraindications or intolerance were excluded from estimation of guideline adherence. The guideline-adherence indicator indicates the proportion of patients whose physicians prescribed medication according to the guidelines. Furthermore, non-administration of recommended drugs because of specific contraindications or intolerance was scored as adherence to guidelines. The modified guideline adherence score in this study strictly assessed whether physicians adhere to guideline recommendations for each individual. As shown in a previous study, our analysis also showed that a poorer guideline adherence was associated with a poorer prognosis in patients with AHF with AF, thus indicating that guideline adherence is important for patients with AHF with AF.

Study limitations

Several limitations of the present study should be noted. First, this was not a randomised controlled trial but a prospective cohort study. Thus, the HF therapy in the KorAHF registry was not randomly assigned but was entirely dependent on the attending physician, which raises the possibility of selection bias. Furthermore, there may be a risk-treatment mismatch in the guideline-directed therapy. Patients with poor guideline adherence had unfavourable clinical characteristics, but the rates of treatment with guideline-directed therapy were low in high-risk patients. Hence, patients with poor guideline adherence were at a high risk of death. This bias may have influenced the prognostic implications of each therapy despite adjustment for several variables that could influence prognosis. Second, we did not integrate adherence to the target dose of the recommended medication into the adherence score because dose escalation to the target dose is usually performed during the follow-up period after stabilisation. Third, HF therapy may be changed during the follow-up period, and this change may influence the clinical outcomes (online supplementary figure). However, the purpose of this study was to evaluate whether guideline-directed therapy at discharge has prognostic implications. Fourth, AF-specific information was limited, as AF diagnosis was based on electrocardiography at admission or during admission. This may have led to underestimation of AF, as some patients could have had a sinus rhythm during baseline electrocardiography and may have developed (episodes of) AF during follow-up.

Metformin use in heart failure (HF) is described as no longer contraindicated in HF, but renal dysfunction caveats remain: the contraindication to metformin use in patients with HF has been removed; metformin remains contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency, and the package insert states it should not be used in men with serum creatinine levels ≥ 1.5 mg/dL and in women with levels ≥ 1.4 mg/dL; National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidance suggests metformin can be used to an estimated glomerular filtration of 30 mL·min−1·1.73 m−2 with a dose reduction advised at an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 45 mL·min−1·1.73 m−2; given these concerns, metformin should be used cautiously (or avoided) in patients at risk for worsening renal dysfunction (eg, acute decompensated HF).

### Eligibility for the 4 pharmacological pillars in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction at discharge [^114WJEkH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background Guidelines recommend using multiple drugs in patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction, but there is a paucity of real-world data on the simultaneous initiation of the 4 pharmacological pillars at discharge after a decompensation event. Methods and Results A retrospective data mart, including patients diagnosed with HF, was implemented. Consecutively admitted patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction were selected through an automated approach and categorized according to the number/type of treatments prescribed at discharge. The prevalence of contraindications and cautions for HF with reduced ejection fraction treatments was systematically assessed. Logistic regression models were fitted to assess predictors of the number of treatments (≥ 2 versus < 2 drugs) prescribed and the risk of rehospitalization. A population of 305 patients with a first episode of HF hospitalization and a diagnosis of HF with reduced ejection fraction (ejection fraction, < 40%) was selected. At discharge, 49.2% received 2 current recommended drugs, β-blockers were prescribed in 93.4%, while a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor was prescribed in 68.2%. A mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist was prescribed in 32.5%, although none of the patients showed contraindications to mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist prescription. A sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor could be prescribed in 71.1% of patients. On the basis of current recommendations, 46.2% could receive the 4 foundational drugs at discharge. Renal dysfunction was associated with < 2 foundational drugs prescribed. After adjusting for age and renal function, use of ≥ 2 drugs was associated with lower risk of rehospitalization during the 30days after discharge. Conclusions A quadruple therapy could be directly implementable at discharge, potentially providing prognostic advantages. Renal dysfunction was the main prevalent condition limiting this approach.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^111NNmY2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Numerous guideline documents have issued recommendations to clinicians concerning the treatment of chronic heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction. However, guidelines do not describe what constitutes an acceptable standard of care, and thus, practitioners who adhere to only a small fraction of the recommendations might claim that they are treating patients 'in accordance with the guidelines'. As a result, < 1% of patients with heart failure are receiving all life-prolonging treatments at trial-proven doses. A major impediment to the widespread adoption of trial-based treatments is a lack of any existing framework that would allow physicians to describe the adequacy of care. To address this deficiency, we propose a novel simple approach that would ask practitioners if a patient had been treated using the dosing algorithm that had been shown to be effective for each drug class. The proposed framework recognizes that all landmark survival trials in heart failure were 'strategy trials', i.e. the studies mandated a standardized forced-titration treatment plan that required timely uptitration to specified target dose unless patients experienced clinically meaningful, intolerable or serious adverse events, which persisted or recurred despite adjustment of other medications. Adherence to trial-proven regimens might be improved if physicians were asked to describe the degree to which a patient's treatment adhered to or deviated from the strategies that had been used to demonstrate the survival benefits of neurohormonal antagonists. The proposed framework should also promote practitioner self-awareness about the lack of evidence supporting the current widespread use of subtarget doses that are non-adherent with trial-proven forced-titration strategies.

### How to handle polypharmacy in heart failure. A clinical consensus statement of the heart failure association of the ESC [^1157xMnw]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

In this scientific statement document, we propose a deprescribing protocol including five steps (Figure 1):
To review and reconcile all drugs the patient is currently taking, the underlying indications and whether there is current or past history of non‐adherence.
To consider the risk of drug‐induced harm in individual patients: medication‐related factors to consider include known ADRs, drug–drug or drug–disease interactions, and polypharmacy.
To assess each drug regarding its current or future expected benefit or harm, or the likelihood of being particularly burdensome (i.e. for instance big tablets difficult to swallow, treatments needing repetitive monitoring, etc.).
To prioritize for discontinuation drugs that have the lowest benefit–harm ratio, the lowest likelihood of adverse withdrawal reactions or disease rebound syndromes, and are easy to withdraw. Attention should be paid to patient preferences.
To implement a discontinuation regimen and closely monitor patients to early identify the results of the intervention. Slow tapering over time may be required for some agents associated with increased risk for an adverse drug withdrawal event. These events may include a relapse of symptoms as a result of the withdrawal, or a physiological withdrawal such as rebound tachycardia after discontinuation of beta‐blockers or an increase in blood pressure after discontinuation of anti‐hypertensive agents. Practical application of these recommendations can be apparently difficult and not immediate in routine care.

Responsibility of therapy revision should not belong to one specific healthcare provider. Multidisciplinary discussion and mutual support in the decision‐making and in the process of deprescribing are priorities. Together with the HF physician in charge, specialized HF nurses and pharmacists are of value in the management of every step of this process.

Figure 1
Multidomain approach for managing polypharmacy in heart failure (HF). Reconciliation of treatments and periodical assessment of therapeutic appropriateness follow multistep and multidisciplinary processes, which should consider patient and drug characteristics. Periodical review of these aspects is pivotal. When the possibility and need of deprescribing is ascertained, the deprescribing protocol represents a point‐by‐point guide that can support physicians' decisions. Alternatives to definitive deprescribing (i.e. represcribing/replacement, variation in the way of administration) should be always evaluated. CV, cardiovascular.

### Heart failure considerations of antihyperglycemic medications for type 2 diabetes [^116pWMsf]. Circulation Research (2016). Low credibility.

Prevalent and incident heart failure (HF) is increased in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, with risk directly associated with the severity of hyperglycemia. Furthermore, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, mortality is increased ≈10-fold in patients with versus without HF. Reducing HF with antihyperglycemic therapies, however, has been unsuccessful until recently. In fact, HF as an important outcome in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus seems to be heterogeneously modulated by antihyperglycemic medications, as evidenced by results from cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) and large observational cohort studies. Appropriately powered and executed CVOTs are necessary to truly evaluate cardiovascular safety and efficacy of new antihyperglycemic medications, as reflected by the guidance of the US Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies since 2008. In light of the best available evidence at present, metformin and the sodium-glucose-co-transporter 2-inhibitor empagliflozin seem to be especially advantageous with regard to HF effects, with their use associated with reduced HF events and improved mortality. Acarbose, the dipeptidyl-peptidase 4-inhibitor sitagliptin, the glucagon-like peptide 1-receptor agonist lixisenatide based on presently available CVOT results comprise reasonable additional options, as significant harm in terms of HF has been excluded for those drugs. Additions to this list are anticipated pending results of ongoing CVOTs. Although no HF harm was seen in CVOTs for insulin or sulfonylureas, they should be used only with caution in patients with HF, given their established high risk for hypoglycemia and some uncertainties on their safety in patients with HF derived from epidemiological observations. Pioglitazone is contraindicated in patients with HF > New York Heart Association I, despite some benefits suggested by CVOT subanalyses.

Pioglitazone

Pioglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure. Patients treated with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride must be considered [see BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS (4), and ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)].

### Aspirin use in chronic heart failure: what should we recommend to the practitioner? [^116x5L3N]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

There has been ongoing controversy as to whether aspirin should be used in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). The argument for aspirin is that many patients have underlying coronary disease, and aspirin prevents reinfarction and other vascular events. Arguments against the routine use of aspirin are that many CHF patients do not have underlying coronary disease, and that the benefit of aspirin lessens after the first 6 to 12 months after infarction. Also, several analyses suggest that aspirin may actually worsen outcomes in CHF patients, possibly because it inhibits prostaglandins, with resulting adverse hemodynamic and renal effects. Two recent prospective randomized studies have found that aspirin is associated with more frequent hospitalizations for worsening heart failure, although it did not have an adverse effect on vascular events. These results suggest that aspirin should not be routinely used in CHF patients and be avoided in those with refractory CHF, but that it may be beneficial in patients with recent infarction or multiple vascular risk factors.

### Practical recommendations for the use of ACE inhibitors, β-blockers, aldosterone antagonists and angiotensin receptor blockers in heart failure: putting guidelines into practice [^11664hjw]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2005). Low credibility.

Surveys of prescribing patterns in both hospitals and primary care have usually shown delays in translating the evidence from clinical trials of pharmacological agents into clinical practice, thereby denying patients with heart failure (HF) the benefits of drug treatments proven to improve well-being and prolong life. This may be due to unfamiliarity with the evidence-base for these therapies, the clinical guidelines recommending the use of these treatments or both, as well as concerns regarding adverse events. ACE inhibitors have long been the cornerstone of therapy for systolic HF irrespective of aetiology. Recent trials have now shown that treatment with beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists and angiotensin receptor blockers also leads to substantial improvements in outcome. In order to accelerate the safe uptake of these treatments and to ensure that all eligible patients receive the most appropriate medications, a clear and concise set of clinical recommendations has been prepared by a group of clinicians with practical expertise in the management of HF. The objective of these recommendations is to provide practical guidance for non-specialists, in order to increase the use of evidenced based therapy for HF. These practical recommendations are meant to serve as a supplement to, rather than replacement of, existing HF guidelines.

### Trends in calcium channel blocker use in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and comorbid atrial fibrillation [^111KM7fQ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and atrial fibrillation commonly coexist. Most calcium channel blockers are not recommended in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, but their use has been seldom evaluated. For patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and comorbid atrial fibrillation, we sought to 1) determine the proportion discharged on contraindicated calcium channel blockers, 2) describe how clinicians' use of these medications at discharge have changed over time, and 3) identify predictors for contraindicated calcium channel blocker prescription at discharge.

Methods

We analyzed 395 patients discharged with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and atrial fibrillation between 2008 and 2018. Discharge on a contraindicated calcium channel blocker (any calcium channel blocker except amlodipine) was the primary outcome. Changes in calcium channel blocker prescription over time were evaluated with a Cochran-Armitage trend test. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of calcium channel blocker prescription at discharge.

Results

Twenty-nine (7.3%) patients were discharged on a contraindicated calcium channel blocker without change over time (P trend = .38). Of these, 26 (86.7%) were discharged on multiple atrioventricular nodal blocking medications. Hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 7.87; 95% confidence interval, 1.04–59.40) and female sex (OR 3.01; 95% CI, 1.36–6.67) were both associated with contraindicated calcium channel blocker prescription at discharge while diabetes mellitus was negatively associated with this outcome (OR 0.34; 95% CI, 0.14–0.88).

Conclusion

One in 14 patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and comorbid atrial fibrillation were discharged on a contraindicated calcium channel blocker, without change over time. Most patients were discharged on multiple atrioventricular nodal blockers, highlighting potential need for greater coordination between discharging physicians, pharmacists, and electrophysiology.

In those with an LVEF < 55% to 60%, use of an MRA, ARNI, or ARB may be considered when an ARNI is not feasible. ARNIs and MRAs should be titrated to the maximum tolerated dosages based on symptoms, blood pressure, potassium, and creatinine, with STRONG-HF supporting initiation of GDMT at one-half of target doses before discharge and titration to target dosages over the next 2 weeks, with frequent follow-up over the 2 months.

### Practical recommendations for the use of ACE inhibitors, β-blockers and spironolactone in heart failure: putting guidelines into practice [^114nmVCM]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2001). Low credibility.

Surveys of prescribing in both hospitals and primary care have shown delays in translating improved survival data from clinical trials into clinical practice thereby denying patients the benefits of proven treatments, such as the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.

### Polypharmacy and guideline-directed medical therapy initiation among adults hospitalized with heart Failure [^1143jEAB]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

There are several strengths to this study. Geographic diversity was a major strength, as this cohort from REGARDS included participants admitted to 408 different hospitals across the 48 contiguous states of the United States and the District of Columbia. Another important strength was that the data was derived from chart level data, which permitted collection of detailed information on indications and contraindication, including data on intolerances/allergies as well as comorbid conditions.

Study Limitations

There were also some important limitations. First, chart abstraction is an imperfect strategy to identify contraindications to medications, since conditions that could serve as a contraindication may not be clearly documented — it is possible that this study underestimated the prevalence of contraindications. Although we have used a broad list of conditions including relative contraindications that might prevent physicians from initiating GDMT in real practice, there may be other contraindications not clearly documented in the chart or not easily detected by chart review. In addition, there may have been discussions between the patient and physician regarding risks and benefits of GDMT that were not clearly documented, whereby the patient ultimately decided to defer initiation of a GDMT agent for various reasons. Second, we did not have data on prior attempts of GDMT and/or data from prior outpatient encounters that could have impacted GDMT initiation. Third, although we incorporated multiple covariates when examining the association between polypharmacy and GDMT initiation, following a well-accepted conceptual framework (the Andersen model), there is risk of unmeasured confounding. Fourth, there are important nuances to decision-making related to ACEI/ARB/ARNI vs HYD-ISD, specifically in Black persons that were beyond the scope of this study. Future work examining how polypharmacy and other factors affect the decision of prescribing ACEI/ARB/ARNI vs HYD-ISD is warranted. Fifth, we only examined underprescribing from the standpoint of initiation — whether polypharmacy impacts the likelihood of reaching maximal dosing is an important issue that also merits further investigation. Future work would also benefit from a larger sample size, as inferences regarding some of the medication patterns were limited by wide error bars. Finally, we included data as far back as 2003, though the majority of events occurred after 2010; since this time, the number of medications available to treat different conditions including HF has increased significantly. To build on this work, future work would benefit from examining medication patterns during the latest era of HF pharmacotherapy, which now notably includes sodium-glucose transport protein-2 inhibitors.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^117R5eNn]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Proposal for a new framework for describing the degree of adherence to evidence‐based treatment

Given the broad range of possible reasons why physicians do not prescribe and uptitrate drugs that prolong survival in chronic heart failure, how can we objectively describe the adequacy of treatment in individual patients? Although it is possible to simply record the doses of drugs, such an approach provides no information about whether the practitioner actually utilized the forced‐titration strategies that were shown to be effective in prolonging life in large‐scale clinical trials.

It is appealing to simply ask physicians to describe why target doses of drugs were not prescribed, but such an approach would be impossible to implement. Imagine asking each practitioner to document at each visit the ability of patients to tolerate each drug class, the nature of the adverse event that prevented uptitration, the steps that were taken to enhance tolerability, and whether failure to achieve target doses was related to misconceptions held by the prescribing clinician. The reasons for failing to achieve target doses varies from patient to patient and may change over time in the same patient. Additionally, there may be many simultaneous reasons for a decision to maintain subtarget doses.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — drugs of unproven value or that may worsen HF: In patients with HFrEF, dihydropyridine calcium channel-blocking drugs are not recommended treatment for HF. In patients with HFrEF, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and hormonal therapy are not recommended other than to correct specific deficiencies. In patients with HFrEF, nondihydropyridine calcium channel-blocking drugs are not recommended. In patients with HFrEF, class IC antiarrhythmic medications and dronedarone may increase the risk of mortality. In patients with HFrEF, thiazolidinediones increase the risk of worsening HF symptoms and hospitalizations. In patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk, the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors saxagliptin and alogliptin increase the risk of HF hospitalization and should be avoided in patients with HF. In patients with HFrEF, NSAIDs worsen HF symptoms and should be avoided or withdrawn whenever possible.

### Pioglitazone hydrochloride (Actos) [^116CMq6f]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

5.1 Congestive Heart Failure

ACTOS, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when ACTOS is used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure. Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of ACTOS must be considered [see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.2 Edema

In controlled clinical trials, edema was reported more frequently in patients treated with ACTOS than in placebo-treated patients and is dose-related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In postmarketing experience, reports of new onset or worsening edema have been received.

ACTOS should be used with caution in patients with edema. Because thiazolidinediones, including ACTOS, can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, ACTOS should be used with caution in patients at risk for congestive heart failure. Patients treated with ACTOS should be monitored for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)].

Likewise, the Canadian guidelines recommend that, in the absence of contraindications, patients with HFrEF be treated with combination therapy from the beginning, including one evidenced-based medication from each of the categories (ARNI, B-blocker, MRA, and SGLT2i) (strong recommendation; moderate level of evidence). The main recommendations on the use of SGLT2i stated in the main guidelines are summarized in Table 3.

### How to handle polypharmacy in heart failure. A clinical consensus statement of the heart failure association of the ESC [^1134vvo1]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

The rationale for drug discontinuation is inadequately addressed by randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and is not explored in the guidelines. There are various barriers to deprescribing which can involve the healthcare system, physicians and patients. There is no consensus nor solid evidence regarding the most appropriate approach to deprescribing in multimorbid HF patients. Patients may perceive deprescribing as a form of abandonment of care or a cost‐saving measure. Both patients and physicians may hold beliefs in the continuation of treatment despite the lack of indication. Patients may be hesitant to discontinue a medication initiated by other physicians, and there is often a lack of proactive communication between healthcare professionals and patients regarding the rationale for deprescribing a specific treatment. Healthcare‐related barriers to deprescribing may include the lack of dedicated time, lack of adequate staffing, lack of a consistent deprescribing workflow, and limited documentation in the medical records of patients.

Key points:
Dedicated time to the careful revision of prescriptions at every medical encounter can contribute to avoid inappropriate prescribing.
Deprescribing aims to reduce unnecessary or potentially harmful medication use in order to improve patient outcome.
Several tools are available to address polypharmacy in the elderly population (Table 2).
Deprescribing should follow a structured stepwise process (Figure 1).
Multidisciplinary discussion is key to the practical process of deprescribing.

Fixed‐dose combination in heart failure

Fixed‐dose combination (or polypill) strategies, defined as FDC for multiple purposes, consist of the association of ≥ 2 drugs in a single formulation and were first introduced in the early 2000s to substantially reduce CV disease in both primary and secondary prevention. Such a strategy improves patient adherence, and can aid in mitigating the polypharmacy burden. In patients with systemic hypertension, FDC reduced the daily pills intake, has been found to increase patient adherence, and is currently recommended as initial strategy for most patients. Exceptions are patients with moderate‐to‐severe frailty, symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, or older people (aged ≥ 85 years).

Data from a meta‐analysis confirmed the positive impact of FDC on CV outcomes in primary prevention. In patients with recent myocardial infarction, a polypill including key medications (aspirin, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor, statin) reduced CV events by 24% as compared with usual care, and European guidelines on hypertension support the use of FDC for primary and secondary prevention of CV outcomes.

WARNINGS

Rosiglitazone maleate: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE AND MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION

Thiazolidinediones, including rosiglitazone, cause or exacerbate congestive heart failure in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. After initiation of AVANDAMET, and after dose increases, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of heart failure (including excessive, rapid weight gain, dyspnea, and/or edema). If these signs and symptoms develop, the heart failure should be managed according to current standards of care. Furthermore, discontinuation or dose reduction of AVANDAMET must be considered.
AVANDAMET is not recommended in patients with symptomatic heart failure. Initiation of AVANDAMET in patients with established NYHA Class III or IV heart failure is contraindicated. [See Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2).]
A meta-analysis of 52 clinical trials (mean duration 6 months; 16,995 total patients), most of which compared rosiglitazone to placebo, showed rosiglitazone to be associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction. Three other trials (mean duration 46 months; 14,067 total patients), comparing rosiglitazone to some other approved oral antidiabetic agents or placebo, showed a statistically non-significant increased risk of myocardial infarction, and a statistically non-significant decreased risk of death. There have been no clinical trials directly comparing cardiovascular risk of rosiglitazone and ACTOS (pioglitazone, another thiazolidinedione), but in a separate trial, pioglitazone (when compared to placebo) did not show an increased risk of myocardial infarction or death. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3).]

In a retrospective cohort of 16 417 Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes mellitus discharged after a HF hospitalization, metformin was linked with reduced mortality (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.78–0.97), and a systematic review reported a pooled adjusted risk estimate for mortality of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.74–0.87; P < 0.001); in HF with chronic kidney disease, the pooled adjusted risk estimate was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.64–1.02; P = 0.08), and metformin was not associated with an increased risk for lactic acidosis. The 2016 American Diabetes Association standards recommend that metformin can be used in patients with stable HF if renal function is normal (eg, > 60 mL·min–1·1.73 m–2) but should be avoided in unstable or hospitalized patients with HF, and in 2016 the FDA recommended that metformin be contraindicated when renal function is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m².

### Rosiglitazone maleate and metformin hydrochloride (Avandamet) [^111F4WN1]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

5.2 Cardiac Failure

Rosiglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, alone or in combination with other antidiabetic agents, can cause fluid retention, which may exacerbate or lead to heart failure. Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If these signs and symptoms develop, the heart failure should be managed according to current standards of care. Furthermore, discontinuation or dose reduction of rosiglitazone must be considered [see Boxed Warning].

Patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) NYHA Class I and II treated with rosiglitazone have an increased risk of cardiovascular events. A 52-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled echocardiographic trial was conducted in 224 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and NYHA Class I or II CHF (ejection fraction ≤ 45%) on background antidiabetic and CHF therapy. An independent committee conducted a blinded evaluation of fluid-related events (including congestive heart failure) and cardiovascular hospitalizations according to predefined criteria (adjudication). Separate from the adjudication, other cardiovascular adverse events were reported by investigators. Although no treatment difference in change from baseline of ejection fractions was observed, more cardiovascular adverse events were observed with rosiglitazone treatment compared to placebo during the 52-week trial. (See Table 2.)

Initiation of AVANDAMET in patients with established NYHA Class III or IV heart failure is contraindicated. AVANDAMET is not recommended in patients with symptomatic heart failure. [See Boxed Warning .]

### Holistic approach to drug therapy in a patient with heart failure [^113choNT]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a growing global public health problem affecting at least 26million people worldwide. The evidence-based landscape for HF treatment has changed at a rapid rate over the last 30 years. International guidelines for the management of HF now recommend the use of four pillars in all patients with reduced ejection fraction: angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors or ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors. Beyond the main four pillar therapies, numerous further pharmacological treatments are also available in specific patient subtypes. These armouries of drug therapy are impressive, but where does this leave us with individualised and patient-centred care? This paper reviews the common considerations needed to provide a holistic, tailored and individual approach to drug therapy in a patient with HF with reduced ejection fraction, including shared decision making, initiating and sequencing of HF pharmacotherapy, drug-related considerations, polypharmacy and adherence.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^113hK6bi]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Current challenges in describing the adequacy of treatment regimens

Authors often claim that patients enrolled in clinical studies were receiving optimal medical therapy as background treatment. In clinical practice, practitioners commonly state that their treatment plan is 'guideline‐directed medical therapy'. What do these statements mean? Actually, there exists no standardized framework to describe the degree to which a patient's medical regimen adheres to, or deviates from, the strategies that were used in clinical trials to demonstrate the benefits of specific drugs and devices.

There should be no doubt that most patients are not receiving target (or the highest tolerated) doses of all essential drugs, even when patients are treated by clinical investigators with considerable expertise in heart failure. Critical (class I) elements are often missing, and most eligible patients are never prescribed target doses of essential drugs at any point in time during follow‐up. 3, 4, 5 In one prospective study, only 23% of patients were receiving ≥ 50% of target doses of beta‐blockers, renin–angiotensin inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. 4 In a second survey, target doses of angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors, beta‐blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists were prescribed in < 1%. 5

Even if an expert panel were formed to critically examine the treatment of individual patients, such oversight does not necessarily improve physician adherence to crucial recommendations. For example, the COAPT trial established a compulsory review of drug treatments for patients with heart failure prior to enrolment. Yet, only 60% to 70% of patients were receiving a conventional inhibitor of the renin–angiotensin system; < 5% were receiving a neprilysin inhibitor; and it is not known if patients were treated with the target doses of class I agents that have been shown to reduce mortality. 6 Furthermore, the medical review process in COAPT was applied only at the start of the trial; following randomization, uptitration of medications was discouraged, an approach that is inconsistent with best clinical practice. Interestingly, in the MITRA‐FR trial (which studied the same intervention as in COAPT), patients received more intensive medical therapy for heart failure than in the COAPT trial, even though there was no external oversight process. 7

### Drug therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: what is the 'right' dose? [^111hXfYu]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

What can we conclude about the dosing of evidence‐based pharmacotherapy in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction?

The most correct conclusion from the landmark trials in HFrEF is that the substantial benefits observed were obtained despite a third to a half of patients not achieving the 'target doses' aspired to. However, it is important to reiterate that in all trials it was recognized that every patient would not tolerate the target dose and up‐titration towards the target might be limited by intolerance (and indeed for some drugs was limited by the protocol e.g. because of hyperkalaemia). The rate of target dose achievement must also be interpreted in the light of the rates achieved in the placebo group. Therefore, the average dose achieved and the proportion attaining the target dose, as compared with the same metrics in the relevant trials, is the best way to assess dosing success in a patient cohort; it is a mistake to assume that 100% of patients should achieve the target dose. More importantly, it must be recognized that the low doses used during the up‐titration phase of these drugs also have a substantial effect. It is this evidence – that there is a clear clinical benefit from even low doses and this is demonstrable within a very short time after starting treatment – that supports the change in emphasis in the new guidance. Up‐titrating the dose of a single agent before starting the next therapy is of secondary importance. Initiating a low dose of as many protective therapies as possible as quickly as possible is the priority. This is to avoid delay in obtaining the early and additive benefit from the multiple mechanistically distinct evidence‐based therapies available. As argued elsewhere, the order in which these drugs is started does not matter and may be tailored to patient characteristics. Up‐titration of dose, guided by patient tolerability, remains important but can be done later.

### Type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure: a position statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^117Vnb2n]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

The coexistence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and heart failure (HF), either with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), is frequent (30–40% of patients) and associated with a higher risk of HF hospitalization, all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality. The most important causes of HF in T2DM are coronary artery disease, arterial hypertension and a direct detrimental effect of T2DM on the myocardium. T2DM is often unrecognized in HF patients, and vice versa, which emphasizes the importance of an active search for both disorders in the clinical practice. There are no specific limitations to HF treatment in T2DM. Subanalyses of trials addressing HF treatment in the general population have shown that all HF therapies are similarly effective regardless of T2DM. Concerning T2DM treatment in HF patients, most guidelines currently recommend metformin as the first-line choice. Sulphonylureas and insulin have been the traditional second- and third-line therapies although their safety in HF is equivocal. Neither glucagon-like preptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, nor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors reduce the risk for HF hospitalization. Indeed, a DPP4 inhibitor, saxagliptin, has been associated with a higher risk of HF hospitalization. Thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) are contraindicated in patients with (or at risk of) HF. In recent trials, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, empagliflozin and canagliflozin, have both shown a significant reduction in HF hospitalization in patients with established CV disease or at risk of CV disease. Several ongoing trials should provide an insight into the effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with HFrEF and HFpEF in the absence of T2DM.

Each of the criteria proposed in the table deserves thought and deliberation, particularly with respect to the use of beta‐blockers. Since not all beta‐blockers reduce mortality, the only members of the drug class that warrant inclusion in stratum I are those that have been specifically shown to reduce mortality in large‐scale trials. Furthermore, analyses of these trials have raised important questions about the ability of beta‐blockers to prolong survival in patients with atrial fibrillation, 48 potentially because the target doses used in the pivotal trials may have caused excessive slowing of the ventricular response, which predisposed to fatal bradyarrhythmic events. 49 Consequently, patients with atrial fibrillation who are treated with a beta‐blocker are assigned to stratum I with no designated target heart rate, since heart rates of 80–90 bpm may be appropriate targets for the use of beta‐blockers if patients have atrial fibrillation. 50

Why are patients receiving subtarget doses of critical treatments?

In clinical practice, physicians initiate treatment at a low 'starting dose', but most patients continue to receive the starting dose for long periods of time, often indefinitely, with no or minimal uptitration. When new treatments are initiated at low doses during a hospitalization for heart failure, these doses are typically maintained following discharge. 25 This pattern of practice is prevalent whether patients are treated by primary care physicians or by heart failure specialists.

A striking example is the prescribing of sacubitril/valsartan. The drug is commonly initiated at 24/26 mg twice daily, but is uptitrated only in a small fraction of patients. 26 In contrast, few patients received long‐term treatment with 24/26 mg twice daily in the large‐scale clinical trial that established the survival benefit of neprilysin inhibition (PARADIGM‐HF). 27, 28 All patients in that trial received target doses of the drug at randomization, and > 70% were maintained on this dose for the duration of the study 27; yet, in clinical practice, < 25% of patients are ever titrated to the target dose of 97/103 mg twice daily. Interestingly, 40% of the patients who required temporary dose reduction in PARADIGM‐HF were subsequently restored to target doses. In contrast, in clinical practice, the vast majority of dose reductions are permanent, leading to indefinite treatment with subtarget doses.

The approach to treating life‐threatening heart failure in clinical practice differs markedly from that used by oncologists to treat life‐threatening cancers. Cancer specialists initiate simultaneous therapy with multiple‐drug regimens at target doses and down‐titrate only if serious adverse reactions occur that cannot be mitigated with additional treatments. Efforts to prolong life are valued far more highly than efforts to minimize drug toxicity. In striking contrast, the treatment of heart failure is routinely initiated with low doses of a single drug; additional therapies are added at a later time; and avoidance of adverse effects represents the clinical priority. The difference in the two approaches is medically inexplicable, since heart failure is more lethal than most forms of cancer. 29 Furthermore, the median improvement in survival produced by most treatments for heart failure exceeds that for most therapies for metastatic cancer.

### Tailoring medical therapy for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^1148W1gG]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Upfront integrated phenotype‐based approach treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction

Practical consideration for a comprehensive optimization of medical therapy

Clinical decision‐making has become complex in the current era of HFpEF therapeutics. While multiple classes of drugs have been recently tested, there is a need to adopt an integrated optimization of foundational therapy to improve the care of chronic HFpEF (Figure 1). From a practical standpoint, a comprehensive treatment approach incorporating all evidence‐based therapies should represent the cornerstone of HFpEF management. At the same time, patients with HFpEF may have different clinical presentations and phenotypes, degrees of congestion, haemodynamic status, and comorbidities. Therefore, adjusting or prioritizing drugs according to the HFpEF phenotype would permit a personalized implementation of evidence‐based medications. Clinical inertia should not defer initiation of evidence‐based treatment, and starting effective therapy can rapidly reduce risk in HFpEF.

Figure 1
Contemporary heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) treatment approach. ARNI, angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor; LVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction; MRA, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist; SGLTi, sodium–glucose cotransporter inhibitor; T2DM, type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Given the large benefits shown in major trials, the SGLT2i dapagliflozin and empagliflozin should be considered as first‐line therapy regardless of the phenotype and the clinical settings for all HFpEF patients lacking contraindications. Based on the results of the SOLOIST‐WHF trial, the dual SGLT1/2 inhibitor sotagliflozin has also indication for HF patients irrespective of LVEF in the United States. The non‐steroidal MRA finerenone might represent the second foundational therapy for HFpEF. This drug should be administered simultaneously or in rapid sequence with SGLTi. This appears even more critical among patients with a recent worsening HF event who showed greater absolute treatment benefit. As many patients presenting with HFpEF may already be on a background steroidal MRA, the switch to finerenone might be considered once this drug is approved. In countries where there is an indication, angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI) should be considered in all patients with HFmrEF as well as in HFpEF patients with below normal LVEF and among those recently hospitalized or in the worsening HF setting. Recent analyses suggest that a combination therapy with ARNI, MRA and SGLTi may have positive CV effects on patients with LVEF up to 55–60%.

FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

WARNING: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE and LACTIC ACIDOSIS Congestive Heart Failure
- Thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone, which is a component of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride, cause or exacerbate congestive heart failure in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
- After initiation of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride, and after dose increases, monitor patients carefully for signs and symptoms of heart failure (e.g., excessive, rapid weight gain, dyspnea, and/or edema). If congestive heart failure develops while taking pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride, consider discontinuation of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride or dosage reduction of pioglitazone in pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
- Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with symptomatic heart failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
- Initiation of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride in patients with established New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Lactic Acidosis
- Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (greater than 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate:pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally greater than 5 mcg/mL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
- Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.
- Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided in the Full Prescribing Information [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].
- If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Selection of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist for patients with hypertension or heart failure [^113Wuxta]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical trials have demonstrated morbidity and mortality benefits of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) in patients with heart failure. These studies have used either spironolactone or eplerenone as the MRA. It is generally believed that these two agents have the same effects, and the data from studies using one drug could be extrapolated for the other. National and international guidelines do not generally discriminate between spironolactone and eplerenone, but strongly recommend using an MRA for patients with heart failure due to LV systolic dysfunction and post-infarct LV systolic dysfunction. There are no major clinical trials directly comparing the efficacy of these two drugs. This article aims to compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of spironolactone and eplerenone, and to analyse the available data for their cardiovascular indications and adverse effects. We have also addressed the role of special circumstances including co-morbidities, concomitant drug therapy, cost, and licensing restrictions in choosing an appropriate MRA for a particular patient, thus combining an evidence-based approach with personalized medicine.

### 2022 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association / Heart Failure Society of America guideline for the management of heart failure: executive summary [^113vV3GJ]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The 2022 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Failure Society of America (AHA/ACC/HFSA) Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure replaces the 2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure and the 2017 ACC/AHA/HFSA Focused Update of the 2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure. The 2022 guideline is intended to provide patient-centric recommendations for clinicians to prevent, diagnose and manage patients with heart failure.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from May 2020 to December 2020, encompassing studies, reviews and other evidence conducted in human subjects that were published in English from MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane Collaboration, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other relevant databases. Additional relevant clinical trials and research studies published through September 2021 were also considered. This guideline was harmonized with other American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines published through December 2021.

Results and Conclusions

Heart failure remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. The 2022 heart failure guideline provides recommendations based on contemporary evidence for the treatment of these patients. The recommendations present an evidence-based approach to managing patients with heart failure, with the intent to improve quality of care and align with patients' interests. Many recommendations from the earlier heart failure guidelines have been updated with new evidence, and new recommendations have been created when supported by published data. Value statements are provided for certain treatments that have high-quality published economic analyses.

Third, physicians may be unaware of the directions that were provided to investigators in clinical trials regarding the uptitration of neurohormonal antagonists. In these trials, physicians were required to increase the dose of the study medication to the specified target dose in a standardized manner, and to make an ongoing and concerted effort to achieve and maintain the target dose, even if patients experienced unwanted changes in blood pressure, renal function, or electrolytes. Reaching values for systolic blood pressure or heart rate in the 'normal range' was not considered a valid reason for interruption of the forced‐titration strategy. For example, many physicians mistakenly believe that systolic blood pressures of 100–120 mmHg are sufficiently low to prevent further dose uptitration. 41 However, in the landmark clinical trials, physicians were typically advised to continue uptitration as long as the systolic blood pressure was > 85–90 mmHg, if patients were not experiencing recurrent symptoms related to hypotension. Similarly, in trials of beta‐blockers, investigators were required to uptitrate to target doses even if the heart rate on a subtarget dose declined to 65 bpm. These strategies are contrary to commonly‐held beliefs that patients with chronic heart failure require certain levels of perfusion pressure or that they need a heart rate of 70–80 bpm to maintain cardiac output.

Clinical practice and patients' perspectives

Almost half of the patients with HF consider medication side effects to be a serious challenge caused by this disease and believe that health care professionals can prevent, alleviate, or control these adverse reactions. Clear advice about rationale for use, possibility of modification and shared decision‐making can help to cope with adverse effects, which highlights the importance of an open and effective relationship between the patient and the health care professional.

Professional attitudes and behaviour
Adjust the medication regimen in case of side effects, explain the reasons and share with the patient an informed decision about how to cope with the side effect.
Counsel all patients and their preferred caregivers to recognize and act upon common side effects of HF medications.
Advise patients to seek medical help immediately in case of swelling lips or throat.
Counsel patients on how to reduce risk of falls.
Start HF medications at a low dose and increase in small steps to improve tolerance.
Rule out pulmonary congestion and heartburn as a cause of cough prior to discontinuing angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors.
Recommend patients not to skip the diuretic therapy when they are away from home, but encourage them to choose the optimal timing of taking the diuretics according to their peak urination and planned trip, for example, upon returning home.
Help patients to document a history of side effects.
Be aware that associated colleagues might need an explanation in terms of worrisome blood pressure or renal function.
Report the adverse event in the patient's records.

### Pharmacist management and quality of care for heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction [^112xXcFo]. JACC: Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pharmacist medication management may improve the treatment of heart failure.

Objectives

The authors sought to examine the trends in pharmacist use for heart failure management in the VA (Veterans Affairs) Health Care System and the association with guideline-recommended medication therapy.

Methods

The authors identified patients with recent-onset heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) ≤ 40% (HFrEF) in the VA Health Care System from 2017 to 2021. They determined the association of pharmacist management within 6 months of initial HFrEF diagnosis date and optimal guideline-recommended medication at 12 months following incident HFrEF diagnosis (use of all of the following where no contraindications: renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, beta-blocker, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist.

Results

Among the 104,517 patients with recent-onset HFrEF, 10,657 (10.2%) had a pharmacist encounter within 6 months of diagnosis; this increased from 7.0% in 2017 to 14.3% in 2021. Among patients without contraindications to therapy, those with a pharmacist encounter were more likely to be on all recommended therapy when compared to those without a pharmacist encounter (31% vs 15%, all P < 0.0001). Use of individual treatments were also higher in those with a pharmacist encounter (angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor: 23% vs 12%, beta-blocker: 89% vs 69%, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist: 43% vs 25%, all P < 0.0001). After adjustment for patient characteristics, a pharmacist encounter was associated with greater odds of optimal therapy (adjusted OR: 2.51; 95% CI: 2.39–2.63).

Conclusions

Pharmacists are increasingly involved in managing heart failure in the VA Health Care System. Pharmacist management was associated with increased guideline-recommended medication use.

### Keeping your patient with heart failure safe… [^112ZdegJ]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

A case-control study demonstrated a significant odds ratio of developing HF equal to 26. 3 in elderly patients with a history of heart disease receiving NSAIDs. Prazosin also failed to demonstrate an increase in EF, similar to the findings in patients randomized to placebo. 29 More recently, the doxazosin arm of the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial was terminated early because of a significantly higher incidence of the combined cardiovascular disease end point compared with chlorthalidone. A higher risk of the development of HF was associated with the use of doxazosin.
28.

Verapamil has limited data regarding its use in patients with HF because of its known negative inotropic effects and manufacturer's warning of worsening HF. 33 An early open-label trial showed marked hemodynamic and clinical deterioration in patients with an EF of less than 35% treated with verapamil after 1 year. 34 Although diltiazem has less negative inotropy and chronotropy than verapamil, it has also been associated with HF deterioration in patients with an EF of less than 40% at baseline.
35. The ACC/AHA guidelines support the withdrawal of CCBs because of the potential for this class to adversely affect the clinical status of patients with HF. In addition, their use is not recommended to treat patients with HF who have comorbid disease states such as hypertension or chronic atrial fibrillation. 15 On the basis of current guidelines and previous studies, verapamil, diltiazem, nifedipine, nisoldipine, and nicardipine are not recommended for long-term treatment of patients with HF.

The package insert states that metformin is contraindicated in patients with HF requiring pharmacologic treatment, yet this recommendation seems overly restrictive, since diabetes is an extremely prevalent concomitant disease state, and any patient with decreased EF should receive pharmacologic treatment. Certainly patients with the more severe HF and those prone to acute pulmonary exacerbations, perhaps due to dietary or medication noncompliance, are not candidates for metformin therapy.

### Guideline for the management of heart failure caused by systolic… [^111gHWTk]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Because of perceived risks and contraindications, ACE inhibitors are often avoided in patients with heart failure. Renal dysfunction and cough should not be considered absolute contraindications to the use of these agents. When the systolic blood pressure is less than 100 mm Hg or the creatinine level is elevated, careful monitoring is warranted during the initiation of ACE inhibitor therapy. CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS Calcium channels blockers have no direct role in the treatment of heart failure resulting from systolic dysfunction. The first-generation agents diltiazem and nifedipine were shown to have adverse outcomes in patients with systolic dysfunction who had had a myocardial infarction. A subgroup analysis 23 of a randomized, controlled trial involving amlodipine suggested a mortality benefit in patients with nonischemic heart failure. However, a larger subsequent study 25 found no benefit in administering amlodipine to patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy.

Currently, no evidence supports the use of calcium channel blockers in patients with heart failure. ANGIOTENSIN RECEPTOR BLOCKERS Angiotensin receptor blockers are safe 29 but have never been shown to be more effective 30 than ACE inhibitors in mortality trials of patients with heart failure. In a recently completed study, 31 no improvement in all-cause mortality occurred when angiotensin receptor blockers were added to background therapy consisting of ACE inhibitors and, sometimes, beta blockers. Furthermore, a subgroup analysis 31 showed a 10 percent increase in the composite end point of mortality plus morbidity among patients receiving valsartan whose baseline therapy included a beta blocker. We recommend the use of angiotensin receptor blockers only in patients who are intolerant of ACE inhibitors. Even in this setting, we recommend that these agents be used with caution in patients who are also taking beta blockers.

ASPIRIN Aspirin is used in many patients with heart failure caused by ischemic cardiomyopathy. Although patients with heart failure who are already taking aspirin may be maintained on the drug, heart failure itself is not an indication to start aspirin therapy. Potential adverse affects of aspirin on gastric mucosa and on renal function should be considered. Patients with heart failure caused by coronary artery disease should be maintained on aspirin. There are theoretic concerns about aspirin negating some of the beneficial impact of ACE inhibitors. However, no clinical data have demonstrated a harmful effect from combining these agents.
