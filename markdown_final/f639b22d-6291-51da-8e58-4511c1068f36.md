## Question

High RBC low MCV

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to interpret and evaluate a high red blood cell (RBC) count with low mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the abnormality and excluding spurious causes. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis for microcytosis and how a high RBC count refines it. Next, I will outline a stepwise diagnostic workup, including iron studies, hemoglobin electrophoresis, and when to consider bone marrow evaluation. After that, I should consider special populations and pitfalls, and finally synthesize the most likely etiologies and a practical management plan with appropriate follow-up and counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and its clinical significance. A high RBC count with low MCV is a discordant pattern that immediately narrows the differential toward thalassemia trait or iron deficiency with compensatory erythrocytosis, and I should double-check that the CBC was obtained on a fresh EDTA sample and that there was no preanalytical error or instrument artifact before proceeding, because spurious counts and indices can mislead interpretation [^f9164818] [^cac8793e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check for spurious causes of high RBC and low MCV, including cold agglutinins causing RBC clumping and spurious macrocytosis or miscounts, and I should review the smear for schistocytes or microspherocytes that can artifactually elevate platelets and distort RBC indices. If present, I should repeat the sample warm or use alternative counting methods to verify the true indices before labeling the pattern [^cac8793e] [^198ebc16].

> Next, I should review the core differential for microcytosis and how a high RBC count shifts probabilities. The three most common causes of microcytosis are iron deficiency anemia, thalassemia trait, and anemia of chronic disease. Of these, thalassemia trait uniquely produces microcytosis with a compensatory increase in RBC production, so a high RBC count with low MCV is classic for thalassemia trait, whereas iron deficiency typically shows a low or normal RBC count unless there is recent bleeding or recovery, and anemia of chronic disease is usually normocytic or mildly microcytic with low reticulocytes [^24d2dc9e] [^451b8f98] [^f9164818].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology behind the high RBC in thalassemia. In thalassemia trait, imbalanced globin chain synthesis leads to microcytosis and hypochromia, but the marrow compensates by increasing erythropoiesis, yielding a higher RBC count and often a normal or near-normal hematocrit despite microcytosis. This compensatory mechanism is less effective if folate is deficient, so I should keep folate status in mind when interpreting borderline cases [^f9164818].

> I will now examine the first branch point: iron status. I should confirm ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and TIBC, and I need to remember that ferritin is an acute phase reactant, so in the presence of inflammation a normal or high ferritin does not exclude iron deficiency. In thalassemia trait, ferritin is typically normal or high unless there is coexisting iron deficiency, and transferrin saturation is usually normal or high, which helps distinguish it from pure iron deficiency where ferritin is low and transferrin saturation is low [^24d2dc9e] [^451b8f98].

> If iron deficiency is present, I should confirm the source of blood loss, especially gastrointestinal bleeding, because iron deficiency in adults is pathological until proven otherwise. I need to ensure appropriate evaluation for occult GI blood loss and consider endoscopy when indicated, while also recognizing that a high RBC count is not expected in isolated iron deficiency and should prompt me to reconsider mixed etiologies or a thalassemia carrier state with iron deficiency [^24d2dc9e] [^f4ad26bf].

> If iron studies are normal or suggest thalassemia, I should proceed to hemoglobin electrophoresis. I should confirm that I am ordering the right test: in beta-thalassemia trait, HbA2 is typically elevated above 3.5%, whereas alpha-thalassemia trait often shows a normal electrophoresis and requires molecular testing for alpha-globin deletions. I need to ensure I consider ethnicity and family history to guide pretest probability and counseling, and I should remember that silent alpha-thalassemia carriers can have MCV just below 80 fL with a high RBC count [^24d2dc9e] [^cc2aa24b] [^f9164818].

> But wait, what if the pattern is not purely thalassemia or iron deficiency. I should double-check for combined defects such as thalassemia trait plus iron deficiency, which can blunt the classic thalassemia indices and complicate interpretation, and I should consider less common microcytic processes like sideroblastic anemia or lead poisoning if the clinical context warrants, using smear review and targeted testing as indicated [^24d2dc9e] [^451b8f98].

> Next, I should review the reticulocyte count and peripheral smear to assess marrow response and morphology. In thalassemia trait, the reticulocyte count is often normal or mildly elevated reflecting compensated erythropoiesis, whereas in iron deficiency the reticulocyte count is typically low unless there is recent bleeding or treatment response. The smear in thalassemia shows microcytosis, hypochromia, and target cells, which supports the diagnosis when present [^f9164818] [^24d2dc9e].

> I need to ensure I tailor the workup to special populations. In pregnancy, universal CBC with indices is recommended, and low MCV should trigger hemoglobin electrophoresis to assess for thalassemia carrier status given implications for fetal risk. In children, microcytosis is common and iron deficiency predominates, but thalassemia trait must be considered, especially in at-risk ethnic groups. In older adults, I should maintain a low threshold to evaluate for GI blood loss when iron deficiency is identified [^cc2aa24b] [^6ff026bf] [^f4ad26bf].

> Hold on, I should verify that I am not over-relying on MCV-guided classification alone. Recent primary care data suggest MCV-based rules can misclassify a meaningful fraction of patients, so I should integrate MCV with iron studies, reticulocytes, and smear rather than using MCV in isolation to exclude etiologies, particularly when mixed processes are possible [^30d47e7e].

> Let me synthesize the most likely etiologies for high RBC with low MCV. The leading diagnosis is thalassemia trait, where microcytosis coexists with a compensatory increase in RBC count and often normal or high ferritin. Second is iron deficiency anemia with a relative or transient erythrocytosis from recent bleeding or recovery, which is less common but important to exclude. Less likely considerations include combined thalassemia plus iron deficiency, anemia of chronic disease with atypical indices, and sideroblastic anemia, which should be considered if iron studies are atypical or there is macrocytosis on smear [^f9164818] [^24d2dc9e] [^451b8f98].

> I should confirm the management pathway. If thalassemia trait is diagnosed, I need to counsel on the benign nature of the carrier state, avoid unnecessary iron therapy, and consider genetic counseling, especially in reproductive-age patients. If iron deficiency is confirmed, I should treat with iron and investigate the source of blood loss. If both coexist, I should treat iron deficiency while acknowledging that the thalassemia trait will persist and that indices may not fully normalize after iron repletion [^24d2dc9e] [^f4ad26bf] [^cc2aa24b].

> Finally, I need to ensure appropriate follow-up. I should repeat the CBC after iron therapy to document hematologic response and confirm that the RBC count and MCV move in the expected directions, and I should reconsider the diagnosis if the response is atypical. If thalassemia trait is suspected but electrophoresis is normal, I should escalate to alpha-globin gene testing to avoid missing silent alpha-thalassemia, and I should document family studies when indicated to support genetic counseling [^24d2dc9e] [^cc2aa24b].

High RBC with low MCV most often reflects **thalassemia trait** [^f9164818], where microcytosis from reduced hemoglobin synthesis is offset by a compensatory increase in RBC production, yielding a high RBC count with normal or near-normal hemoglobin/hematocrit [^f9164818]. Other causes include **iron deficiency anemia** (early or compensated) [^24d2dc9e], **anemia of chronic disease** (especially with iron restriction) [^bfa5fd37], and **sideroblastic anemia** [^24d2dc9e]. Evaluate with iron studies (ferritin, transferrin saturation) [^24d2dc9e], hemoglobin electrophoresis [^cc2aa24b], and a peripheral smear [^451b8f98]; manage based on the underlying cause, with genetic counseling for thalassemia [^cc2aa24b].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** can explain a high RBC count with low MCV:

- **Thalassemia trait**: Reduced globin synthesis causes microcytosis, but the marrow compensates by increasing RBC production, yielding a high RBC count with normal or near-normal hemoglobin/hematocrit [^f9164818].

- **Iron deficiency anemia**: Early or compensated iron deficiency can show microcytosis with a relatively preserved or mildly increased RBC count before hemoglobin falls significantly [^notfound].

- **Anemia of chronic disease**: Inflammation-driven iron restriction can cause microcytosis with a compensatory erythrocytosis in some cases [^notfound].

- **Sideroblastic anemia**: Defective heme synthesis leads to microcytosis and variable RBC counts depending on disease severity and compensation [^24d2dc9e].

## Clinical conditions associated with high RBC and low MCV

| **Clinical condition** | **Pathophysiology** | **Key laboratory features** |
|-|-|-|
| Thalassemia trait | Reduced globin synthesis with compensatory erythrocytosis | - High RBC count <br/> - Low MCV <br/> - Normal or high ferritin <br/> - Elevated HbA2 (β-thalassemia) [^f9164818] |
| Iron deficiency anemia (early/compensated) | Impaired hemoglobin synthesis with compensatory erythrocytosis | - High or normal RBC count <br/> - Low MCV <br/> - Low ferritin <br/> - Low transferrin saturation [^24d2dc9e] |
| Anemia of chronic disease | Iron restriction with compensatory erythrocytosis | - High or normal RBC count <br/> - Low MCV <br/> - Normal or high ferritin <br/> - Low transferrin saturation [^24d2dc9e] |
| Sideroblastic anemia | Defective heme synthesis | - Variable RBC count <br/> - Low MCV <br/> - Elevated ferritin <br/> - Ringed sideroblasts on marrow [^notfound] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **systematic diagnostic approach** is essential:

- **Confirm the abnormality**: Repeat CBC to exclude laboratory error; review smear for morphology (microcytosis, anisocytosis, poikilocytosis) [^1713d8a2].

- **Iron studies**: Ferritin, serum iron, transferrin saturation, TIBC to distinguish iron deficiency from anemia of chronic disease or thalassemia [^24d2dc9e].

- **Hemoglobin electrophoresis**: Identify thalassemia trait (elevated HbA2 in β-thalassemia; normal HbA2 in α-thalassemia) [^cc2aa24b].

- **Reticulocyte count**: Assess marrow response; elevated in thalassemia or hemolysis, low in iron deficiency or anemia of chronic disease [^097973ff].

- **Additional tests**: Consider vitamin B12/folate, lead levels, or bone marrow if sideroblastic anemia is suspected [^24d2dc9e].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Thalassemia trait**: Benign carrier state; genetic counseling is key, especially for family planning [^cc2aa24b].

- **Iron deficiency anemia**: Identify and treat the source of blood loss; provide iron replacement [^24d2dc9e].

- **Anemia of chronic disease**: Treat the underlying inflammatory condition; consider iron therapy if iron-restricted erythropoiesis is significant [^notfound].

- **Sideroblastic anemia**: Address reversible causes (e.g. alcohol, drugs); consider pyridoxine, transfusions, or stem cell transplantation in severe cases [^notfound].

---

High RBC with low MCV most often reflects **thalassemia trait**, but iron deficiency, anemia of chronic disease, and sideroblastic anemia must be excluded. A structured workup with iron studies, hemoglobin electrophoresis, and smear review guides diagnosis and management, with counseling for thalassemia and targeted therapy for the underlying cause.

### Evaluation of microcytosis [^24d2dc9e]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Microcytosis is typically an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients who received a complete blood count for other reasons. The condition is defined as a mean corpuscular volume of less than 80 µm³ (80 fL) in adults. The most common causes of microcytosis are iron deficiency anemia and thalassemia trait. Other diagnoses to consider include anemia of chronic disease, lead toxicity, and sideroblastic anemia. Serum ferritin measurement is the first laboratory test recommended in the evaluation of microcytosis. Low ferritin levels suggest iron deficiency. Once a presumptive diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia has been made, an underlying source for the deficiency should be determined. Iron deficiency anemia in adults is presumed to be caused by blood loss; the most common source of bleeding is the gastrointestinal tract. The possibility of gastrointestinal malignancy must be considered. If the serum ferritin level is not initially low, further evaluation should include total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation level, serum iron level, and possibly hemoglobin electrophoresis. Anemia of chronic disease is suggested with low iron levels and decreased total iron-binding capacity. Patients with beta-thalassemia trait usually have elevated levels of hemoglobin A2.

### Evaluation of macrocytosis [^1713d8a2]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis, generally defined as a mean corpuscular volume greater than 100 fL, is frequently encountered when a complete blood count is performed. The most common etiologies are alcoholism, vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, and medications. History and physical examination, vitamin B12 level, reticulocyte count, and a peripheral smear are helpful in delineating the underlying cause of macrocytosis. When the peripheral smear indicates megaloblastic anemia (demonstrated by macro-ovalocytes and hyper-segmented neutrophils), vitamin B12 or folate deficiency is the most likely cause. When the peripheral smear is non-megaloblastic, the reticulocyte count helps differentiate between drug or alcohol toxicity and hemolysis or hemorrhage. Of other possible etiologies, hypothyroidism, liver disease, and primary bone marrow dysplasias (including myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative disorders) are some of the more common causes.

### A mendelian randomization-based exploration of red blood cell distribution width and mean corpuscular volume with risk of hemorrhagic strokes [^7b43e0c0]. HGG Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hemorrhagic stroke results from bleeding into/around the brain when a weakened vessel ruptures. The blood accumulates to compress the surrounding brain cells, leading to brain tissue damage and neurological deficits. According to American Stroke Association, hemorrhagic strokes occupy about 13% of all strokes consisting of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) — bleeding into the brain parenchyma — and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) — bleeding into the subarachnoid space. Mortality and morbidity are high for hemorrhagic stroke while identifying risk factors of the hemorrhagic stroke helps detect and modify the risk, potentially reducing the odds of death or disability of the fatal disease. Identifying risk factors of the hemorrhagic stroke helps detect and modify the risk, potentially reducing the odds of death or disability of the fatal disease.

Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) describes the average size and volume of erythrocytes circulating in the bloodstream. It is calculated by dividing the hematocrit by the concentration of erythrocytes (hematocrit × 10/red blood cell count [millions/mm³ blood]). Red blood cell distribution width (RCDW) is defined as one standard deviation (SD) of erythrocyte volume divided by the MCV (SD/MCV × 100) and is used to measure the heterogeneity of red blood cell size. Therefore, RCDW and MCV are correlated biologically. RCDW could be a strong predictor of the risk and prognosis of ischemic stroke. Similarly, MCV can be used to calculate the mortality and morbidity rates of ischemic stroke. RCDW and MCV are often used to diagnose hematological system diseases, such as iron-deficiency anemia and bone marrow dysfunction. They help determine the risk of a cardiovascular event occurring after surgery or blood transfusions. Increases in RCDW can be observed more easily as MCV tends to remain at low levels; RCDW and stroke are generally associated with a group of patients with low MCV.

### Screening characteristics of hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume for detection of iron deficiency in pregnancy [^3826e1dd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

The hemoglobin and the mean corpuscular volume from a first-trimester complete blood count are insufficiently sensitive to screen for iron deficiency during pregnancy.

### Anemia in older adults [^f4ad26bf]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults. Diagnostic cutoff values for defining anemia vary with age, sex, and possibly race. Anemia is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on laboratory testing. Patients may present with symptoms related to associated conditions, such as blood loss, or related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, such as weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Causes of anemia in older adults include nutritional deficiency, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammation, and occult blood loss from gastrointestinal malignancy, although in many patients the etiology is unknown. The evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination, assessment of risk factors for underlying conditions, and assessment of mean corpuscular volume. A serum ferritin level should be obtained for patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. A low serum ferritin level in a patient with normocytic or microcytic anemia is associated with iron deficiency anemia. In older patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia, endoscopy is warranted to evaluate for gastrointestinal malignancy. Patients with an elevated serum ferritin level or macrocytic anemia should be evaluated for underlying conditions, including vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and malignancy. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Symptomatic patients with serum hemoglobin levels of 8 g per dL or less may require blood transfusion. Patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia should be given a trial of oral iron replacement. Lower-dose formulations may be as effective and have a lower risk of adverse effects. Normalization of hemoglobin typically occurs by eight weeks after treatment in most patients. Parenteral iron infusion is reserved for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate oral iron therapy.

### Why is my patient anemic? [^7f38d88b]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Anemia is a decreased number of circulating red blood cells and is a common medical condition faced in clinical practice. Anemia is caused by loss of red blood cells, destruction of red blood cells, decreased production of red blood cells, or a combination of these processes. Through a clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation the provider must identify the process by which the patient is anemic. Often the cause of anemia is straightforward; however, the cause can be challenging, requiring a thorough knowledge of both hematology and general medicine.

### Committee opinion no. 691: carrier screening for genetic conditions [^896a7a30]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hemoglobinopathies — a complete blood count with red blood cell indices should be performed in all women who are currently pregnant to assess not only their risk of anemia but also to allow assessment for risk of a hemoglobinopathy, and ideally, this testing also should be offered to women before pregnancy. A hemoglobin electrophoresis should be performed in addition to a complete blood count if there is suspicion of hemoglobinopathy based on ethnicity (African, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, Southeast Asian, or West Indian descent). If red blood cell indices indicate a low mean corpuscular hemoglobin or mean corpuscular volume, hemoglobin electrophoresis also should be performed.

### Evaluation of anemia in children [^fc3019e4]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a hemoglobin level of less than the 5th percentile for age. Causes vary by age. Most children with anemia are asymptomatic, and the condition is detected on screening laboratory evaluation. Screening is recommended only for high-risk children. Anemia is classified as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic, based on the mean corpuscular volume. Mild microcytic anemia may be treated presumptively with oral iron therapy in children six to 36 months of age who have risk factors for iron deficiency anemia. If the anemia is severe or is unresponsive to iron therapy, the patient should be evaluated for gastrointestinal blood loss. Other tests used in the evaluation of microcytic anemia include serum iron studies, lead levels, and hemoglobin electrophoresis. Normocytic anemia may be caused by chronic disease, hemolysis, or bone marrow disorders. Workup of normocytic anemia is based on bone marrow function as determined by the reticulocyte count. If the reticulocyte count is elevated, the patient should be evaluated for blood loss or hemolysis. A low reticulocyte count suggests aplasia or a bone marrow disorder. Common tests used in the evaluation of macrocytic anemias include vitamin B12 and folate levels, and thyroid function testing. A peripheral smear can provide additional information in patients with anemia of any morphology.

### Microcytic anemia… [^fc0a6437]. publications.aap.org (2007). Low credibility.

After completing this article, readers should be able to: Anemia is the most common hematologic abnormality that pediatricians encounter. The differential diagnosis for anemia in children includes congenital, acquired, benign, malignant, common, and extraordinarily rare disorders. Thankfully, most conditions cause consistent changes in the mean cell volume of red blood cells and can be grouped by using this parameter. In children, anemia is caused most often by disorders that result in smaller-than-normal RBCs. With a thorough history, a good physical examination, and perhaps some additional blood work, the correct cause of a child's microcytic anemia can be discovered. Automated blood counters may not take into account the normal variations in hemoglobin/hematocrit and MCV that are seen throughout childhood. Results reported as abnormal must be compared with age-specific values.

Values that are 2 standard deviations below the age-appropriate mean can be considered. Comments.

### Modulation of red blood cell population dynamics is a fundamental homeostatic response to disease [^031a2a5b]. American Journal of Hematology (2015). Low credibility.

Increased red blood cell (RBC) volume variation (RDW) has recently been shown to predict a wide range of mortality and morbidity: death due to cardiovascular disease, cancer, infection, renal disease, and more; complications in heart failure and coronary artery disease, advanced stage and worse prognosis in many cancers, poor outcomes in autoimmune disease, and many more. The mechanisms by which all of these diseases lead to increased RDW are unknown. Here we use a semi-mechanistic mathematical model of in vivo RBC population dynamics to dissect the factors controlling RDW and show that elevated RDW results largely from a slight reduction in the in vivo rate of RBC turnover. RBCs become smaller as they age, and a slight reduction in the rate of RBC turnover allows smaller cells to continue circulating, expanding the low-volume tail of the RBC population's volume distribution, and thereby increasing RDW. Our results show that mildly extended RBC lifespan is a previously unrecognized homeostatic adaptation common to a very wide range of pathologic states, likely compensating for subtle reductions in erythropoietic output. A mathematical model-based estimate of the clearance rate may provide a novel early-warning biomarker for a wide range of morbidity and mortality.

### A practical approach to the evaluation of the anemic child [^cc1b531e]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Anemia is a sign of disease and not a final diagnosis. The clinician's goal is to define the underlying cause. The anemia may be due to decreased production or Increased destruction or loss of red blood cells. Integration of the results of the initial CBC. particularly the RBC indices, the peripheral blood smear, the history and the physical examination can help organize the focus of further evaluations and, ultimately, minimize the number of tests needed to make a firm diagnosis.

### Elevated nucleated red blood cells in neonates with down syndrome and pulmonary hypertension [^b46896c2]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

We report an association between higher absolute nucleated red blood cells and mean corpuscular volume and idiopathic persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn in neonates with Down syndrome. Elevation of these blood indicies should prompt echocardiographic studies to monitor pulmonary arterial pressures.

### Evaluation of anemia [^bfa5fd37]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common problem in primary care. Classification based on mean cell volume narrows the differential diagnosis and directs testing. A marked macrocytosis is characteristic of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, certain medications, and primary bone marrow disorders. The three most common causes of microcytic anemia are iron deficiency, thalassemia trait, and anemia of inflammation. Additional laboratory testing is required for diagnosis. Determination of the rate of development of anemia and examination of a blood smear may provide diagnostic clues to guide more specialized testing. Diagnosis of iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency mandates determination of the underlying cause.

### The accuracy of mean corpuscular volume guided anaemia classification in primary care [^30d47e7e]. Family Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Anemia can be categorized into micro-, normo- or macrocytic anemia based on the mean corpuscular volume (MCV). This categorization might help to define the etiology of anemia.

Methods

The cohort consisted of patients newly diagnosed with anaemia in primary care. Seven aetiologies of anaemia were defined, based on an extensive laboratory protocol. Two assumptions were tested: (i) MCV < 80 fl (microcytic) excludes vitamin B12 deficiency, folic acid deficiency, suspected haemolysis and suspected bone marrow disease as anaemia aetiology. (ii) MCV > 100 fl (macrocytic) excludes iron deficiency anaemia, anaemia of chronic disease and renal anaemia as anaemia aetiology.

Results

Data of 4129 patients were analysed. One anaemia aetiology could be assigned to 2422 (59%) patients, more than one anaemia aetiology to 888 (22%) patients and uncertainty regarding the aetiology remained in 819 (20%) patients. MCV values were within the normal range in 3505 patients (85%). In 59 of 365 microcytic patients (16%), the anaemia aetiology was not in accordance with the first assumption. In 233 of 259 macrocytic patients (90%), the anaemia aetiology was not in accordance with the second assumption.

Conclusions

Anaemia aetiologies might be ruled out incorrectly if MCV guided classification is used as a first step in the diagnostic work-up of anaemia. We recommend using a broader set of laboratory tests, independent of MCV.

### Anemia in children [^958fac0e]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Anemia in children is commonly encountered by the family physician. Multiple causes exist, but with a thorough history, a physical examination and limited laboratory evaluation a specific diagnosis can usually be established. The use of the mean corpuscular volume to classify the anemia as microcytic, normocytic or macrocytic is a standard diagnostic approach. The most common form of microcytic anemia is iron deficiency caused by reduced dietary intake. It is easily treatable with supplemental iron and early intervention may prevent later loss of cognitive function. Less common causes of microcytosis are thalassemia and lead poisoning. Normocytic anemia has many causes, making the diagnosis more difficult. The reticulocyte count will help narrow the differential diagnosis; however, additional testing may be necessary to rule out hemolysis, hemoglobinopathies, membrane defects and enzymopathies. Macrocytic anemia may be caused by a deficiency of folic acid and/or vitamin B12, hypothyroidism and liver disease. This form of anemia is uncommon in children.

### Committee opinion no. 691: carrier screening for genetic conditions [^cc2aa24b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hemoglobinopathy and thalassemia screening — pregnancy care includes that a complete blood count with red blood cell indices should be performed in all women who are currently pregnant; if indices indicate a low mean corpuscular hemoglobin or mean corpuscular volume, hemoglobin electrophoresis also should be performed, and it should also be performed when ethnicity raises suspicion, ideally before pregnancy, with repeat testing not necessary if prior results are available. Determination of mean corpuscular volume is recommended to assess risk of α-thalassemia or β-thalassemia; patients with a low mean corpuscular volume (less than 80 fL) may have one of the thalassemia traits and should have hemoglobin electrophoresis, and measurement of serum ferritin levels is recommended. β-thalassemia is associated with elevated hemoglobin F and elevated hemoglobin A2 levels (more than 3.5%). Neither hemoglobin electrophoresis nor solubility testing can identify α-thalassemia trait; if the mean corpuscular volume is below normal, iron deficiency is excluded, and electrophoresis is not consistent with β-thalassemia trait, then DNA-based testing should be used to detect α-globin gene deletions characteristic of α-thalassemia. Solubility tests are inadequate for screening and fail to identify several important traits, and if both partners are identified as carriers of a gene for abnormal hemoglobins, genetic counseling is recommended.

### Effect of a red blood cell transfusion on biological markers used to determine the cause of anemia: a prospective study [^78994007]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Blood test results required for the evaluation of anemia are considered difficult to interpret after red blood cell transfusion. However, this hypothesis is neither supported by a strong physiological rationale nor is it evidence based.

Methods

We conducted a prospective multicenter study to compare the values of key assays prior to and after a course of red blood cell transfusion in the emergency or internal medicine units in 4 university hospitals. The following parameters were measured prior to and within 48 to 72 hours after transfusion: complete blood count with reticulocyte count, direct Coombs' test, ferritin, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, serum and erythrocyte folate, cobalamin, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, haptoglobin, and C-reactive protein. We investigated the impact of transfusion on these parameters and assessed whether abnormal values prior to the transfusion became normal after transfusion (or conversely).

Results

There were 77 patients included in the study. Changes in mean values of mean corpuscular volume, soluble transferrin receptor, erythrocyte folate, cobalamin, haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, and direct Coombs' test were not statistically significant. Changes in reticulocyte count, ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum folate, and total bilirubin concentrations were statistically significant, but they remained in the same diagnostic category (normal or abnormal) in 79% to 98% of the cases; 97% of patients with iron deficiency still had low ferritin or transferrin saturation after a transfusion.

Conclusion

Blood tests performed after a one-time red blood cell transfusion can be used to establish the cause of anemia when they have not been performed before.

### Health supervision for children and adolescents with down syndrome [^8bded133]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Down syndrome — macrocytosis and interpretation of mean corpuscular volume notes that children have a similar risk for iron-deficiency anemia as the typical population but it may be missed because of macrocytosis; iron insufficiency may precede anemia and have longer term neurologic effects; macrocytosis, which increases mean corpuscular volume, is present in up to one-third of patients, therefore a low mean corpuscular volume is not a useful screen for iron deficiency/insufficiency, lead toxicity, or thalassemia.

### Iatrogenic anemia (can it be prevented?) [^e7da02b3]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2014). Low credibility.

'Iatrogenic anemia' is a condition of lowered hematocrit and hemoglobin count resulting from large or frequent removal of blood samples, usually for laboratory testing. It is frequently seen in patients who are already suffering from bone marrow depression, and thus may become a comorbidity. Because several different types of chemical agents may be required for test procedures, a large volume of blood could be removed for each set of testing, perhaps 50–60 mL. Often local and reference laboratories request larger samples than are really necessary to perform a given test and still have some left to perform any required repeat testing. My experience shows that a volume of about 3 mL of each type of sample should be sufficient for this purpose.

### Red blood cell count and risk of adverse outcomes in patients with mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction [^b1756633]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Three critical parameters related to RBCs

RBC count: This denotes the concentration of RBCs per microliter of blood, typically enumerated in millions. Integral to oxygen transportation, diminished counts may indicate conditions such as anemia, while elevated counts could signal disorders like polycythemia vera.

Hemoglobin: This intracellular protein is responsible for transporting oxygen to tissues and returning carbon dioxide to the lungs. Hemoglobin concentrations, quantified in grams per deciliter, can reflect various health conditions, with lower levels potentially indicative of anemia and higher levels suggestive of polycythemia vera or chronic hypoxia.

Red blood cell specific volume (RBCSV): This parameter represents the volume fraction of RBCs in the blood, also called hematocrit. Normal hematocrit ranges differ by sex. Deviations from normal ranges can indicate various conditions — low levels may suggest anemia, and high levels could indicate dehydration or other disorders.

2.2 RBC count

According to the definition of the standard RBC count in routine blood testing at our hospital, the reference range for men is 4.0 to 5.5 × 10¹² /L and that for women is 3.5 to 5.0 × 10¹² /L. After excluding patients with elevated RBC counts (> 5.5 × 10¹² /L in men and > 5.0 × 10¹² /L in women), the patients were divided into those with reduced RBC counts (< 4.0 × 10¹² /L in men and < 3.5 × 10¹² /L in women) and normal RBC counts (≥ 4.0 × 10¹² /L in men and ≥ 3.5 × 10¹² /L in women). We chose to evaluate RBC count as our primary parameter rather than hemoglobin or RBC specific volume (hematocrit), because RBC count is less affected by hypoxia, dehydration, and volume status, which can be confounding clinical factors within this patient population.

### Blood counts in adult and elderly individuals: defining the norms over eight decades of life [^6a309496]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Medium credibility.

The blood count is one of the most common tests used for health assessment. In elderly individuals, selection of a 'healthy' reference population for laboratory assessment is difficult due to the high prevalence of chronic morbidities, leading to uncertainty regarding appropriate reference intervals. In particular, age-specific lower haemoglobin reference limits to define anaemia are controversial. Here, we applied a data mining approach to a large dataset of 3 029 904 clinical routine samples to establish blood count reference intervals. We excluded samples from units/specialists with a high proportion of abnormal blood counts, samples from patients with an unknown or decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate, and samples with abnormal test results in selected other analytes. After sample exclusion, 566 775–572 060 samples from different individuals aged 20–100 years were available for analysis. We then used an established statistical algorithm to determine the distribution of physiological test results and calculated age- and sex-specific reference intervals. Our results show substantial trends with age in haematology analytes' reference intervals. Most notably, haemoglobin and red cell counts decline in men with advanced age, accompanied by increases in red cell volume in both sexes. These findings were confirmed in an independent dataset, and suggest an at least partly physiologic cause.

### Cutoff value for correcting white blood cell count for nucleated red blood cells: what is it? Why is it important? [^fd966ca3]. Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) are normally observed in the peripheral blood of neonates and during pregnancy. Under other conditions, the presence of nucleated RBCs in circulating blood indicates disorder in the blood-producing mechanism. The increased presence of nucleated RBCs, however, falsely elevates the leukocyte count, as measured by most automated hematology analyzers, warranting a manual correction of the leukocyte count. For a long time, cutoff values for correcting white blood cell (WBC) count for the presence of nucleated RBCs have been used regularly, particularly in developing countries. However, because those values are largely subjective, they can vary widely between laboratories worldwide. These varied cutoff values include 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50; it appears that the numbers 5 and 10 are the most common values used in corrections; the reasons require further elucidation. In this article, we discuss the merits of correcting the WBC count for nucleated RBCs at certain cutoff points.

### Usefulness of red cell width distribution (RDW) in the assessment of children with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) [^97447d64]. Pediatric Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

RDW is one of the parameters in complete blood count (CBC) that measures variation in red blood cell size or volume (anisocytosis). The most common cause of an elevated RDW is anemia [evaluated in association with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) in differential diagnosis]. Regardless of that higher than normal RDW has also been described as a risk factor for unfavourable clinical course in various diseases in children. RDW is known to be a prognostic marker in adult with pulmonary hypertension. The value of this test in the PAH pediatric population was not yet established. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prognostic value of RDW in children with PAH and utility of this parameter in management.

### How to approach chronic anemia [^c39c5a05]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

We present herein an approach to diagnosing the cause of chronic anemia based on a patient's history and complete blood cell count (CBC). Four patterns that are encountered frequently in CBCs associated with chronic anemias are considered: (1) anemia with abnormal platelet and/or leukocyte counts, (2) anemia with increased reticulocyte counts, (3) life-long history of chronic anemia, and (4) anemia with inappropriately low reticulocytes. The pathophysiologic bases for some chronic anemias with low reticulocyte production are reviewed in terms of the bone marrow (BM) events that reduce normal rates of erythropoiesis. These events include: apoptosis of erythroid progenitor and precursor cells by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, development of macrocytosis when erythroblast DNA replication is impaired, and development of microcytosis due to heme-regulated eIF2α kinase inhibition of protein synthesis in iron-deficient or thalassemic erythroblasts.

### Mean corpuscular volume… [^cc5e315c]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Sir. — The study of RBCs done by Stockman and Oski demonstrated that mean corpuscular volume of low-birth-weight infants progressively declined with age. No etiologic factor for this decline could be determined. The MCV was determined by electronic counting, and therefore no distinction could have been made between reticulocytes and mature RBCs, as only an average MCV is recorded. 1 Thus, a high peripheral blood reticulocyte count, as occurs normally in the perinatal period, 2 may contribute to a high MCV, even though the mature RBCs may be of smaller size. I suggest that the high values of MCV and the subsequent decline with age may be, at least in part, an artifact of electronic counting, secondary to the normal decline of the reticulocyte count in the perinatal period.

### Spurious thrombocytosis, red cell count and mean cell volume in a patient with thermal burns [^cac8793e]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). Medium credibility.

A 71‐year‐old man was admitted to the emergency room with third‐degree thermal burns involving 10% of his body surface area. His full blood count showed a haemoglobin concentration of 152 g/l, red cell count (RBC) of 5.23 × 10¹²/l and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 84.5 fl with leukocytosis (white cell count 35.30 × 10⁹/l) and thrombocytosis (platelet count 1149 × 10⁹/l).

A peripheral blood film showed: schistocytes, spherocytes and microspherocytes; vacuolated monocytes with dysmorphic nuclei, some with granular pink inclusions; neutrophils with nuclear projections, Döhle bodies and phagocytosed erythrocytes (images). The blood film also revealed that schistocytes and microspherocytes were responsible for a spurious platelet count in the automated analyser (Beckman Coulter DxH900) (images, right), since they were in the same size range as the platelets (note the changes observed in equipment histograms when microspherocytes and schistocytes were observed (A) and when they were no longer present in a later blood film (B)). Red cell fragments being classified as platelets was also responsible for a falsely low RBC and falsely high MCV. Spurious thrombocytosis must be considered in patients with severe thermal injuries when traditional methods of platelet counting (impedance or optical counting) are used. This problem is not posed when using automated fluorescence flow cytometry.

### Hematologic variables and venous thrombosis: red cell distribution width and blood monocyte count are associated with an increased risk [^40ae7563]. Haematologica (2014). Low credibility.

Recent studies suggest that leukocytes and erythrocytes play a role in coagulation. However, whether leukocytes, erythrocytes and other hematologic variables are associated with risk of venous thrombosis is not well known. To study this, we used data from 2473 patients with venous thrombosis and 2935 controls. The variables assessed were: total leukocytes, granulocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, hematocrit, hemoglobin, erythrocytes and red cell indices (mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration and red cell distribution width). We found a strong dose-response relation for higher red cell distribution width and monocyte count with risk of venous thrombosis, with odds ratios of 3.1 (95% confidence interval, 2.0–4.8) and 2.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.3–5.8), respectively, after adjustment for age, sex, C-reactive protein level, malignancy and co-morbidities. Monocyte count and red cell distribution width were associated with venous thrombosis even within reference ranges. A low monocyte count (< 0.12 × 10⁹/L) was associated with a lower risk of venous thrombosis after full adjustment (odds ratios 0.6; 95% confidence interval, 0.4–0.8). In summary, high red cell distribution width and blood monocyte count, two parameters that are inexpensive and easily obtainable, were clearly associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis. Future studies should evaluate the underlying mechanism and the use of these variables in prediction models for first and recurrent thrombosis.

### Idiopathic erythrocytosis: a disappearing entity [^7aaa2f69]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

Erythrocytosis results when there is an increased red cell mass and thus an increased hemoglobin. The causes can be divided into primary intrinsic defects of the erythroid progenitor cell and secondary defects, where factors external to the erythroid compartment are responsible. Both can then be further divided into congenital and acquired categories. Congenital causes include mutations of the erythropoietin receptor and defects of the oxygen-sensing pathway including VHL, PHD2 and HIF2A mutations. When fully investigated there remain a number of patients in whom no cause can be elucidated who are currently described as having idiopathic erythrocytosis. Investigation should start with a full history and examination. Having eliminated the common entity polycythemia vera, further direction for investigation is guided by the erythropoietin level. Clinical consequences of the various erythrocytoses are not clear, but in some groups thromboembolic events have been described in young patients. Evidence is lacking to define best management, but aspirin and venesection to a target hematocrit should be considered.

### Mean corpuscular volume and mortality in patients with CKD [^6206d16c]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Mean corpuscular volume is the measure of the average size of the circulatory erythrocyte, and it is principally used as an index for the differential diagnosis of anemia. Recently, mean corpuscular volume has been associated with mortality in many clinical settings. However, the association of mean corpuscular volume with mortality in patients with CKD has not been fully addressed.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of 1439 patients with stages 3–5 CKD and baseline mean corpuscular volume values from 2004 to 2012 in a medical center. The study cohort was divided into the high-mean corpuscular volume group and the low-mean corpuscular volume group by the median value (90.8 fl) of mean corpuscular volume. The baseline patient information included demographic data, laboratory parameters, medications, and comorbid conditions. The independent association of mean corpuscular volume with mortality was examined using multivariate Cox regression analysis.

Results

Of the 1439 participants, 234 patients (16.2%) died during a median follow-up of 1.9 years (interquartile range, 1.1–3.8 years). The crude overall mortality rate was significantly higher in the high-mean corpuscular volume group (high-mean corpuscular volume group, 22.7%; low-mean corpuscular volume group, 9.7%; P < 0.001). In the fully adjusted models, the high-mean corpuscular volume group was associated with higher risks of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 2.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.62 to 2.96; P < 0.001), cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio, 3.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.80 to 7.06; P < 0.001), and infection-related mortality (hazard ratio, 2.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.41 to 3.49; P = 0.001) compared with the low-mean corpuscular volume group.

Conclusions

In patients with stages 3–5 CKD, mean corpuscular volume was associated with all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality, and infection-associated mortality, independent of other factors. The underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms warrant additional investigation.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for molecular and haematology methods for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of the haemoglobinopathies [^f9164818]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

First-line haematology methods

All haematological testingshould be carried out on blood samples that are as fresh as possible. The complete blood count (CBC) or full blood count (FBC), haemoglobin pattern analysis and haemoglobin component quantification requires whole blood drawn into anticoagulant (EDTA). If necessary, bloods can be transported and stored at 4 o C.

Complete blood count

Electronic measurement is recommended, especially for MCV (mean cell volume), for which the measurements should be direct. All red cell indices (and other parameters) are important in evaluation, including Hb (haemoglobin), RBC (red blood cell count), MCH (mean corpuscular haemoglobin content), MCV and some labs use RDW (red cell distribution width), which is the standard deviation of the red cell size measurements expressed either as a percentage of the mean or a coefficient of variation.

RDW can potentially discriminate between thalassaemia carriers and iron deficiency and sometimes between thalassaemia carriers and a thalassaemia disorder or other rare causes of microcytosis, as indicated by decreased MCV (see notes below). It is a measure of the degree of anisocytosis and is simpler and faster than performing red cell morphology analysis (see Supplementary Information), although not as comprehensive. RDW alone is not a diagnostic parameter for β -thalassaemia trait.

The RBC count is also a parameter that can potentially distinguish between iron deficiency and thalassaemia. High RBC (erythrocytosis) results from a mechanism that compensates for the chronic low MCH present in thalassaemia carriers. This compensating mechanism needs folic acid levels to be maintained and may restore the Hb level of a markedly microcytic thalassaemia carrier to near normal values, raising RBC to 6–7 (10¹²/l) or higher, without exceeding the normal packed cell volume (PCV) level. On the other hand, RBC compensation might be less evident in case of folic acid deficiency, a vitamin with limited body reserves, which is essential for cell division and thus for erythropoiesis. In case of folic acid deficiency carriers may become more anaemic, and microcytosis may become less evident, even disappearing in cases with coexisting vitamin B12 deficiency. In addition, RBC compensation is less evident in cases when MCH is only moderately reduced.

5 DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH IN ANAEMIA

5.1 Recommendations

Screening for anaemia should be performed in all children with acute and chronic GI disease at initial diagnosis and be repeated on a regular basis based on the degree of anaemia and the course of the underlying condition (LoE: low; SoR: strong, voting: 100% agreement).

5.1.1 Statement

In chronic inflammatory GI diseases such as IBD, it is necessary to differentiate IDA from ACD and FID (LoE: low; SoR: strong, voting: 92% agreement).

5.1.2 Practice points

1 Screening for anaemia should include evaluation of haematological parameters, iron status, inflammatory parameters, coeliac serology and stool testing for faecal occult blood and calprotectin (Table 1).
2 A nutritional evaluation includes assessment of micronutrient intake and intake of foods capable of inhibiting iron absorption (Table 1).
3 MCV as well as reticulocyte count are helpful to classify anaemia, initiate further diagnostic testing and find the GI aetiology of anaemia (Table 1).

Summary of evidence

For the diagnostic approach, it is helpful to use the classification of anaemia regarding pathogenesis (hypo‐regenerative anaemia with a low reticulocyte count vs. regenerative anaemia with a normal or high reticulocyte count) and red cell morphology (microcytic vs. normocytic vs. macrocytic anaemia) (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Suggested algorithm for diagnosis of anaemia in children and adolescents with GI disease. CMV, cytomegalovirus; CRP, C‐reactive protein; CT, computer tomography; EBV, Epstein–Barr virus; ESR, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; IBD, inflammatory bowel disease; IgA, immunoglobulin A; GI, gastrointestinal; H. pylori, Helicobacter pylori; HbC, haemoglobin C; HbS, haemoglobin S; LDH, lactic dehydrogenase; MCV, mean corpuscular volume; MRA, magnetic resonance angiography; MRE, magnetic resonance enterography; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; WBC, white blood cell. 1. For example, folic acid and vitamin B12. 2. Infectious causes: giardiasis, malaria, tuberculosis, EBV and CMV.

Despite the availability of various tests, a single test may not distinguish IDA from ACD or FID. Therefore, it is helpful to use a combination of tests (Table 4).

### Differential diagnosis and management of anemia in the newborn [^9d9e8c6f]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Neonatal anemia is a condition with a diverse etiologic spectrum. Therefore, in order to form a focused differential diagnosis, it is important for the caregiver to have some knowledge of the more common causes of low hemoglobin and hematocrit concentrations in the neonate. Proper history taking, physical examination, and interpretation of diagnostic tests can narrow this focus and aid in establishing an accurate diagnosis and in directing the appropriate therapeutic interventions.

### Inherited microcytic anemias [^451b8f98]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

Inherited microcytic anemias can be broadly classified into 3 subgroups: (1) defects in globin chains (hemoglobinopathies or thalassemias), (2) defects in heme synthesis, and (3) defects in iron availability or iron acquisition by the erythroid precursors. These conditions are characterized by a decreased availability of hemoglobin (Hb) components (globins, iron, and heme) that in turn causes a reduced Hb content in red cell precursors with subsequent delayed erythroid differentiation. Iron metabolism alterations remain central to the diagnosis of microcytic anemia, and, in general, the iron status has to be evaluated in cases of microcytosis. Besides the very common microcytic anemia due to acquired iron deficiency, a range of hereditary abnormalities that result in actual or functional iron deficiency are now being recognized. Atransferrinemia, DMT1 deficiency, ferroportin disease, and iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia are hereditary disorders due to iron metabolism abnormalities, some of which are associated with iron overload. Because causes of microcytosis other than iron deficiency should be considered, it is important to evaluate several other red blood cell and iron parameters in patients with a reduced mean corpuscular volume (MCV), including mean corpuscular hemoglobin, red blood cell distribution width, reticulocyte hemoglobin content, serum iron and serum ferritin levels, total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, hemoglobin electrophoresis, and sometimes reticulocyte count. From the epidemiological perspective, hemoglobinopathies/thalassemias are the most common forms of hereditary microcytic anemia, ranging from inconsequential changes in MCV to severe anemia syndromes.

### Polycythemia vera [^8e6389cc]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Polycythemia vera is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder characterized by increased red blood cell mass. The resultant hyperviscosity of the blood predisposes such patients to thrombosis. Polycythemia vera should be suspected in patients with elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit levels, splenomegaly, or portal venous thrombosis. Secondary causes of increased red blood cell mass (e.g., heavy smoking, chronic pulmonary disease, renal disease) are more common than polycythemia vera and must be excluded. Diagnosis is made using criteria developed by the Polycythemia Vera Study Group; major criteria include elevated red blood cell mass, normal oxygen saturation, and palpable splenomegaly. Untreated patients may survive for six to 18 months, whereas adequate treatment may extend life expectancy to more than 10 years. Treatment includes phlebotomy with the possible addition of myelosuppressive agents based on a risk-stratified approach. Agents under investigation include interferon alfa-2b, anagrelide, and aspirin. Consultation with a hematologist is recommended.

### JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis: current diagnostic approach and therapeutic views [^c864911b]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic approach

In clinical practice, hematology referrals for erythrocytosis are triggered by Hgb/Hct level above 16.5 g/dl/49% and 16 g/dl/48% in Caucasian males and females, respectively, and should be confirmed by at least two separate blood counts evaluated at different time points. This should be followed by distinguishing true from apparent erythrocytosis; the former is a result of either a clonal MPN, as in PV, or a non-clonal process resulting in secondary erythrocytosis. It is also important to recognize inapparent (masked) erythrocytosis in which an increase in red cell mass (RCM) is accompanied by a concomitant increase in plasma volume and therefore masked by a normal Hgb/Hct. Similarly, in situations with normal Hgb/Hct and concomitant iron deficiency, PV is often underrecognized. Conversely, an apparent erythrocytosis may result from either a reduction in plasma volume (relative erythrocytosis) or extreme high normal values which exceed the 95th percentile of sex-, race-and altitude-adjusted normal values. RCM measurement is no longer available at our institution; however, upon evaluation of its performance and practical utility in a total of 105 patients with erythrocytosis; elevated RCM was seen in 76%, 20%, 21%, and 57% with PV, secondary erythrocytosis, apparent erythrocytosis, and essential thrombocythemia, respectively. In the particular study RCM significantly correlated with both Hct and Hgb levels (p < 0.001). Hgb/Hct values below which an elevated RCM was not observed were 16/48% for males and 13/39% for females. In contrast, values > 19.5/58% for males and 17.5/53% for females were almost always associated with increased RCM. In other words, RCM measurement was found to be suboptimal in distinguishing PV from other causes of erythrocytosis and failed to offer any additional diagnostic value. Furthermore, obesity is a confounding factor that hinders accurate interpretation of RCM values.

### The pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I [^07dec496]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Haematology and biochemical assays

A full blood count typically reveals moderate macrocytic anaemia, with a haemoglobin (Hb) of 66–116 g/l (mean 92 g/l), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 100–120 and reticulocytopenia, although 30% of cases have a normal MCV (Wickramasinghe, 1998). There are reports of transient neutropenia/thrombocytopenia, but these lineages are generally unaffected (Meznarich et al, 2018). The hallmark of CDA‐I is an absolute or relative reticulocytopenia, indicative of ineffective erythropoiesis (Heimpel, 2004). Ineffective erythropoiesis was originally demonstrated using ferrokinetic studies, where the fraction of 59 Fe present in peripheral red blood cells is calculated 2 weeks post‐intravenous infusion. Where erythropoiesis is effective, e.g. when anaemia occurs due to bleeding, iron deficiency or haemolysis, the fraction of red cells containing 59 Fe is ~75–80%, but in ineffective erythropoiesis, it may be as low as 25–30% (Lewis, 2001). Recently, a new clinical index, termed the bone marrow responsiveness index (BMRI), has been developed to discriminate haemolytic anaemia from ineffective erythropoiesis. This is defined as: [(absolute reticulocyte count) × (patient Hb/normal Hb)] and was shown to be a highly sensitive parameter (90.4%) to achieve a clinical diagnosis of CDA‐II. This metric is likely to be useful in CDA‐I but is yet to be formally validated in this disease.

The blood film, as illustrated in Fig 2, is markedly abnormal with anisocytosis and various poikilocytes, including teardrops, ovalocytes, elliptocytes, microspherocytes, irregularly contracted red cells (Heimpel et al, 2010) and occasional nucleated red cells (Tamary & Dgany, 2009), although these are not a typical feature. Red cell distribution width, as a quantitative assessment of the aniosopoikilocytosis seen on films, is elevated in CDA‐I (Wickramasinghe, 1998; Kamiya & Manabe, 2010). Renal and liver function are normal unless perturbed secondary to severe iron overload, but unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase will be elevated from the haemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis. Haptoglobin levels are reduced secondary to intra‐ and extra‐vascular haemolysis (Heimpel, 2004).

### NCCN guidelines® insights: myelodysplastic syndromes, version 2.2025 [^bf5ea6a5]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Childhood myelodysplastic syndromes — differential diagnosis and diagnostic thresholds are noted: Differential diagnoses include aplastic anemia (AA) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Compared to AA, children with MDS have a significantly elevated mean corpuscular volume and clonal hematopoiesis is confirmatory, and higher expression of p53, lower expression of survivin, or MDS-related cytogenetic abnormalities can also help differentiate MDS from AA. Compared with AML, low WBC count, multi-lineage dysplasia, and clonal hematopoiesis with numerical rather than structural cytogenetic abnormalities suggest MDS, and a bone marrow blast count of < 20% also suggests MDS, with biologic features more important than a strict blast cutoff value. Monosomy 7 strongly suggests MDS. When patients present with AML, dysplasia does not necessarily indicate antecedent MDS and criteria for MDS diagnosis in a patient who presents with AML are stringent; dysplasia may reflect infection, deficiencies of B12 and copper, drug therapy, or chronic disease, and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia, congenital sideroblastic anemia, and Pearson syndrome should also be excluded.

Association of blood counts with 5-year MDD incidence

We next considered the association of blood cell counts with 5-year MDD incidence in the white British subcohort (Fig. 2). High white blood cell (WBC) count was associated with increased MDD incidence (AOR = 1.21 [1.06, 1.40], FDR = 3%), as was one particular WBC subset: high neutrophil count (AOR = 1.23 [1.07, 1.42], FDR = 2%) and percentage (AOR = 1.23 [1.05, 1.45], FDR = 5%) were associated, but not high basophil, eosinophil, lymphocyte, or monocyte counts or percentages.

Nine of 14 red blood cell (RBC) measures were also associated with MDD incidence. Low RBC count, an indicator of anemia, was strongly associated with incident MDD (AOR = 1.47 [1.26, 1.70], FDR = 0.002%), along with low hemoglobin concentration (AOR = 1.38 [1.19, 1.60], FDR = 0.03%) and hematocrit percentage (AOR = 1.29 [1.11, 1.51], FDR = 0.7%). MDD incidence was also associated with high mean corpuscular (RBC) volume (MCV; AOR = 1.48 [1.27, 1.71], FDR = 0.002%), an indicator of macrocytosis — an enlargement of RBCs that often co-occurs with anemia (macrocytic anemia). Thus, indicators of anemia and macrocytosis were associated with increased MDD incidence.

Guideline 1.5 - evaluation of anaemia – Baseline investigations

We recommend that initial clinical and laboratory evaluation of anaemia should be performed prior to initiation of treatment for anaemia in CKD patients. (1A)

We recommend that laboratory evaluation should include the following tests (1B):

- **Full blood count (FBC) including — in addition to the Hb concentration**:

- **Red blood cell indices**:

- mean corpuscular haemoglobin [MCH]

- mean corpuscular volume [MCV]

- mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration [MCHC])

- white blood cell count and differential count

- platelet count

- Absolute reticulocyte count to assess bone marrow responsiveness (if indicated).

- **Test to determine iron status**:

- percentage of hypochromic red blood cells (% HRC), but only if processing of blood sample is possible within 6 h or

- reticulocyte Hb count (CHr) or equivalent tests e.g. reticulocyte Hb equivalent or

- combination of transferrin saturation (TSAT) and serum ferritin if the above tests are not available or the person has thalassemia or thalassemia trait

- Serum ferritin to assess iron stores.

- Plasma/serum C-reactive protein (CRP) to assess inflammation.

Based on the initial assessment we recommend in selected cases, the following tests may be useful to diagnose the cause of anaemia (1B):
Serum B 12 and folate concentrations.
Tests for haemolysis (plasma/serum levels of haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, Coombs' test).
Plasma/serum and/or urine protein electrophoresis.
free light chains and bone marrow examination.
Hb electrophoresis.

### Red blood cell indexes in patients in patients with hereditary spherocytosis and β-thalassemia combination [^6704e5b2]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

The spontaneous occurrence of hereditary spherocytosis (HS) and beta-thalassemia in the same patient is a rare event. The mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration is elevated above the reference range in half to two-thirds of patients with HS, but there are no data for the HS/beta-thal combinations for the red blood cell indexes. This study reassessed these values in these particular patients. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution (RDW), and reticulocyte count were documented from 43 HS patients, 13 of which were from 10 families with the combination of beta-thal and HS; 28 controls were also included. Patients with HS/beta-thal have a significantly lower MCV, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and MCHC and a significantly higher RDW than normal control subjects; 95% of beta-thalassemia carriers are free of clinical symptoms. When red blood cell indexes reveal a possibility of a beta-thalassemia carrier state with the symptoms of hemolytic anemia, HS should be considered.

Complete blood cell count

A CBC for diagnostic evaluation of anemia should include the following cell indices: red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocytes count/production index, red cell distribution width (RDW), thrombocyte count and leucocyte count. In order to differentiate between various forms of anemia, the first step is to look at the MCV and MCH to identify macrocytic/normocytic/microcytic anemia. The next step is to evaluate the reticulocyte count and to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate erythropoiesis. The morphology of red blood cells and the reticulocyte count can help to identify the various causes of anemia, as shown in Table 2.

Table 2.
Causes of anemia and influence on red blood cell morphology and reticulocyte count.

In clinical practice, it has to be considered that multiple causes of anemia can be present in one patient. For example, coexisting IDA and ACD can be microcytic or normocytic. In IDA with concurrent drug-induced anemia (e.g. in the case of treatment with azathioprine), the lab test can be microcytic or even show a macrocytic anemia. This shows that the presence of macrocytic anemia alone should not be mistaken as a reason to exclude iron deficiency. MCH and MCHC are usually decreased in iron deficiency anemia, but are usually normal in ACD.

The RDW shows how much the erythrocytes differentiate in their size. It is commonly increased in IDA and within normal range in thalassemia. However, in patients with IBD, it has to be considered that nutritional deficits and disease activity can also increase the RDW.

Reticulocyte count is reduced (or 'normal', although it should physiologically be upregulated in anemia) in iron deficiency as a sign of inappropriate erythropoiesis. If the reticulocyte count is increased, hemolysis is an important differential diagnosis (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin and haptoglobine are parameters that help to further investigate the presence of hemolysis). The reticulocyte production index (RPI) puts the reticulocyte count in relation to the severity of anemia (RPI = reticulocyte count in % × hematocrit of the patient/ideal hematocrit (= 0.45) × reticulocyte maturation time). As a result of the shorter half-life, reticulocyte indices can reflect changes in the iron homeostasis within 3–10 days, much faster than erythrocyte indices.

### Personalized management of essential thrombocythemia-application of recent evidence to clinical practice [^2dff955d]. Leukemia (2013). Low credibility.

Impact on clinical practice

On the basis of the above fact, we reiterate the prognostic importance of confirming the diagnosis of true ET in any patient with a reported diagnosis of 'ET'. In this regard, one must carefully examine the complete blood count (anemia or leukocytosis suggest early/prefibrotic MF), peripheral blood smear (increased red cell distribution width, decreased mean corpuscular volume that is not associated with iron deficiency, or leukoerythroblastosis suggests early/prefibrotic MF), serum lactate dehydrogenase (increased levels are more consistent with early/prefibrotic MF) and JAK2 V617F allele burden (diagnosis of ET must be questioned in the presence of > 25% allele burden).

In terms of management, caution is required in the use of aspirin in early/prefibrotic MF because of the increased baseline risk of bleeding. In general, we recommend avoidance of prophylactic aspirin therapy in early/prefibrotic MF, especially in the presence of a bleeding history. This is different from our treatment approach in WHO-defined ET, in which we recommend universal use of aspirin therapy in the absence of clear contraindications, such as clinically relevant acquired von Willebrand syndrome. On the other hand, the indications to use cytoreductive therapy remain similar to those of ET, but might require deeper cytoreduction in the presence of leukocytosis.

### Diagnosing and treating diamond blackfan anaemia: results of an international clinical consensus conference [^92122fe4]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

Diagnostic and supporting criteria for the diagnosis of DBA are described in Table III. These criteria are subject to future modification as more evidence-based data are accumulated. A diagnosis of "classical" DBA is made if all the diagnostic criteria are met. When there is a positive family history, an otherwise normal individual should be considered as having "non-classical" DBA if a mutation shared by affected family members is present. Anyone suspected of having DBA, but with insufficient diagnostic criteria, should be considered as having sporadic, non-classical DBA if a reported mutation is present. A patient can be assigned as having a "probable" diagnosis, with a decreasing degree of certitude if; three diagnostic criteria are present along with a positive family history; two diagnostic criteria and three minor supporting criteria are present; or, a positive family history and three minor supporting criteria are evident, even in the absence of diagnostic criteria. Of note, macrocytosis may be masked by iron deficiency or thalassemia minor and, in the newborn, can be obscured by residual fetal erythrocytes. The erythrocyte adenosine deaminase (eADA) activity, not influenced by prior transfusions, is elevated (≥ 3 SD) in 80–85% of patients classified as having DBA. In contrast, 90% of patients classified as having TEC have normal eADA activity. Elevated eADA activity, increased fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) are not very strong independent criteria, however, these factors should be seriously considered when evaluating a sibling as a stem cell transplant donor. Steroid responsiveness is not considered a diagnostic criterion and corticosteroids should not be administered until a diagnosis is made. If the first three diagnostic criteria are present, but there is no paucity of red cell precursors in the bone marrow and no supporting criteria, the diagnosis of DBA cannot be made. A bone marrow evaluation should be repeated at a later date as red cell marrow hypoplasia may develop after anaemia and reticulocytopenia. Furthermore, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia are not uncommon findings. Thus the presence of additional cytopenias does not preclude the diagnosis of DBA in a patient with red cell aplasia and may be severe enough to require treatment.

### Reference intervals of complete blood count constituents are highly correlated to waist circumference: should obese patients have their own "normal values? " [^4f4989e7]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Body mass index (BMI), the prevalent indicator of obesity, is not easily grasped by patients nor physicians. Waist circumference (WC) is correlated to obesity, is better understood and has a stronger relationship to the metabolic syndrome. We compiled WC, complete blood count (CBC) parameters as well as other pertinent data of 6766 25-55-year-old US volunteers sampled in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, in the years 2005–2010. To determine reference intervals of typical US patients visiting their clinician, we used minimal exclusion criteria. We compiled hemoglobin, red blood cell count, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), red cell distribution width (RDW), platelet count, mean platelet volume, and counts of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. In addition, we also compiled serum C reactive protein and serum iron. The three major US races were studied and reference interval diagrams were constructed for each CBC parameter plotted against WC. WBC count, RDW, lymphocyte, neutrophil, and red blood cell count increase with WC. Conversely, serum iron and MCH and MCV decrease. These relationships may be related to insulin resistance and chronic activation of the immune system and the resulting low-grade inflammatory state. WC is a strong predictor for many CBC parameters, suggesting that WC should be taken into account when evaluating blood count results. Clinicians who take care of obese patients should be aware of altered hematology and investigate and treat accordingly.

### RCL1 copy number variants are associated with a range of neuropsychiatric phenotypes [^22360326]. Molecular Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Blood phenotypes

Common variants in RCL1 affect red blood cell and platelet indices, including significantly decreasing or increasing mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and red blood cell count (RBC), affecting platelet count (decreasing and increasing) and increasing platelet crit (defined as platelet count × mean platelet volume [MPV]/10,000). Therefore, blood panel values were abstracted from the proband's medical record, including 20 assessments over the course of over 3 years. While MCV was in the normal range, MCH was low at 27.2 ± 0.37 picograms/cell (normal range 28.2–30.5), and his RBC was elevated at 5.2 ± 0.22 million cells per µL (normal range 3.7–4.9). In addition, MPV was elevated with a mean of 11.3 ± 0.55 fL (normal range 7.5–8.3). In agreement with previous RCL1 blood phenotypes, the proband's RCL1 variant is likely contributing to the shifted MCV, RBC, and MPV phenotypes.

Robust RCL1 transcriptional expression during human development

RCL1 demonstrates robust RNA expression in the prefrontal cortical regions during early human development which extends into the neonatal period and subsequently decreases into adulthood (Fig. 2a). To evaluate RCL1 localization in the developing human cortex, we performed immunohistochemical analyses of RCL1 in the mid-gestation fetal cortex (20 weeks gestation) which demonstrate that RCL1 is ubiquitious across the cortical column (ventrical zone to cortical plate), with robust expression in deep-layer CTP2 + neurons (cortical layer 5/6) and among cells in the ventricular zone, including GFAP + progenitors (Fig. S1). However, RCL1 did not colocalize with GFAP + fibers located in more superficial cortical regions (Fig. S2c). Immunohistochemical analyses of the human neonate cortex (270 days post-birth) and adult cortex (37 year old) revealed the highest RCL1 signal colocalized with a neuronal marker (NeuN, Fig. 1) with the limited signal in the white matter (Fig. S1a). In agreement with IHC data, analysis of adult human neocortex single cell RNA sequencing data demonstrates that RCL1 is broadly expressed across several neuronal types, including enrichment within specific excitatory and inhibitory neuron clades (Fig. S2).

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^7ba7eb9b]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Screening tests and interpretation in IBD-related anemia specify that initially a complete blood count (CBC), CRP, and ferritin levels should be performed, and if anemic, testing should include CBC with differential, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular Hgb concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution width (RDW), reticulocyte count, CRP, serum ferritin, and transferrin saturation (TSAT); in IDA and FID anemia is more likely to be microcytic and hypochromic (low MCV and MCHC) whereas in ACD it is more likely normocytic and normochromic; macrocytosis may be seen with vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency or drug therapy including sulfasalazine, methotrexate, 6-MP, and azathioprine; a high RDW in the presence of microcytosis suggests iron deficiency and has a high sensitivity of about 93% for the diagnosis of iron deficiency; the reticulocyte count is a useful marker of bone marrow response where a low count indicates suppression of erythropoiesis and a high initial count raises suspicion for hemolysis prompting further evaluation including a peripheral blood cell smear, serum haptoglobin, bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, and direct Coomb's test; if the platelet count is high, iron deficiency and/or inflammation is more likely.

### Evaluation of microcytic anemia [^60d17a1b]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a reduction in red blood cell mass or hemoglobin concentration in blood. It is statistically differentiated from normal states as a hemoglobin concentration or hematocrit 2 SD below the mean for the healthy population adjusted for age and sex. Anemias may be classified based on the morphologic function of red blood cells and their size on a peripheral blood smear. Subcategories are microcytic, normocytic, and macrocytic anemias, but these are not mutually exclusive. In infants and children, the most common form of anemia is microcytic. A detailed history and physical examination with appropriate laboratory test results can help detect the correct cause of anemia in most patients. The objective of this article is to aid physicians taking care of children in conducting a proper evaluation to identify the correct cause of microcytic anemia.

### Why does my patient have erythrocytosis? [^476f201b]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Primary polycythemias are the result of intrinsic abnormalities of the hematopoietic progenitors that lead to constitutive overproduction of red cells accompanied by low erythropoietin (EPO) levels. Secondary polycythemias are caused by conditions resulting in increased EPO production. Polycythemia vera (PV) is a primary polycythemia, and is a chronic clonal progressive myeloproliferative neoplasm. A single recurrent point mutation in the pseudokinase domain of JAK2 molecule (JAK2(V617F)) is present in > 95% of patients with PV. The goal of therapy in PV is to normalize blood counts to minimize the risk of thrombotic events.

### Anemia in infants and children: evaluation and treatment [^6ff026bf]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Anemia affects more than 269 million children globally, including 1.2 million children in the United States. Although anemia can present with numerous symptoms, children are most often asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Anemia in infants and children most often arises from nutritional iron deficiency but can also be a result of genetic hemoglobin disorders, blood loss, infections, and other diseases. In the United States, newborn screening programs assess for various genetic causes of anemia at birth. The US Preventive Services Task Force notes insufficient evidence to recommend universal screening of asymptomatic children in the first year of life; however, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening all children before 1 year of age. Initial laboratory evaluation consists of a complete blood cell count, with further testing dependent on mean corpuscular volume. Microcytic anemia is the most common hematologic disorder in children, with iron deficiency as the most common cause. A recommended dosage of 2 to 6 mg/kg per day of ferrous sulfate is the most effective oral iron supplementation for patients with iron deficiency anemia. Delayed cord clamping at birth might prevent early iron deficiency, but no clinically relevant outcomes are certain. Normocytic anemia is classified by reticulocyte count and can reflect hemolysis (high reticulocyte count) or bone marrow suppression (low reticulocyte count). Macrocytic anemia is less common in children and is typically a result of nutritional deficiencies or poor absorption of cobalamin (vitamin B12) or folate. Pediatric hematology referral might be beneficial for patients who do not respond to treatment, and referrals are critical for any bone marrow suppression that is diagnosed.

### Red cell distribution width as a marker of activity in inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative review [^1cd238c5]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical utility of RDW

RDW, a parameter measured automatically in every complete blood count (CBC), is an actual reflection of RBC size variability and heterogeneity. RDW is considered as a reliable index of the anisocytosis of the RBC population circulating in peripheral blood. There are 2 different ways to express RDW statistically: as a coefficient of variation (RDW-CV) and/or a standard deviation (RDW-SD). RDW-SD (expressed in fL) is an actual evaluation of the width of the RBC size distribution histogram and is quantified after determination of the width (in fL) at the 20% height level of that histogram. This index is therefore not influenced by the average size of the RBC population, the mean corpuscular volume (MCV).

On the other hand, RDW-CV (expressed in %) is derived from a mathematical formula that includes SD and MCV:

RDW-CV (%) = 1 standard deviation of RBC volume / MCV × 100% and it is affected by variations in RBC size. Anemias were traditionally classified, according to their MCV value, as microcytic (MCV below the reference range), normocytic (MCV within the reference range) and macrocytic (MCV above the reference range). In the early 80s a different approach was proposed for anemia classification using both RDW and MCV.

Based on this classification, 2 distinct entities of anemias were described: one with a homogeneous erythrocyte population and normal RDW, and a second with a heterogeneous erythrocyte population and a greater RDW. The main conditions that influence and elevate RDW value include anemias due to nutritional deficiencies (iron, B12 and folate), hemoglobinopathies, hemolytic anemias, and sickle-cell anemia (Table 1).

### Three-generation female cohort with macrocytic anemia and iron overload [^198ebc16]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Macrocytosis is defined as an MCV above the upper limit of normal for age, which varies from infants to adults. Increased MCV in an automatic complete blood count (CBC) may be artifactual, such as with a marked compensatory reticulocytosis in response to anemia; reticulocytes are normally larger than mature circulating red cells (up to 126 fL for healthy adults), while they can be even larger in conditions of stress erythropoiesis, raising the perceived MCV of the total erythrocytes (mature and non‐mature) in automated CBC measurements. Cold agglutinins may also cause spurious macrocytosis due to cell counting errors of red cell aggregates. Obtaining the reticulocyte count and evaluating the blood smear are always valuable first steps to confirm a true macrocytosis and start the diagnostic evaluation.

True macrocytosis, typically associated with anemia, can have numerous causes based on clinical context, encompassing both acquired and congenital disorders. The most common pathophysiologic mechanisms involved are (1) impaired DNA synthesis in the erythroblast nuclei during terminal erythropoiesis causing megaloblastic bone marrow changes because of nuclear‐cytoplasmic asynchrony, (2) altered red cell hydration increasing cell volume, or (3) altered composition of the lipid bilayer of the RBC membrane.

Impaired DNA synthesis in megaloblastic anemia is caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, both critical components in the thymidine synthesis pathway. Deficiency of folate and/or vitamin B12 occurs either due to dietary restrictions, malabsorption syndromes like short‐gut syndrome, or in autoimmune disorders associated with loss of intrinsic factor production (atrophic gastritis) or anti‐intrinsic factor antibodies, which would prevent vitamin B12 absorption. Rare genetic disorders of vitamin B12 or folate transport and metabolism also exist, leading to syndromes that may present not only with megaloblastic anemia, but also with failure to thrive, other cytopenias, neurodevelopmental disorders, and/or thromboembolic events. Medications, such as methotrexate (a folate antimetabolite), antiretrovirals, and chemotherapeutic nucleoside analogs, all of which interfere with DNA synthesis, may also cause macrocytosis with or without anemia. Notably, a very rare cause of macrocytosis is copper deficiency which also causes neutropenia and neurological manifestations like B12 deficiency.

### Relation between red blood cell distribution width and inflammatory biomarkers in a large cohort of unselected outpatients [^f83acf0b]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Context

A strong independent association has been recently observed between elevated red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and increased incidence of cardiovascular events.

Objective

To assess whether RDW is associated with plasma markers of inflammation since the mechanism(s) underlying this association remain unknown.

Design

We retrospectively analyzed results of RDW, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, ferritin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in a large cohort of unselected adult outpatients who were consecutively referred by general practitioners for routine medical check-up.

Results

Cumulative results of RDW and other factors were retrieved from the database of our laboratory information system for 3845 adult outpatients during a 3-year period. When participants were grouped according to RDW quartiles, there were strong, graded increases of ESR and hsCRP (P < .001), both parameters being up to 3-fold higher in the fourth versus the first quartile. Accordingly, the percentages of those with hsCRP greater than 3 mg/L (from 28% to 63%; P < .001) and ESR greater than 40 mm/h (from 8% to 40%; P < .001) increased steadily across RDW quartiles. In multivariable regression analysis, ESR and hsCRP predicted RDW independently of age, sex, mean corpuscular volume, hemoglobin, and ferritin.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, our study demonstrates for the first time a strong, graded association of RDW with hsCRP and ESR independent of numerous confounding factors. If confirmed in future follow-up studies, this association might provide a rationale to introduce the easy, inexpensive RDW in algorithms for cardiovascular risk prediction.

### Computer vision quantitation of erythrocyte shape abnormalities provides diagnostic, prognostic, and mechanistic insight [^5873d3b4]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 4 shows that RBC-diff counts may in some scenarios be predictive of patient outcomes or track with patient prognosis. The surprising associations with mortality in Figure 4 B persisted after adjusting for multiple factors, including morphology grading flags, comorbidities, and RDW, suggesting the presence of valuable and underutilized clinical information in blood smears. We note that the population of patients with blood smears at MGH is not representative of the general patient population, and further study of this signal in healthy cohorts is required.

RBC-diff can also help provide single-cell insights into the influence of morphology on CBC indices (Figure 5) via the estimation of single-cell volumes. Estimation of blood count parameters from imaging data has previously been shown to be promising, with prototype approaches showing similar accuracy to flow-cytometry approaches. By connecting estimated CBC indices to morphology, RBC-diff can generate morphology-corrected CBC indices that may provide improved discrimination of pathologic states or response to treatment. It has been shown that hemoglobin levels can be estimated from blood smear images, suggesting that RBC-diff could potentially be extended to other blood count measures such as hemoglobin and mean corpuscular hemoglobin.

This study focuses primarily on the quantitation of schistocytes because they are commonly elevated in important acute care settings, and existing automated systems show limited specificity of detection. Schistocyte counts can be approximated via the fragmented red cell count (FRC), which can be calculated via flow-cytometry. FRC counts are sensitively but nonspecifically associated with imaging-derived schistocyte countsand may have diagnostic value for TMAs. However, FRC counts do not provide information on other RBC morphologic classes, a key feature for differential diagnosis in our study (Figure 3) and a part of the current recommendations for TMA diagnosis. Although FRC is a valuable correlate of schistocyte levels, it is typically used to highlight the need for manual smear review, and thus may provide value in tandem with the RBC-diff. A robust comparison of the RBC-diff schistocyte counts and FRC was not possible in this study because the primary clinical hematology analyzers at the MGH and BWH do not routinely record FRC values.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^12f4ce03]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

There is little information in literature to guide the approach to CKD patients who show laboratory evidence of iron deficiency. Nevertheless, given the high prevalence of GI blood loss due to variety of causes in this patient population, deciding on a subsequent management plan, including endoscopy, depends on the clinical presentation. This supports the recommendation that CKD patients who present with anaemia and iron deficiency should undergo careful clinical assessment prior to the initiation of anaemia therapy.

Reduced iron availability for erythropoiesis can manifest as low mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular Hb (MCH), but given the relatively long lifespan of circulating erythrocyte, this test will not reflect the existing availability of iron at the time of testing. Testing the reticulocytes for their Hb content (CHr or Ret-He) may allow more accurate estimation of iron availability, because reticulocytes are present in the circulation for 4–5 days, so give a discrete population to study. Reduced red cell Hb can be reflective of reduced haem availability or globin. Therefore, the red cell analyte values (%HRC, CHr, Ret-He) may be affected by the presence of haemoglobinopathies.

Anaemia of CKD (guidelines 2.1–2.4)

### Genetic influences on peripheral blood cell counts: a study in baboons [^b13e5f77]. Blood (2005). Low credibility.

Interperson differences in peripheral blood cell counts in healthy individuals result from genetic and environmental influences. We used multivariate genetic analyses to assess the relative impact of genes and environment on baseline blood cell counts and indices using a pedigreed colony of baboons, an animal with well-documented analogies to human blood physiology. After accounting for age, sex, and weight, we found that genetic influences explain a significant proportion of the remaining variability, ranging from a low of 13.7% for mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) to a high of 72.4% for red blood cell (RBC) number. Genes influence 38.5% of the variation in baseline white blood cell (WBC) count, a characteristic that correlates with mortality in both the general human population and clinically defined subgroups such as individuals with sickle-cell disease. We examined the interaction between pairs of traits and identified those that share common genetic influences (pleiotropy). We unexpectedly observed that the same gene or group of genes influences both WBC count and mean platelet volume (MPV). We anticipate that this approach will ultimately lead to discovery of novel insights into the biology of related traits, and ultimately identify important genes that affect hematopoiesis.

### Red blood cell indices and development of hospital-acquired anemia during acute myocardial infarction [^9a566e6a]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Hospital-acquired anemia (HAA) is common, often develops in the absence of bleeding, and is associated with poor outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). It is unknown whether red cell distribution width (RDW) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), which are routinely available markers of iron deficiency, are associated with development of HAA during AMI. We studied 15,133 patients with AMI without anemia at admission. HAA was defined by nadir hemoglobin levels below age-, gender-, and race-specific thresholds and moderate-severe HAA was defined as nadir hemoglobin ≤ 11 g/dl. We examined the association between low MCV (< 80 fL) and/or increased RDW (> 15%) on patients' initial complete blood cell count and moderate-severe HAA using multivariable modified Poisson regression. Moderate-severe HAA was more common in patients with high RDW and low MCV (45.5%), high RDW and MCV ≥ 80 fL (33.0%), and normal RDW and low MCV (28.0%) than in those with normal RDW and MCV (18.3%, p < 0.001). Compared to patients with normal RDW and MCV, those with increased RDW and low MCV (relative risk 1.72, 95% confidence interval 1.57 to 1.87), increased RDW and MCV ≥ 80 fL (relative risk 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.16 to 1.42), or normal RDW and low MCV (relative risk 1.34, 95% confidence interval 1.08 to 1.65) were independently more likely to develop moderate-severe HAA. In conclusion, increased RDW and low MCV were independent predictors of moderate-severe HAA.

### Prevalence and utility of low mean corpuscular volume in infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit [^cf403a2c]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the prevalence of low mean corpuscular volume (MCV) in newborn infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit and to assess low MCV as a diagnostic test for alpha thalassemia.

Study Design

Retrospective analysis of all infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit between January 2010 and October 2018 for which a complete blood count was performed during the first 3 postnatal days. Infants with a low MCV were compared with those with a normal MCV. Infants with positive hemoglobin Bart (Hb Bart) were compared with those withnegative Hb Bart. Low MCV was also evaluated as a diagnostic test for alpha thalassemia.

Results

A total of 3851 infants (1386 preterm, 2465 term) met the inclusion criteria and 853 (22.2%) had a low MCV. A low MCV was more common in term (25%) compared with preterm infants (17.1%, P < .001). Hb Bart positive newborn screening was identified in 133 infants (3.5%). Hb Bart was positive in 11.1% of infants with low MCV compared with 1.3% with normal MCV (P < .001). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of low MCV for the diagnosis of alpha thalassemia were 71.4%, 79.6%, 11.3%, and 98.7%, respectively.

Conclusions

As Hb Bart positive newborn screens were seen in only 11.1% of infants with microcytosis, further diagnostic investigation may be warranted in individual infants. Further research to correlate microcytosis with iron status in infants and mothers is needed as well as studies using DNA analysis for the evaluation of alpha thalassemia variants.

### A neonate with coombs-negative hemolytic jaundice with spherocytes but normal erythrocyte indices: a rare case of autosomal-recessive hereditary spherocytosis due to α-spectrin deficiency [^578ee459]. Journal of Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis (HS) in a newborn infant is generally made on the basis of a positive family history, spherocytes on blood film and Coombs-negative hemolytic jaundice of variable severity with an elevated mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and a low mean corpuscular volume (MCV). In general, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) quantification of erythrocyte membrane proteins is not needed to make the clinical diagnosis of HS. However, we observed that a neonate with no family history of HS, but with abundant spherocytosis on repeated blood films, Coombs-negative hemolytic jaundice and normal MCHC and MCV measurements, where SDS-PAGE revealed alpha-spectrin deficiency, a rare autosomal-recessive variety of HS that generally has a severe clinical phenotype.

### Hematologic disorders during essential hypertension [^f07adee5]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Besides the traditional risk factors, hematological changes may be involved in the development of arterial hypertension and in its pathogenesis.

Methods

The study, conducted on a sample of 545 subjects, 215 with hypertension and 330 witnesses, were evaluated for peripheral blood parameters in western Algeria; Logistic regression analysis was used to predict hypertension with hematological parameters.

Results

The characters studied related significantly; lower red blood cell levels have a three-and-a-half-fold risk of developing hypertension compared to those who have normal red blood cell counts (OR = 3.64, 95% CI = 1.37–9.65, p < 0.05). Subjects who have mean corpuscular volume rate below 80 fl are more exposed to hypertension (OR = 13.58, 95% CI = 4.68–39.41, p = 0.000). The mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration reveals that subjects who have a lower than normal (< 27 pg) are once less exposed to hypertension (OR = 0.04, 95% CI = 0.01–0.13, p = 0.000). Subjects who have lower platelet count than normal are twelve times more exposed to hypertension (OR = 12.13, 95% CI = 1.45–101.18, P = 0.021). Finally, the increase in sedimentation rate at one hour increases the risk of hypertension by 56.63 times compared to subjects with normal sedimentation rate (OR = 56.63, 95% CI = 3.37–597.33, P = 0.001).

Conclusions

Hematological profile associated with essential hypertension retained Red blood cells ratio, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, platelet ratio, and sedimentation rate at one hour.

### Should we screen for globin gene mutations in blood samples with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) greater than 80 fL in areas with a high prevalence of thalassaemia? [^b7669f03]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

Aims

To investigate whether it is worthwhile, in areas where thalassaemia is common, to screen for globin gene mutations in subjects with a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) above 80 fL, especially in partners of known thalassaemia carriers.

Methods

Blood samples from 95 subjects with MCV between 80 and 85 fL were screened for the presence of alpha globin gene mutations and the haemoglobin (Hb) E mutation.

Results

Thirty four subjects harboured globin gene mutations. Of these, 31 had deletions of one alpha globin gene, one had Hb Constant Spring, and three had Hb E mutations.

Conclusion

Based on the above figures and known prevalence rates of thalassaemia carriers, it would seem worthwhile to screen for globin gene mutations in partners of known thalassaemia carriers, regardless of MCV, to identify pregnancies at risk of Hb H disease or Hb E/beta thalassaemia.

### Prognostic value of preoperative red cell distribution width: fine-tuning by mean corpuscular volume [^c60144c4]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Abnormal red cell distribution width (RDW), reflecting heterogeneity of red blood cell (RBC) size, is associated with cardiovascular disease outcomes. However, whether RBC size itself, expressed as mean corpuscular volume (MCV), provides additional prognostic value is unclear. We therefore investigated the relationship between outcomes after cardiac surgery and both RDW and MCV simultaneously.

Methods

From January 2010 to January 2014, 16,097 patients underwent cardiac surgery at Cleveland Clinic and had complete blood count findings available for analysis. Outcomes included RBC transfusion, postoperative complications, and intensive care unit (ICU) and postoperative hospital lengths of stay. Risk-adjusted associations of RDW and MCV with outcomes and their relative importance in predicting outcome were identified by random forest machine learning.

Results

High RDW was associated with more RBC transfusions. Except for postoperative atrial fibrillation, risks of complications and ICU and postoperative lengths of stay were at their minimum when RDW was normal, 13% to 14%. The relationship of MCV to complications was U-shaped: high (macrocytosis) and low (microcytosis) values were associated with higher risk. RDW was an important risk factor for most postoperative outcomes and lengths of stay; MCV was less so, but provided prognostic value in addition to RDW alone, particularly when there was macrocytosis.

Conclusions

Abnormal RDW and MCV are associated with higher risk of transfusion and postoperative outcomes after cardiac surgery. RDW is one of the most important variables in predicting outcomes, but MCV provides additional prognostic value. Both should be taken into consideration when estimating the perioperative risk of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

### Levetiracetam [^b3d5ab69]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.9 Hematologic Abnormalities

Levetiracetam can cause hematologic abnormalities. Hematologic abnormalities occurred in clinical trials and included decreases in white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, and red blood cell (RBC) counts; decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit; and increases in eosinophil counts. Cases of agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in the postmarketing setting. A complete blood count is recommended in patients experiencing significant weakness, pyrexia, recurrent infections, or coagulation disorders.

Partial-Onset Seizures

Adults

Minor, but statistically significant, decreases compared to placebo in total mean RBC count (0.03 × 10⁶/mm³), mean hemoglobin (0.09 g/dL), and mean hematocrit (0.38%), were seen in levetiracetam-treated patients in controlled trials.

A total of 3.2% of levetiracetam-treated and 1.8% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (≤ 2.8 × 10⁹/L) decreased WBC, and 2.4% of levetiracetam-treated and 1.4% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (≤ 1.0 × 10⁹/L) decreased neutrophil count. Of the levetiracetam-treated patients with a low neutrophil count, all but one rose towards or to baseline with continued treatment. No patient was discontinued secondary to low neutrophil counts.

### Efficiency of red cell distribution width in identification of children aged 1–3 years with iron deficiency anemia against traditional hematological markers [^87569899]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency among Indian preschool children contributing to increased burden of morbidity and mortality and the most significant negative consequence of iron deficiency is iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Recent NFHS–III surveys (2005–06) have shown that 70–85% (approx. 79.2%) of Indian young children have anemia. IDA is attributed to inadequate iron intake, poor bioavailability of iron or high nutritional needs during childhood which is further exacerbated by chronic intestinal blood losses due to helminth infections and in many areas due to severe malarial infections. Studies have shown that iron deficiency causes delay in cognitive development and poor motor and sensory system functioning and that iron supplementation in early years may prevent these complications among children. Conversely, there is an evidence suggesting that routine iron treatment in non-iron deficient children may have adverse consequences for morbidity and infections. Therefore, it is very important to detect iron deficiency (ID) at its earliest stage in children especially in a low resource setting and replenish the iron stores by proper supplementation, thereby preventing many of the adverse developmental and behavioral effects caused by IDA. Currently, the detection of IDA is largely dependent upon quantification of biochemical markers like serum ferritin (SFr), serum transferrin (STr) and zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) which are not routinely available and affordable in developing countries due to high costs. Moreover, these tests are altered by inflammation, which limits their applicability for clinical interpretation, especially in areas with high infection rates. Another limitation of the commonly used hematological tests is their poor sensitivity or specificity as they can be modified by conditions other than iron deficiency. Studies have shown that RDW in addition to other hematological markers like mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and hemoglobin can be used as a differential diagnostic tool for identification of iron deficiency anemia. Various studies also show that the onset of iron deficiency anemia can be predicted using automated blood analyzers, as a low haemoglobin level along with a high level of anisocytosis detectable by red cell distribution width prove to be good indicators of changes in blood due to depleted iron stores. It seems that the earliest hematological manifestation of iron deficiency is marked by an elevated level of RDW and reports have shown that it is a cost-effective screening tool for early diagnosis of IDA in comparison to SFr and ZnPP. The red blood cell (RBC) distribution width, a measure of variations in the width of circulating RBCs, reported as a part of complete blood count has been known to be of value in the discrimination of iron deficiency anemia from other causes of microcytic anemia, but studies in pediatric populations are lacking. Thus, in the present study we evaluated the discriminative ability of RDW diagnostic test for detecting iron deficiency anemia among children aged 1–3 yrs in a low socio-economic setting using receiver's operating characteristic curve (ROC) analyses.

### Approach to anaemia in gastrointestinal disease: a position paper by the ESPGHAN gastroenterology committee [^c43fbf57]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

A reduced erythrocyte mass can be the consequence of haemolytic anaemia, resulting from both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Hereditary or acquired diseases can be the cause of intrinsic abnormalities in the structure and membrane of RBSs, such as spherocytosis and elliptocytosis, enzymatic disorders (glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase [G6PD] and pyruvate synthesis), sickle cell anaemia and thalassaemia. Regarding extrinsic factors of anaemia, haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenic purpura or disseminated intravascular coagulation represent mechanical processes with the destruction of RBCs. Furthermore, antibody‐mediated destruction of RBCs can also be considered an extrinsic disorder.

The morphology of anaemia is described by RBC size, shape and colour. Using this classification system, anaemias are classified as hypochromic microcytic anaemia (mean corpuscular volume [MCV] < 80 fL), macrocytic anaemia (MCV > 100 fL) and normocytic normochromic anaemia (MCV: 80–100 fL). Main causes of microcytic anaemia include IDA, thalassaemia, and ACD, with impaired iron absorption due to tissue inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IDA is diagnosed in the presence of ferritin < 30 or < 100 μg/L in the absence/presence of active disease, respectively. Inflammation through cytokine‐mediated mechanisms may trigger an increase in hepcidin and a decrease in circulating iron levels, but not ferritin, hence in the presence of biochemical and/or clinical evidence of inflammation, ACD should be diagnosed if serum ferritin levels are increased and transferrin saturation is decreased.

Finally, anaemia can also be classified according to the form of clinical presentation as acute (usually due to bleeding or haemolysis) or chronic.

### Red blood cell count and risk of adverse outcomes in patients with mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction [^64245735]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS

Our findings suggest that reduced RBC counts are associated with increased CV mortality in patients with HFmrEF. Women with HFmrEF are more sensitive to changes in RBC counts than are men. Compared with men with HFmrEF, women with reduced RBC counts had a greater risk of CV death, and an increased RBC count was associated with a more significant reduction in the risk of CV death in women. Correcting a decreased RBC count can potentially reduce the risk of CV death in patients with HFmrEF. However, there is no clear conclusion regarding the need for medication to correct anemia in patients with HFmrEF. Further research is needed to understand the risk associated with anemia in patients with HFmrEF. A better understanding of risk factors for anemia in patients with HFmrEF may help to develop strategies to improve outcomes of patients with this severe disease.

### Emergency medicine evaluation and management of anemia [^c90807d0]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common condition and is diagnosed on laboratory assessment. It is defined by abnormally low hemoglobin concentration or decreased red blood cells. Several classification systems exist. Laboratory markers provide important information. Acute anemia presents with symptoms owing to acute blood loss; chronic anemia may present with worsening fatigue, dyspnea, lightheadedness, or chest pain. Specific treatments depend on the underlying anemia and etiology. Iron is an alternative treatment for patients with microcytic anemia owing to iron deficiency. Hyperbaric oxygen is an option for alternative rescue therapy. Most patients with chronic anemia may be discharged with follow-up if hemodynamically stable.

### Red cell distribution width and dementia among rural-dwelling older adults: the MIND-China study [^084c709f]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Dementia affects over 50 million people worldwide, and nearly 60%of all dementia patients live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Notably, the number of people with dementia is projected to increase faster in LMICs than in high-income countries in the coming decades. Since the 1990s the prevalence of dementia in China has increased steadily in all age groups from 60 years of age. The total annual expenditure for dementia in China was estimated at US$168 billion. The prevalence of dementia was notably higher in the rural than urban communities. Given that there is currently no curative therapy available for dementia, identifying modifiable risk factors is crucial for preventive and therapeutic interventions to delay the onset of dementia and slow cognitive decline.

The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a simple parameter that reflects the heterogeneity of circulating erythrocyte volume. It is routinely calculated by the overwhelming majority of hematologic analyzers according to red blood cell (RBC) volume and mean corpuscular volume (MCV). A normal RDW suggests homogeneous RBC size, whereas an elevated RDW indicates heterogeneous RBC size, known as anisocytosis. RDW in combination with MCV can used for differential diagnosis of anemia. An elevated RDW is often related to anemia due to nutrient deficiency (e.g. iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid) and sideroblastic anemia, and a normal RDW is often related to anemia from chronic disease, thalassemia heterozygosity, and aplastic anemia. Studies have shown that an increased RDW is associated with mortality, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and other chronic health conditions. The association of RDW with adverse health outcomes may depend on anemia or hemoglobin levels. Of note, the cross-sectional data from the Chicago Health and Aging Project found that elevated RDW was associated with dementia, especially among non-anemic participants. In addition, evidence has been accumulating over the last decade that anemia or low hemoglobin is related to cognitive impairment and dementia among older adults. However, most population-based studies of anemia and dementia have been conducted among high-income countries. In particular, the relationship of abnormal RDW with dementia and cognitive function as well as the interplay of increased RDW and anemia in cognitive aging has yet to be explored among LMICs.

Therefore, in this population-based cross-sectional study of older adults living in the rural communities in China, we sought 1) to evaluate the associations of RDW and anemia with dementia and global cognitive function; and 2) to explore whether their association varied by anemia status.

### Red blood cell distribution width and ischaemic stroke [^8351bcac]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a parameter that reflects the heterogeneity of the red blood cell volume. It is indicated that the variation coefficient of the red blood cell volume is more objective and accurate than that of the red blood cell on the blood smear. RDW is in about 11.0%–16.0% in normal population. RDW will rise under some physiological and pathological conditions.

RDW has at least five clinical significant meanings:
To diagnose and guide the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia. Traditionally, anaemia deficiency from iron can be differentiated from folate deficiency according to the size of RDW. RDW would increase because of the release of immature red blood cells into the blood stream in certain haematological diseases.RDW increases in iron deficiency anaemia, and such increase would appear earlier than the decline of mean corpuscular volume (MCV), which can be an early indication of iron deficiency. When MCV is low, RDW would increase more significantly. When iron therapy is given, RDW would elevate first and then gradually reduce at the normal level.
To diagnose small cell and low pigment anaemia.
To classify anaemia.
Previously, many research suggested that RDW was closely related to the mortality and cardiovascular events, such as acute coronary syndrome, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation (AF) and hypertension.
RDW can be made as a predictor of mortality in patients with cancer, chronic lung disease or acute renal failure.

Stroke is the result of cerebral vascular occlusion or haemorrhage, and it is the leading cause of death in the world. At present, clinical diagnosis relies on history, neurological examinations and neuro-imaging. Several scoring systems are used to quantify the degree of severity of stroke: the Glasgow Coma Scale, Canadian Neurological Scale, Scandinavian Stroke Scale and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). However, there is no biological surrogate marker to diagnose stroke. RDW by flow cytometry could be an option for this purpose and predict the occurrence of stroke.

### The clinical relevance of an isolated increase in the number of circulating hyperchromic red blood cells [^26233d72]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

To search for laboratory evidence of hereditary spherocytosis (HS) among apparently healthy children with the chance finding of an isolated increase in hyperchromic red cells (cells with intracellular haemoglobin concentration > 410 g/litre).

Methods

Blood and reticulocyte counts and Pink tests were performed on successive children found on routine counts to have > 4% hyperchromic red cells, and compared with age and mean cell haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) matched controls and children known to have HS.

Results

Thirty four patients with > 4% hyperchromic red cells had significantly higher absolute numbers of such cells (p < 0.0001) and higher reticulocyte counts (p < 0.01) than age matched controls, together with higher MCHC (p < 0.0001) and haemoglobin distribution width (p < 0.0001) values and lower mean cell volume (p < 0.02) values. Significant differences were also found among hyperchromic red blood cell, reticulocyte, and haemoglobin distribution width values when subjects were compared with MCHC matched controls. Pink test values were higher in children with increased hyperchromic red blood cells, but not significantly so. In patients with HS, most variables measured were significantly different both from those of children with > 4% hyperchromic cells and controls. Despite the differences found, few MCHC, HDW, reticulocyte, or Pink test values were outside of the normal limits, and only one child with increased hyperchromic cells had both a mild reticulocytosis and a slightly raised Pink test value.

Conclusions

Subjects with an isolated increase in hyperchromic red blood cells have a profile of red blood cell changes similar to that of patients with HS, but to a lesser degree. They may carry a recessive form of the disease but lack the laboratory features of clinically manifest HS.

### Association of red blood cell distribution width with mortality risk in hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection [^7ed56761]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory illness with a high rate of hospitalization and mortality. Biomarkers are urgently needed for patient risk stratification. Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a component of complete blood counts that reflects cellular volume variation, has been shown to be associated with elevated risk for morbidity and mortality in a wide range of diseases.

Objective

To investigate whether an association between mortality risk and elevated RDW at hospital admission and during hospitalization exists in patients with COVID-19.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study included adults diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and admitted to 1 of 4 hospitals in the Boston, Massachusetts area (Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, North Shore Medical Center, and Newton-Wellesley Hospital) between March 4, 2020, and April 28, 2020.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was patient survival during hospitalization. Measures included RDW at admission and during hospitalization, with an elevated RDW defined as greater than 14.5%. Relative risk (RR) of mortality was estimated by dividing the mortality of those with an elevated RDW by the mortality of those without an elevated RDW. Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model.

Results

A total of 1641 patients were included in the study (mean [SD] age, 62[18] years; 886 men [54%]; 740 White individuals [45%] and 497 Hispanic individuals [30%]; 276 nonsurvivors [17%]). Elevated RDW (> 14.5%) was associated with an increased mortality risk in patients of all ages. The RR for the entire cohort was 2.73, with a mortality rate of 11% in patients with normal RDW (1173) and 31% in those with an elevated RDW (468). The RR in patients younger than 50 years was 5.25 (normal RDW, 1% [n = 341]; elevated RDW, 8% [n = 65]); 2.90 in the 50- to 59-year age group (normal RDW, 8% [n = 256]; elevated RDW, 24% [n = 63]); 3.96 in the 60- to 69-year age group (normal RDW, 8% [n = 226]; elevated RDW, 30% [104]); 1.45 in the 70- to 79-year age group (normal RDW, 23% [n = 182]; elevated RDW, 33% [n = 113]); and 1.59 in those ≥ 80 years (normal RDW, 29% [n = 168]; elevated RDW, 46% [n = 123]). RDW was associated with mortality risk in Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, D-dimer (dimerized plasmin fragment D) level, absolute lymphocyte count, and common comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension (hazard ratio of 1.09 per 0.5% RDW increase and 2.01 for an RDW > 14.5% vs ≤ 14.5%; P < .001). Patients whose RDW increased during hospitalization had higher mortality compared with those whose RDW did not change; for those with normal RDW, mortality increased from 6% to 24%, and for those with an elevated RDW at admission, mortality increased from 22% to 40%.

Conclusions and Relevance

Elevated RDW at the time of hospital admission and an increase in RDW during hospitalization were associated with increased mortality risk for patients with COVID-19 who received treatment at 4 hospitals in a large academic medical center network.

### Systematic evaluation of hematologic parameters and blood smear findings in patients with SARS-CoV-2 vs other viral respiratory infections [^bd9206e6]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We evaluated and compared the peripheral blood findings in patients with acute COVID-19 vs other viral respiratory infections.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed peripheral blood counts and smear morphology in patients with a positive viral respiratory panel (VRP) or SARS-CoV-2 test.

Results

A total of 97 peripheral blood samples (COVID-19 infection, 53; VRP positive, 44) from 50 patients (mean [SD] age, 45.8 [20.8] years; females 52%) were reviewed. There were no statistically significant differences in the demographic characteristics between the 2 groups. The most common peripheral blood abnormalities were anemia, thrombocytopenia, absolute lymphopenia, and reactive lymphocytes. The following peripheral blood findings were significantly associated with other viral respiratory infections compared with COVID-19 infection: low red blood cell count, low hematocrit, high mean corpuscular volume, thrombocytopenia, low mean platelet volume, high red cell distribution width, band neutrophilia, and toxic granulation in neutrophils.

Conclusions

Our study showed that there are several peripheral blood count and morphologic abnormalities seen in patients with COVID-19, but most of these findings lack specificity as they are also seen in the other viral respiratory infections.

### Hematological parameters and prevalence of anemia in white and British Indian vegetarians and nonvegetarians in the UK biobank [^1e2022f6]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Statistical analyses

Baseline characteristics of the cohort were tabulated by 6 diet groups in white British participants and by 2 diet groups in British Indian participants. The primary outcomes of this research were blood counts and prevalence of anemia, and the secondary outcomes were prevalence of subtypes of anemia and prevalence of low platelet counts and elevated platelet volume. Linear regressions were modeled to estimate the adjusted mean levels (95% CIs) of each hematological parameter of interest, including hemoglobin, red blood cell count, reticulocyte percentage, immature reticulocyte fraction, total white blood cell count, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, platelet count, and platelet volume.

To estimate mean levels of hemoglobin, red blood cell count, reticulocyte percentage, and immature reticulocyte fraction, the regression model was stratified by sex and menopausal status (men, premenopausal women, and postmenopausal women) and adjusted for age of recruitment (5-y age groups from < 45, 45–49, 50–54, 55–59, 60–64, and ≥ 65 y). We additionally adjusted for smoking status (never, previous, current < 15 cigarettes per day, current ≥ 15 cigarettes per day, and unknown) in a second model. There was little difference in reticulocyte percentage and immature reticulocyte fraction by sex and menopausal status; thus, we combined the 3 groups and adjusted for sex in the regression model for our main results and presented the stratified results secondarily.

To estimate mean levels of white cells (total white blood cell count, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils) and platelets (platelet count and platelet volume), the regression model was adjusted for age and sex and subsequently for smoking status. In addition, as a third model, we restricted the analysis to participants who answered "No" to the question "Do you have any long-standing illness, disability, or infirmity?" to remove the possible confounding effect of chronic illnesses on white cell or platelet count.

For classification of anemia, low platelet count, and elevated platelet volume, numbers and percentages of people in each diet group were reported as observed, based on criteria as previously described. For anemia, we additionally restricted the analyses to people who reported no iron or B vitamins supplement use.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^440b00ef]. KDIGO (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO anemia in chronic kidney disease — CBC interpretation and reticulocyte/erythropoietin testing states that the anemia of CKD is hypoproliferative and generally normochromic and normocytic; erythropoietin levels are not useful for evaluation in most clinical settings and are generally not recommended for measurement. Effective erythropoietic proliferative activity is most simply assessed by determining the absolute reticulocyte count. Abnormal white blood cell or platelet counts are not typical of CKD anemia and should prompt investigation for other processes. Reticulocyte counts obtained with automated CBC testing may be high with active blood loss or hemolysis and low with hypoproliferative erythropoiesis. Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency may cause macrocytosis, whereas iron deficiency or inherited disorders of hemoglobin formation may produce microcytosis.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency and early rise in mean corpuscular volume… [^78ce9765]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — In the article by Charles A. Hall, MD, we do not dispute the fact that a high mean corpuscular volume should alert a physician to the possibility of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency; however. there are a multitude of other important causes of high MCV, some of which are liver disease, renal disease, hypothyroidism, blood regeneration, and malaria, to name a few. 1In our experience, which consists of a study of the vitamin B12 status of 772 patients during a two-year period, 101 were found to have a low serum vitamin B12 level. Of these 101 patients only four were found to have a high MCV. Conversely, in 45 patients of the 772 studied who had a high MCV, only five had a low vitamin B12 serum Smith TJS, Malon RG.

### Eliminating race-based reference ranges in haematology: a call to action [^95ac23b2]. The Lancet: Haematology (2021). High credibility.

In haematology, as in all of medicine, the use of reference intervals for laboratory variables is essential to define disease states and inform treatment decisions. There are many haematological variables, including haemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, absolute neutrophil count, and iron indices, that are often reported to be different on the basis of a person's race or ethnicity. Although there are many haematological conditions with a genetic basis, such that it is appropriate to consider ancestry in the diagnostic algorithm, defining pathology on the basis of a social construct such as race is unacceptable. The inclusion of separate thresholds or simple statements that so-called normal values vary by race further validates the common misperception that there are physiological differences between Black and white patients. These statements might have downstream effects on diagnostic and treatment decisions that exacerbate existing racial health disparities. In this Viewpoint, we argued for the removal of race-based reference intervals across haematology.

### Idiopathic erythrocytosis: a diagnostic and management challenge with emerging areas for exploration [^c4045703]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite published algorithms for approaching the work-up of erythrocytosis, a significant proportion of patients are left with uncertainty as to its aetiology and prognosis. The term 'idiopathic erythrocytosis' (IE) is applied when known primary and secondary aetiologies have been ruled out. However, the assignment of secondary aetiologies is not always straightforward or evidence based, which can lead to misdiagnosis and heterogeneity in cohort studies. Furthermore, new studies have identified germline or somatic mutations that may affect prognosis. Epidemiological and cohort data are inconsistent as to whether IE increases the risk for complications such as arterial and venous thromboembolism, clonal transformation or comorbid conditions. Randomized trials assessing the role of phlebotomy for long-term management of IE have not been performed, so treatment remains a vexing problem for clinicians. Standardization of terminology and testing strategies, including comprehensive genetic screening in clinical research, are key to refining our understanding of IE.

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^097973ff]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Anemia in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease — etiologic workup by mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and reticulocyte count — directs low MCV with low or normal reticulocytes toward iron deficiency anemia (IDA) with low ferritin, low Tsat, high sTfR, normal CRP or functional iron deficiency (FID) with high ferritin, low Tsat, indeterminate sTfR, high CRP; low MCV with high reticulocytes suggests thalassemia requiring hemoglobin electrophoresis; normal MCV with low or normal reticulocytes indicates anemia of chronic disease (ACD) with high ferritin, normal/low Tsat, low sTfR, high CRP or other causes; high MCV with high reticulocytes indicates hemolysis requiring blood smear, LDH, Coomb's test, haptoglobin, and Hgb electrophoresis; high MCV with low or normal reticulocytes suggests B12 or folate deficiency, drug-induced, liver disease, hypothyroidism, or myelodysplasia.

### Diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes: the classic and the novel [^7e755de2]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Laboratory findings

Table 1 lists the laboratory abnormalities that are typical, yet not specific for patients with MDS. C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate can be elevated. At least 90% of MDS patients will be anemic, and ~50% of them will have a hemoglobin concentration of less than 10 g/dL. The anemia is usually mildly macrocytic, with an increased red cell distribution width. Reflecting the BM dysfunction that characterizes MDS, patients usually do not have an increased reticulocyte count, in contrast to patients with hemolytic anemia. Table 1 lists other laboratory findings.

Serum chemistry is usually normal unless there is a comorbidity associated with anemia. Serum iron and iron saturation as well as serum ferritin can be elevated in the sideroblastic subtype. It is important to exclude nutritional deficiencies, especially folic acid and vitamin B12 deficiency, both of which can cause macrocytic anemia. Blood chemistries can also rule out underlying liver or kidney disease. Hepatitis B and C, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus and parvovirus B19 infections must be ruled out.

The PB smear is usually non-specific, but it might show features consistent with disease. For example, the red blood cells (RBC) might have anisocytosis or poikylocytos, and sometimes there may be nucleated RBC. The white blood cells may include an increased number of immature myeloid cells ("left shift") with hypolobulation ("Pelger"-like cells) and hypogranulation. PB platelets might be distorted, clumped, and big (megaplatelets), in addition to being present in low number. Persistent monocytosis suggests CMML, on the assumption that other etiologies for monocytosis have been excluded. The PB smear is especially helpful in that it may uncover a disease other than or in addition to MDS. For example, thrombocytosis or leukocytosis would suggest an MPN, or at least an overlap MDS/MPN syndrome.

Altogether, the combination of symptoms and laboratory findings along with the exclusion of other causes of anemia/cytopenia, raises the suspicion of MDS (Table 1), but other investigations are required in order to establish the diagnosis of MDS.

### Efficiency of red cell distribution width in identification of children aged 1–3 years with iron deficiency anemia against traditional hematological markers [^5537cb91]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

The high incidence of IDA in children emphasizes the need for the cost effective and reliable tool in diagnosing IDA. A number of different indicators, such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, erythropoietin, erythrocyte protoporphyrin, serum iron, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration have been used to evaluate IDA. But the drawbacks of these tests are that many of them are expensive and require sophisticated laboratories, while others have been found to have a low specificity. It has been seen that anisocytosis occurs, where the erythrocytes produced are of smaller than average size and having a large size variation, due to inadequate iron supply. The morphology and function of erythrocytes at molecular level has been known to be disturbed due to iron deficiency anemia. Therefore, an increase in RDW values may occur in IDA allowing an early detection of ID before reduction in MCV occurs. RDW has been reported to have a high predictive value for IDA and can differentiate beta-thalassemia from other causes of anemia in populations. Our results corroborate the view that RDW evaluated in a large sample performed very well as a screening diagnostic test for identifying iron deficiency anemia. These findings are similar to the findings of earlier studies conducted in other settings and support the usage of RDW as a screening tool for identifying iron deficiency anemia.

### Decline of the red blood cell count in patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy for localized prostate cancer: impact of ADT on insulin-like growth factor-1 and erythropoiesis [^552e5746]. Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To elucidate the mechanism of blood hemoglobin loss in patients with prostate cancer during androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), and to examine the activity of the growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) axis during ADT, which plays an important role in hematopoiesis.

Methods

A total of 83 patients with localized prostate cancer, who received ADT, were prospectively studied on the basis of their blood samples at the baseline and after ADT for 6 months.

Results

Before ADT, the IGF-1 level was correlated with the red blood cell (RBC) count (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient analysis [rs] = 0.315, P = 0.011), hemoglobin (rs = 0.278, P = 0.018), and mean corpuscular volume (rs = 0.266, P = 0.020), but such relationships disappeared after ADT. After ADT, the serum IGF-1 level increased compared with that at the baseline (21 ± 6 vs 18 ± 5 nmol/L, respectively, P < .001), but no change was observed in the serum GH level (P = 0.691). There was no difference between erythropoietin and interleukin-6 concentrations before and after ADT (P = 0.852 and P = 0.208, respectively). The hemoglobin concentration and RBC count declined after ADT compared with those before treatment (P < .001 for each). Although the mean corpuscular volume declined after ADT (P = 0.002), the mean cell hemoglobin was comparable between before and after ADT (P = 0.676).

Conclusions

Despite the unaffected GH, erythropoietin, and interleukin-6 levels, the serum IGF-1 concentration was elevated by ADT. Even with the increased IGF-1 level, the RBC count and hemoglobin concentration declined after ADT. IGF-1 in the bone marrow erythroid progenitor cells might be functionally inactivated during ADT.

Table 1
WHO classification of anaemia according to age and severity.

Table 2
Classification of anaemia.

Hypo‐regenerative anaemia can occur in aplastic anaemia, renal cell aplasia, renal failure or endocrine disorders. A disturbance in the maturation and proliferation of red blood cells (RBCs) may be caused by defective DNA synthesis, as in anaemia due to vitamin B12 and/or folic acid deficiency. In IDA, thalassaemia, and ACD, there is impaired Hb synthesis. ACD is multifactorial and associated with the presence of infection, inflammation or malignancy. To understand the pathomechanism of anaemia, assessment of hepcidin levels may be very helpful. Hepcidin is an iron‐regulatory hormone that inhibits iron release from cells of the reticuloendothelial system and intestinal absorption leading to hypoferraemia. An increase in hepcidin and other inflammatory cytokines, therefore, reduces the availability of iron for erythropoiesis in the bone marrow. It is usually a mild normocytic or microcytic anaemia with reticulocytopenia and with low circulating iron and low transferrin saturation, but with a normal to elevated iron storage protein ferritin.

### How I treat non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia [^28cfb0da]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Patient 1: diagnosing non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia, the intricate interplay of genotype and phenotype

A 25-year-old woman was referred to our clinic for moderate chronic microcytic anemia. The hemoglobin (Hb) concentration was 9.5 g/dL, and the mean corpuscular volume was 69 fL. The red-cell distribution width was normal, and the mean corpuscular Hb concentration was low. Before she was referred to us, she was initially treated empirically for iron deficiency anemia with oral ferrous sulfate without improvement. Lactate dehydrogenase level, reticulocyte count, and indirect bilirubin level were mildly elevated; haptoglobin was suppressed. Hb electrophoresis showed an elevated HbA2 fraction at 4.5% and a normal HbF fraction at 0.7%. She was initially thought to have a severe manifestation of heterozygous β-thalassemia. Her ferritin level was elevated at 780 ng/mL. α-Globin gene analysis demonstrated the presence of an additional α-globin gene in a DNA insert of 3.7 kb. This patient had β-thalassemia intermedia, resulting from increased α/β-globin chain imbalance in the setting of 1 defective β-globin gene (IVSI-110 G > A) and a triplicated α-globin gene locus.

### Differential diagnosis and management of polycythemia [^3ee21d15]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

One percent to 5% of all newborns in the United States are polycythemic. As the venous hematocrit rises above 65%, the thickness or viscosity of whole blood also increases, potentially compromising blood flow to a variety of organs. Fortunately, relatively few infants who have neonatal polycythemia or hyperviscosity develop complications attributable to their thick blood; however, controversy and the need for continued research envelop the issue of which infants are at risk and need to be treated. This article reviews the differential diagnosis, clinical presentation, and treatment of neonatal polycythemia.

### Can polycythaemia vera disease be predicted from haematologic parameters? A machine learning-based study [^7ba71f8f]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Absolute erythrocytosis is divided into three subclasses: primary erythrocytosis caused by an intrinsic defect in the precursor cells of the haematopoietic series, secondary erythrocytosis caused by extrinsic stimuli such as erythropoietin (EPO) and idiopathic erythrocytosis in which no aetiological cause is identified. The prototype of primary erythrocytosis is PV. PV is defined as an acquired stem cell disease characterised by uncontrolled clonal production of precursor cells with normal morphology of erythrocytes, platelets (PLT) and leukocytes in the absence of any stimulus and extramedullary haematopoiesis. Although the aetiology of the disease has not been fully elucidated, the incidence is 5–17/million in the USA and Europe. PV is more frequently seen in people older than 60 years of age, but is extremely rare in people younger than 40 years of age. Although the incidence is similar in men and women, it is slightly higher in men. At the time of diagnosis, splenomegaly is found in 70% of patients and hepatomegaly in 30%. Therefore, PV patients usually have mild to moderate leucocytosis and thrombocytosis. Leucocytosis is found in 60% of patients with PV, and thrombocytosis in half of the patients. Serum EPO level is frequently low in PV. The V617F point mutation in exon 14 of JAK2 is present in 95% of patients with PV. Currently, the diagnostic criteria of the updated International Consensus Classification (ICC) are used for PV. The diagnostic criteria for PV require either all three major criteria or the first two major criteria and minor criteria to be met. These major criteria are as follows: HGB > 16.5 g/dL in men, > 16.0 g/dL in women; HCT > 49% in men, > 48% in women, bone marrow biopsy showing hypercellularity for age with trilineage enlargement (panmyelosis) including marked erythroid, granulocytic and megakaryocytic proliferation with pleomorphic, mature megakaryocytes (size differences) and presence of JAK2 V617F or JAK2 exon 12 mutation. Minor criteria are subnormal serum EPO level (normal range of EPO in adults: 4.1–19.5 mU/mL). Major criterion 2 (bone marrow biopsy) may not be necessary in cases with persistent absolute erythrocytosis (persistent absolute erythrocytosis is defined as HGB levels higher than 18.5 g/dL in men or 16.5 g/dL in women or HCT higher than 55.5% in men and 49.5% in women). Accordingly, three major criteria or the first two major criteria plus minor criteria must be present for the diagnosis of PV.

### Health supervision for children and adolescents with sickle cell disease: clinical report [^a26a06cb]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease — transient aplastic crisis is characterized by an exacerbation of baseline anemia with a substantially decreased reticulocyte count, typically to below 1%; recognition requires comparison of CBC and reticulocyte counts during illness with baseline values, red blood cell transfusions are often needed, human parvovirus B19 infection is the most common cause and is highly contagious with isolation of suspected cases from at-risk persons recommended, and contacts with SCD are at risk so a hemoglobin and reticulocyte count is checked.

### Levetiracetam oral (levetiracetam) [^d5d8b222]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.9 Hematologic Abnormalities

Levetiracetam can cause hematologic abnormalities. Hematologic abnormalities occurred in clinical trials and included decreases in white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, and red blood cell (RBC) counts; decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit; and increases in eosinophil counts. Cases of agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in the postmarketing setting. A complete blood count is recommended in patients experiencing significant weakness, pyrexia, recurrent infections, or coagulation disorders.

Partial-Onset Seizures

Adults

Minor, but statistically significant, decreases compared to placebo in total mean RBC count (0.03 × 10⁶/mm³), mean hemoglobin (0.09 g/dL), and mean hematocrit (0.38%), were seen in levetiracetam-treated patients in controlled trials.

A total of 3.2% of levetiracetam-treated and 1.8% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (≤ 2.8 × 10⁹/L) decreased WBC, and 2.4% of levetiracetam-treated and 1.4% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (≤ 1.0 × 10⁹/L) decreased neutrophil count. Of the levetiracetam-treated patients with a low neutrophil count, all but one rose towards or to baseline with continued treatment. No patient was discontinued secondary to low neutrophil counts.

### Increased risk of prediabetes among virally suppressed adults with HIV in central Kenya detected using glycated haemoglobin and fasting blood glucose [^53cf089f]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study limitations include the failure to use 75g‐OGTT test, the gold standard, as part of our algorithm for T2D diagnosis. We did not assess the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) in this population, who are likely to have macrocytosis, a factor that could interfere with HbA1c values. We relied on the last haemoglobin (Hb) assessed in the preceding 6 months and did not assess a current Hb to rule out anaemia. Both macrocytosis and current low haemoglobin would likely be associated with falsely low HbA1c levels. Our findings may therefore underestimate the prevalence of elevated HbA1c in this population.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^38764bc0]. KDIGO (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO anemia in chronic kidney disease — vitamin B12 and folate testing notes these are uncommon but treatable causes of anemia linked to macrocytosis and low red blood cell (RBC) indices, with limited data indicating the prevalence is ≤ 10% of hemodialysis patients and unknown in CKD. Because these deficiencies are easily correctable and vitamin B12 deficiency may signal other disease processes, assessment of folate and vitamin B12 levels are generally considered standard components of anemia evaluation, especially with macrocytosis. Folate deficiency is best detected with serum folate testing, and RBC folate can be measured when serum levels are equivocal or recent dietary intake may obscure deficiency using serum levels alone.

### From microcytosis to macrodiagnosis [^1e4da865]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

A 12-year-old Hispanic girl presented with fatigue, lightheadedness, and intermittent headaches. She was depressed and appeared pale to her mother. Her examination was unremarkable except for palpebral conjunctival pallor and was otherwise noncontributory. She had a profound hypoproliferative microcytic anemia with low iron level, low transferrin saturation, and a normal ferritin level. The patient experienced improvement in clinical symptoms following transfusion of packed red blood cells and oral iron therapy. At follow-up 2 months later, she presented with similar symptoms and persistent microcytic anemia with low iron levels. Her ferritin level was increased along with markedly elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. An oral iron challenge demonstrated lack of absorption, and hepcidin level was also significantly elevated. Thorough gastrointestinal and rheumatologic evaluations were performed to search for a source of inflammation. Key components of the patient's social history supplemented by serology, radiographic, and pathologic findings ultimately cinched an unexpected diagnosis.

4 DISCUSSION

This study showed that reduced RBC counts were associated with increased CV mortality in patients with HFmrEF after adjusting for covariates. However, there was little correlation between changes in RBC counts and the incidence of CV events in patients with HFmrEF.

Anemia is common in patients with HFrEF or HFpEF and is associated with a poorer long‐term prognosis. In a meta‐analysis involving more than 150 000 patients with HF from 33 studies, anemia doubled the risk of death. Compared with patients without anemia, those with anemia are older, more likely to be female, and more likely to have diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and severe HF with a worse functional status. In addition, patients with HF and anemia have several comorbidities, including CKD, malnutrition associated with cardiac cachexia, and a low albumin concentration, all of which may worsen the prognosis.

Furthermore, anemia and CKD often coexist in patients with HF. One study showed that although anemia doubled the risk of death in patients with HF, the adjusted risk of death was further increased by 1.5‐fold in the presence of CKD. The above‐mentioned studies and ours have demonstrated the association between HF and anemia. However, the difference is that unlike our study, previous studies failed to focus specifically on patients with HFmrEF. Our study demonstrates a relationship between RBC count and prognosis in patients with HFmrEF.

Severe anemia may progress to HF syndrome, which disappears when the anemia is corrected. The erythropoietin concentration increases in proportion to the severity of HF. The relationship between renal blood flow and erythropoietin secretion in patients with HF is complex and not fully understood. For many years, correction of anemia in patients with HF was thought to improve symptoms, quality of life, and clinical outcomes. However, research has shown that treating anemia with erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents does not improve clinical outcomes but is associated with higher rates of thromboembolic events. Correction of anemia with erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents in patients with CKD with or without HF is associated with increased adverse events (including death). Iron deficiency is also a significant cause of anemia. A meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing ferric carboxymaltose versus placebo showed that ferric carboxymaltose administration was associated with reduced mortality and HF hospitalization in iron‐deficient patients with HFrEF. Although the clinical benefit of intravenous iron in anemic patients with HF has been demonstrated, the long‐term (> 1 year) clinical benefit is uncertain.

### Evaluation and management of iron deficiency in children undergoing intestinal rehabilitation – A position paper from the NASPGHAN intestinal rehabilitation special interest group [^b12cbd53]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). High credibility.

Pediatric intestinal rehabilitation — iron status assessment and micronutrient evaluation includes the following guidance: Recommendation: Vitamin B12, zinc, and copper deficiency should be evaluated based on an anatomic risk and in children not responding to conventional treatment. In addition, Recommendation: While assessing iron status in children undergoing IR, we recommend categorizing children into 3 categories: 1. Children without ID; 2. Children with ID without anemia; and 3. Children with IDA. The text cautions that patients may have IDA, vitamin B12, and/or folate deficiency resulting in low normal mean corpuscular volume (MCV), that MCV can also be elevated in liver disease, making it an unreliable marker for iron deficiency (ID) assessment in children with IF-associated liver disease (IFALD), and that deficiencies of copper or zinc, or preexisting hemoglobinopathies can lead to microcytosis; caution should be taken in cases of suspected infection or inflammation (for example, central line-associated bloodstream infections, SBBO, and childhood viral infections).
