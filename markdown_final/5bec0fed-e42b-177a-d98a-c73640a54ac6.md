Management of bph

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial evaluation and how to confirm BPH while excluding mimics. Then, I should classify symptom severity and decide whether to observe or treat. Next, I will review first-line medical therapy, including alpha-blockers, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, and PDE5 inhibitors, and when to combine them. After that, I need to check indications for procedural or surgical therapy and how prostate size guides modality selection. Finally, I will consider special scenarios, follow-up and monitoring, and patient-centered care principles, making sure each step aligns with current AUA and EAU guidance and that I verify any claims against the cited evidence.

> Let me first confirm the core elements of the initial evaluation. I need to ensure we capture history, physical exam with digital rectal exam, IPSS, and urinalysis, and that I screen for red flags such as hematuria, recurrent UTIs, stones, or renal insufficiency that would push me toward expedited urologic evaluation or imaging, because these are foundational clinical principles in the AUA guidance and are echoed in primary care summaries of BPH workups [^112nihvL] [^116azxyn].

> Wait, let me verify the role of PSA and imaging in the initial workup. I initially thought PSA is mandatory for all patients, but hold on, I should correct that: PSA is not universally required at baseline; it is reasonable to obtain in men with a 10-year life expectancy to screen for prostate cancer and to help infer prostate size, yet guidelines frame PSA as optional rather than mandatory in the initial assessment, and imaging is not routine unless there are complications or procedural planning needs, so I should tailor these tests to risk, symptoms, and goals of care [^116hKygb].

> Next, I should review symptom classification and the decision to treat. Mild symptoms or those not bothersome warrant watchful waiting with education and lifestyle measures, whereas moderate-to-severe bothersome symptoms justify active treatment; I need to ensure I quantify bother and set expectations about goals of therapy, including symptom relief and prevention of progression, which the AUA and EAU consistently emphasize as patient-centered anchors for decisions [^113eFqzj] [^112nihvL].

> I will now examine first-line medical therapy. Alpha-1 blockers are appropriate first-line for most men with bothersome LUTS because they act on the dynamic component and provide rapid relief; tamsulosin is often preferred for lower blood pressure effects, and I should confirm that this aligns with both AUA and CUA positions, which it does [^112Gf7A7] [^113KWhdq]. Hold on, I should verify onset and durability: alpha-blockers work quickly, but benefits are maintained only while on therapy, so adherence and tolerability matter for sustained effect [^112Gf7A7].

> Let me consider 5-alpha reductase inhibitors next. I should confirm indications: 5-ARIs are for men with prostatic enlargement, typically operationalized as prostate volume greater than 30 g, PSA greater than 1.5 ng/mL, or palpable enlargement on DRE, and they reduce progression risk and future surgery or AUR; I need to counsel on delayed onset over months and sexual adverse effects, which the AUA explicitly recommends discussing before initiation [^1171gHwN] [^114FQQeN]. But wait, what if the prostate is small? In that scenario, 5-ARI monotherapy is less likely to help symptomatically, so I should avoid it unless the goal is disease modification in a clearly enlarged gland [^1171gHwN].

> I should double-check the role of PDE5 inhibitors. Tadalafil 5 mg daily is a reasonable option, particularly when erectile dysfunction coexists, though the magnitude of LUTS benefit is modest; I need to set expectations accordingly and consider it as monotherapy or in combination with alpha-blockers in selected patients, which is supported by AUA and EAU statements [^1155szG2] [^116axiqu].

> Now, combination therapy. I need to ensure I reserve alpha-blocker plus 5-ARI for men with moderate-to-severe symptoms and prostatic enlargement, because that is where the strongest evidence exists for added symptom control and disease modification; the CombAT trial shows earlier and greater symptom improvements with combination versus monotherapy, albeit with more adverse events, and both AUA and EAU endorse this approach in appropriately selected men [^116nE6c9] [^117CdENi] [^115vsMSx]. Hold on, I should verify whether we can stop the alpha-blocker after stabilization; withdrawal strategies are reasonable but not rigorously proven, so I should individualize and monitor closely if attempting withdrawal [^117VortW].

> For storage-predominant symptoms, I should review anticholinergics and beta-3 agonists. These can be added to an alpha-blocker when urgency, frequency, or nocturia persist despite addressing outlet obstruction, but I need to screen for cognitive risk with anticholinergics and counsel on modest benefits; AUA supports conditional recommendations for these combinations in selected patients [^114JU6PB] [^1155szG2]. Let me reconsider nocturia specifically: it is often multifactorial, so I should evaluate for sleep apnea, fluid management, and other contributors before escalating therapy [^113qdfqY].

> Next, I should review when to move beyond medications. Indications for procedural or surgical therapy include complications such as renal insufficiency from BPH, refractory retention, recurrent UTIs, stones, or gross hematuria, as well as failure or intolerance of medical therapy or patient preference to avoid lifelong medications; I need to ensure I document these clearly and discuss retreatment risks, since failure and secondary procedures can occur across modalities [^116azxyn] [^112g6HTM].

> I need to check how prostate size guides procedural choice. For small to average prostates, TURP remains the historical reference standard, while bipolar TURP and laser options like HoLEP or PVP offer comparable efficacy with different risk profiles; for larger glands, simple prostatectomy or enucleation techniques are favored, and in higher bleeding risk patients, laser vaporization or enucleation reduces transfusion risk; device therapies such as UroLift or Rezum have size and morphology constraints and should be matched carefully to anatomy [^117Uwq2F] [^112FZJCJ] [^116Y571o]. Hold on, I should verify that these size-based considerations are guideline-endorsed; yes, contemporary AUA guidance explicitly incorporates size and morphology into procedural selection [^113yRCDx].

> Let me think about special scenarios. Acute urinary retention warrants alpha-blocker initiation and a trial of catheter removal, with 5-ARI added if the prostate is enlarged to reduce recurrence risk; I should confirm that this is supported, and indeed CUA recommends offering alpha-blockers during catheterization for retention [^111Pgp2v]. For men on anticoagulation or with high bleeding risk, I should prioritize laser vaporization or enucleation over traditional TURP to mitigate bleeding, which is consistent with AUA expert opinion [^112FZJCJ]. If prostate cancer is present or suspected, I should coordinate BPH therapy with oncology and consider how procedures affect cancer surveillance or treatment plans, underscoring multidisciplinary decision-making [^116uyoiX].

> I should confirm follow-up cadence and monitoring. After initiating therapy, reassess in 4 to 12 weeks with IPSS and a global assessment, and at each visit thereafter; if there is inadequate response or intolerable effects, I should reconsider the diagnosis, assess adherence, and consider urodynamics or imaging to distinguish obstruction from detrusor dysfunction, adjusting therapy accordingly [^112yNbsR] [^112Gf7A7]. Hold on, I should verify that IPSS changes correlate with patient-reported improvement; yes, a 3-point IPSS reduction generally corresponds to slight improvement, which helps align objective scores with patient goals [^113FdNL1].

> Finally, I need to ensure shared decision-making and patient-centered care are explicit. I should discuss benefits, risks, costs, and preferences for each option, including the possibility of retreatment and long-term medication effects, and I should address sexual function proactively because treatments and the disease itself can impact it; aligning choices with patient values improves adherence and satisfaction, which is repeatedly emphasized in contemporary guidelines and reviews [^112V3VaY] [^116QufvG]. Let me reconsider disparities and access as well: acknowledging variation in care and implementing equitable, culturally competent counseling is essential to close gaps in outcomes, a point highlighted in recent AUA equity-focused commentary [^116sJpFy].

---

The management of BPH centers on **shared decision-making** [^112V3VaY] and a **stepwise approach** [^112P9cEV] that matches therapy to symptom severity, prostate size, and patient preferences. Start with **lifestyle measures** for mild symptoms [^113eFqzj]; use **alpha-blockers** for moderate-to-severe symptoms [^116VJAZ4], adding a 5-ARI if the prostate is enlarged (≥ 30 mL) [^1171gHwN] or progression risk is high [^115vsMSx]. Consider PDE5 inhibitors when erectile dysfunction coexists [^116axiqu] [^114YNZLf], and reserve surgery for refractory cases or complications [^116azxyn]. Monitor with IPSS [^112yNbsR] and adjust therapy based on response and side effects [^112Gf7A7].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A thorough diagnostic evaluation is essential to confirm BPH and exclude other causes of LUTS [^112nihvL]:

- **History and physical examination**: Assess symptom severity, impact on quality of life, and perform a digital rectal exam (DRE) to estimate prostate size [^112nihvL].

- **International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)**: Quantifies symptom severity and guides treatment decisions [^112nihvL].

- **Urinalysis**: Screens for infection or hematuria [^112nihvL].

- **Serum PSA**: Consider in men with a 10-year life expectancy to assess for prostate cancer and estimate prostate volume [^115ywDbp].

- **Uroflowmetry and post-void residual (PVR)**: Optional tests to assess obstruction and retention [^116WaV8z].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management is appropriate for patients with mild symptoms or minimal bother [^113eFqzj]:

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Limit evening fluids, reduce caffeine/alcohol, avoid constipation, and maintain a healthy weight [^115sAeu6].

- **Behavioral therapies**: Bladder training, pelvic floor exercises, and timed voiding [^115sAeu6].

- **Watchful waiting**: Regular monitoring with IPSS and reassessment if symptoms progress [^113eFqzj].

---

## Medical management

Medical therapy is the cornerstone for moderate-to-severe LUTS [^116VJAZ4]:

| **Medication class** | **Indication** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Alpha-blockers (tamsulosin, alfuzosin, silodosin) | First-line for moderate-to-severe symptoms | Relax smooth muscle, reduce resistance | Rapid onset; side effects include dizziness, ejaculatory dysfunction [^notfound] |
| 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (finasteride, dutasteride) | Enlarged prostate (≥ 30 mL) or high progression risk | Shrink prostate, reduce DHT | Slow onset (6–12 months); sexual side effects, reduced PSA [^115m2bqC] [^114FQQeN] |
| Combination therapy (alpha-blocker + 5-ARI) | Moderate-to-severe symptoms with enlarged prostate | Dual mechanism | Superior to monotherapy for symptom reduction and progression prevention [^116nE6c9] |
| PDE5 inhibitors (tadalafil) | Coexisting erectile dysfunction | Relax smooth muscle, improve flow | Modest LUTS benefit; headache, dyspepsia [^116axiqu] |
| Anticholinergics (solifenacin, tolterodine) | Storage-predominant symptoms | Reduce detrusor contractions | Dry mouth, constipation, cognitive effects [^notfound] |
| Beta-3 agonists (mirabegron) | Storage symptoms | Relax detrusor | Hypertension, urinary retention risk [^notfound] |

---

## Surgical and minimally invasive options

Surgery is indicated for **refractory symptoms**, **complications**, or **patient preference** [^116azxyn]:

- **Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)**: Gold standard for prostates 30–80 mL [^117Uwq2F].

- **Holmium laser enucleation (HoLEP)**: Effective for large prostates (> 80 mL) and low bleeding risk [^notfound].

- **Photoselective vaporization (PVP)**: Suitable for high bleeding risk patients [^112FZJCJ].

- **Minimally invasive options**: Prostatic urethral lift (UroLift), water vapor therapy (Rezum), and temporary implantable devices for select patients [^111wfGE9].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is essential to assess efficacy and tolerability [^112yNbsR]. Use **IPSS at each visit** [^112yNbsR] and reassess at 4–12 weeks after starting or changing therapy [^notfound]. Adjust treatment based on response, side effects, and patient preference [^115XAkZu].

---

## Patient education and shared decision-making

Patient education and shared decision-making are critical to align treatment with patient goals and improve adherence [^112V3VaY]. Discuss **benefits, risks, and alternatives**, including potential side effects and the need for ongoing therapy or retreatment [^112g6HTM].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Emerging therapies include **novel pharmacologic agents**, **improved minimally invasive devices**, and **personalized medicine approaches** [^112c5Q2j]. Research focuses on **durability**, **cost-effectiveness**, and **patient-reported outcomes** [^114o92i1].

---

Effective BPH management requires a **stepwise, patient-centered approach** [^112P9cEV] that balances symptom control, progression prevention, and quality of life. Regular monitoring and shared decision-making ensure optimal outcomes [^112V3VaY].

### Update on AUA guideline on the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^114qQbtX]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To revise the 2003 version of the American Urological Association's (AUA) Guideline on the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

Materials and Methods

From MEDLINE® searches of English language publications (January 1999 through February 2008) using relevant MeSH terms, articles concerning the management of the index patient, a male ≥ 45 years of age who is consulting a healthcare provider for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were identified. Qualitative analysis of the evidence was performed. Selected studies were stratified by design, comparator, follow-up interval, and intensity of intervention, and meta-analyses (quantitative synthesis) of outcomes of randomized controlled trials were planned. Guideline statements were drafted by an appointed expert Panel based on the evidence.

Results

The studies varied as to patient selection; randomization; blinding mechanism; run-in periods; patient demographics, comorbidities, prostate characteristics and symptoms; drug doses; other intervention characteristics; comparators; rigor and intervals of follow-up; trial duration and timing; suspected lack of applicability to current US practice; and techniques of outcomes measurement. These variations affected the quality of the evidence reviewed making formal meta-analysis impractical or futile. Instead, the Panel and extractors reviewed the data in a systematic fashion and without statistical rigor. Diagnosis and treatment algorithms were adopted from the 2005 International Consultation of Urologic Diseases. Guideline statements concerning pharmacotherapies, watchful waiting, surgical options and minimally invasive procedures were either updated or newly drafted, peer reviewed and approved by AUA Board of Directors.

Conclusions

New pharmacotherapies and technologies have emerged which have impacted treatment algorithms. The management of LUTS/BPH continues to evolve.

### The progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia: examining the evidence and determining the risk [^113F8Bod]. European Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is often associated with enlargement of the prostate gland, lower urinary tract symptoms, decreased urinary flow and a reduced quality of life. Furthermore, if the symptoms associated with BPH are left untreated, serious complications, such as acute urinary retention, may ensue. Evidence is emerging from long-term clinical studies to suggest that BPH is a progressive disease, with some patients progressing much more rapidly than others.

Objective

This article aims to explore the natural history of BPH progression from a molecular, pathological and clinical perspective, with emphasis on the key clinical evidence to support the progressive nature of this disease. How our increased understanding of the disease and of the risk factors for BPH progression might be applied to improve current management practices are also discussed.

Conclusion

Strategies to identify patients most at risk and guidelines directed towards long-term management, in addition to short-term treatment, may be useful in helping to prevent BPH progression.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia: AUA GUIDELINE PART I-initial work-up and medical management [^112P9cEV]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a histologic diagnosis describing proliferation of smooth muscle and epithelial cells within the prostatic transition zone. The prevalence and severity of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in aging men are progressive and impact the health and welfare of society. This revised Guideline provides a useful reference on effective evidence-based management of male LUTS/BPH. See the accompanying algorithm for a summary of the procedures detailed in the Guideline (figures 1 and 2[Figure: see text] [Figure: see text]).

Materials and Methods

The Minnesota Evidence Review Team searched Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and AHRQ databases to identify eligible English language studies published between January 2008 and April 2019, then updated through December 2020. Search terms included Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and keywords for pharmacological therapies, drug classes, and terms related to LUTS or BPH. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low) for support of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In the absence of sufficient evidence, information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions (table 1[Table: see text]).

Results

Nineteen guideline statements pertinent to evaluation, work-up, and medical management were developed. Appropriate levels of evidence and supporting text were created to direct both primary care and urologic providers towards streamlined and suitable practices.

Conclusions

The work up and medical management of BPH requires attention to individual patient characteristics, while also respecting common principles. Clinicians should adhere to recommendations and familiarize themselves with standards of BPH management.

### Surgical management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia: AUA guideline amendment 2019 [^116Ahkza]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is common in men and can have negative effects on quality of life (QoL). It is the hope that this Guideline becomes a reference for effective evidence-based surgical management of LUTS/BPH.

Materials and Methods

The evidence team searched Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality database to identify studies indexed between January 2007-September 2017. Following initial publication, this guideline was amended in 2019 and reflects relevant literature published through January 2019. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low) for support of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In the absence of sufficient evidence, additional information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions (table 1 in supplementary unabridged guideline, https://www.jurology.com).

Results

This Guideline provides evidence-based recommendations regarding management of LUTS/BPH utilizing surgery and minimally invasive surgical therapies (MIST). Additional statements are made regarding diagnostic and pre-operative tests. Clinical statements are made in comparison to what is generally accepted as the gold standard (i.e. transurethral resection of the prostate [TURP] monopolar and/or bipolar). This guideline is designed to be used in conjunction with the associated treatment algorithm (see figure) [Figure: see text]Conclusions:The prevalence and the severity of LUTS increases as men age and is an important diagnosis in the healthcare of patients and the welfare of society. This document will undergo updating as knowledge regarding treatments and future surgical options continues to expand.

### EAU guidelines on benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) [^116WaV8z]. European Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To establish guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of BPH.

Methods

A search of published work was conducted using Medline. In combination with expert opinions recommendations were made on the usefulness of tests for assessment and follow-up: mandatory, recommended, or optional. In addition, indications and outcomes for the different therapeutic options were reviewed.

Results

A digital rectal examination is mandatory in the assessment for the diagnosis of BPH. Recommended tests are the International Prostate Symptom Score, creatinine measurement (or renal ultrasound), uroflowmetry, and postvoid residual urine volume. All other tests are optional. The aim of treatment is to improve patients' quality of life, and it depends on the severity of the symptoms of BPH. The watchful waiting policy is recommended for patients with mild symptoms, medical treatment for patients with mild-moderate symptoms, and surgery for patients who failed medication or conservative management and who have moderate-severe symptoms, and/or complications of BPH which require surgery. Regarding non-surgical treatments, transurethral microwave thermotherapy is the most attractive option. These treatments should be reserved for patients who prefer to avoid surgery or who no longer respond favourably to medication. Finally, recommendations for follow-up tests and a recommended follow-up time schedule after BPH treatment are provided.

Conclusions

Recommendations for assessment, possible therapeutic options, and follow-up of patients with BPH are made.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^112nihvL]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) evaluation — initial assessment: In patients with bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) possibly attributed to BPH, clinicians should obtain a medical history, conduct a physical examination, utilize the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), and perform a urinalysis (Clinical Principle). Patients should be counseled on options for intervention, which can include behavioral/lifestyle modifications, medical therapy and/or referral for discussion of procedural options (Expert Opinion).

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^114o92i1]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) treatment evaluation and definitions emphasize that studies of comparative efficacy of behavioral and lifestyle intervention versus medical treatment, medical therapies versus MISTs, and surgical treatments compared to each other are lacking, and models for improvement could include population science, registries, and analysis of electronic medical records and insurance databases. A better definition of potential long-term complications of medical therapy needs to be delineated to enhance both prescriber and patient choice, and the ability to use a calculator with patient parameters to obtain a treatment algorithm or set of appropriate options could streamline approaches and care. MIST and surgical therapies for BPH require a different regulatory process where only patients who remain in follow-up are seen, while with medical therapy patients remain in the care of their providers as therapy is ongoing and prescription renewals are necessary; this variance in patient interaction can lead to different definitions and criteria for treatment failure and in tracking of rates of retreatment. More data are needed, and a proposed evidence-based classification system for guiding patient care, reimbursement practices, and research outcomes assessment that is applicable across a variety of surgical treatments is of critical importance.

### Common questions about the diagnosis and management of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^115ywDbp]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common condition that increases in prevalence with age. A history should include onset, duration, and severity of lower urinary tract symptoms and medication use to rule out other causes of symptoms. Physical examination includes a digital rectal examination and assessment for bladder distention or neurologic impairment. Recommended tests include serum prostate-specific antigen measurement and urinalysis to help identify infection, genitourinary cancer, or calculi as an alternative cause of lower urinary tract symptoms. BPH severity is assessed using validated, self-administered symptom questionnaires such as the American Urological Association Symptom Index or International Prostate Symptom Score. Mild or nonbothersome symptoms do not require treatment. Bothersome symptoms are managed with lifestyle modifications, medications, and surgery. Alpha blockers are first-line medications for BPH. Surgical referral is indicated if BPH-related complications develop, medical therapy fails, or the patient chooses it. Dietary supplements, such as saw palmetto, pygeum, cernilton, and beta sitosterols, and acupuncture are not recommended for the management of BPH.

### Recent developments in guidelines on benign prostatic hyperplasia [^114hWYUz]. Current Opinion in Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Guidelines within the healthcare system aim to rationalize the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of a particular disease and can be applicable on an international scale or may be country specific. Specialists, who determine the clinical evidence for individual practices, prepare these guidelines, and the strength of these recommendations depends on available evidence. The assessment of patients includes a minimal number of non-invasive tests. Only in cases of abnormalities are additional (more invasive) tests recommended. Treatment decisions should be evidence-based but, despite guidelines, the choice of treatment is often highly dependent on the personal preference of the urologist. Patients' awareness of different treatment options and their involvement in choosing a treatment is also increasing. Economical aspects are becoming more and more important in making healthcare decisions. Data on durability of treatments, however, are limited and deserve special attention in order to provide the most cost-effective care for different patient groups.

### Benign prostatic hyperplasia in primary care: what you need to know [^111Tca3G]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

We reviewed recent literature and treatment guidelines regarding the prevalence, pathophysiology, and management of BPO related to BPH; and management of lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to BPH.

Materials and Methods

Published literature and current treatment concepts were reviewed regarding the diagnosis and treatment options for BPO.

Results

BPH is a histological diagnosis that can contribute to medical problems, including enlargement of the prostate and BPO. These conditions should be treated only if the symptoms are troublesome, there is considerable risk of progression, and/or cancer is suspected. Very effective medical and surgical options are available to treat BPO and improve patient quality of life.

Conclusions

BPO is highly treatable, but should be managed in close collaboration with the patient. Pharmacological agents and minimally invasive procedures, when appropriate, are generally preferred to more invasive surgery. Patients with mild or moderate symptoms usually can be treated by a primary care physician; more complicated cases should be referred to a urologist for evaluation and management.

### Clinical approach to the prostate: an update [^113ycssx]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Prostatic disease continues to present clinicians with challenges. Although giant strides have been made in the medical and surgical management of benign prostatic hyperplasia, many fundamental questions about its pathogenesis, progression, and treatment efficacy remain unanswered. Prostate cancer also continues to be an area in which progress is needed despite major recent advancements. Numerous debates that include the value of prostate-specific antigen screening and appropriate roles for each of the numerous therapeutic modalities await resolution. For millions of patients who suffer from prostatitis, a major breakthrough is yet to come. Current treatment regimens for prostatitis remain ineffective at best. Contemporary approaches to the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate cancer, and prostatitis are discussed in this review.

### How would you manage this patient with benign prostatic hyperplasia? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^116pYjr5]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are common in older patients assigned male sex at birth, regardless of gender identity, and treatment of these symptoms is therefore common in primary care practice. In 2021, the American Urological Association published guidelines for management of BPH. They recommend using a standardized scoring system such as the International Prostate Symptom Score to help establish a diagnosis and to monitor the efficacy of interventions, α-blockers as the first-choice pharmacotherapy option, and 5α-reductase inhibitors for patients with prostate size estimated to be at least 30 cc. Tadalafil is another option regardless of erectile dysfunction. Combination therapies with α-blockers and 5α-reductase inhibitors, anticholinergic agents, or β 3 -agonists are effective options. A surgical referral is warranted if the BPH results in chronic kidney disease, refractory urinary retention, or recurrent urinary tract infections; if there is concern for bladder or prostate cancer; or if symptoms do not respond to medical therapy. In this article, a general internal medicine physician and a urologist discuss the treatment options and how they would apply their recommendations to a patient who wishes to learn more about his options.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) purpose and clinical framing — BPH is described as a histologic diagnosis involving proliferation of smooth muscle and epithelial cells within the prostatic transition zone, and management of bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) should recognize the complex dynamics of the bladder, bladder neck, prostate, and urethra; although medical therapy is often first line, there remain clinical scenarios where surgery is indicated as the initial intervention and should be recommended when other comorbidities do not preclude this approach.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia: AUA GUIDELINE PART II-surgical evaluation and treatment [^112XSMDa]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Surgical therapies for symptomatic bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are many, and vary from minimally invasive office based to high-cost operative approaches. This Guideline presents effective evidence-based surgical management of male lower urinary tract symptoms secondary/attributed to BPH (LUTS/BPH). See accompanying algorithm for a detailed summary of procedures (figure[Figure: see text]).

Materials/Methods

The Minnesota Evidence Review Team searched Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and AHRQ databases to identify eligible studies published between January 2007 and September 2020, which includes the initial publication (2018) and amendments (2019, 2020). The Team also reviewed articles identified by Guideline Panel Members. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low) for support of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In the absence of sufficient evidence, information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions (table[Table: see text]).

Results

Twenty-four guideline statements pertinent to pre-operative and surgical management were developed. Appropriate levels of evidence and supporting text were created to direct urologic providers towards suitable and safe operative interventions for individual patient characteristics. A re-treatment section was created to direct attention to longevity and outcomes with individual approaches to help guide patient counselling and therapeutic decisions.

Conclusion

Pre-operative and surgical management of BPH requires attention to individual patient characteristics and procedural risk. Clinicians should adhere to recommendations and familiarize themselves with criteria that yields the highest likelihood of surgical success when choosing a particular approach for a particular patient.

### Evidence-based guidelines in lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia and variation in care [^114APAPc]. Current Opinion in Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Guidelines have been developed to assist physicians in the diagnosis and management of patients with lower urinary tract symptoms. These guidelines vary in the level of evidence used and the strength of their recommendations. With variations in guidelines, multiple variations in clinical practice may also been seen.

Recent Findings

Although examinations of physician compliance with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) guidelines date back to the 1980s, researchers have become more interested in closer examination of guideline compliance. Furthermore, guidelines themselves are becoming more robust documents, with the American Urological Association and European Association of Urology guidelines updated in 2014 and 2015, respectively. This review examines both the evidence base behind these BPH guidelines and the variations in clinical care related to the guidelines.

Summary

Despite over 40 years of study, variations continue to occur in the work up and treatment of men with BPH. With the proliferation of medications and surgical procedures available for symptomatic lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to BPH, we will continue to see this variation in care. Our current guidelines can help mitigate this variation by providing a baseline set of assessments and algorithms for routine patients. However, only through continued refinement will the guidelines meet their full potential. The prior review shows how the evidence base is limited for the diagnostic work up for LUTS, provides limited information on comparative effectiveness of therapies in LUTS and BPH, and has not led to consistency between guidelines.

### Managing patients with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^115cwx6k]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Many men with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia can be managed safely and effectively by primary care providers. After a basic evaluation to exclude other diseases that may cause lower urinary tract symptoms, quantifying the degree of symptoms and bother, and perhaps making an assessment of prostate size, the primary care provider can determine which men require immediate evaluation by a urologist and which men may choose among various treatment options, including watchful waiting and various single agent or combination medication strategies. Recent information about risk factors for disease progression has also helped to inform patient decisions on which treatment option is best for the individual patient. The purpose of this review is to provide primary care providers with an approach to the management of men with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

### Watchful waiting in benign prostatic hyperplasia [^111tVsSe]. Current Opinion in Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Watchful waiting is a well known approach to the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). In recent years, several large longitudinal studies have published their findings on the natural history of BPH. In addition, several other studies reporting the outcomes of patients randomized to medical treatment versus placebo have been used to extrapolate patients who are at low risk for progression.

Recent Findings

Both longitudinal studies and randomized placebo-controlled trials have confirmed the progressive nature of BPH, with symptom progression being the most common manifestation. Variables such as baseline prostate-specific antigen, prostate volume, symptom score and bother score, decreased flow rate, and increased postvoid residual have all been linked to progression to acute urinary retention and need for surgery.

Summary

Historically, not much has been known about the natural history of BPH and thus, who would be a good candidate for watchful waiting. In this review, we discuss the natural history of BPH and the outcomes of affected patients managed with watchful waiting, as well as variables predictive of progression.

AUA nomenclature — statement types and evidence strength define how recommendations are framed: Strong Recommendations are directive statements that an action should or should not be undertaken because net benefit or net harm is substantial; Moderate Recommendations are directive statements that an action should or should not be undertaken because net benefit or net harm is moderate; and Conditional Recommendations are non-directive statements used when the evidence indicates there is no apparent net benefit or harm or when the balance between benefits and risks/burdens is unclear. Body of evidence strength Grade A in support of a Strong or Moderate Recommendation indicates the statement can be applied to most patients in most circumstances and that future research is unlikely to change confidence; Grade B indicates the statement can be applied to most patients in most circumstances, but better evidence could change confidence; and Grade C indicates the statement can be applied to most patients in most circumstances, but better evidence is likely to change confidence. Where gaps in the evidence exist, Clinical Principles or Expert Opinions are provided via consensus of the Panel, where a Clinical Principle is a statement about a component of clinical care widely agreed upon by urologists or other clinicians for which there may or may not be evidence in the medical literature, and Expert Opinion refers to a statement based on members' clinical training, experience, knowledge, and judgment for which there may or may not be evidence in the medical literature.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) initial medical therapy — trial duration and next-step evaluation are specified as follows: "An initial trial of medical management over 4 weeks with an alpha blocker or PDE5, and over 6–12 months with a 5-ARI is reasonable in men with bothersome LUTS". "Referral to a specialist is recommended for men who either do not improve with medical management, or have symptomatic improvement but intolerable medication-related side effects". If "initial medical management does not lead to symptomatic improvement", clinicians should consider "performance of studies, such as urodynamics, to confirm BOO versus DO", noting that "Understanding the contribution of DO versus BOO can aid in patient counseling and in the selection of additional medication options". In men "with LUTS predominantly due to BPH", "procedural or surgical options may be considered", whereas in "complicated LUTS… additional medication classes should be considered along with procedural options".

### Clinical commentary… [^111f9JXN]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What is the best medical therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia. Evidence-Based Answer Although alpha blockers and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors each reduce BPH symptoms more than placebo, alpha blockers are more effective than 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. Phytotherapy has potential but unproven benefit in BPH. However, these small improvements in symptom scores are unlikely to be clinically meaningful. This trial also examined combinations of therapy. Although doxazosin and finasteride were each more effective than placebo in preventing the progression of BPH at four years, the combination of doxazosin and finasteride was superior to either alone.
5.

Recommendations from Others The AUA recommends treatment of BPH based on the severity of lower urinary tract symptoms using the AUA symptom index. 11 Men with mild symptoms or with moderate to severe symptoms without bother can be managed with watchful waiting and yearly follow-up. Men with moderate to severe symptoms and with bother can be treated with medication; those who do not have complications of BPH can be treated with watchful waiting. Alpha blockers are recommended as first-line treatment for BPH, except for prazosin and phenoxybenzamine, which lack data to support their use and, therefore, are not recommended. The 5-alpha reductase inhibitors are only recommended in men with documented prostate enlargement.

There is panel consensus that combination treatment with alpha blockers and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors is also appropriate for BPH. Clinical Commentary Patient preference should guide BPH treatment. Men who are not inconvenienced by symptoms of BPH often accept no treatment. Because of the increasing popularity of "natural" treatment, many men will opt for phytotherapy because of its perceived potential benefit and little risk of harm. Saw palmetto is sold over-the-counter and, thus, is very accessible.

### Comparative assessment of attitudes and expectations: Iranian patients versus urologists in the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^115T4zLA]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is characterized by the non-malignant enlargement of the prostate gland, primarily resulting from unregulated hyperplastic growth in the periurethral and transition zones of the prostate. Histopathological investigations have demonstrated that approximately 50% of men in their sixth decade exhibit pathological features consistent with BPH. This benign prostatic enlargement frequently manifests as lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), significantly impacting the affected individuals' quality of life. Symptoms commonly associated with BPH include nocturia, reduced urinary flow, increased urinary frequency, post-void dribbling, urgency, and incomplete voiding. Importantly, the prevalence of BPH-related urinary symptoms tends to escalate with advancing age. Studies have indicated that LUTS attributed to BPH affect roughly 50% of men aged 60 and older, and approximately 80% of men aged 80 and older.

The severity of symptoms and their perceived impact on patients' well-being are pivotal considerations in treatment decisions, often assessed using tools such as the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and Quality of Life (QoL) score. Based on the severity of LUTS, patient preference, and physician opinion, treatment modalities for BPH encompass a spectrum ranging from lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions to surgical procedures, comprising approximately 13 distinct methods. Physician selection of treatment modality for individual patients is multifaceted and contingent upon various factors, including anticipated outcomes.

To optimize treatment outcomes and align with patient expectations, a comprehensive understanding of treatment advantages and disadvantages is essential, along with an awareness of patients' primary concerns. The utilization of pharmacological interventions for mitigating severe symptoms remains restricted, with medications predominantly prescribed for managing mild to moderate LUTS. Surgical modalities are generally regarded as more appropriate for addressing severe urinary symptoms and enhancing the quality of life among patients diagnosed with BPH. However, patient reluctance towards surgery due to potential perioperative and postoperative complications requiring additional interventions is not uncommon. Patient preference significantly influences treatment selection, with patient knowledge about the disease, attitudes towards BPH, disease progression, and treatment options all influencing decision-making and treatment expectations. Prior research has delineated differences in attitudes towards BPH and its treatment between patients and urologists.

This study aims to assess the level of knowledge, expectations, and treatment preferences among Iranian patients diagnosed with BPH. Furthermore, it seeks to compare the attitudes of Iranian patients with BPH to those of urologists, with a focus on evaluating urologists' concerns and expectations regarding BPH management and their treatment approaches. By elucidating patients' attitudes and expectations, this study endeavors to inform more effective treatment strategies for BPH.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patient counseling — patients should be counseled on options for intervention, which can include behavioral/lifestyle modifications, medical therapy and/or referral for discussion of procedural options (Expert Opinion). Lifestyle and behavioral interventions are reasonable first-line treatments for all patients, with straightforward interventions including limiting intake of fluids prior to bedtime or travel, mild diuretics such as caffeine and alcohol, and bladder irritants such as highly seasoned or irritative foods; other interventions include avoiding constipation, increasing physical activity, weight loss, Kegel exercises at time of urinary urgency, timed voiding regimens, and double-voiding techniques. Pelvic floor muscle training, including biofeedback, may be helpful for patients with urgency and storage symptoms, and offering referral to a specialist without a trial of medication is reasonable.

Patient-centered approaches to improve adherence and compliance in BPH medical management are stressed, noting that while medications are the mainstay, there is wide variability among prescribers in treatment choice. Appropriate and patient-centered therapeutic strategies continue to lag behind evidence-based medicine, which has led to poor adherence and compliance with various therapies. Contributing factors include insurance coverage, type of medication, side effects, cost, and availability of information technology, and managing patient expectations is variable among prescribers. Use of technology, improved informatics, and coalescence of treatment strategies are presented as opportunities to improve both short- and long-term safety and efficacy with medications and to provide more uniform approaches to treatment success and failure and gateways to minimally-invasive and surgical therapies.

### Translation of benign prostatic hyperplasia guidelines into clinical practice [^113hBjVu]. Current Opinion in Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this article is to describe the current position of clinical practice guidelines for benign prostatic hyperplasia in daily management and identify the potential barriers that may hinder the implementation of guidelines into clinical practice.

Recent Findings

Recent studies have attempted to compare and grade benign prostatic hyperplasia clinical practice guidelines using appraisal instruments underlining the issues of quality and updates of guidelines. Surveys have evaluated the adoption of guidelines from the urological community and recent studies have made major contributions to our knowledge of the translation of evidence to daily practice.

Summary

Numerous clinical practice guidelines (both national and international) for benign prostatic hyperplasia exist. High methodological quality clinical practice guidelines are likely to be the most beneficial to patients and strength of recommendations depends on available evidence. Efforts to implement guidelines are not always successful and a considerable variation especially in diagnostic assessment of benign prostatic hyperplasia has been reported. Difficulties in translation of benign prostatic hyperplasia guidelines into clinical practice are related to lack of knowledge but also to differences in routine practices, beliefs, cost, availability, and reimbursement policy. Bridging the implementation gap represents a challenging task for clinical practice guideline supporters.

### Real life practice in the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^111Y9Asj]. Current Opinion in Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the current diagnostic and treatment options of lower urinary tract symptom due to benign prostatic hyperplasia and to put data from real life practice into perspective.

Recent Findings

The overall incidence rate of lower urinary tract symptom/benign prostatic hyperplasia was found at 15 per 1000 man-years (95% CI 14.8–16.1). The incidence increases with age from 3/1000 man-years at 45–49 years to 38/1000 man-years at 75–79 years. Recent diagnostic studies include the use of PSA to estimate prostate volume and its predictive value for the long-term risk of prostate enlargement. Variability of the International Prostate Symptom Score when filled at home and in the hospital is discussed. The first-line treatment option remains medical therapy. The most prescribed alpha-blockers are terazosin, alfuzosin, and tamsulosin, which are comparable in efficacy. The efficacy of finasteride is also confirmed, especially for enlarged prostates with the possibility of volume reduction up to 30%. Interventional therapy begins when there is evidence of moderate to severe symptoms. Long term results put transurethral microwave thermotherapy in advantage over other minimally invasive modalities. Surgical treatment remains the procedure with the best results. Open prostatectomy is still indicated for severely enlarged prostates. Transurethral resection for medium-sized prostates and bladder-neck incision for small prostates also remain the best option.

Summary

Real life practice studies in the last few years have broadened our insight into the application of different diagnostic and treatment modalities. Since results from randomized controlled trials can not always be extrapolated to daily urological practice, real life practice studies made data available to complement data from randomized controlled trials.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) — nocturia burden and evaluation are emphasized as follows: The most prevalent and bothersome symptom of the LUTS is nocturia, which is also associated with increases in overall mortality. The differential diagnosis of increased nighttime urination frequency/volumes and the role of sleep apnea are highlighted as important, and nocturia is often multifactorial in origin and symptomatic of other medical problems, further complicating effective management. Due to the considerable burden of nocturia on quality of life (QoL) and a lack of effective management options, more funded research is needed, and nocturia, whether global, reduced bladder capacity, or mixed, is described as a unique symptom complex requiring special concern and judicious evaluation.

### Comparative assessment of attitudes and expectations: Iranian patients versus urologists in the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^113iHA89]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study enhances our understanding of patients' attitudes and concerns about BPH. It provides a comparative analysis of the attitudes of urologists and patients by evaluating the treatment approaches of urologists when dealing with BPH. Gaining insights into the concerns, expectations, and preferences of patients with BPH is crucial for more effective disease management.

Our findings reveal a significant lack of knowledge about BPH among patients across various educational levels and age groups within our community. This highlights the need for the health and treatment system to increase public awareness about BPH, which can facilitate timely referrals at the onset of the disease and help prevent potential complications. Additionally, urologists' efforts in thoroughly explaining the various aspects of the disease can alleviate patients' concerns, align their expectations, and assist them in selecting appropriate treatment options.

Clinicians treat the symptoms associated with BPH on a daily basis. Although BPH is nearly universal with age, not all men develop lower urinary tract symptoms. Over the past 100 years, several notable advances in the field of urology have not only improved our understanding of the aetiology and natural history of this common disease, but have also facilitated the development of therapeutics to effectively manage BPH-related symptoms. The high quality of modern-day diagnosis, as well as medical and surgical treatment for BPH, is a testimony to centuries of observation and decades of scientific research.

BPH retreatment definitions and reporting — Thresholds for and types of retreatments will vary substantially by provider, patient, failure category, and initial treatment modality, and older trials do not consistently report retreatment with medical therapy; the difficulty of accurately recording initiation and duration of medical therapy precludes routine assessment and may lead to underreporting relative to minimally invasive and surgical retreatments. Across trials, definitions of retreatment or treatment failure have varied considerably, the FDA has not issued a standardized definition of retreatment or requires reporting of retreatment in clinical trials, and development of an evidence-based and universally employed classification system would provide transparent evidence of retreatment risk.

### American Urological Association and European Association of Urology guidelines in the management of benign prostatic hypertrophy: revisited [^112LbK3K]. Current Opinion in Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to provide a complete revision of two of the most widely used clinical guidelines in the management of lower urinary tract symptoms induced by benign prostatic hyperplasia and their importance and compliance among urologists.

Recent Findings

Updates of the American Association of Urology and European Association of Urology clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) were reviewed and analyzed. Literature concerning compliance and application of these two CPGs in the different working scenarios of practicing has been evaluated.

Summary

Urology has moved to an era in which costs and quality of care are being scrutinized, and compliance to CPGs will be assessed. Practicing urologists do not have the time to keep up to date with the continuous incoming literature and CPGs are a great tool to give the highest quality of care to our patients.

### Benign prostate hyperplasia: a review of the year's progress from bench to clinic [^111Muqx8]. Current Opinion in Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Therapeutic tools for classic benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) have focused on the dynamic component of obstruction and/or elimination of the static component via surgical or pharmaceutical therapies. Unfortunately, an exact cause for this disease process has not been identified, but additional insight has been achieved. This article presents an update of the BPH literature with a special focus on basic science or translational studies concerned with the cause of clinically significant BPH with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

Recent Findings

Investigators are exploring connections between BPH with clinically significant LUTS, the metabolic syndrome, inflammation, alterations in cell signaling, and genetics which in turn has provided additional information concerning the pathogenesis, medical therapies as well as surgical therapies.

Summary

BPH is a chronic, progressive disease with important care implications and financial risks to the healthcare system. Continued improvements in length of life will demand that we unlock the cause of LUTS secondary to BPH with the goal of prevention as the ideal therapy. Studies reported in the last year contributed to our understanding of the disease process and provide insight for additional studies.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) background — histology, androgen pathway, and prevalence: BPH is a histologic diagnosis that refers to the proliferation of glandular epithelial tissue, smooth muscle, and connective tissue within the prostatic transition zone. The mechanism by which testosterone exerts many of its physiological effects on the prostate gland is through dihydrotestosterone (DHT); once intracytoplasmic, testosterone is converted to its active metabolite DHT by the enzyme 5 α -reductase, type 2, and DHT forms a complex with androgen receptors that is then transported to the nucleus where the complex exerts its effects on the transcription of DNA. BPH is nearly ubiquitous in aging males, with worldwide autopsy proven histological prevalence increases starting at age 40–45 years to reach 60% at age 60 and 80% at age 80, and while BPH, or histological hyperplasia, in and of itself does not require treatment.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) treatment — goals, medications, and procedural indications/classification are outlined as follows: Traditionally, the primary goal of treatment has been to alleviate bothersome LUTS that result from BPO, and more recently treatment has also focused on the prevention of disease progression and complications such as AUR; pharmacologic classes used to treat LUTS/BPH include alpha-adrenergic antagonists (alpha blockers), 5-ARIs, PDE5, and anticholinergics, which may be utilized alone or in combination to take advantage of their different mechanisms of action, and an additional class of agent that may be considered in combination with alpha blockers is beta-3 agonists; there exist clinical scenarios in which conservative or pharmacological management are either inadequate or inappropriate and long-term use of medications for LUTS/BPH have been implicated in cognitive issues and depression, and these situations merit consideration of one of the many invasive procedures available for the treatment of LUTS/BPH; indications include a desire by the patient to avoid taking a daily medication, failure of medical therapy to sufficiently ameliorate bothersome LUTS, intolerance to pharmaceutical side effects, and conditions for which medical therapy is insufficient such as acute and/or chronic renal insufficiency, refractory urinary retention, recurrent UTIs, recurrent bladder stones, and recalcitrant gross hematuria; acute and chronic adverse events associated with each class of medical therapy can include cardiovascular and sexual effects; surgical treatment of symptomatic BPH may be classified into three general types: 1. MIST; 2. Simple prostatectomy; and 3. Transurethral surgery, with transurethral surgery involving removal of the obstructing adenomatous tissue via the transurethral route, classically with monopolar electrocautery TURP, and alternatives developed including bipolar TURP and various laser-based therapies to achieve similar clinical efficacy while reducing the risks of perioperative bleeding and short- and long-term complications; in appropriate patients for whom the physical size of the prostate cannot be addressed due to the expertise of the surgeon via a safe or efficacious transurethral approach, simple prostatectomy (i.e., adenoma enucleation) may be considered.

### Educating patients about lifestyle modifications for prostate health [^111YRsjD]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and other prostatic diseases share many observational and mechanistic features with cardiovascular disease. Both BPH and cardiovascular disease increase significantly with age and affect a disproportionate number of men from racial/ethnic minority populations. Pharmacotherapy and surgical options are the treatments most often discussed in the medical literature for the 2 conditions, and these treatments have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness, regardless of the severity of the condition. Obesity, lack of physical activity, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, higher blood pressure, a heart-unhealthy diet, and other factors that increase the risk for cardiovascular disease also appear to be associated with increased risk for BPH. However, the potential for lifestyle changes to prevent or reduce the severity of BPH, especially as an adjunct to conventional treatments, has not received significant attention, even in recent specialty treatment guidelines. Because lifestyle changes may affect the risk for developing BPH or its progression, clinicians are in need of guidelines they can use to educate patients about the potential links between increased risk of cardiovascular disease and increased risk or greater severity of BPH. Patients need to know that a heart-healthy lifestyle is also a prostate-healthy lifestyle. This article provides educational and lifestyle recommendations that may favorably affect BPH and improve overall health in men.

### Sexual function in patients treated for benign prostatic hyperplasia [^116QufvG]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

What is the effect of different treatment options for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) on sexual function or dysfunction? With increasing age, sexual dysfunction and BPH become more prevalent. Some treatments for BPH can affect sexual function. Different surgical treatments have different effects on sexual function depending on how much the internal involuntary sphincter is affected. The same is true for medical therapies, each class of drug having a unique affect on sexual function.

Starting Point

In the past, many articles suggested a causal relation between BPH and sexual dysfunction. But a recent report by H Leliefeld and colleagues (BJU International 2002; 89: 208–13) confirms the idea that the relation is coincidental. Prospectively, these investigators examined patients at baseline and 9 months after various treatments for BPH with questionnaires on voiding symptoms, related complications, and sexual function. 84% of patients reported no change in sexual function. All treatments showed both improvement and deterioration in 3–14% and 0–16% of patients, respectively. As expected, age was the most important determinant of sexual function. In addition, the effect of severe irritative symptoms or the presence of urological comorbidity, such as bladder stones, increased the rate of sexual dysfunction. In this study, most patients underwent surgical therapy or watchful waiting while fewer had medical therapy. Too few patients had minimally invasive procedures to comment on their effect on sexual function. WHRE NEXT? Thus the relation between treatment of BPH (or watchful waiting) and sexual dysfunction is usually coincidental, unless symptoms become severe or complications (such as bladder stones or urinary retention) develop. More prospective studies are needed to assess the effect of BPH and its treatment on sexual function. Medical therapy is now more common than surgery in developed countries and treatment of BPH is commonly advocated for improvement in quality of life. Therefore any effects on sexual function become even more important. As minimally invasive surgical operations become more common, more data will be required for such interventions. The difficulty will be in keeping up with the rapidly evolving techniques of minimally invasive therapies.

### Benign prostatic hyperplasia [^117AzJAp]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which causes lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), is a common diagnosis among the ageing male population with increasing prevalence. Many risks factors, both modifiable and non-modifiable, can increase the risk of development and progression of BPH and LUTS. The symptoms can be obstructive (resulting in urinary hesitancy, weak stream, straining or prolonged voiding) or irritative (resulting in increased urinary frequency and urgency, nocturia, urge incontinence and reduced voiding volumes), or can affect the patient after micturition (for example, postvoid dribble or incomplete emptying). BPH occurs when both stromal and epithelial cells of the prostate in the transitional zone proliferate by processes that are thought to be influenced by inflammation and sex hormones, causing prostate enlargement. Patients with LUTS undergo several key diagnostic investigations before being diagnosed with BPH. Treatment options for men with BPH start at watchful waiting and progress through medical to surgical interventions. For the majority of patients, the starting point on the treatment pathway will be dictated by their symptoms and degree of bother.

### New medical treatments for lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia and future perspectives [^1156pU8K]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Historically, the standard medical treatment for LUTS in men with BPH included α1-antagonists, 5α-reductase inhibitors and phytotherapy. These agents remain indeed today the mainstay of BPH treatment. Nonetheless, albeit full dose treatment, some patients remain symptomatic or may experience BPH progression, defined as the onset of acute urinary retention (AUR), urinary infection (UI) or the need of BPH-related surgery. In addition, the drugs routinely used in the management of LUTS carry potential adverse effects (AE), which in turn may be the cause of non-compliance of patients. Therefore, research is progressing in order to expand and optimize medical strategies in the management of BPH-related LUTS. Selective α1-antagonists, phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, and anticholinergics have been tested and have entered our armamentarium for the management of male LUTS. These agents, their pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and AEs should be well known to the practicing urologist. Furthermore, our knowledge of bladder and prostatic molecular anatomy is constantly growing, and in parallel new biomolecular targets are being identified and explored as new candidates in BPH management. Objective of this systematic review is to summarize the evidence regarding the new medical therapies currently available for BPH-related LUTS, and to give an overview on current research and agents which may enter our everyday clinical practice in the close future.

### Initial choices and final outcomes in lower urinary tract symptoms [^1147rqHX]. European Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Management of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) requires careful thought so that the most appropriate treatment can be targeted to each individual patient. Initial choices in the management of LUTS/BPH include watchful waiting, medical therapies and surgical interventions. A decision on treatment choice should be taken together with the patient. It should be based on the best available scientific evidence but also be individualised to patients' circumstances and personal choices. Management of LUTS/BPH should be focused on the burden and impact of urinary symptoms and related quality of life. The rate of treatment failure, which can be assessed through the switch to other medical therapy or surgery and/or the delay or prevention of complications related to LUTS/BPH, is also important. Beneficial effects of treatment should be balanced against the incidence of adverse events associated with therapy. Medical therapy has been shown to be effective in improving short-term outcomes (maximum urinary flow rate and symptom scores). Increasing evidence indicates that in the long-term more selective alpha(1)-adrenoceptor (AR) antagonists such as alfuzosin and tamsulosin may reduce the risk of treatment failure with a comparable rate to finasteride. Although the different alpha(1)-AR antagonists are equivalent in efficacy they differ in tolerability with the subtype selective tamsulosin having the lowest risk for interference with blood pressure regulation. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) improves storage symptoms to a lesser extent and/or more slowly than it improves voiding symptoms. In contrast, alpha(1)-AR antagonists improve both voiding and bothersome storage symptoms to the same extent and quite rapidly which has a considerable impact on quality of life. alpha(1)-AR antagonists also relieve storage symptoms to almost the same extent as TURP. Ultimately the initial choice of treatment will depend upon its efficacy, speed of onset, durability, tolerability and on patients' choice. For the majority of patients with moderate to severe symptoms a subtype selective alpha(1)-AR antagonist such as tamsulosin offers the best current combination of efficacy and tolerability.

### Comparative assessment of attitudes and expectations: Iranian patients versus urologists in the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^112kQys6]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is common and presents as lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Understanding patient concerns and treatment preferences is essential for effective management. This study aimed to investigate the attitudes, preferences, and expectations of Iranian patients with BPH, and compare them with those of urologists in addressing this condition.

Methods

A cohort of patients diagnosed with BPH underwent assessment during their initial visit. Before any counseling, their attitudes, concerns, and expectations regarding benign prostate enlargement were evaluated using semi-structured interviews. Patient responses were analyzed based on educational levels and age. Additionally, correspondence was initiated with thirty urologists who graduated within the past twelve years to assess their attitudes toward BPH, concerns, and treatment approaches. Interview questions were constructed using the Delphi method, and their validity was confirmed. Responses from both groups were analyzed and compared. Descriptive statistics, independent t-test, Chi-squared test, Mann-Whitney U, and principal component analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation were used for statistical analysis.

Results

The study comprised 261 patients and 30 urologists. Findings revealed that 86.2% of patients and 86.7% of urologists perceived a lack of sufficient patient knowledge about BPH. Patients across all educational levels and age groups expressed a desire for more information about their condition. Primary concerns among patients included exacerbation of urinary symptoms, potential malignancy, and sexual dysfunction. While patients generally preferred pharmacological treatments, those older than 75 years showed a significantly higher preference for surgical options. Conversely, urologists exhibited greater concern for long-term clinical complications associated with BPH. Results indicated significant parallels between the attitudes of urologists and patients in assessing the multifaceted impact of BPH on patient well-being.

Conclusion

This study enhances our understanding of patient attitudes and concerns regarding BPH, thereby facilitating more effective treatment strategies. Our findings encourage urologists to enhance patient perspectives by delivering comprehensive information. Furthermore, the comparison between patient and urologist attitudes towards BPH underscores the importance of tailored care and patient-centered approaches in optimizing outcomes for individuals with BPH.

Introduction

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a progressive enlargement of prostatic glandular and stromal tissues, leading to lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) that significantly impact quality of life, particularly among the aged. BPH prevalence increases with age, affecting ~20% of men in their 40 s and up to 70% of men in their 60 s. Over the past three decades (1990–2021), the global incidence of BPH has risen dramatically from ~6.5 million to 13.5 million new cases annually, underscoring the urgent need for effective treatment options (Box 1).

Current medical therapies, including adrenergic blockers (e.g. terazosin) and 5α-reductase inhibitors (e.g. finasteride), provide symptom relief but do not fully address the disease's underlying pathophysiology. For patients with severe BPH, surgical intervention, primarily transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), remains a standard approach. However, the persistence of treatment failures and the progressive nature of BPH highlight the need for novel therapeutic strategies.

There is substantial evidence supporting the hormone-dependent nature of BPH during aging. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) and growth hormone-releasing hormone (GH-RH) are critical in regulating growth hormone (GH) secretion and have been implicated in aging-related processes. Aging is associated with a decline in GH secretion, leading to reduced anabolic effects, increased adiposity, and decreased muscle mass. This hormonal shift contributes to frailty, metabolic dysfunction, and a decline in overall physiological resilience. In addition, aging-related changes in LH-RH and GH-RH signaling may influence inflammatory processes and the progression of age-related diseases, including BPH.

Experimental and clinical studies indicate that GH-RH and LH-RH analogs play a crucial role in prostate growth regulation. Prostate cells express receptors for these hypothalamic hormones, which can either stimulate hyperplasia or be blocked by antagonists to reduce prostate size and inflammation. Recent research has demonstrated that GH-RH antagonists not only shrink prostate volume but also exert potent anti-inflammatory effects, making them promising candidates for BPH treatment.

Overall, aging contributes to BPH by altering hormonal balance, increasing inflammation, and promoting prostatic tissue remodeling. This review provides a historical and scientific perspective on the evolution of hormonal therapies for BPH, focusing on the development of LH-RH and GH-RH antagonists. We discuss their molecular mechanisms, therapeutic potential, and the need for further clinical studies to optimize their application in BPH management.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) combination therapy — In an Asian cohort using a 0.2 mg tamsulosin dose, men with characteristics of disease progression had better symptomatic benefit from combination therapy than tamsulosin monotherapy, with a 24-month study reporting more prominent improvements in maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax) and prostate volume reduction and reductions in the risk of acute urinary retention (AUR) and BPH related surgery; another study found that initial combination dutasteride and tamsulosin improved quality of life compared to later initiation of tamsulosin after disease progression; Providers may start combination therapy with the intention of later discontinuing the alpha blocker (sometimes called "Withdrawal Therapy"). While this is a reasonable strategy, the concept has not been studied rigorously, and there are insufficient data to gauge the utility of this approach or the duration at which combination therapy should be continued before cessation of the alpha blocker. As stated previously, providers do not need to obtain a PSA solely for determination of 5-ARI efficacy as part combination therapy, although knowledge of a pre-existing value may help guide treatment options.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) combination therapy — In the CombAT trial, 4,844 men were randomized to tamsulosin 0.4 mg, dutasteride 0.5 mg, or their combination for four years; inclusion required prostate volume > 30 mL and PSA of > 1.5 ng/mL, and combination therapy produced significantly greater symptom improvements versus dutasteride from month 3 and tamsulosin from month 9, better BPH-related health status from months 3 and 12, and greater Qmax improvement from month 6, but with a significant increase in drug related adverse events versus monotherapies; four-year data indicated similar improvements for men with baseline prostate volume ≥ 60mL and PSA ≥ 4ng/mL for dutasteride and combination therapy, but superiority of combination when prostate volume and PSA were lower than these thresholds (while still above the study inclusion criteria of prostate volume > 30mL and PSA > 1.5ng/mL), and Qmax improvements were more profound with increasing prostate volume and PSA levels in combination therapy subjects.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) — International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) changes and Global Subjective Assessment (GSA) thresholds are correlated, with large IPSS magnitude changes corresponding to smaller magnitude changes in quality of life (QoL), and the baseline IPSS predicting the IPSS drop needed for threshold improvements; in a VA study correlating GSA at 13 weeks after treatment initiation that randomized 1,218 men to 4 therapies over 12 months, on average, a -3 point decrease was needed for a 'slight' improvement and a -5.1 and -8.8 point improvement for a 'moderate' or 'marked' improvement; a similar 7-point Likert analysis stratified by tamsulosin, dutasteride, and their combination reported results substantially similar to Barry et al.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) evaluation — pressure flow studies — Clinicians should consider pressure flow studies prior to intervention for LUTS/BPH when diagnostic uncertainty exists (Expert Opinion); pressure flow studies are the most complete means to determine the presence of BOO, most men with BOO void with low urinary flow (Qmax < 10 cc/s) at peak voiding pressures and confirmation of BOO occurs if high voiding pressures accompany the low urinary flow, and a randomized trial found a similar rate for progression to surgery with routine care versus urodynamic testing (38% versus 36%, total n = 820).
