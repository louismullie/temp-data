## Question

Optimal CPAP settings for gallstones

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about "CPAP settings for gallstones" and, implicitly, how to optimize both CPAP therapy and gallstone management if they coexist. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether CPAP has any role in treating gallstones at all. Then, I should review evidence-based management pathways for gallstones, distinguishing symptomatic from asymptomatic disease and high-risk surgical scenarios. Next, I should verify how CPAP pressures are actually determined for obstructive sleep apnea and what "typical" pressures look like. Finally, I need to reconcile the likely source of confusion between intra-abdominal pressures used during laparoscopic cholecystectomy and CPAP pressures used for sleep apnea, and lay out practical next steps for each condition.

> Let me first confirm the category error. CPAP is a therapy for obstructive sleep apnea to pneumatically splint the upper airway open during sleep; it does not treat gallstones or gallbladder disease, which are managed surgically, medically with bile acids in select cases, or by observation depending on symptoms and risk factors [^115BkwmM] [^1113ZqqS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the standard for symptomatic gallstones. For patients with symptomatic gallbladder stones, guideline-based care favors laparoscopic cholecystectomy as the standard approach, typically using four ports with two 10 mm and two 5 mm trocars, and intraoperative loss of stones alone is not a reason to convert to open surgery, which reinforces that definitive therapy is surgical rather than any airway pressure modality [^113TuK5j] [^113VNzru].

> Wait, let me verify what "pressures" are discussed in laparoscopic cholecystectomy because this may be the source of confusion. In the OR, surgeons use pneumoperitoneum pressure (mmHg) to create working space, and evidence suggests low-pressure pneumoperitoneum at 8–10 mmHg with deep neuromuscular blockade can be non-inferior to standard 12–14 mmHg for key intraoperative endpoints and may reduce postoperative shoulder pain, although meta-analytic conclusions remain cautious about routine universal adoption and emphasize equivalence of major outcomes with potential pain benefits at lower pressures [^112QYCRY] [^1163UEYn] [^114Da4uD].

> I need to check the asymptomatic scenario because management differs. For asymptomatic gallstones, watchful waiting is appropriate given an estimated 2–6% annual risk of developing symptoms, with rare prophylactic exceptions such as porcelain gallbladder or specific hematologic conditions where surgery may be considered; otherwise, many patients never require intervention over five years, aligning with population data and labeling summaries [^117Nn3fY] [^113CcsCs] [^114t3SMm] [^114FaDsj].

> Next, I should review options for patients who are poor surgical candidates. In high-risk individuals who decline or cannot undergo cholecystectomy, ursodeoxycholic acid (ursodiol) is indicated for radiolucent, noncalcified stones under 20 mm, though long-term safety beyond 24 months is not established; for severe acute calculous cholecystitis in unstable patients, image-guided gallbladder drainage (percutaneous cholecystostomy) can be a temporizing or alternative strategy within multidisciplinary pathways, with interval cholecystectomy considered when feasible [^115BkwmM] [^116mDdH7] [^111epmxT].

> Let me now examine how CPAP settings are determined, because this is separate and should be precise. Optimal CPAP pressure is usually derived by attended manual titration polysomnography to achieve the lowest effective pressure that normalizes obstructive events across sleep stages and positions, commonly targeting residual AHI below 5, while recognizing that manually titrated fixed pressures often land around 10–11 cm H2O and can be slightly overestimated compared with APAP-derived 90th/95th percentile pressures; predictive equations incorporating AHI, BMI, oxygen nadir, event duration, and craniofacial metrics exist but explain only a portion of interindividual variance, so device-based titration remains the clinical cornerstone [^1175SAkS] [^115zQYYB] [^111Sb3MY] [^114oe3A4].

> Hmm, wait a minute — at first I wondered if the user might actually mean "what insufflation pressure should be used during laparoscopic cholecystectomy" when they wrote "CPAP settings", but that would be a mistake because laparoscopic pressures are measured in mmHg and pertain to intraperitoneal CO2 insufflation, whereas CPAP for sleep apnea is set in cm H2O and pertains to upper airway splinting during sleep; conflating these can easily happen due to the shared concept of "pressure", but they are clinically unrelated and used in entirely different contexts [^114oydsT] [^114oe3A4].

> I should double-check the diagnostic gateways so the patient lands in the right care pathway. If the concern is biliary pain, right upper quadrant ultrasound is the appropriate first test and should guide surgical referral for symptomatic disease; if the concern is sleep apnea, the right step is diagnostic polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing followed by titration or initiation of APAP with structured follow-up, emphasizing mask/interface comfort, humidification, and early adherence support to optimize outcomes [^1115ZyaN] [^115PNqZp] [^113JWknX].

> In summary, I need to ensure the key takeaway is unambiguous. There is no such thing as "CPAP settings for gallstones"; gallstone therapy relies on clinical status–driven surgical, medical, or expectant strategies, while CPAP settings are tailored for obstructive sleep apnea using sleep study–based targets, and any numeric similarity between pneumoperitoneum pressures and CPAP pressures is coincidental and measured in different units with different physiologic goals [^1113ZqqS] [^1175SAkS] [^114oydsT].

There is no clinical indication for **CPAP to treat gallstones**; it is used for **obstructive sleep apnea** and is **not a therapy** for gallstone disease [^1111CP8n]. If you meant CPAP for a patient with gallstones who also has OSA, follow **standard OSA titration targets** (residual AHI < 5; control in supine REM) [^1175SAkS], and consider **APAP as an alternative** [^113RYagN] [^115zQYYB]. If you instead meant intraoperative ventilation during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, **pressure-controlled ventilation** can lower peak airway pressures [^114wQebm]; additionally, **low-pressure pneumoperitoneum** (8–10 mmHg) with deep neuromuscular blockade [^112QYCRY] is non-inferior to standard pressure [^114oydsT]. Please clarify whether you are asking about **CPAP for OSA** in a patient with gallstones or **intraoperative ventilatory settings** during cholecystectomy.

### Low-pressure pneumoperitoneum with deep neuromuscular blockade versus standard pressure pneumoperitoneum in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstone disease: a non-inferiority randomized control trial [^112QYCRY]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

Low-pressure pneumoperitoneum (LPP) is an attempt at improving laparoscopic surgery; however, it presents the issue of poor working space for which deep neuromuscular blockade (NMB) may be a solution. There is a lack of literature comparing LPP with deep NMB to standard pressure pneumoperitoneum (SPP) with moderate NMB.

This study was a single institutional, prospective non-inferiority randomized controlled trial (RCT) with permuted block randomization of subjects into Group A and Group B. Group A underwent LPP at 8–10 mmHg with deep NMB [Train of Four count (TOF): 0, Post Tetanic Count (PTC): 1–2], while Group B underwent SPP at 12–14 mmHg with moderate NMB. The level of NMB was monitored using a neuromuscular monitor with TOF count and PTC. Cisatracurium infusion was used for continuous deep NMB in Group A. The primary outcome measures were the surgeon satisfaction score and the time for completion of the procedure. Additionally, secondary clinical outcomes were assessed.

A total of 222 patients were screened, with 181 participants enrolled [F: 138 (76.2%); M: 43 (23.8%); Group A n = 90, Group B n = 91]. Surgeon satisfaction scores (26.1 ± 3.7 vs. 26.4 ± 3.4; p = 0.52) and time for completion (55.2 ± 23.4 vs. 52.5 ± 24.9 min; p = 0.46) were statistically similar between groups A and B. Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses indicated that Group A was non-inferior to Group B in terms of total surgeon satisfaction score; however, non-inferiority was not demonstrated for the time for completion of surgery. Mean pain scores and incidence of shoulder pain were statistically similar up to 7 days of follow-up in both groups.

### Comparison of three auto-adjusting positive pressure devices in patients with sleep apnoea [^113RYagN]. The European Respiratory Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Auto-adjustable continuous positive airway pressure (APAP) devices are an emerging treatment alternative to fixed-pressure continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy for obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. They have been engineered to automatically adjust the pressure to the optimal level on a continuous basis. However, not all APAP technologies use the same algorithm. Three different APAP devices — Autoset Spirit, Breas PV 10i, and RemStar Auto — were compared in a randomised crossover trial in patients already established on fixed-pressure CPAP therapy. The outcome measures were compliance, quality of life, and side-effects.

Twenty-seven middle-aged patients (25 male) previously diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (median [interquartile range] apnoea/hypopnoea index 48 [29–76]), established on CPAP therapy for over three years, were randomised to each APAP device for four weeks. Mean pressure and patient compliance were significantly lower on the Breas PV 10i than on the other APAP devices. The devices were similar in terms of quality of life, daytime sleepiness, and upper airway side-effects, but patients evaluated them significantly differently in terms of device features, sleep quality, and pressure comfort, with the Breas PV 10i being the least popular. Auto-adjustable positive airway pressure devices differ in pressure delivery and patient compliance in obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome patients.

### A comparison of pressure-controlled and volume-controlled ventilation for laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^114wQebm]. Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

The potential advantages of pressure-controlled over volume-controlled ventilation during laparoscopic surgery have yet to be proven. We randomly assigned 42 patients with a BMI < 30 kg/m², scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, to receive either pressure- or volume-controlled ventilation. Compared with volume-controlled ventilation, pressure-controlled ventilation resulted in a significant decrease in mean (SD) peak airway pressure at 10 minutes (20.4 (2.7) vs. 24.0 (4.7) cmH₂O, p = 0.004) and 30 minutes (20.7 (3.0) vs. 23.9 (4.9) cmH₂O, p = 0.015) and an increase in mean airway pressure at 10 minutes (10.5 (0.9) vs. 9.6 (1.1) cmH₂O, p = 0.007) and 30 minutes (10.5 (1.1) vs. 9.6 (1.2) cmH₂O, p = 0.016). Gas exchange and hemodynamic stability were similar. We conclude that pressure-controlled ventilation is a safe alternative and offers some advantages to volume-controlled ventilation during laparoscopic cholecystectomy in non-obese patients.

### A predictive model for optimal continuous positive airway pressure in the treatment of pure moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea in China [^1175SAkS]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Patients in this study underwent overnight PSG using the Alice 5 diagnostic sleep system (Philips Respironics, Bend, OR, USA). Sixteen channels were used simultaneously to conduct tests, including an electroencephalogram, electrooculogram, submental and leg electromyogram, electrocardiogram, airflow in the mouth and nose (thermistor, nasal pressure transducer), chest and abdominal respiratory efforts, blood oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry), snoring, and body position parameters. A sleep technician observed and confirmed patients' sleep positions using an infrared camera in the room.

Laboratory-based manual titration was performed throughout the night to determine the optimal CPAP pressure. Optimal pressure was defined as the lowest effective pressure that could control most respiratory disturbances, including apnea, hypopnea events, and snoring in all body positions and stages, especially in the supine position during rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep. Specifically, the goal was to achieve a residual AHI of less than 5 events per hour and supine REM for at least 15 minutes after treatment.

Polysomnographic data were automatically analyzed by the sleep analysis system and assessed by a polysomnographic technologist. An apnea event was defined as a reduction in airflow amplitude by more than 90% from the pre-event baseline for at least 10 seconds, and a hypopnea event was defined as a reduction in airflow by at least 30% of the pre-event baseline for at least 10 seconds, accompanied by at least 3% oxygen desaturation.

### Pulmonary recruitment maneuver reduces shoulder pain and nausea after laparoscopic cholecystectomy: A randomized controlled trial [^116St8Co]. World Journal of Surgery (2021). High credibility.

This prospective, randomized, controlled trial was conducted in a secondary-level hospital, involving experienced staff and those under training, aiming for results of clinical significance. Participants, postoperative personnel, and the investigator registering data were blinded to group affiliation. All study procedures were approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Linköping, Sweden (2014/120–31) and the trial was registered with the registration number: NCT03026543.

Inclusion criteria included adults over 18 years old, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification I-II, excluding body mass index as a health variable, and patients scheduled for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Written consent was obtained. Exclusion criteria were acute cholecystitis, pancreatitis or cholangitis, conversion to open surgery, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) during or after surgery, extra surgical procedures, and complications classified as Clavien-Dindo grade ≥ II.

Participants were consecutively enrolled and randomized into one of two equally sized groups: intervention with pulmonary recruitment maneuver (PRM) or control. Block randomization was computer-generated by an independent statistician, and the allocation decision was placed in sealed, opaque, sequentially numbered envelopes. Each envelope accompanied the participant to the operating theater, where it was opened by the anesthetic staff. Preoperatively, participants filled in a health declaration, and six weeks of non-smoking was a prerequisite for surgery.

### Ursodiol 400 mg [^115BkwmM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Ursodiol is indicated for patients with radiolucent, noncalcified gallbladder stones less than 20 mm in greatest diameter. These patients include those for whom elective cholecystectomy would be undertaken except for the presence of increased surgical risk due to systemic disease, advanced age, idiosyncratic reaction to general anesthesia, or for those patients who refuse surgery. The safety of using ursodiol beyond 24 months is not established. Additionally, ursodiol is indicated for the prevention of gallstone formation in obese patients experiencing rapid weight loss.

### Improvement of sleep parameters by titration polysomnography could predict adherence to positive airway pressure therapy in obstructive sleep apnea [^112fYXh1]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Poor adherence to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been a critical issue in treating obstructive sleep apnea. Because long-term CPAP adherence may be established shortly after treatment begins, early intervention is essential. This study aimed to identify the potential factors affecting CPAP therapy adherence during diagnostic polysomnography and auto CPAP titration polysomnography.

- **Methods**: This retrospective observational study included 463 patients with obstructive sleep apnea who underwent consecutive diagnostic polysomnography and titration polysomnography. We recorded their demographic, anthropometric, and lifestyle factors and obtained self-reported comments regarding their sleep status following both polysomnography evaluations. CPAP adherence was evaluated following 3 months of treatment.

- **Results**: A total of 312 patients (67.4%) fulfilled the criteria for good adherence. Each patient's CPAP adherence was categorized as "poor" (< 4 hours/night or < 70% of nights), "good" (≥ 4 hours/night and ≥ 70% of nights), or "excellent" (≥ 6 hours/night and ≥ 80% of nights). There were no significant differences in arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation measured by pulse oximetry and apnea-hypopnea index during diagnostic polysomnography among the three groups. The polysomnographic evaluations indicated that patients with better adherence displayed more significant improvements in sleep parameters, including apnea-hypopnea index, sleep efficacy, sleep latency, and sleep architecture, which were correlated with an improvement in self-reported sleep quality.

### Low pressure versus standard pressure pneumoperitoneum in laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^115mvzVf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

A pneumoperitoneum of 12 to 16 mm Hg is used for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Lower pressures are claimed to be safe and effective in decreasing cardiopulmonary complications and pain.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of low pressure pneumoperitoneum compared with standard pressure pneumoperitoneum in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded until February 2013 to identify randomised trials using search strategies.

- **Selection criteria**: We considered only randomised clinical trials, irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status for inclusion in the review.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently identified trials and independently extracted data. We calculated the risk ratio (RR), mean difference (MD), or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using both fixed-effect and random-effects models with RevMan 5 based on available case analysis.

- **Main results**: A total of 1092 participants were randomly assigned to the low pressure group (509 participants) and the standard pressure group (583 participants) in 21 trials, providing information for this review on one or more outcomes. Three additional trials comparing low pressure pneumoperitoneum with standard pressure pneumoperitoneum (including 179 participants) provided no information for this review. Most of the trials included low anaesthetic risk participants undergoing e---

### Effectiveness of conservative management versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the prevention of recurrent symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease (C-GALL trial): Pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial [^114PaVC9]. BMJ (2023). High credibility.

The economic analysis was conducted according to a prespecified and agreed health economics analysis plan, which is available from the corresponding author on request. Mirroring the statistical analysis, the principles of the intention-to-treat analysis were followed to compare cost and QALYs between groups. Data for the 24-month follow-up were used, as this would better reflect costs and consequences relevant to the economic analysis. Reliance on complete case data for cost-effectiveness analysis can introduce bias unless the data are completely missing at random.

We implemented multiple imputation as part of the primary economic analysis, using chained equations with predicted mean matching and generating 20 imputed datasets with plausible fitted values assigned for missing cost and utility elements. The imputation model included all the variables in the analysis model (age, sex, treatment group allocation) and auxiliary variables that may help to explain missingness (trial centre, indicator for having surgery, and type of procedure). Rubin's rules were used to pool estimates across multiple imputation datasets.

General linear regression models adjusted for minimisation factors (centre, age, sex) and baseline SF-6D score were used. Adjusted mean values by treatment allocation and the incremental difference between the groups were obtained using the methods of recycled predictions. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated as the difference in mean costs divided by the difference in mean QALYs for the conservative management group versus the cholecystectomy group.

### Clinical evolution of gallstones following percutaneous cholecystostomy in patients with severe acute calculous cholecystitis: a single-center analysis of 102 cases [^111epmxT]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

The study received local board approval. We conducted a single-center retrospective case-control evaluation of the outcomes of patients who had undergone percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) for severe acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC), comparing those who went on to have interval laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) with those who had PC only.

At our institution, a diagnosis of ACC was made in the presence of the acute onset of pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, localized tenderness with or without guarding on palpation, elevated serum white cell count, and evidence of gallstones within a thick-walled gallbladder on abdominal ultrasound and/or computed tomography scan. In case of altered liver function tests and/or evidence of a dilated biliary tree on imaging, subjects were also assessed using magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. Upon diagnosis, the severity of ACC was defined according to the Tokyo guidelines.

Emergency LC was contraindicated in cases of Tokyo 3 disease or any Tokyo grade associated with a duration of symptoms greater than 5 days, previous multiple upper abdominal surgeries, an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score greater than 3, or a body mass index ≥ 40 kg/m². The decision to proceed with PC was made at a multidisciplinary level, at any time from the diagnosis of ACC in critically ill patients who required organ support in the intensive care unit, or in those who did not respond to maximal intravenous antibiotic therapy for 4 days or more. The clinical response was judged to be poor based on persistent tachycardia, hypotension, a white cell count > 18×10⁹/L, and/or serum C-reactive protein > 250 mg/L.

### Reltone 400 mg [^1128Cyxc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Alternative therapies**: Watchful waiting has the advantage that no therapy may ever be required. For patients with silent or minimally symptomatic stones, the rate of development of moderate-to-severe symptoms or gallstone complications is estimated to be between 2% and 6% per year, leading to a cumulative rate of 7% to 27% in 5 years. Presumably, the rate is higher for patients already having symptoms.

- **Cholecystectomy**: For patients with symptomatic gallstones, surgery offers the advantage of immediate and permanent stone removal but carries a high risk in some patients. About 5% of cholecystectomized patients have residual symptoms or retained common duct stones. The spectrum of surgical risk varies as a function of age and the presence of disease other than cholelithiasis.

- **Mortality rates for cholecystectomy in the U.S. (National Halothane Study, JAMA 1966; 197:775–8)**: Among 27,600 cholecystectomies, smoothed rates indicate deaths per 1000 operations. Women in good health or who have only moderate systemic disease and are under 49 years of age have the lowest surgical mortality rate (0.054). Men in all categories have a surgical mortality rate twice that of women. Common duct exploration quadruples the rates in all categories. The rates rise with each decade of life and increase tenfold or more in all categories with severe or extreme systemic disease.

### Upper airway anatomical balance contributes to optimal continuous positive airway pressure for Japanese patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome [^111Sb3MY]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to examine whether the upper airway anatomical balance, as reflected by tongue size relative to maxillomandibular size, is related to optimal nasal continuous positive airway pressure (PnCPAP).

- **Methods**: Sixty-six male Japanese obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) patients (median apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] = 33.9 episodes/h [10th/90th percentile = 19.5/59.9], median body mass index [BMI] = 25.1 kg/m² [10th/90th percentile = 21.2/30.4]) were recruited. All patients underwent standard polysomnography (PSG), and PnCPAP was determined by nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) titration. The anatomical balance was defined as the tongue area (TG) divided by the lower face cage (LFC) measured on cephalometry. A predictive equation of PnCPAP was created using demographic, polysomnographic, and cephalometric variables.

- **Results**: Significant correlations were found between PnCPAP and descriptive variables, including BMI, AHI, lowest SpO2, distance from the anterosuperior point of the hyoid bone to the mandibular plane (MP-H), and TG/LFC. Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that AHI and TG/LFC were independent predictors of PnCPAP. The predictive equation was: PnCPAP = 1.000 + 0.043 × AHI + 9.699 × TG / LFC, which accounted for 28.0% of the total variance in PnCPAP (R² = 0.280, p < 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: Anatomical balance of the upper airway, in addition to the severity of OSAS, is an important contributing factor for PnCPAP in Japanese OSAS patients.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of gallstones [^113TuK5j]. Journal of Hepatology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for gallstone disease, and more specifically with respect to cholecystectomy (technical considerations), the EASL 2016 guidelines recommend performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy using 4 ports. Two ports should be at least 10 mm in size, and the other two ports should be at least 5 mm in size.

### Low-pressure versus standard-pressure pneumoperitoneum in laparoscopic cholecystectomy: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^117NiZBu]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). High credibility.

In this study, we chose to consider elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy only as the index procedure for the meta-analysis for two main reasons: firstly, to reduce bias linked to outcomes related to the complexity of laparoscopic procedures, and secondly, because the elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy is considered a cornerstone procedure for the minimally invasive surgeon.

A Cochrane review already exists on this topic. The primary conclusion was that although laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be completed successfully using low pressure in approximately 90% of people undergoing the procedure, no conclusive evidence exists to support its utilization of low pressure in healthy, low anaesthetic risk patients and that the safety must be better defined. As a result, the authors did not recommend low-pressure pneumoperitoneum unless future trials demonstrate a clinical benefit. Although a significant reduction in post-operative shoulder pain was demonstrated, its influence on other considered parameters was either inconclusive or not significant. In conclusion, although lowering intra-abdominal pressure may decrease the associated detrimental effects of standard/high-pressure pneumoperitoneum, the safety of low-pressure pneumoperitoneum has not been fully defined.

In our analysis, the pressures reported as low in the considered studies ranged from 6 to 10 mmHg, while in the standard/high-pressure groups, 12 to 15 mmHg pressures were applied.

Regarding post-operative pain, the timeframe considered in the included studies was highly variable. However, in general, pat

### Effect of positive airway pressure on obese patients undergoing surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112LHzm6]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder characterized by repeated interruptions in breathing during sleep, resulting in inadequate oxygen levels. Studies have revealed that middle-aged adults with a higher BMI face a significantly higher risk of sleep apnoea. In severely obese individuals, the prevalence of sleep apnoea can range from 40–90%. Obstructive sleep apnoea is more prevalent among obese individuals.

Positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy is the gold standard treatment for moderate to severe OSA. PAP therapy maintains upper airway patency by maintaining positive air pressure throughout the respiratory cycle, functioning as an inflatable splint. This modality encompasses continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP), and positive airway pressure with automatic titration (APAP). CPAP provides a continual, stable influx of positive air pressure to the patient's airway, engineered to avert airway collapse and minimize the frequency of apnoeic episodes. BIPAP delivers two distinct pressure settings – an elevated pressure during inspiration (IPAP) and a reduced pressure during expiration (EPAP), enabling patients to benefit from increased respiratory support during inspiration along with continuous positive pressure during expiration, thereby contributing to enhanced comfort and therapeutic outcomes. The APAP is an intelligent non-invasive ventilator autonomously adjusting the end positive pressure airway level in alignment with the patient's respiratory requirements.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, cholesterol gallstones, and cholecystectomy: New insights on a complex relationship [^111PD2hF]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Gallstone disease (GSD) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) often coexist in a given patient, and both conditions are associated with obesity and insulin resistance. The relationship between GSD and NAFLD is complex and bidirectional. In this review, we summarize the existing information on the complex link between GSD and NAFLD and the potential implications for patient care.

- **Recent findings**: Several clinical studies and systematic reviews have addressed the association between NAFLD and GSD, underscoring that NAFLD is an independent risk factor for GSD. Conversely, GSD has also been found to be an independent risk factor for NAFLD, with GSD potentially being linked to greater disease severity. In addition to the data showing the association of NAFLD and GSD, recent evidence has shown that cholecystectomy may itself be a risk factor for NAFLD development. The complex and bidirectional relationship between these diseases is partially explained by a number of common pathogenic links, but the precise underlying mechanisms of the association of GSD and NAFLD need to be better delineated. Although the mechanisms of the promotional effect of cholecystectomy on NAFLD development are unknown, recent findings unveiling new aspects of gallbladder physiology and endocrine actions of bile acids provide a framework to advance research in this field.

- **Summary**: In this review, we address the different aspects of the complex association between NAFLD and GSD, including the potential underlying mechanisms and recent information on the endocrine actions of bile acids.

### A predictive model for optimal continuous positive airway pressure in the treatment of pure moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea in China [^114oe3A4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Numerous predictive formulas based on different ethnicities have been developed to determine continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) without laboratory-based manual titrations. However, few studies have focused on patients with OSA in China. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a predictive equation for determining the optimal value of CPAP for patients with OSA in China.

- **Methods**: 526 pure moderate to severe OSA patients with attended CPAP titrations during overnight polysomnogram were split into either formula derivation (419 patients) or validation (107 patients) groups according to the treatment time. A predictive model was created in the derivation group, and the accuracy of the model was tested in the validation group.

- **Results**: Apnea hypopnea index (AHI), body mass index (BMI), longest apnea time (LAT), and minimum percutaneous oxygen saturation (minSpO2) were considered as independent predictors of optimal CPAP through correlation analysis and multiple stepwise regression analysis. The best equation to predict the optimal value of CPAP was: CPAPpred = 7.581 + 0.020*AHI + 0.101*BMI + 0.015*LAT - 0.028*minSpO2 (R2 = 27.2%, p < 0.05). The correlation between predictive CPAP and laboratory-determined manual optimal CPAP was significant in the validation group (r = 0.706, p = 0.000). The pressure determined by the predictive formula did not significantly differ from the manually titrated pressure in the validation cohort (10 ± 1 cmH2O vs. 11 ± 3 cmH2O, p = 0.766).

### Low-pressure versus standard-pressure pneumoperitoneum in laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114oydsT]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). High credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis included 44 randomized controlled trials that compared different pressures of pneumoperitoneum in the setting of elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Most studies compared two groups: low-pressure versus standard- or high-pressure pneumoperitoneum, whereas 7 studies included three or more groups.

- **Characteristics of RCTs included in the systematic review**: The studies involved patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. One study also included patients undergoing emergency procedures. Surgical indications varied, including symptomatic gallstones, acalculous cholecystitis, and gallbladder polyps. There was no restriction on the type of anesthesia or patient positioning used, which was consistent across study groups.

- **Types of interventions**: Thirty-seven trials compared low-pressure (≤ 10 mmHg) versus standard- or high-pressure (> 10 mmHg) pneumoperitoneum. Seven trials compared three or more pressure groups.

The characteristics and results are detailed in Table 1, and the study selection process is depicted in the PRISMA flow diagram (Fig. 1).

### Aerosol delivery and humidification with the Boussignac continuous positive airway pressure device [^112oiVHf]. Respiratory Care (2011). Low credibility.

A simple method for effective bronchodilator aerosol delivery while administering continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) would be useful in patients with severe bronchial obstruction.

- **Objective**: To assess the effectiveness of bronchodilator aerosol delivery during CPAP generated by the Boussignac CPAP system and its optimal humidification system.

- **Methods**: First, we assessed the relationship between flow and pressure generated in the mask with the Boussignac CPAP system. Next, we measured the inspired-gas humidity during CPAP with several humidification strategies in 9 healthy volunteers. We then measured the bronchodilator aerosol particle size during CPAP, with and without a heat-and-moisture exchanger, in a bench study. Finally, in 7 patients with acute respiratory failure and airway obstruction, we measured the work of breathing and gas exchange following a β(2)-agonist bronchodilator aerosol (terbutaline) delivered during CPAP or via standard nebulization.

- **Results**: Optimal humidity was obtained only with the heat-and-moisture exchanger or heated humidifier. The heat-and-moisture exchanger had no influence on bronchodilator aerosol particle size. Work of breathing decreased similarly after bronchodilator delivery via either standard nebulization or CPAP, but P(aO(2)) increased significantly only after CPAP aerosol delivery.

- **Conclusions**: CPAP bronchodilator delivery decreases the work of breathing as effectively as does standard nebulization, but produces a greater oxygenation improvement in patients with airway obstruction.

### Ursodiol 400 mg [^117Nn3fY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Alternative therapies**: Watchful waiting has the advantage that no therapy may ever be required. For patients with silent or minimally symptomatic stones, the rate of development of moderate-to-severe symptoms or gallstone complications is estimated to be between 2% and 6% per year, leading to a cumulative rate of 7% to 27% in 5 years. Presumably, the rate is higher for patients already experiencing symptoms.

- **Cholecystectomy**: For patients with symptomatic gallstones, surgery offers the advantage of immediate and permanent stone removal but carries a high risk in some patients. About 5% of cholecystectomized patients have residual symptoms or retained common duct stones. The spectrum of surgical risk varies depending on age and the presence of diseases other than cholelithiasis.

	**Mortality rates for cholecystectomy in the US**: Women in good health or who have only moderate systemic disease and are under 49 years of age have the lowest surgical mortality rate (0.054); men in all categories have a surgical mortality rate twice that of women. Common duct exploration quadruples the rates in all categories. The rates rise with each decade of life and increase tenfold or more in all categories with severe or extreme systemic disease. The data originates from the National Halothane Study, JAMA 1966; 197:775–8, analyzing 27,600 cholecystectomies.

Regarding surgical interventions for gallstone disease, specifically concerning cholecystectomy indications, the EASL 2016 guidelines recommend considering a cholecystectomy in patients with hereditary spherocytosis and sickle cell disease who have concomitant asymptomatic gallstones at the time of splenectomy. It is also advised to perform a prophylactic cholecystectomy during other abdominal surgeries in patients with sickle cell disease and asymptomatic gallstones to avoid diagnostic uncertainty in the event of sickle cell crises.

### The risk paradox: Use of elective cholecystectomy in older patients is independent of their risk of developing complications [^111GFcDT]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

We recently developed and validated a prognostic model that accurately predicts the 2-year risk of emergent gallstone-related hospitalization in older patients presenting with symptomatic gallstones.

- **Study design**: We used 100% Texas Medicare data (2000 to 2011) to identify patients aged 66 years and older with an initial episode of symptomatic gallstones not requiring emergency hospitalization. At presentation, we calculated each patient's risk of 2-year gallstone-related emergent hospitalization using the previously validated model. Patients were placed into the following risk groups based on model estimates: < 30%, 30% to < 60%, and ≥ 60%. Within each risk group, we calculated the percent of elective cholecystectomies (≤ 2.5 months from initial episode) performed.

- **Results**: In all, 161,568 patients had an episode of symptomatic gallstones. The mean age was 76.5 ± 7.3 years, and 59.9% were female. The 2-year risk of gallstone-related hospitalizations increased from 15.9% to 41.5% to 65.2% across risk groups. For the overall cohort, 22.3% in the low-risk group, 20.9% in the moderate-risk group, and 23.2% in the high-risk group underwent elective cholecystectomy in the 2.5 months after the initial symptomatic episode. In patients with no comorbidities, elective cholecystectomy rates decreased from 34.2% in the low-risk group to 26.7% in the high-risk group. Of patients who did not undergo cholecystectomy, only 9.5% were seen by a surgeon in the 2.5 months after the initial episode.

- **Conclusions**: The risk of acute biliary symptoms requiring hospitalization has not been clearly articulated in this study text.

### Early pathophysiology-driven airway pressure release ventilation versus low tidal volume ventilation strategy for patients with moderate-severe ARDS: Study protocol for a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial [^1137Ni3s]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Considering the viscoelastic nature of the lung in ARDS, airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) was initially described in 1987 by Stock and colleagues as a groundbreaking form of mechanical ventilation. Instead of delivering tidal volume by elevating airway pressure above the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), APRV entails the provision of continuous positive airway pressure with a brief intermittent release phase, enabling the release of only a partial lung volume and allowing spontaneous breathing throughout the high-pressure phase. Theoretically, in the context of heterogeneous lung injury under APRV ventilation, the appropriate elevated baseline airway pressure (Phigh) at the safe target and prolonged duration of Phigh could optimally facilitate gradual alveolar recruitment over time while averting overinflation. Moreover, the brief release phase (Tlow) allows for only a partial loss of lung volume to eliminate carbon dioxide, prevent alveolar collapse, and foster alveolar stability and homogeneity. Consequently, APRV emerges as an exemplary protective mechanical ventilation strategy for enhancing pulmonary function and mitigating lung injury.

### Concept of the pathogenesis and treatment of cholelithiasis [^111MYfrD]. World Journal of Hepatology (2012). High credibility.

Gallstone disease can be associated with a variety of conditions, including acute cholangitis, obesity, coronary artery disease, and hormone replacement therapy. Other associations include total parenteral nutrition (TPN), bariatric surgery, vomiting, nausea, and several types of pain such as epigastric, right upper quadrant (RUQ), colicky abdominal, back, postprandial abdominal, shoulder, and chest pain.

Further associations include rapid weight loss, Mirizzi syndrome, diabetes mellitus type 2, gallstones, female sex, and Collin's sign. Gallstone disease may also be related to acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, acute pancreatitis, and metabolic syndrome.

### Impact of gallstone disease on the risk of stroke and coronary artery disease: Evidence from prospective observational studies and genetic analyses [^112QPgyA]. BMC Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Gallstone disease (GSD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are both common and costly global public health issues, with their comorbidity long documented. In a large meta-analysis of prospective studies involving over 1.2 million participants, an increased risk of CVD events has been reported among GSD patients (pooled hazard ratio [HR] = 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.16–1.30). Despite epidemiological evidence associating GSD with CVD, a critical clinical dilemma remains regarding the uncertainty over the role of cholecystectomy — the gold standard therapy for symptomatic GSD — in modifying the risk of CVD. Performing cholecystectomy has not counteracted the deleterious effect of GSD on CVD risk (compared to GSD patients not undergoing cholecystectomy), but rather increased it (compared to the general population).

Despite being drawn from observational studies rather than randomized controlled trials, this evidence reflects a potentially complex etiological interplay. It is essential to acknowledge that these findings may be biased by distinct patient and disease characteristics between patients who undergo cholecystectomy versus those who do not. Indeed, phenotypic associations derived from conventional observational designs can be subject to bias, confounding, and reverse causality, while limited accessibility to study samples or covariates further hinders accurate quantification of effects. One way of addressing the discrepancies between epidemiological and clinical results is to investigate the genetic underpinnings of these associations.

### Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs for biliary colic [^1177RydH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Cholelithiasis refers to the presence of gallstones, which are concretions that form in the biliary tract, usually in the gallbladder. It is one of the most common surgical problems worldwide and is particularly prevalent in most Western countries. Biliary colic is the term used for gallbladder pain experienced by a person with gallstones without overt infection around the gallbladder. It is the most common manifestation of cholelithiasis, observed in over one-third of people with gallstones over the course of 10 or more years. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been widely used to relieve biliary colic pain, but their role needs further elucidation. They may decrease the frequency of short-term complications such as mild forms of acute cholecystitis, jaundice, cholangitis, and acute pancreatitis. However, they may also increase the occurrence of more severe and possibly life-threatening adverse events such as gastrointestinal bleeding, renal function impairment, cardiovascular events, or milder events such as abdominal pain, drowsiness, headache, dizziness, or cutaneous manifestations.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of NSAIDs in people with biliary colic.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP), Science Citation Index Expanded (Web of Science), and ClinicalTrials.gov until July 2016. We applied no language limitation.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised clinical trials.

### The art and science of continuous positive airway pressure therapy in obstructive sleep apnea [^115PNqZp]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Despite the high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome, no ideal therapy has emerged at the time of writing. Based on recent randomized trials, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is the treatment of choice. Although CPAP can prevent pharyngeal collapse in virtually all patients who choose to wear it, poor patient adherence to the treatment limits its effectiveness. Convincing data exist that treatment with CPAP can alleviate the neurocognitive sequelae of OSA, but data on cardiovascular complications are more limited.

Several recent reports support a lowering of nocturnal and daytime blood pressure with CPAP, but data on the prevention of myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular events are currently lacking. Patient adherence to CPAP can be improved with optimization of mask comfort, heated humidification, and intensive support and education. For those who remain poorly compliant, alternative therapies such as autotitrating devices and oral positive airway pressure can be considered. Further research into the basic mechanisms underlying OSA will be required for new therapeutic targets to develop.

### A predictive model for optimal continuous positive airway pressure in the treatment of pure moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea in China [^113kwtM7]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common form of sleep-disordered breathing characterized by the cessation or significant attenuation of oronasal airflow during sleep, accompanied by daytime drowsiness and fatigue. Nearly one billion adults aged 30 to 69 worldwide are reported to have OSA. The highest number of affected individuals is in China, followed by the United States, Brazil, and India. OSA is associated with multiple-system damage due to intermittent hypoxia.

Previous studies have demonstrated the beneficial role of automatic continuous positive airway pressure (auto-CPAP) therapy in treating OSA patients. However, auto-CPAP titration followed by fixed continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) facilitated through a web platform is not commonly used in China. This is due to economic factors, medical insurance policies, and the nascent stage of telemedicine services, which lack relevant national policies and regulations. Currently, the "gold standard" for diagnosing and treating OSA in China includes an initial laboratory diagnostic polysomnogram (PSG), followed by a second PSG for manually titrating the appropriate CPAP value if moderate to severe OSA is detected. This procedure is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, the titration duration may be insufficient to determine the appropriate pressure, as patients often struggle to sleep well in an unfamiliar environment.

### Vomiting gallstones as a presenting feature of small bowel obstruction secondary to inflammatory stricture [^1148SsTM]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with symptoms caused by gallstones are common on a surgical take. Understanding the different ways in which this common condition can present is important to enable the correct diagnosis and thus management plan. The immediate management of gallstones depends on the presenting features and can range from analgesia to surgical intervention. Obstructive cases require intervention, either by ERCP or surgery; the non-obstructive cases are usually left to settle before an elective operation at a later date. In surgery, the presence of a clinical sign where it 'should not be' can be a sign of another underlying pathology, and this is the embodiment of surgery — to assimilate seemingly disparate pieces of information and act in a way to treat the cause. This case study highlights a rare presentation of one disease state, in vomiting of gallstones, that raised the diagnosis of another pathology, a small bowel obstruction.

### Low-pressure versus standard-pressure pneumoperitoneum in laparoscopic cholecystectomy: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114Da4uD]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). High credibility.

It has been previously demonstrated that the rise of intra-abdominal pressures and prolonged exposure to such pressures can produce changes in the cardiovascular and pulmonary dynamics which, though potentially well tolerated in the majority of healthy patients with adequate cardiopulmonary reserve, may be less well tolerated when cardiopulmonary reserve is poor. Nevertheless, theoretically lowering intra-abdominal pressure could reduce the impact of pneumoperitoneum on the blood circulation of intra-abdominal organs as well as cardiopulmonary function. However, the evidence remains weak, and as such, the debate remains unresolved. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to demonstrate the knowledge around the effect of pneumoperitoneum at different pressure levels during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

- **Materials and methods**: This systematic review and meta-analysis were reported according to the recommendations of the 2020 updated Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions.

- **Results**: This systematic review and meta-analysis included 44 randomized controlled trials that compared different pressures of pneumoperitoneum in the setting of elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Length of hospital stay, conversion rate, and complications rate were not significantly different, whereas statistically significant differences were observed in post-operative pain and analgesic consumption. According to the GRADE criteria, the overall quality of evidence…

### Titration studies overestimate continuous positive airway pressure requirements in uncomplicated obstructive sleep apnea [^115zQYYB]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Attended manual continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) titration is the standard practice for determining optimal positive airway pressures for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) treatment. However, an unattended single-night auto-titrating positive airway pressure (APAP) titration is an alternative. The goal of this study was to determine whether therapeutic CPAP pressures determined during manual titrations are higher than APAP-generated surrogate pressures.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective review of 165 adults with uncomplicated OSA who had full/split-night manual CPAP titrations prior to commencing treatment with APAP. Demographic and clinical data, including 30-day APAP compliance data, were obtained. We compared the recommended CPAP pressure from manual titrations with the 90th/95th percentile pressure generated from APAP usage over 30 days.

- **Results**: The recommended CPAP pressures during the manual titrations were higher than the 90th/95th percentile pressures generated from APAP (11.4 ± 3.4 vs 10.3 ± 2.4 cmH2O; p = 0.000). Almost half the group (41.9%) had their manually derived titration pressure at least 1.5 cm above the 90th/95th percentile pressure. In multivariate analyses, body mass index was the only variable that predicted higher manual titration pressures. Notably, the average residual apnea-hypopnea index on 30-day APAP data was less than the average residual apnea-hypopnea index observed at the recommended pressure during the manual titration (5.0 ± 4.3 vs 7.2 ± 8.5; p = 0.006).

- **Conclusions**: Manual CPAP titrations may overestimate pres.

### Development of symptoms and complications in individuals with asymptomatic gallstones [^114FaDsj]. The British Journal of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Gallbladder stones are common in the developed world. Complications of gallstones contribute substantially to healthcare costs and may be life-threatening. Identifying individuals likely to develop complications would be beneficial in clinical practice, as elective cholecystectomy could then be performed.

- **Methods**: Seven hundred thirty-nine subjects aged 35–85 years from the general population were screened for gallbladder problems by ultrasonography and a questionnaire assessment of putative risk factors and digestive symptoms. Gallstones, cholesterolosis, or sludge in the gallbladder were diagnosed in 123 (16.3%) of the 739 subjects. Of these, 120 were followed for a median of 87 (range 3–146) months to May 2003 or until treatment was required.

- **Results**: Fourteen patients were admitted to hospital and treated for gallstone-related complications or symptoms. The cumulative risk of being treated during the first five years after detection of asymptomatic gallstones was 7.6%, with no indication of this risk levelling off. There were no significant differences between treated and untreated subjects regarding digestive symptoms or any of the risk factors monitored at the initial screening, although treated subjects were significantly younger than those who were not treated.

- **Conclusion**: Nearly one in ten individuals with asymptomatic gallbladder stones in the general population may be expected to develop symptoms or complications that require treatment within five years. Age may be inversely related to the incidence of complications.

### Obesity as a risk factor for cardiac arrhythmias [^112quTqY]. BMJ Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the mainstay treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea, although reports on the effects of this treatment on atrial fibrillation (AF) risk are conflicting. Observational studies have reported reductions in atrial and ventricular ectopy and arrhythmias with continuous positive airway pressure, and maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion and catheter ablation for AF. Two meta-analyses of 108 observational studies evaluating the effect of continuous positive airway pressure on AF risk reported similar results. One meta-analysis of 3,743 people suggested that AF risk increased by almost 60% in people with obstructive sleep apnoea who were not treated with continuous positive airway pressure. The other meta-analysis of 4,752 patients reported a 42% relative risk reduction of AF recurrence with continuous positive airway pressure among more than 1,000 patients. Another meta-analysis of clinical and observational studies comprising 14,812 patients showed that continuous positive airway pressure reduced AF recurrence by over 60%. The benefits of this treatment in reducing AF recurrence might also be greater in younger patients (< 60 years). Similarly, continuous positive airway pressure has been shown to be particularly efficacious at decreasing AF risk in younger men who are obese, supporting intervention early in the progression of obesity.

Nevertheless, an open-label randomised trial of 108 patients with paroxysmal AF and moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnoea showed no difference in AF burden between groups treated with continuous positive airway pressure.

### Combined use of high-frequency jet ventilation and abdominal lift for laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a patient with glottic impairment [^116kGaiG]. Surgical Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Effective airway management during laparoscopic anesthesia is important to minimize the adverse consequences of the carbon dioxide (CO2) pneumoperitoneum (PP). During PP, reduced respiratory excursion and tidal volumes with increased CO2 absorption may lead to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis. Although these problems can usually be avoided by the use of positive pressure ventilation and an endotracheal tube, patients with a restricted airway who cannot be intubated pose a unique challenge.

High-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) has been described as an alternative to endotracheal intubation in other settings. The use of the small-diameter jet tube allows relatively unobstructed access to the larynx during laryngeal surgery. In patients with glottic impairment related to vocal fold immobility, jet ventilation allows positive pressure ventilation without the use of an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy in cases where lung and diaphragmatic compliance permit adequate excursion for ventilation, and glottal diameter permits an adequate outflow of air.

In this report, we describe the successful use of HFJV combined with an abdominal lifting technique and low-pressure PP for laparoscopic surgery in a patient with glottic compromise related to vocal fold immobility. Using these techniques, a laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed successfully without endotracheal intubation or the need for a tracheostomy.

### Conray [^116V2M2N]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In addition to the general precautions previously described, in the presence of acute pancreatitis, direct cholangiography, if necessary, should be employed with caution. It is advised to inject no more than 5 to 10 mL without undue pressure. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography should only be attempted when compatible blood for potential transfusions is ready and emergency surgical facilities are available. The patient should be carefully monitored for at least 24 hours to ensure prompt detection of bile leakage and hemorrhage. Appropriate premedication of the patient is recommended, and drugs that are cholespastic, such as morphine, should be avoided. Respiratory movements should be controlled during the introduction of the needle.

Adverse reactions may often be attributed to injection pressure or excessive volume of the medium resulting in overdistention of the ducts and local pain. Some of the medium may enter the pancreatic duct, which may result in pancreatic irritation. Occasionally, nausea, vomiting, fever, and tachycardia have been observed. Pancholangitis resulting in liver abscess or septicemia has been reported.

In percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, some discomfort is common, but severe pain is unusual. Complications of the procedure are often serious and have been reported in 4 to 6 percent of patients. These reactions have included bile leakage and biliary peritonitis, gall bladder perforation, internal bleeding (sometimes massive), and blood-bile fistula resulting in septicemia involving gram-negative organisms.

Reltone™ is indicated for patients with radiolucent, noncalcified gallbladder stones less than 20 mm in greatest diameter. This applies to patients for whom elective cholecystectomy would normally be performed, but increased surgical risk due to systemic disease, advanced age, or idiosyncratic reaction to general anesthesia is present. It is also indicated for patients who refuse surgery. The safety of Reltone™ use beyond 24 months has not been established. Additionally, Reltone™ is indicated for the prevention of gallstone formation in obese patients experiencing rapid weight loss.

### Intention to exercise in patients with obstructive sleep apnea [^113b4b3W]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common and serious health issue that is strongly associated with excess weight. Exercise may be an effective mechanism for reducing the severity of OSA both in association with and independent of reduction in body weight. As such, increased exercise has been suggested as a potential intervention for OSA, particularly for patients with mild to moderate clinical severity. However, it is unknown how ready to engage in exercise patients with OSA are.

Self-reported exercise intention was assessed in 206 consecutive patients attending a large tertiary sleep disorders service in Australia. Classification of the patients by Stage of Change, a construct of the Transtheoretical Model of behavior change, was supported by differences between the groups in level of habitual self-reported exercise. Cluster analysis identified four potential patient types, with differing profiles in perceived costs and benefits of exercise, and exercise-related self-efficacy. The validity of these patient clusters was also supported by differences between the groups in self-reported exercise levels. The results may help to identify patients who are more likely to engage in increased exercise and to identify barriers to exercise in patients less inclined to increase their exercise.

### Performance of diagnostic guidelines in the evaluation of choledocholithiasis in patients with acute biliary presentation: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116qFW5H]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Acute biliary disease is a common surgical problem. Choledocholithiasis, the presence of gallstone in the common bile duct (CBDS), complicates 5%–20% of these presentations, potentially leading to increased morbidity and treatment complexity. CBDS can be identified with high accuracy through endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) prior to definitive treatment with cholecystectomy or during cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiography (IOC). However, neither method is routinely employed. ERCP carries a risk of potentially serious adverse events, such as pancreatitis, and is usually performed on patients with a high pretest probability. IOC's routine use is limited by factors such as increased operation time, cost, and radiation exposure for both patients and staff. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) are alternative modalities for diagnosing CBDS, offering comparable diagnostic performance without the issues associated with ERCP or IOC. Yet, these modalities are resource-intensive, have limited availability, and may result in increased length of stay and additional financial costs.

Optimal management of acute biliary disease should incorporate an assessment of CBDS risk to select patients at elevated CBDS risk for additional investigations (ERCP, IOC, MRCP, or EUS), while allowing patients at low risk to forego them safely. Over the years, various diagnostic guidelines have been proposed for this purpose, including those by the American Society…

### Gallstones top to toe: what the radiologist needs to know [^112JW9r9]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Gallstones are solid rounded particles composed of a combination of cholesterol and bilirubin that form within the gallbladder and the biliary system. The size and number of gallstones vary, with some patients forming multiple small gallstones and others forming single or few large stones.

The incidence of gallstones is increasing in Western populations as obesity levels rise. In the United States, 8.6% of Caucasian men and 16.6% of women have gallstones. The vast majority of gallstones are asymptomatic and require no follow-up; however, approximately 10–15% of gallstones will become symptomatic over a period of 10–15 years of follow-up. The symptomatic manifestations of gallstones are variable and range from mild symptoms such as biliary colic to severe acute presentations such as pancreatitis, which can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In a patient who has suffered a symptomatic manifestation of gallstones, the incidence of a further manifestation over their lifetime is approximately 3% per year. The risk for gallstone-related pathology is also related to the number and size of stones, with numerous larger stones more likely to cause symptoms. For this reason, it is suggested that once symptoms present, the patient should be offered a cholecystectomy.

- **Main risk factors for gallstone formation**: See Table 1.
- **Factors protective against gallstones**: See Table 2.

There are three main types of gallstones:

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^116yRz7a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons combined the published validated clinical scores and proposed a risk stratification of common bile duct stones (CBDS) in three different classes, defined as follows: low risk (50%) of CBDS. This proposed classification has clear clinical implications:

- **Low risk**: Patients with a low risk of CBDS should be operated on without further investigation.
- **Moderate risk**: Patients with moderate risk should be evaluated with a second-level examination, either preoperatively with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), or intraoperatively with laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) or intraoperative cholangiography (IOC), in order to select patients who need stone removal. According to local expertise, laparoscopic transcystic CBD exploration is a valuable option.
- **High risk**: Patients with high risk of CBDS should undergo preoperative diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

The ASGE guidelines remain a valuable tool for the diagnosis and management of CBDS in patients with acute calculus cholecystitis (ACC). According to their classification, high-risk patients require specific assessment and intervention strategies. See Fig. 1 for the flowchart of management of ACC.

- **Risk factors and classification of risk for CBDS**: Modified from Maple et al. 2010, Table 2 outlines the risk factors and classification criteria.

What is the best tool to stratify the risk for CBDS in patients with ACC? We suggest stratifying the risk of CBDS according to the proposed classification modified from the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons guidelines.

### Ventilatory burden in obstructive sleep apnea: A novel indicator for assessing severity [^112EpfjJ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events and is associated with increased mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD). The apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) is currently considered the gold standard for diagnosing OSA because it measures the frequency of apneas and hypopneas during sleep. However, recent studies have revealed that AHI alone is inadequate for assessing the severity of OSA because it overlooks the duration and depth of the breathing disturbance and hypoxia.

Recently, research has shown that hypoxic burden, which effectively reflects desaturation events together with respiratory events, is more significant in terms of cardiovascular complications than AHI. However, hypoxic burden does not fully characterize the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in OSA because it disregards the frequency and duration of respiratory events as well as the impact of sleep fragmentation.

In a recent journal publication, Parekh and colleagues introduced a novel metric for respiratory events known as ventilatory burden (VB). VB is defined as the proportion of breaths in which the amplitude of the inspiration airflow is less than 50% during sleep. By analyzing data from various epidemiologic and clinical cohorts, the researchers found that VB remained relatively consistent in the healthy population and was positively correlated with the severity of upper airway collapse. Moreover, the study revealed that VB could serve as a predictor for CVD and all-cause mortality in OSA. These findings suggest that VB holds potential as a novel indicator for assessing severity in OSA.

### Performance of diagnostic guidelines in the evaluation of choledocholithiasis in patients with acute biliary presentation: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112nxtLf]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Figure 2 presents the ROC and summary ROC curves for the following guidelines: (A) ASGE 2010 guidelines, (B) ASGE 2019 guidelines, and (C) ESGE guidelines. Label "1" denotes pooled sensitivity/specificity of the guidelines when used to differentiate patients at low risk from those at greater than low risk for CBDS. Label "2" indicates pooled sensitivity/specificity when used to differentiate patients at high risk from those at less than high risk for CBDS. (D) displays a graph of the summary ROC curves for the three guidelines using a jointly estimated model.

Results of heterogeneity analysis for each guideline at each diagnostic threshold are presented in Table 5. Notably, studies evaluating the ASGE 2010 guideline for its ability to discriminate patients with low risk from those with non-low risk for CBDS show appreciably higher between-study heterogeneity (0.83 of total variance), compared to studies examining the other diagnostic thresholds or the ASGE 2019 and ESGE guidelines (all < 50% of total variance). Through outlier assessments, we identified two studies evaluating ASGE 2010 guidelines, two studies evaluating ASGE 2019 guidelines, and two studies evaluating ESGE 2019 guidelines, where their performance measures depart significantly from the other included studies. However, excluding these outliers results in only small absolute changes to the overall performance of the guidelines, with AUCs of 0.71, 0.74, and 0.76 for ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines, respectively.

### Low-pressure versus standard-pressure pneumoperitoneum in laparoscopic cholecystectomy: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1172po5K]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). High credibility.

The risk of bias in the included randomized controlled trials was independently assessed by two authors using the Risk of Bias Assessment (RoB-2) tool without masking the trial names. The methodological quality of the RCTs was evaluated based on sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other sources of bias. Trials classified as low risk of bias in sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete data, and selective outcome reporting were judged to be at low bias risk.

### Defining the core components of a clinical review of people using continuous positive airway pressure therapy to treat obstructive sleep apnea: An international e-Delphi study [^113JWknX]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend regular review of individuals using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to treat obstructive sleep apnea but do not agree on the core components and frequency. We aimed to achieve consensus on essential components and frequency of review.

- **Methods**: We used an e-Delphi approach, recruiting a multidisciplinary international expert panel to identify components based on a list compiled from guidelines and to score these on a scale of 1 to 5 over three rounds. Consensus was defined as ≥ 75% agreement for scores of 4 or higher. Free-text comments were thematically analyzed.

- **Results**: Forty participants completed three rounds scoring 36 potential components. Seventeen components achieved consensus: treatment acceptability, sleep quality, symptom resolution (including reduction in apnea-hypopnea index), assessment of sleepiness (including when driving), technical CPAP issues (mask fit/humidification/cleaning/filters), recording CPAP adherence, and quality of life. Participants suggested 12 to 18 monthly reviews (more frequent when commencing CPAP) or "on demand". Free-text comments highlighted that reviews should be multidisciplinary, flexible (including telehealth), and focus on symptom control.

- **Conclusions**: We mapped 17 prioritized components to a suggested template that may support clinical reviews. Reviews should be flexible, frequently in the early stages of commencing CPAP, shifting to "on demand" and/or remote follow-up for maintenance. Our findings may inform future guideline recommendations for reviewing CPAP users.

### Management of gallstones [^113qrVME]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Many patients with gallstones can be managed expectantly. Generally, only persons with symptoms related to the presence of gallstones, such as steady, nonparoxysmal pain lasting four to six hours located in the upper abdomen, or complications like acute cholecystitis or gallstone pancreatitis, warrant surgical intervention. Biliary pain is alleviated by cholecystectomy in the majority of cases. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is considered the most cost-effective management strategy in the treatment of symptomatic gallstones. Medical management strategies are mostly palliative and are not widely supported. Patients with longer-lasting biliary pain, in combination with abdominal tenderness, fever, and/or leukocytosis, require an ultrasound evaluation to help establish a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Once a patient is diagnosed, having cholecystectomy early in the course of the disease can significantly reduce the hospital stay.

### Updated guideline on the management of common bile duct stones (CBDS) [^1178tsxF]. Gut (2017). High credibility.

Common bile duct stones (CBDS) are estimated to be present in 10–20% of individuals with symptomatic gallstones. They can result in a number of health problems, including pain, jaundice, infection, and acute pancreatitis. A variety of imaging modalities can be employed to identify the condition, while management of confirmed cases of CBDS may involve endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, surgery, and radiological methods of stone extraction.

Clinicians are therefore confronted with a number of potentially valid options to diagnose and treat individuals with suspected CBDS. The British Society of Gastroenterology first published a guideline on the management of CBDS in 2008. Since then, a number of developments in management have occurred along with further systematic reviews of the available evidence. The following recommendations reflect these changes and provide updated guidance to healthcare professionals who are involved in the care of adult patients with suspected or proven CBDS. It is not a protocol, and the recommendations contained within should not replace individual clinical judgement.

### Performance of diagnostic guidelines in the evaluation of choledocholithiasis in patients with acute biliary presentation: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Nrvi1]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

- **Abstract**. Optimal management of acute biliary disease should include an assessment for possible choledocholithiasis (CBDS). Various diagnostic guidelines have been developed by expert bodies for this purpose, but uncertainties remain about their performance in wider practice.

- **Methods**. For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus for studies on adult populations published in English between 2000 and August 2024. All studies pertaining to the performance of diagnostic guidelines developed or adopted by regional, national, or international professional bodies were considered. We excluded diagnostic tools or scoring systems developed locally with limited scopes, such as those employed by a single institution or a group of related institutions. We extracted or derived performance measures in the forms of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative and performed meta-analysis using a multilevel random effects model to calculate pooled sensitivity and specificity for the reviewed guidelines. Their performance was summarized using summary ROC curves and AUCs. The quality of the evidence was assessed with the PROBAST risk of bias and applicability tool. This study is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024581409).

- **Findings**. Of 1892 records identified, 31 studies were eligible with data available, all of which had a low to moderate risk of overall bias. All studies focused on one or more of three international guidelines, namely the ASGE guidelines in 2010, the revised ASGE guidelines in 2019, and the ESG.

### 2016 WSES guidelines on acute calculous cholecystitis [^116mDdH7]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

- **Use of percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC)**: PC could be considered as a possible alternative to surgery after the failure of conservative treatment in a small subset of patients unfit for emergency surgery due to their severe comorbidities. The Tokyo Guidelines on acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC) consider gallbladder drainage as mandatory in severe grade (according to the Tokyo classification) acute cholecystitis and also suggest its use in moderate grade if conservative treatment fails. The panel of the Tokyo Guidelines states that it is known to be an effective option in critically ill patients, especially in elderly patients and patients with complications; however, there is a lack of good-quality evidence to support the statement.

- **Comparative studies**: Hatzidakis et al. published in 2002 a randomized trial comparing PC with conservative treatment in patients with acute acalculous cholecystitis or ACC; there were no significant differences in mortality and morbidity. Akyurek et al. published in 2005 a trial where patients with ACC were randomized to receive PC followed by early laparoscopic cholecystectomy or conservative treatment followed by delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy. There were no differences in terms of mortality and morbidity; PC plus early laparoscopic cholecystectomy resulted in a reduction of the length of stay and costs.

- **Retrospective case-control study**: Melloul et al. in 2011 published a retrospective case-control study in critically ill patients with biliary sepsis treated by early laparoscopic cholecystectomy or PC; mortality was not different between the two treatments, but early laparoscopic cholecystectomy was associated with significantly higher rates of complications.

### Impact of standard-pressure and low-pressure pneumoperitoneum on shoulder pain following laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a randomised controlled trial [^1163UEYn]. Surgical Endoscopy (2017). High credibility.

The incidence of shoulder pain (SP) following laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) varies between 21% and 80%. A few randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses have shown lesser SP in LC performed under low-pressure carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum (LPCP) than under standard-pressure carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum (SPCP). However, the possible compromise in adequate exposure and effective working space during LPCP has negatively influenced its uniform adoption for LC.

- **Materials and methods**: All consecutive patients undergoing elective LC for gallstone disease who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled. Forty patients were randomised to the SPCP group (pressure of 14 mmHg) and 40 to the LPCP group (pressure of 9–10 mmHg). The primary outcome measured was the incidence of SP and its severity on the visual analogue scale (VAS) at 4, 8, 24 hours, and 7 days after LC. Secondary outcomes measured were procedural time, technical difficulty, surgeons' satisfaction score on exposure and working space, intra-operative changes in heart rate and blood pressure, abdominal pain, and analgesic requirement. Analyses were performed using Stata software.

- **Results**: There was no conversion to open surgery, bile duct injury, or need to increase intra-abdominal pressure in either group. Twenty-three patients (57.5%) in the SPCP group and nine patients (22.5%) in the LPCP group had SP (p = 0.001). The severity of SP was significantly more in the SPCP group at 8 and 24 hours (p = 0.009 and 0.005, respectively). Both groups had similar procedural time, surgeons' satisfaction score, and intra-operative changes.
