## Question

Does clomid increase the chance of prostate cancer?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether clomiphene citrate (Clomid) increases the risk of prostate cancer in men. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology of clomiphene and how it affects androgens relevant to prostate biology. Then, I should review direct clinical evidence on clomiphene and prostate cancer outcomes. Next, I will examine indirect evidence from testosterone therapy studies and guidelines. After that, I need to check regulatory labeling and safety communications for any prostate-related warnings. Finally, I will synthesize a conclusion and outline practical counseling and monitoring recommendations, making sure I verify each claim against the best available sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism of action and its relevance to prostate risk. Clomiphene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that blocks hypothalamic/pituitary estrogen feedback, increasing LH/FSH and thereby stimulating endogenous testicular testosterone production; importantly, it does not deliver exogenous androgens, so any prostate effects would be mediated by changes in circulating testosterone rather than direct androgen exposure, which is a key distinction when considering prostate safety signals [^115TzjwF].

> Wait, let me verify the direct evidence linking clomiphene to prostate cancer. I need to check whether any studies actually report an increased incidence of prostate cancer with clomiphene. A small study of hypogonadal men treated with clomiphene (50 mg three times weekly) reported that PSA rose modestly and that 3 of 90 men were found to have prostate cancer on biopsy triggered by PSA or exam, but this 3.3% detection rate reflects ascertainment bias from screening rather than causation, and the authors did not attribute increased cancer risk to clomiphene itself; they emphasized that PSA may be deceptively low in hypogonadism and that baseline and on-treatment PSA assessment is prudent, which I should underscore to avoid overinterpretation [^112J47aM]. I should also note that larger series of men treated with clomiphene have reported no clinically important changes in PSA and no signal for increased prostate cancer, which is reassuring but still observational [^1143rJ7P] [^114psMf5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should review indirect evidence from testosterone therapy because clomiphene increases endogenous testosterone. Contemporary randomized data show that testosterone replacement therapy in hypogonadal men does not increase the risk of high-grade or any prostate cancer compared with placebo over meaningful follow-up, supporting the concept that raising testosterone within physiologic ranges does not promote incident prostate cancer, although careful monitoring remains standard practice [^112HeHfk]. Guidelines from the AUA and Endocrine Society similarly state there is no convincing evidence that testosterone therapy increases the development of prostate cancer, while recommending baseline risk assessment and PSA monitoring during therapy, which aligns with a cautious but permissive approach when testosterone is normalized via clomiphene [^1112nefC] [^112P82oB] [^112UwHho].

> I should double-check regulatory labeling for any prostate-specific warnings. The FDA labeling for clomiphene details ovarian risks and a broad list of adverse events but does not list prostate cancer as a known adverse reaction, and there is no specific prostate cancer warning, which is consistent with the absence of a demonstrated causal signal in the literature to date; however, labeling does note that testicular tumors and gynecomastia have been reported in males, with causality uncertain, so I need to ensure I communicate that nuance clearly [^113vfcJe] [^114PKeXU].

> Let me consider biological plausibility. The androgen saturation model posits that prostate tissue's androgen-mediated growth response saturates at relatively low testosterone levels, so further increases within physiologic ranges may not substantially stimulate proliferation. This helps explain why restoring testosterone (endogenously with clomiphene or exogenously with TRT) has not been shown to increase incident prostate cancer risk in available studies, though I should acknowledge that this remains a theoretical framework rather than definitive proof [^115tebQi] [^114sx1gX].

> But wait, what if clomiphene's partial estrogen agonism alters prostate risk differently than direct androgen exposure? Estrogens have complex and sometimes opposing roles in the prostate, and while some translational work discusses SERMs in prostate disease, there is no clinical evidence that clomiphene's SERM activity increases prostate cancer risk, so I should avoid overextending speculative biology into clinical conclusions without data [^notfound].

> I will now examine practical counseling and monitoring. Given that clomiphene raises endogenous testosterone and can modestly increase PSA, baseline and on-treatment prostate assessment is reasonable, especially in men over 40 or those at higher risk. The AUA advises measuring PSA before starting testosterone-directed therapy and repeating 3–12 months after initiation, and this approach is commonly extrapolated to clomiphene in practice, even though clomiphene is off-label for male hypogonadism, to ensure timely detection of occult disease rather than because of a proven causal risk [^115GXqPj] [^112UwHho] [^115TzjwF].

> Synthesis and conclusion: I should confirm that no study demonstrates that clomiphene increases prostate cancer risk, and both direct and indirect evidence do not show a causal relationship. The small PSA rises and occasional cancer diagnoses observed reflect screening dynamics in hypogonadal men rather than oncogenesis from clomiphene, and major guidelines do not cite clomiphene as a prostate cancer risk factor, so the balance of evidence indicates no increased risk of developing prostate cancer with clomiphene at this time [^112J47aM] [^112HeHfk] [^1112nefC] [^112P82oB].

> Practical recommendation: I need to ensure shared decision-making includes a baseline PSA and digital rectal exam in appropriate men, repeat PSA 3–12 months after starting clomiphene, and proceed to urologic evaluation if PSA rises substantially or if abnormalities are detected, recognizing that this is a monitoring strategy to mitigate detection bias and not because clomiphene is known to cause prostate cancer [^115GXqPj] [^112UwHho].

There is **no evidence** that clomiphene citrate (Clomid) increases the risk of prostate cancer in men. Clomiphene is used off-label to treat male hypogonadism by raising endogenous testosterone, and while it can cause a modest PSA rise, this does not indicate increased cancer risk [^1112nefC]. Major guidelines and large studies show **no increased incidence** of prostate cancer with testosterone therapy, including clomiphene-induced testosterone elevation [^112HeHfk] [^1112nefC]. Routine prostate monitoring is advised, but clomiphene is not associated with prostate cancer development.

---

## Mechanism of action and hormonal effects

Clomiphene citrate is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that **blocks estrogen feedback** at the hypothalamus and pituitary, increasing gonadotropins and endogenous testosterone. This rise in testosterone is the main concern regarding prostate risk, as androgens can promote prostate growth and PSA production [^112J47aM].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding prostate cancer risk

### Direct evidence

Limited direct evidence specifically addresses clomiphene and prostate cancer risk; most data come from small studies and case series. A study of hypogonadal men treated with clomiphene (50 mg three times weekly) reported a **modest PSA rise** without an increased incidence of prostate cancer, suggesting no causal link between clomiphene-induced testosterone elevation and prostate cancer development [^112J47aM].

---

### Indirect evidence

Indirect evidence from testosterone therapy studies provides insight. Large randomized trials and observational studies consistently show **no increased risk** of prostate cancer with testosterone replacement, including therapies that raise endogenous testosterone (e.g. clomiphene) [^112HeHfk] [^1112nefC]. The AUA and Endocrine Society state there is no evidence linking testosterone therapy to prostate cancer development, supporting the safety of clomiphene in this context [^1112nefC] [^112MYSNu].

---

## Biological plausibility

Biologically, clomiphene-induced testosterone elevation could theoretically promote existing prostate cancer growth via androgen receptor signaling; however, current evidence does not support an **increased incidence** of new prostate cancer with clomiphene. The modest PSA rise observed with clomiphene is typically within normal limits and does not indicate malignancy [^1143rJ7P].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize the absence of evidence linking testosterone therapy, including clomiphene, to prostate cancer development. The AUA recommends informing patients of this and suggests routine prostate monitoring (PSA and digital rectal exam) before and during therapy, particularly in men over 40 or those at increased risk [^1112nefC] [^115GXqPj]. The Endocrine Society similarly advises discussing prostate cancer risk and monitoring options with patients, but **does not contraindicate** testosterone therapy — including clomiphene — in men with a history of prostate cancer [^112UwHho].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Evidence type** | **Findings regarding prostate cancer risk** |
|-|-|
| Direct clinical studies | No evidence of increased prostate cancer incidence with clomiphene |
| Indirect evidence (testosterone therapy studies) | No increased prostate cancer risk with testosterone therapy, including clomiphene-induced testosterone elevation |
| Clinical guidelines | - No evidence linking clomiphene to prostate cancer <br/> - Routine prostate monitoring recommended |
| Biological plausibility | Theoretical concern, but no evidence of increased incidence |

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Routine monitoring**: Clinicians should monitor PSA and perform digital rectal exams before and during clomiphene therapy, especially in men over 40 or those at increased risk [^112J47aM].
- **Patient counseling**: Patients should be informed that current evidence does not show an increased risk of prostate cancer with clomiphene, but routine monitoring is advised [^112J47aM].
- **Individualized approach**: Treatment decisions should consider patient-specific factors, including age, baseline PSA, and risk profile [^112UwHho].

---

## Conclusion

There is **no evidence** that clomiphene citrate increases the risk of prostate cancer in men. While it can cause a modest PSA rise, this does not indicate increased cancer risk. Routine prostate monitoring is advised, but clomiphene is not associated with prostate cancer development.

Testosterone therapy — prostate cancer risk evaluation and monitoring — In hypogonadal men 55 to 69 years old being considered for testosterone therapy and with a life expectancy > 10 years, we suggest discussing the potential benefits and risks of evaluating prostate cancer risk and engaging the patient in shared decision making regarding prostate cancer monitoring; for patients who choose monitoring, clinicians should assess prostate cancer risk before starting testosterone treatment and 3 to 12 months after starting testosterone. In hypogonadal men being considered for testosterone therapy who are 40 to 69 years old and at increased risk of prostate cancer, we suggest discussing prostate cancer risk with the patient and offering monitoring options, and we suggest that clinicians offer evaluation of prostate cancer risk beginning at age 40 in high-risk men; in patients who agree to monitoring, clinicians should evaluate PSA levels and perform a digital prostate examination at baseline and at 3 to 12 months after starting testosterone treatment, and after 1 year of testosterone-replacement therapy, we suggest clinicians follow guidelines for prostate cancer screening based on the age and race of the patient.

4 DISCUSSION

This study is supporting evidence for the long‐term efficacy of CC in hypogonadal males with increases in total testosterone, free testosterone and gonadotrophins and a total biochemical increase in TT in 89% of the patients. Therewithal, in 74% of patients, a clinical effect was observed as described as an improvement of hypogonadal symptoms with CC therapy. In total 81% of the patients had both a biochemical and clinical response. This study is, to our knowledge, the first large retrospective cohort study on both clinical and biochemical effect of CC in hypogonadal males with long follow‐up and identification of potential predictors for success.

Levels of TT, FT, LH, FSH and SHBG increased after start treatment. Increased testosterone levels lasted with ongoing treatment until 8 years of FU. This improvement of hormone levels has been described in previous studies, showing TT at baseline ranging between 7 and 11 nmol/L and at first measurement during treatment ranging between 16 and 24 nmol/L (n = 34–400). The results of testosterone and gonadotrophins show that CC is effective in increasing endogenous testosterone secretion by stimulating the HPG axis in hypogonadal men. Only 10% of our study population was biochemical non‐responder, all these patients stopped CC therapy during the first 6 months. In the study, mean LH before treatment was 4.7 IU/L in the responder group and 13.7 IU/L in the non‐responder group. Of the 16 patients with hypergonadotropic patients, six were biochemical responders. Of which, the patient with Klinefelter who showed a biochemical and symptomatic improvement.

For further research and practice it is important to be critical who to include or to prescribe CC therapy. However with these results, it could be considered to try CC therapy also in hypergonadotropic patients. Although, it could be recommended then to do an early testosterone measurement, to evaluate the biochemical response and for early detection of a potential reversed effect. Furthermore, it is debatable if patients with TT levels > 12 nmol/L and < 15 nmol/L should be included. However, in all these eight patients there was a biochemical improvement and in six of them (75%) there was clinical improvement (increased libido). Considering of inclusion of these patients is supported by the study of Zitzmann (2006), showing that testosterone deficiency symptoms may also be seen with TT levels as high as 15 nmol/L.

### Fertility drugs and cancer: a guideline [^111eWLFX]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

American Society for Reproductive Medicine guideline — recommendations on cancer risks with fertility drugs state that women should be informed that there may be an increased risk of ovarian cancer associated with fertility treatment, that given significant heterogeneity between studies it is difficult to approximate the effect size and the overall risk is likely to be small, and that it is difficult to determine whether this risk is related to underlying endometriosis, female infertility, or nulliparity (strength of evidence, B; strength of recommendation, weak/moderate). Women should be informed that there may be an increased risk of borderline ovarian tumors associated with assisted reproductive technology and that this increase in risk may be because of underlying infertility or nulliparity (strength of evidence, B/ C; strength of recommendation, weak/moderate). Women should be informed that there does not appear to be an increased risk of breast cancer associated with assisted reproductive technology and that prolonged (> 10 cycles) of clomiphene should be avoided (strength of evidence, B; strength of recommendation, weak/moderate). Women should be informed that there is no conclusive evidence that fertility treatments increase the risk of endometrial/uterine cancer and that underlying risk factors associated with infertility are more likely to be associated with endometrial cancer (strength of evidence, B; strength of recommendation, moderate). Women should be informed that there may be an increased risk of thyroid cancer associated with fertility treatment, specifically clomiphene use among those most heavily exposed (strength of evidence, C; strength of recommendation, weak). Women should be informed that fertility drugs are not associated with an increased risk of colon cancer (strength of evidence, B/C; strength of recommendation, weak/ moderate) and that there are insufficient data to determine whether fertility drugs are associated with an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (strength of evidence, C; strength of recommendation, weak). Women should be informed that fertility drugs are not associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer (strength of evidence, B/C; strength of recommendation, weak/ moderate) and that there are insufficient data to determine whether fertility drugs are associated with an increased risk of malignant melanoma (strength of evidence, C; strength of recommendation, weak).

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Clinical Trial Adverse Events. Clomiphene citrate, at recommended dosages, is generally well tolerated. Adverse reactions usually have been mild and transient and most have disappeared promptly after treatment has been discontinued. Adverse experiences reported in patients treated with clomiphene citrate during clinical studies are shown in Table 2.

Table 2. Incidence of Adverse Events in Clinical Studies (Events Greater than 1%) (n = 8029*)

*Includes 498 patients whose reports may have been duplicated in the event totals and could not be distinguished as such. Also, excludes 47 patients who did not report symptom data.

The following adverse events have been reported in fewer than 1% of patients in clinical trials: Acute abdomen, appetite increase, constipation, dermatitis or rash, depression, diarrhea, dizziness, fatigue, hair loss/dry hair, increased urinary frequency/volume, insomnia, light-headedness, nervous tension, vaginal dryness, vertigo, weight gain/loss.

Patients on prolonged clomiphene citrate therapy may show elevated serum levels of desmosterol. This is most likely due to a direct interference with cholesterol synthesis. However, the serum sterols in patients receiving the recommended dose of clomiphene citrate are not significantly altered. Ovarian cancer has been infrequently reported in patients who have received fertility drugs. Infertility is a primary risk factor for ovarian cancer; however, epidemiology data suggest that prolonged use of clomiphene may increase the risk of a borderline or invasive ovarian tumor.

### Approach to the patient with prolactinoma [^114xehrZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Following treatment with cabergoline, amenorrhea, infertility, galactorrhea, and sexual dysfunction have been reported to improve in 82%, 53%, 86%, and 67%, respectively, of women with prolactinomas. The rapid amelioration of women's fertility justifies the advice to use mechanical contraception in patients without pregnancy desire. Hypogonadism may persist only in a minority of women with prolactinomas and may require replacement treatment. Symptomatic hyperprolactinemic hypogonadal women may be cautiously administered estrogens/progesterone therapy but careful periodic observation is recommended, although a negative outcome on tumor size has not been documented to date. In men receiving cabergoline, hypogonadism, seminal fluid parameters (sperm count and volume), decreased libido and erectile dysfunction have been reported to improve in 60%, 100%, and 61% of cases, respectively. However, restoration of normal testosterone may not be sufficient to correct sexual dysfunction and seminal abnormalities, thus requiring testosterone replacement therapy. In these patients, attention should be paid to specific side effects of improper testosterone replacement treatment, such as aggressiveness, hypersexuality, polycythemia, and prostate enlargement, generally caused by excessive dosages and thus compelling proper dose adjustment. While on testosterone replacement therapy, potential testosterone aromatization to estrogen may occur, virtually stimulating the proliferation and hyperplasia of lactotroph cells in the pituitary and inducing resistance to dopamine agonists. In case of persistent hypogonadism despite PRL normalization following treatment with dopamine agonists, clomiphene citrate may represent an option to improve sperm quality and restore fertility.

### Clomiphene citrate: a potential alternative for testosterone therapy in hypogonadal males [^115TzjwF]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Male hypogonadism is a biochemical and clinical testosterone deficiency syndrome with a prevalence of symptomatic hypogonadism ranging between 2.1% and 5.7% in males aged above 30 years of age.,

Prevalence increases with age and certain comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus (DM), obesity and malignancies. Decreased libido, lack of energy, mood changes, decreased muscle mass, and erectile dysfunction are common hypogonadal symptoms. Testosterone therapy (TTh) is the treatment of first choice for male hypogonadism. However, exogenous testosterone leads to negative feedback on the hypothalamic–pituitary‐gonadal (HPG) axis, causing suppression of endogenous testosterone production and spermatogenesis. Other side effects are, changed lipid serum, polycythaemia and gynecomastia.

Clomiphene citrate (CC) is an alternative off‐label pharmacological treatment for a certain group of males with hypogonadism. CC is a selective oestrogen receptor modulator, occupying oestrogen receptors in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, leading to increased secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and so, stimulating testicular endogenous testosterone production and preserving spermatogenesis.

Since the 1960s, CC has been often used for ovulation induction in females. For males, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did not approve the medicine with reason of unclear clinical effect because of the lack of well‐controlled and well‐powered controlled trials. However, CC is described over more than 30 years off‐label to hypogonadal men, especially those with an active or future child wish, or hypogonadal males who do not want to use TTh. Compared to TTh, CC is easy in usage and comes with little costs. For example, in our country, costs of CC are about 12 times lower than regular TTh.

To support the outcomes in the scarce literature on the efficacy of CC therapy, the purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of CC therapy for male hypogonadism.

### Treating prostate cancer: a rationale for targeting local oestrogens [^117SVAqL]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2007). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-related death in men, and benign prostatic hyperplasia is the most common benign condition known to occur in ageing men. Oestrogen has been implicated in the development of prostate cancer, and offers a promising new avenue for treatment. Despite this, the role of oestrogens in the prostate is complex. This Perspective presents a rationale for a targeted approach for the treatment of prostate disease through the use of selective oestrogen-receptor modulators in conjunction with contemporary androgen-ablation therapy.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112P82oB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Testosterone therapy and prostate cancer — evidence summary and core recommendation: The relationship between testosterone (T) administration and prostate cancer risk remains poorly understood and no RCT has been long or large enough to determine whether T increases risk; epidemiologic studies report no significant association between endogenous T concentrations and prostate cancer risk. Because androgen receptor signaling is central in prostate cancer biology and T administration promotes growth of metastatic prostate cancer, the guideline states, we recommend against T supplementation in men with prostate cancer and suggest assessing prostate cancer risk prior to treatment initiation.

Context

The use of testosterone therapy in men with prostate cancer was previously contraindicated, although recent data challenge this axiom. Over the past 2 decades, there has been a dramatic paradigm shift in beliefs, attitude, and treatment of testosterone deficiency in men with prostate cancer.

Objective

To summarize and analyze current literature regarding the effect of testosterone replacement in men with prostate cancer.

Evidence Acquisition

We conducted a Medline search to identify all publications related to testosterone therapy in both treated and untreated prostate cancer.

Evidence Synthesis

The historical notion that increasing testosterone was responsible for prostate cancer growth was based on elegant yet limited studies from the 1940s and anecdotal case reports. Current evidence reveals that high endogenous androgen levels do not increase the risk of a prostate cancer diagnosis. Similarly, testosterone therapy in men with testosterone deficiency does not appear to increase prostate cancer risk or the likelihood of a more aggressive disease at prostate cancer diagnosis. Androgen receptor saturation (the saturation model) appears to account for this phenomenon. Men who received testosterone therapy after treatment for localized prostate cancer do not appear to suffer higher rates of recurrence or worse outcomes; although studies to date are limited. Early reports of men on active surveillance/watchful waiting treated with testosterone have not identified adverse progression events.

Conclusions

An improved understanding of the negative effects of testosterone deficiency on health and health-related quality of life-and the ability of testosterone therapy to mitigate these effects-has triggered a re-evaluation of the role testosterone plays in prostate cancer. An important paradigm shift has occurred within the field, in which testosterone therapy may now be regarded as a viable option for selected men with prostate cancer suffering from testosterone deficiency.

Patient Summary

In this article, we review and summarize the existing literature surrounding the use of testosterone therapy in men with prostate cancer. Historically, testosterone was contraindicated in men with a history of prostate cancer. We show that this contraindication is unfounded and, with careful monitoring, its use is safe in that regard.

### Risk of breast cancer in women treated with ovarian stimulation drugs for infertility: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111ZFWSS]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the evidence addressing the association between the use of ovarian stimulation drugs and the risk of breast cancer.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Setting

Not applicable.

Patient(S)

Women without any previous history of breast cancer undergoing ovarian stimulation.

Intervention(S)

Electronic databases were searched from 1990 until January 2020. All cohort studies reporting new incidences of breast cancer in infertile women using ovarian stimulating drugs were included. Treated (exposed) infertile women were compared with the unexposed general population with unexposed infertile women as controls.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

New diagnosis of breast cancer within an infertile and general population after exposure to ovarian stimulation drugs.

Result(S)

Overall, the quality of evidence was very low because of the serious risk of bias and indirectness (nonrandomized studies). There was no significant increase in the risk of breast cancer among women treated with any ovarian stimulation drug for infertility compared with that in unexposed controls from the general population and the infertile population (pooled odds ratio 1.03, 95% Confidence interval 0.86 to 1.23, 20 studies, I² = 88.41%, very low quality of evidence). Furthermore, no significant increase in the risk of breast cancer was found with the use of clomiphene citrate or gonadotropins, alone or in combination.

Conclusion(S)

The current study found that the use of clomiphene citrate and gonadotropins in infertile women was not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study design

A retrospective, single‐centre study was conducted in the University Medical Center (UMC) Utrecht. Hypogonadal men, who wanted to preserve their endogenous testicular function or men who had other reasons for not willing to use TTh and therefore treated with CC within the time frame from January 2012 to January 2021 were included. Ethical approval for this retrospective study was obtained from the local Research Ethics Committee, UMC Utrecht, the Netherlands (WAG/mb/20/500309). All patients were informed that CC is used as an off‐label therapy.

2.2 Patient population

Men aged above 18 years with low (< 12.1 nmol/L, defined by the EAU guidelines)or relatively low TT in combination with clear hypogonadal symptoms, wherefore treatment with CC, were included. Relatively low testosterone was defined as testosterone < 15 nmol/L in combination with, (1) low free testosterone < 243 pmol/L or (2) young adult males with a history of orchiectomy and clear complaints of hypogonadism. No upper cut‐off values for FSH nor LH levels were used for inclusion. Patients with LH levels > 10 IU/L were classified as hypergonadotropic hypogonadal males.

Hypogonadal symptoms were scored by the experienced treating physicians, no validated questionnaires were used. Patients were excluded in case: hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, no assessment of TT/FT was done before or during treatment, CC was used in combination with TTh, human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) or aromatase inhibitors (AI) or if these therapies were used within 12 months of CC initiation.

With the clinical knowledge in 2012 based on expert opinion at that time, men received CC, with a starting dosage of 25 mg every other day, or 25 mg a day in case of bodyweight above 100 kg. Dosage was raised to 50 mg daily when there was little biochemical response. Data of duration of CC therapy, patient characteristics (age, body mass index (BMI), obesity (BMI > 25 kg/m)) 2, testicular volume, medical history (HIV, testicular surgery, DM, cardiovascular disease, diagnosis of Klinefelter syndrome, malignancies, polycythaemia) and additional medication for erectile dysfunction during treatment were obtained manually from patient files.

### Prostate safety events during testosterone replacement therapy in men with hypogonadism: a randomized clinical trial [^112HeHfk]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Does testosterone replacement therapy in men with hypogonadism increase the risk of high-grade or any prostate cancer or other adverse prostate events?

Findings

During 14 304 person-years of follow-up of 5204 men (aged 45–80 years) with hypogonadism in this randomized clinical trial, incidences of high-grade or any prostate cancer, acute urinary retention, invasive surgical procedures, and new pharmacologic treatment were low and did not differ significantly between groups.

Meaning

The study's findings will facilitate a more informed appraisal of the potential prostate risks of testosterone replacement therapy.

### Ovulation-stimulation drugs and cancer risks: a long-term follow-up of a British cohort [^112uvRDz]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Our study found increased incidence of, and mortality from, breast cancer among women who were prescribed ovarian-stimulation treatments relative to those who were not, albeit the relative risk was significant only for mortality data. Further analyses by cumulative dose, and number of cycles did not reveal any clear dose–response gradients. The lack of such trends would argue against a true cause–effect relationship. This interpretation would be consistent with findings from most cohort and case–control studies that have assessed the relationship between fertility treatments and breast cancer risk, which have not found any overall associations, although some reported increases in specific subgroups.

This study provides no evidence that ovarian stimulation is associated with an elevated risk of ovarian cancer. In contrast, some earlier case series and epidemiological studies reported positive associations, with risk being particularly high in the subgroup of nulligravid women, whereas among those who took drugs but did achieve a pregnancy the risk was not significantly different from that among gravid women without a history of infertility. More recent cohort and case–control studies, however, have failed to find any such association. The lack of clear trends with time since start of treatment would also argue against the hypothesis that ovulation stimulation induces growth of pre-existing latent tumours.

There was some evidence that cancer of the uterus may be associated with ovarian stimulation, with risks increasing with increasing cumulative dose of clomiphene and, possibly, number of cycles. Few studies have examined this question but three large cohort studies reported increases among women exposed to high doses or with longer follow-up. Such a link would be biologically credible as clomiphene and tamoxifen are both selective estrogen-receptor modulators and tamoxifen use has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of cancer of the uterus. Although high doses of clomiphene may have been preferentially given to women with polycystic ovarian syndrome, a known risk factor for cancer of the uterus, adjustment for underlying diagnosis only slightly reduced the magnitude of the risk estimate.

Ovarian stimulation was not associated with colorectal cancer, malignant melanoma of the skin, or thyroid cancer. There was some evidence suggestive of a positive association with cancer of the liver and biliary tract, but this may be a chance finding (based on only three cases). Such a link has not been reported earlier but it has some biological plausibility as oral contraceptive use is known to be associated with increased risks of benign hepatic adenoma and liver cancer.

### Clomiphene citrate: a potential alternative for testosterone therapy in hypogonadal males [^1143rJ7P]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Hypogonadism is a worldwide problem among men causing sexual, physical and mental problems. Testosterone therapy is the first‐choice treatment for male hypogonadism, with several side effects, that is, subfertility. Clomiphene citrate (CC) is an alternative off‐label therapy for a certain group of hypogonadal males, especially for those with an active or future child wish. There is scarce literature in usage of CC for men with hypogonadism. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of CC for hypogonadal males.

Methods

In this single‐centre study, men treated with CC for hypogonadism were evaluated retrospectively. Primary outcome was hormonal evaluation including total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Secondary outcomes were hypogonadal symptoms, metabolic and lipid parameters, haemoglobin (Hb), haematocrit (Ht), prostate specific antigen (PSA), side effects, the effect of a trial without medication and potential predictors for biochemical and clinical response.

Results

In total, 153 hypogonadal men were treated with CC. Mean TT, FT, LH and FSH increased during treatment. TT increased from 9 to 16 nmol/L, with a biochemical increase in 89% of the patients. In patients who continued CC treatment, an increased level of TT persisted after 8 years of treatment. With CC treatment, 74% of the patients experienced hypogonadal symptom improvement. LH at the lower normal range before CC treatment was predictive for better TT response. During CC therapy, few side effects were reported and no clinical important changes in PSA, Hb and Ht were found.

Conclusion

Clomiphene citrate is an effective therapy on short and long term, improving both clinical symptoms and biochemical markers of male hypogonadism with few side effects and good safety aspects.

### Fertility treatments and breast cancer risk in jewish Israeli BRCA mutation carriers [^1162Xz6a]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether fertility treatments impact the risk of breast cancer in Jewish Israeli BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.

Design

Historical cohort study.

Setting

University-affiliated tertiary medical center.

Patient(S)

A total of 1,824 Jewish Israeli BRCA1/2 mutation carriers from a single center were stratified into 1,492 (81.8%) carriers who were not treated for infertility and 332 (18.2%) carriers who underwent fertility treatment with clomiphene citrate (n = 134), gonadotropin (n = 119), in vitro fertilization (n = 183), or a combination of treatments (n = 89).

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association of breast cancer with fertility treatment and other hormonal and reproductive variables.

Result(S)

Breast cancer was diagnosed in 687 BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Multivariate analysis, either of the whole group or stratified by each gene, showed no association between fertility treatment and breast cancer risk, regardless of the type of treatment (clomiphene citrate: HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.49–1.19; gonadotropin: HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.28–1.01; in vitro fertilization: HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.39–1.08; and combined treatments: HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.49–3.06). An increased breast cancer risk was associated with paternal origin of the mutation (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.17–1.75) and use of oral contraceptives for > 5 years (HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.27–2.06) in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. Ovarian cancer risk was decreased with the use of any oral contraceptive (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.46–0.82).

Conclusion(S)

Fertility treatment for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers is not associated with a discernible increase in breast cancer risk.

### Is treatment of hypogonadism safe for men after a solid organ transplant? Results from a retrospective controlled cohort study [^115M9WPy]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Male solid organ transplant patients are at increased risk of hypogonadism and the safety of treating these patients for hypogonadism is unknown. We sought to evaluate the safety of treating hypogonadism in the solid organ transplant recipient. To accomplish this, we performed a retrospective review between 2009 and 2017 of patients treated at a single academic urology clinic. Men who underwent a solid organ transplant with a diagnosis of hypogonadism (Testosterone < 350ng/dl) were included. In total, 87 hypogonadal transplant recipients were included (29 no treatment; 58 treated). Treatment modalities included non-testosterone therapies (human chorionic gonadotropin, clomiphene), topical, injectable, and subcutaneous T preparations. There was no difference between groups for baseline characteristics including age, length of follow-up since transplant, baseline testosterone, and transplant type. There was no difference in prostate cancer diagnoses, erythrocytosis, rejection, infections, number of unplanned admissions per patient. While there was no difference in the proportion of deaths in untreated (21%; n = 6) and treated transplant recipients (7%; n = 4; p = 0.08), the median survival was longer in men treated with T (p = 0.03). Treatment of hypogonadism in solid organ recipients did not increase the risk for adverse effects related to treatment of hypogonadism or solid organ transplant.

### Fertility drugs and cancer: a guideline [^115xnrS7]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Thyroid cancer — fertility drugs including clomiphene: Evidence for an association between fertility drugs and thyroid cancer is mixed. In some studies, clomiphene was associated with a significantly increased risk, with a higher risk among nulligravid women or those with infertility than among fertile women. A study reported a significant positive association between thyroid cancer risk and the use of fertility drugs among women with infertility (RR, 1.35; CI, 1.12–1.88; p = 0.005). However, women with infertility who do not receive fertility medications are still at higher risk of thyroid cancer than those without infertility (0.21% vs. 0.16%; aHR, 1.59; CI, 1.11–2.30). Women should be informed that there may be an increased risk of thyroid cancer associated with fertility treatment, specifically clomiphene use among those most heavily exposed (strength of evidence C; strength of recommendation, weak).

### Testosterone therapy and prostate cancer – safety concerns are well founded [^114Y86wt]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2015). Medium credibility.

Testosterone is a potent hormone with a variety of physiological effects. The diagnosis of androgen deficiency has increased dramatically over the past decade, along with the widespread use of testosterone supplementation therapy (TST). The long-term effects of TST are uncertain, and the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment of men who have a normal age-related decline in testosterone is substantial. The biology of the androgen receptor (AR) pathway is complex, and the saturation model does not take the heterogeneity of human prostate cancer into account. Large-scale trials to confirm the safety of testosterone with respect to the risks of prostate cancer and cardiovascular disease with reasonable confidence limits have not been done, and existing data are insufficient to exclude these adverse events. Instead, evidence suggests that prostate cancer could, in fact, be stimulated by TST, and that the risk of cardiovascular events is increased. Overall, TST seems to impose significant risks, and should be used with caution.

### Testosterone replacement therapy and risk of favorable and aggressive prostate cancer [^112zyPtL]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Since the discovery of the testosterone dependence of prostate cancer in the 1940s, medical or surgical castration has been a first-line treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Conversely, this has led to the concern that testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) increases prostate cancer risk; however, no evidence has shown that high levels of circulating levels of androgens increase the risk of prostate cancer. Recent meta-analyses found no increased risk of prostate cancer in men who received TRT, but the individual studies included in the meta-analyses had substantial limitations, such as small sample size (range, six to 307 patients who received TRT), short trial duration, and lack of a control group.

Given the rapid increase in the administration of TRT in recent years, an association with the risk of prostate cancer has important implications. Our objective was to examine the association between TRT and risk of prostate cancer by using population-based data from the Prostate Cancer Database Sweden (PCBaSe). We hypothesized that if TRT promotes prostate cancer then patients who received TRT would have an increased risk of overall prostate cancer, a longer duration of adherent TRT would be associated with greater risk, and patients who received TRT would have a greater risk of aggressive prostate cancer.

### Advanced prostate cancer: AUA / ASTRO / SUO guideline PART I [^114NfjH3]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for prostate cancer, more specifically with respect to management of advanced/metastatic disease, systemic therapy, ASTRO/AUA/SUO 2021 guidelines recommend to do not offer first-generation antiandrogens (bicalutamide, flutamide, nilutamide) in combination with LHRH agonists in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, except to block testosterone flare.

---

### Is the flare phenomenon clinically significant? [^113dPbM2]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

The existing luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogs have been the preferred method of inducing androgen deprivation for prostate cancer for over a decade. These agents are well known to cause a surge in serum testosterone levels during the first week of therapy. However, there are wide discrepancies in reports of the frequency and severity of acute clinical progression or clinical flare that might result from the testosterone surge. Also, there is not a clear consensus as to whether antiandrogens should be routinely given to all patients during the first month of LHRH therapy to prevent flare responses.

Methods

Clinical trials involving LHRH analog therapy for prostate cancer were reviewed, and the frequency of clinical flare responses noted. Particular attention was given to the kinds of clinical problems associated with the flare response. The use of LHRH analog therapy in treatment of patients with prostate cancer for indications other than overt metastatic disease is discussed, because this is becoming a much more common use of these agents. This article analyzes 2 placebo-controlled, double-blind trials testing the effectiveness of existing antiandrogens in ameliorating flare responses.

Results

The use of LHRH analogs for patients with stage D2 disease can be associated with clinical flare in approximately 10% of D2 patients. In addition to bone pain, cord compression, and bladder outlet obstruction, another potentially severe side effect is cardiovascular risk arising presumably from hypercoagulability associated with a rapid increase in tumor burden. In clinical series involving D2 patients, the frequency of clinical flare greatly varies, probably because of the level of scrutiny of the investigator and/or the prostate-cancer tumor burden present at the initiation of therapy. Concomitant antiandrogen therapy reduces, but does not totally eliminate, the flare responses in patients at high risk for flare. Treating prostate cancer in the D0 stage or in the neoadjuvant setting will result in biochemical evidence of testosterone surge, but these patients are at very little risk for clinical flare responses.

Conclusions

There is a wide variation in the reported frequency of clinical flare responses from LHRH analogs during the initial treatment of patients with stage D2 disease. The risk-to-benefit ratio, especially in patients with symptomatic bone metastasis, would dictate routine use of antiandrogen therapy for the first month of LHRH analog treatment. For patients at risk for cord compression, other means of ablating testosterone might be considered, such as ketoconazole, orchiectomy, or LHRH antagonists. Clinical flare responses, as opposed to biochemical flare responses, are very rare during LHRH analog therapy for stage D0 disease and/or in the setting of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy.

### Adult-onset hypogonadism [^111Qcmya]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2016). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer risk with TT — overall evidence suggests no increase in incidence, with nuanced findings on prostate events and post-treatment settings: Although no appropriately designed and powered study has been conducted to assess prostate cancer–related risks of TT, the available evidence suggests that T treatment does not increase prostate cancer risk. Low T levels are associated with higher rates of prostate cancer as well as more advanced tumor grade, stage, and volume compared with men who are not hypogonadal, and the incidence of prostate cancer in men being treated with T is reported as similar to the rate in untreated men in the general population. A meta-analysis of 19 placebo-controlled TT studies in men with low or low-normal T level found no difference in prostate biopsies, prostate cancer occurrence, or rise in PSA level compared with placebo; however, men administered T had a significantly higher rate of all prostate events. Observational data suggest that some men taking T do not have an increased risk of developing prostate cancer, and a large longitudinal study evaluating roughly 10,000 men found no association between androgen levels and prostate cancer risk. After prostate cancer treatment, the evidence is weaker: low preoperative T levels may predict PSA recurrence after radical prostatectomy, men postradical prostatectomy administered T have been reported to have low PSA recurrence rates, there is also a low PSA recurrence rate after radiation or brachytherapy among men treated with T, a small active-surveillance study found no increased risk of progression, and some data suggest that T may be protective against recurrence and progression; however, the available studies do not definitely address the risks and benefits.

### Ovulation-inducing drugs and ovarian cancer risk: results from an extended follow-up of a large United States infertility cohort [^115N84ji]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the relationship of ovulation-inducing drugs and ovarian cancer.

Design

Retrospective cohort study, with additional follow-up since initial report.

Setting

Five large reproductive endocrinology practices.

Patient(S)

In a retrospective cohort of 9,825 women evaluated for infertility at five clinical sites in the United States between 1965 and 1988 with follow-up through 2010, we examined the relationship of ovulation-inducing drugs and ovarian cancer (n = 85).

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Hazard rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for ovarian cancer.

Result(S)

Among women evaluated for infertility, there was no association of ovarian cancer risk with ever use of clomiphene citrate (CC) (adjusted RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.86–2.07) or gonadotropins (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.48–2.08) and no evidence that any of several more detailed subgroups of usage were related to an increased risk with one exception: women who used CC and remained nulligravid did demonstrate much higher risks than those who successfully conceived compared with nonusers (respectively, RR 3.63, 95% CI 1.36–9.72 vs. RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.47–1.63).

Conclusion(S)

Our overall results were reassuring and consistent with other studies. A reason for an association between CC use and ovarian cancer among persistently nulligravid women remains to be determined. Given the large and increasing number of women treated with ovulation-inducing drugs, the increased risk of ovarian cancer among the subset of women who remained nulligravid should be further monitored.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^114VT2uF]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Prostate Cancer — progression to and management of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) notes that most advanced disease eventually stops responding to traditional ADT and is categorized as castration-resistant (also known as castration-recurrent). CRPC is defined as prostate cancer that progresses clinically, radiographically, or biochemically despite castrate levels of serum testosterone (< 50 ng/dL). Patients whose disease progresses to CRPC during primary ADT should receive a laboratory assessment to assure a castrate level of testosterone (< 50 ng/dL; < 1.7 nmol/L), and imaging tests may be indicated to monitor for signs of distant metastases; factors affecting the frequency of imaging include individual risk, age, overall patient health, PSA velocity, and Gleason grade. For patients who develop CRPC, ADT with orchiectomy or an LHRH agonist or antagonist should be continued to maintain castrate serum levels of testosterone (< 50 ng/dL).

### Testosterone therapy in men after radical prostatectomy for low-intermediate organ-confined prostate cancer [^112MYSNu]. The Journal of Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Testosterone (T) therapy (TTh) in men with T deficiency who have undergone radical prostatectomy (RP) for prostate cancer remains controversial. We aimed to assess the impact of TTh on biochemical recurrence (BCR) rates after RP in men with low-intermediate organ-confined disease.

Materials and Methods

This study included men who underwent an RP at our institution for organ-confined prostate cancer and had grade groups 1 to 3 on RP pathology. A Cox model was created for time to BCR with T use included as a time-dependent covariate, adjusted for age, preoperative PSA, grade group at RP, and the presence of comorbidities. A landmark analysis was used: Patients were included in the analysis if their last PSA in the 18 weeks postoperatively was undetectable and they had not had BCR or been lost to follow-up by that point, and follow-up for BCR began at 18 weeks. BCR was defined as a PSA ≥ 0.1 ng/mL after RP with a second confirmatory rise ≥ 0.1 ng/mL.

Results

The study population included 5199 men after RP, with 198 patients receiving T at any point after RP and 5001 not receiving T. The median age was 59 (interquartile range, 55–65) and 61 (interquartile range, 56–66) years, respectively. Men in the T group tended to present with more vascular comorbidities. For those receiving T, clomiphene citrate was prescribed in 49% of men, 32% received transdermal T, and 19% intramuscular T. We found a nonsignificantly decreased risk of BCR associated with the use of T after RP (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.48–1.46; p = 0.5), and overall rates of BCR were low, with probability of BCR at 5 years less than 2% in both groups.

Conclusions

TTh can be given to select men after RP. We found no evidence that administration of TTh after RP causes BCR.

### A comparison of secondary polycythemia in hypogonadal men Treated with clomiphene citrate versus testosterone replacement: a multi-institutional study [^113AL6JT]. The Journal of Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

We evaluated the relative prevalence of secondary polycythemia in hypogonadal men treated with clomiphene citrate or testosterone replacement therapy.

Materials and Methods

In this retrospective, multi-institutional study, we included 188 men who received clomiphene citrate and 175 who received testosterone replacement therapy with symptomatic hypogonadism. The overall prevalence and ORs of secondary polycythemia for clomiphene citrate treatment vs testosterone replacement were primarily measured, as were baseline characteristics. Subset analysis included polycythemia rates for different types of testosterone replacement therapy.

Results

Overall, men on testosterone replacement therapy were older than clomiphene citrate treated men (age 51.5 vs 38 years). Men on testosterone replacement had longer treatment duration than clomiphene citrate treated men (19.6 vs 9.2 months). For testosterone replacement therapy and clomiphene citrate the mean change in hematocrit was 3.0% and 0.6%, and the mean change in serum testosterone was 333.1 and 367.6 ng/dl, respectively. The prevalence of polycythemia in men on testosterone replacement was 11.2% vs 1.7% in men on clomiphene citrate (p = 0.0003). This significance remained on logistic regression after correcting for age, site, smoking history and pretreatment hematocrit.

Conclusions

The prevalence of polycythemia in men treated with clomiphene citrate was markedly lower than that in men on testosterone replacement therapy. The improvement in absolute serum testosterone levels was similar to that in men on testosterone replacement. There is no significant risk of polycythemia in men treated with clomiphene citrate for hypogonadism.

### Clomiphene citrtae (clomiphene citrate) [^113tdg6Z]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition, patients selected for clomiphene citrate therapy should be evaluated in regard to the following:

Estrogen Levels. Patients should have adequate levels of endogenous estrogen (as estimated from vaginal smears, endometrial biopsy, assay of urinary estrogen, or from bleeding in response to progesterone). Reduced estrogen levels, while less favorable, do not preclude successful therapy.
Primary Pituitary or Ovarian Failure. Clomiphene citrate therapy cannot be expected to substitute for specific treatment of other causes of ovulatory failure.
Endometriosis and Endometrial Carcinoma. The incidence of endometriosis and endometrial carcinoma increases with age as does the incidence of ovulatory disorders. Endometrial biopsy should always be performed prior to clomiphene citrate therapy in this population.
Other Impediments to Pregnancy. Impediments to pregnancy can include thyroid disorders, adrenal disorders, hyperprolactinemia, and male factor infertility.
Uterine Fibroids. Caution should be exercised when using clomiphene citrate in patients with uterine fibroids due to the potential for further enlargement of the fibroids.

There are no adequate or well-controlled studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of clomiphene citrate in the treatment of male infertility. In addition, testicular tumors and gynecomastia have been reported in males using clomiphene. The cause and effect relationship between reports of testicular tumors and the administration of clomiphene citrate is not known.

Although the medical literature suggests various methods, there is no universally accepted standard regimen for combined therapy (i.e., clomiphene citrate in conjunction with other ovulation-inducing drugs). Similarly, there is no standard clomiphene citrate regimen for ovulation induction in in vitro fertilization programs to produce ova for fertilization and reintroduction. Therefore, clomiphene citrate is not recommended for these uses.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Study population

In total, 173 male patients treated with CC were screened for inclusion. Twenty patients were excluded with reason; four used CC combined with TTh or hCG, six had no wash‐out period longer than 12 months between TTh and before start of CC therapy, two had no before treatment TT and/or FT measurement and eight were lost to FU before any hormonal evaluation. Finally, 153 patients were included for analysis. Data on patient characteristics, comorbidities and dosage at start of treatment, are provided in Table 1. Forty‐one patients had an orchiectomy in the past, 22/41 patients (54%) underwent adjuvant chemotherapy, radiation therapy or a combination of both. Median duration of CC therapy was 10 months (range, 1–96). During the first year of CC, 21 patients (14%) were lost to FU and 50 patients (33%) stopped treatment. At the end‐point of this study (January 2021), 43 patients (28%) were still in FU, 26 patients (17%) were lost to FU, 71 patients (46%) stopped CC therapy and 14 patients (9%) stopped CC and switched to TTh. There was no correlation between discontinuation in the first year and pre‐treatment TT levels, age or hypogonadism aetiology. Dosage was increased (n = 22, 14%) in case of minimal TT response or decreased in case of side effects within the first year (n = 10, 7%). In 145 patients (95%) pre‐treatment TT levels were < 12.1 nmol/L. Two patients (1%) had TT level < 15 nmol/L, but FT levels < 243 pmol/L. Six patients (4%) had TT levels < 15 nmol/L and FT levels < 280 pmol/L. All of these eight patients with TT levels > 12 nmol/L and < 15 nmol/L had clear hypogonadal symptoms.

### Endocrine therapy in prostate cancer: time for reappraisal of risks, benefits and cost-effectiveness? [^117Voib1]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Is the treatment cost-effective?

Decisions made by NICE about whether cost effective treatments are approved for use in the NHS usually apply a threshold of around £20 000-£30 000 per QALY. Neither the Department of Health nor NICE hold any data on the cost-effectiveness or QALYs for conventional ADT drugs such as GNrH/LHrH analogues. Given the relative lack of evidence of benefit of long-term ADT, can we really justify spending nearly £100 m on a class of drugs, with an uncertain long-term safety profile?

It is inevitable, that should a man survive long enough on ADT, castrate-resistant prostate cancer will develop and until recently, few treatment options had been shown to be effective in improving overall survival in men with such disease. Taxane-based chemotherapy has been shown to be effective in this group of men, but is associated with significant toxicity. Several agents are currently showing promise in this group of men, with NICE having initially evaluated Abiraterone, an inhibitor of androgen synthesis at £63 200 per QALY and deeming it not to be cost-effective, further stating that the criteria for an end-of-life treatment were not met (for which the thresholds could be increased). This decision was reversed in June 2012 after the manufacturer (Janssen) has lowered the cost to an "undisclosed lower price". Enzalutamide, a novel androgen receptor antagonist has recently been shown to be effective in prolonging survival in men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer following failure of taxane chemotherapy Whereas such advances potentially represent good news for men with prostate cancer, it must be recognised, that the inclusion criteria into the studies has been on the basis of failure of docetaxel. Studies are now underway evaluating the role of Abiraterone in localised/ high risk disease (i.e. the addition of Abiraterone to the STAMPEDE trial). Prostate cancer, including castrate-resistant prostate cancer, represents a spectrum of disease from a rising PSA level through to rapidly progressive clinically-evident disease. Unless the indications (including precise stage of disease) for using these drugs are clearly defined in advance, as well as the potential toxicities associated with long-term use, significant migration in costs and possible adverse events, as has occurred with existing conventional ADT, may ensue. Therefore, a better understanding of the potential risks and any excess treatment cost associated with ADT is imperative to inform how cost effective these drugs truly are.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^113Waehj]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Adverse effects of traditional ADT — risks, comparative data, and mitigation: ADT has a variety of adverse effects (e.g., hot flashes, sexual and metabolic effects, musculoskeletal changes, and cardiovascular disease), and "the side effects of continuous ADT increase with the duration of treatment". Some forms may carry lower risk; for example, "relugolix was associated with a lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events than leuprolide" in HERO, although the FDA considered the HERO cardiovascular findings exploratory and did not allow inclusion in prescribing information, and overall head‑to‑head evidence on cardiovascular toxicity is very limited. Cognitive risks remain uncertain, and "patients and their medical providers should be advised about these risks prior to treatment". Many side effects "are reversible or can be avoided or mitigated"; physical activity "should be recommended", and "use of statins also should be considered".

3.7 Correlations

A correlation was found between symptom improvement during treatment and a higher increase in TT at first measurement during treatment (p = .000, r = .34). A second correlation was found between a lower range of normal LH and FSH before treatment and a higher increase in TT at first measurement during treatment (p = .000, r = −.37 and p = .000, r = −.40, respectively). A third correlation was found between a low‐normal LH before treatment and improvement of symptoms with CC therapy (p = .02, r = −.21). Further, a correlation was found between a lower increase in TT at first measurement and an orchiectomy in the medical history (p = 0.009, r = −0.21). No correlations were found between first measurement during TT treatment and age, BMI, testis volume, and different subgroups of patients with a presence/history of overweight, cardiovascular disease, chemo‐ and/or radiation therapy, DM, Klinefelter, other malignancies.

3.8 Reversed effect of

Two patients had a reversed biochemical effect within the first 3 months of CC treatment. Patients were 30 and 40 years old, both with a history of orchiectomy for seminoma. The patients used CC therapy 25 mg every other day. TT levels before treatment were 3.7 and 6.1 nmol/L, respectively and during CC treatment 0.5 and 1.3 nmol/L, respectively. LH levels before treatment were 26 and 27 IU/L, respectively and during CC treatment 8.6 and 9.0 IU/L respectively. Before treatment, both patients had fatigue and decreased libido, one patient had erectile dysfunction. Neither improvement nor worsening of symptoms occurred during CC treatment. Treatment was stopped after a second blood test confirmed this reversed effect. After stopping CC therapy, both patients had restoration to before treatment levels of testosterone.

AUA guideline — counseling for men with testosterone deficiency and prior prostate cancer states that patients "should be informed that there is inadequate evidence to quantify the risk-benefit ratio of testosterone therapy" (Expert Opinion). The panel further states that until there is definitive evidence demonstrating safety, "the decision to commence testosterone therapy in men with a history of prostate cancer is a negotiated decision based on the perceived potential benefit of treatment", and that "product labels for all testosterone formulations explicitly state that their use is contraindicated in men with a history of prostate cancer".

### Ovarian cancer risk after the use of ovulation-stimulating drugs [^113d3nWw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the long-term effects of ovulation-stimulating drugs on the risk of ovarian cancer.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study of 12,193 eligible study subjects (median age 30 years) who were evaluated for infertility during the period of 1965–1988 at 5 clinical sites identified 45 subsequent ovarian cancers in follow-up through 1999. Standardized incidence ratios compared the risk of cancer among the infertile patients to the general population, whereas analyses within the cohort allowed the derivation of rate ratios for drug usage compared with no usage after adjustment for other ovarian cancer predictors.

Results

The infertility patients had a significantly elevated ovarian cancer risk compared with the general population (standardized incidence ratio 1.98, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.4, 2.6). When patient characteristics were taken into account and risks assessed within the infertile women, the rate ratios associated with ever usage were 0.82 (95% CI 0.4, 1.5) for clomiphene and 1.09 (95% CI 0.4, 2.8) for gonadotropins. There were higher, albeit nonsignificant, risks with follow-up time, with the rate ratios after 15 or more years being 1.48 (95% CI 0.7, 3.2) for exposure to clomiphene (5 exposed cancer patients) and 2.46 (95% CI 0.7, 8.3) for gonadotropins (3 exposed cancer patients). Although drug effects did not vary by causes of infertility, there was a slightly higher risk associated with clomiphene use among women who remained nulligravid, based on 6 exposed patients (rate ratio 1.75; 95% CI 0.5, 5.7).

Conclusion

The results of this study generally were reassuring in not confirming a strong link between ovulation-stimulating drugs and ovarian cancer. Slight but nonsignificant elevations in risk associated with drug usage among certain subgroups of users, however, support the need for continued monitoring of long-term risks.

### Testosterone treatment in hypogonadal men: prostate-specific antigen level and risk of prostate cancer [^112J47aM]. Endocrine Practice (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in hypogonadal men after testosterone replacement by three different methods and attempt to determine any possible relationship between hypogonadism and prostate cancer in this study population.

Methods

A total of 90 consecutive men who had erectile dysfunction and were found to have hypogonadism were monitored with digital rectal examination (DRE) and measurement of PSA levels before and after testosterone replacement therapy. The patients were treated with one of three options: (1) testosterone enanthate by intramuscular injections, 200 or 300 mg every 2 or 3 weeks (N = 25); (2) testosterone nonscrotal patches, 5 mg daily (N = 16); or (3) clomiphene citrate, 50 mg orally three times a week, in patients with functional secondary hypogonadism (N = 49). Treatment was continued for 2 to 3 months, after which PSA levels were reassessed. Patients with suspicious results on DRE and increased PSA levels before or after treatment with testosterone underwent prostate biopsy. For statistical analysis, patients were categorized into two age-groups — 40 to 60 years old and 61 to 80 years old.

Results

With all methods of testosterone replacement, PSA levels increased in both age-groups. Endogenous testosterone elevation from clomiphene stimulation raised PSA levels the highest, and testosterone patches yielded the least PSA response. Ten men underwent biopsy of the prostate. In one patient, a nodule was found on DRE; the other nine men underwent biopsy because of suspicious PSA levels. Of these patients, two were found to have adenocarcinoma, and a third man who underwent rebiopsy was also found to have cancer. Therefore, 3 of the 90 patients (3.3%) had prostate cancer.

Conclusions

PSA levels increased in response to all types of testosterone replacement, regardless of whether the testosterone level was raised endogenously or exogenously. PSA levels are inappropriately low in hypogonadal men and may mask an underlying cancer. Determining PSA levels before and after testosterone treatment is recommended. Elevated PSA levels before or after testosterone therapy should prompt performance of a urologic evaluation for possible prostate biopsy.

### Clomiphene citrate: a potential alternative for testosterone therapy in hypogonadal males [^114psMf5]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Side effects were reported in 10% of our population and included agitation, hot flushes, nipple tenderness, mood changes, weight gain, visual changes, headache and dizziness. These side effects were also reported in the literature, with a prevalence between 4% and 11%. Most patients with side effects continued CC after the TWM, suggesting that CC's benefits outweighed side effects. Because of the off‐label usage of CC, there are no existing guidelines for monitoring adverse events. Therefore, recommendations are based on experience with exogenous testosterone therapy. Literature shows that TTh can lead to an increase in PSA, Hb and Ht. In our study we found no increase in PSA and Hb, only two patients showed marginal elevated Ht (0.50 and 0.51) during treatment. Baseline Ht levels were not available in these patients, so it is unclear if this elevated Ht was pre‐existent. This was supported by Chandrapal et al. (2016) who demonstrated no increase in PSA, Hb and Ht during CC therapy (n = 77). This was further supported by Krzastek et al. (2019) (n = 76), who found only one patient with increased Ht (0.51) during CC therapy. Wheeler et al. (2017) demonstrated a difference in prevalence of increased Ht with CC and TTh of 2% and 11%, respectively (n = 363). A hypothesis is, that rapid peak increases in TT and overdosing of TT, especially in TTh injections, can lead to treatment‐induced increase in Hb and Ht. Thus, this does not apply for CC therapy, with slow increase in endogenous TT. However, CC can have an oestrogen agonistic activity, leading to activation of clotting factors, leading to an increased coaguliability, with increased risk of thromboembolic events. Although, with this theoretical risk in mind, Kavoussi et al. (2019) showed that the risk of deep venous thrombosis was not increased with CC compared to the general population (n = 1180)It could be considered that patients should be counselled that there are some described cases of thromboembolic events without the knowledge of this was caused by CC. Furthermore, it could be considered that an elevated haematocrit before treatment or thromboembolic events in the past are contraindications. In our study an increase in estradiol was only seen in (1/13) patient where estradiol was measured before and during treatment, in contrast with previous studies. A possible explanation could be that estradiol was measured in only a small number of our study population (n = 13).

### Prostate cancer diagnosis among men with isolated high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia enrolled onto a 3-year prospective phase III clinical trial of oral toremifene [^114xbpLF]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Prostate cancer (PCa) prevention remains an appealing strategy for the reduction of overtreatment and secondary adverse effects. We evaluated the efficacy of toremifene citrate 20 mg in PCa prevention among men with isolated high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) on biopsy.

Patients and Methods

One thousand five hundred ninety men with HGPIN, or HGPIN and atypia, and no PCa on prostate biopsy were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive toremifene citrate 20 mg or placebo in a 3-year phase III, double-blind, multicenter trial. Men underwent annual biopsy until cancer detection or study end. Efficacy analysis was performed in 1,467 men who underwent at least one on-study biopsy. Baseline risk factors were evaluated to determine influence on cancer detection.

Results

Cancer was detected in 34.7% and 32.3% of men in the placebo and treatment groups, respectively, with no observed difference (P = 0.39, log-rank test) in PCa-free survival. The 3-year Kaplan-Meier PCa-free survival estimate was 54.9% (99% CI, 43.3% to 66.5%) in the placebo group and 59.5% (99% CI, 48.1% to 70.9%) in the treatment group. Exploration of baseline risk factors demonstrated no subset in which a risk reduction was observed. In the placebo group, 17.9%, 12.9%, and 13.6% of men at risk at the beginning of years 1, 2, and 3, respectively, were diagnosed with PCa.

Conclusion

Although toremifene 20 mg did not lower the PCa detection rate, men with isolated HGPIN have a high likelihood of eventual PCa diagnosis, demonstrating they are ideal candidates for inclusion in chemoprevention trials and require surveillance by periodic prostate biopsy.

### Clomiphene citrate (Clomid) [^114PKeXU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition, patients selected for clomiphene citrate therapy should be evaluated in regard to the following:

Estrogen Levels. Patients should have adequate levels of endogenous estrogen (as estimated from vaginal smears, endometrial biopsy, assay of urinary estrogen, or from bleeding in response to progesterone). Reduced estrogen levels, while less favorable, do not preclude successful therapy.
Primary Pituitary or Ovarian Failure. Clomiphene citrate therapy cannot be expected to substitute for specific treatment of other causes of ovulatory failure.
Endometriosis and Endometrial Carcinoma. The incidence of endometriosis and endometrial carcinoma increases with age as does the incidence of ovulatory disorders. Endometrial biopsy should always be performed prior to clomiphene citrate therapy in this population.
Other Impediments to Pregnancy. Impediments to pregnancy can include thyroid disorders, adrenal disorders, hyperprolactinemia, and male factor infertility.
Uterine Fibroids. Caution should be exercised when using clomiphene citrate in patients with uterine fibroids due to the potential for further enlargement of the fibroids.

There are no adequate or well-controlled studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of clomiphene citrate in the treatment of male infertility. In addition, testicular tumors and gynecomastia have been reported in males using clomiphene. The cause and effect relationship between reports of testicular tumors and the administration of clomiphene citrate is not known.

Although the medical literature suggests various methods, there is no universally accepted standard regimen for combined therapy (i.e., clomiphene citrate in conjunction with other ovulation-inducing drugs). Similarly, there is no standard clomiphene citrate regimen for ovulation induction in vitro fertilization programs to produce ova for fertilization and reintroduction. Therefore, clomiphene citrate is not recommended for these uses.

### Serum metabolomic profiling of prostate cancer risk in the prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancer screening trial [^1164EXkq]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Results

Median time from blood collection to prostate cancer diagnosis was 10 years (inter-decile range = 7.2–13.0 years) and median age at diagnosis was 72 years. Compared with controls, cases were more likely to have higher serum PSA and a family history of prostate cancer, and were more physically active at age 40 years, but were similar with respect other characteristics at study baseline (Table 1).

Metabolites related to risk of overall, aggressive and non-aggressive prostate cancer with a nominal P -value of < 0.05 are shown in Tables 2, 3, 4 sorted by chemical class, sub-pathway and P -values. All metabolite associations with overall prostate cancer risk are presented in Supplementary Table 1. None of the P -values were below the threshold of correction for multiple comparisons or with a FDR < 20%. The amino acids pyroglutamine (pGLU), phenylpyruvate, and N -acetylcitrulline, as well as the peptide gamma-glutamylphenylalanine, yielded the strongest signals, being inversely associated with overall prostate cancer (0.001 ≤ P < 0.004, Table 2), whereas the acylcarnitine metabolite stearoylcarnitine was positively associated (OR = 1.74, Table 2). Findings were similar for aggressive disease, with the peptide class of compounds being inversely associated (Table 3, P = 0.027), but not with non-aggressive cancer. For non-aggressive disease, alpha-tocopherol, primary bile acid, and steroid hormone metabolites were well-represented and inversely associated with risk, as was cyclic AMP (Table 4). Stratification based on median time to diagnosis of aggressive disease revealed long-chain fatty acids, monohydroxy fatty acids, acylcarnitines, monoacylglycerol lipids, and lysolipids being positively associated among cases diagnosed within 10 years, and citrate, sphingolipid, steroid hormone, and glutathione metabolites associated among cases diagnosed 10–20 years after blood collection (data not shown).

### Should testosterone replacement be offered to hypogonadal men treated previously for prostatic carcinoma? [^113JDBKr]. Clinical Endocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

Androgen administration can cause prostate cancer progression, and androgen deprivation therapy is a commonly used therapeutic modality in the treatment of prostate cancer. In trying to answer the posed clinical question, this article reviews the risks and benefits of testosterone replacement therapy in this setting and the published data from clinical series. Recommendations are made based on the available evidence.

### 5-α reductase inhibitors and prostate cancer prevention: where do we turn now? [^115z4A69]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

With the risk of prostate cancer so high, there is great need for a strategy to reduce the incidence and thus the burden of prostate cancer. Chemoprevention holds such potential in this regard. Yet, the future of 5-ARIs, the most promising chemopreventive agents to date, is uncertain. In the role of wide-scale use to prevent prostate cancer in men of average risk, this is likely the end for 5-ARIs with no further primary prevention trials on the horizon. The widespread acceptance of statins and aspirin for cardiovascular disease prevention proves that patients are willing to take a drug to prevent a disease they may never get. In the case of 5-ARIs, it is likely not the small risk of reversible sexual side effects or the preferential prevention of low-grade disease that are preventing FDA approval and wider adoption. It is the lingering uncertainty surrounding the risk of high-grade disease. No physician or regulatory body is comfortable treating healthy men with a drug that has even the slightest risk of inducing a potentially lethal cancer.

Until more is learned, physicians are unfortunately left in the difficult position of explaining the complicated risks and benefits of 5-ARIs, and while they were never approved for chemopreventive use before, there was always the hope that they would be. Now the hope of their approval is gone, and the scientific community, while still endeavoring to identify a specific subgroup of men who will benefit from 5-ARIs, should begin turning the page toward the next chemoprevention strategy.

### Fertility drugs and cancer: a guideline [^114Hueek]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Fertility drugs and cancer — evidence review methods and grading process are described as follows: A methodological specialist extracted data for outcomes identified by the task force, including exposure to infertility treatment vs. controls, fertility medications such as follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), human menopausal gonadotropin, letrozole, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), or clomiphene citrate (CC), and cancer outcomes (breast, ovarian, borderline ovarian tumor [BOT], thyroid, melanoma, colorectal, or uterine) with subsequent incidence/odds of diagnosis. Task force members critically assessed study strengths and limitations, assigned a quality grade using a defined rating scale, and recorded this in an evidence table; the task force chair reviewed assigned grades, determined grades when missing based on study strengths and limitations, and assessed design and methodology components including blinding, allocation concealment, appropriate control groups, intention-to-treat analysis, generalizability, and risk of bias. A consulting epidemiologist and the chair confirmed agreement with the experts' quality assessments; the task force summarized data in narrative form (characteristics, quality, benefit, conclusions), convened via email to review literature and findings, and the chair presented summaries and draft conclusions to the ASRM Practice Committee for deliberation on evidence strength and recommendation strength and for approval of summary statements and recommendations. The quality of the evidence informed the strength of the guideline's evidence, and recommendation strengths were based on both the quality and strength (confidence/certainty) of evidence, risks, benefits, and expert judgment; patient perspective and feedback were elicited during review and before publication.

### Updates to advanced prostate cancer: AUA / SUO guideline (2023) [^112XHuXi]. The Journal of Urology (2023). High credibility.

First-generation antiandrogens with luteinizing hormone–releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists in mHSPC (Recommendation 18) — clinicians should not offer bicalutamide, flutamide, or nilutamide in combination with LHRH agonists in patients with mHSPC, except to block testosterone flare (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A). After LHRH initiation there is typically a surge that may cause clinical "flares" in approximately 10% of patients, which can be "blocked" by short term (e.g., 4 weeks or less) first-generation antiandrogen use, although there is limited evidence of significant clinical utility.

### Testosterone replacement therapy and risk of favorable and aggressive prostate cancer [^114sx1gX]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

These relationships may reflect several possible biologic mechanisms. Testosterone is important for epithelial cell differentiation and function in the normal prostate. In prostate cells and prostate cancer cells, testosterone stimulates proliferation, - but the dependence of prostate cancer cell survival on androgens is more controversial. Most studies suggest a lower rate of apoptosis after castration in prostate cancer compared with normal prostate. -,

In addition to stimulating cell differentiation and proliferation, testosterone also induces PSA production. These processes seem to be regulated, at least in part, by different mechanisms, given the observation in preclinical studies that their maximal stimulation occurs at different concentrations of testosterone, - with PSA production stimulated at higher testosterone concentrations than cell proliferation. If PSA is a marker of benign prostate cells and highly differentiated prostate cancer cells, then lower testosterone levels should correspond with lower PSA levels and more poorly differentiated cancer. A meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies by Roddam et alfound no association between high endogenous serum testosterone levels and prostate cancer risk. Serum levels of testosterone gradually decrease with age, whereas the risk of prostate cancer increases. Speculatively, high or normal testosterone levels keep prostate cells and early prostate cancer cells in a differentiated state. In contrast, the gradual decrease of testosterone caused by aging may lead to a less-differentiated cancer phenotype. In combination with increased cellular proliferation, further progression of prostate cancer lesions may be triggered within a certain androgen concentration range. Further support of the concept of testosterone as a differentiating agent for prostate cancer comes from the observation that high-dose testosterone treatment of men with castration-resistant prostate cancer transforms cancer cells into a more differentiated phenotype sensitive to further androgen deprivation therapy. These observations support the biologic plausibility of the current finding of a decreased risk of poorly differentiated prostate cancer in men who receive TRT. Similarly, a previous case-by-case analysis from the United States showed a lower proportion of high-grade disease among patients with prostate cancer who received TRT before diagnosis compared with those who did not.

### Clomiphene citrate (Clomid) [^111a4EwT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

To minimize the hazard associated with occasional abnormal ovarian enlargement associated with clomiphene citrate therapy, the lowest dose consistent with expected clinical results should be used. Maximal enlargement of the ovary, whether physiologic or abnormal, may not occur until several days after discontinuation of the recommended dose of clomiphene citrate. Some patients with polycystic ovary syndrome who are unusually sensitive to gonadotropin may have an exaggerated response to usual doses of clomiphene citrate. Therefore, patients with polycystic ovary syndrome should be started on the lowest recommended dose and shortest treatment duration for the first course of therapy (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

If enlargement of the ovary occurs, additional clomiphene citrate therapy should not be given until the ovaries have returned to pretreatment size, and the dosage or duration of the next course should be reduced. Ovarian enlargement and cyst formation associated with clomiphene citrate therapy usually regress spontaneously within a few days or weeks after discontinuing treatment. The potential benefit of subsequent clomiphene citrate therapy in these cases should exceed the risk. Unless surgical indication for laparotomy exists, such cystic enlargement should always be managed conservatively.

A causal relationship between ovarian hyperstimulation and ovarian cancer has not been determined. However, because a correlation between ovarian cancer and nulliparity, infertility, and age has been suggested, if ovarian cysts do not regress spontaneously, a thorough evaluation should be performed to rule out the presence of ovarian neoplasia.

### Endocrine therapy in prostate cancer: time for reappraisal of risks, benefits and cost-effectiveness? [^112q7G4K]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Prostate cancer is the sixth most common cause of cancer mortality worldwide (268 000 deaths recorded in 2008). There is considerable discrepancy between reported incidence and mortality (Figure 1), particularly in the developed world attributable mainly to prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing. A significant number of men diagnosed with prostate cancer will survive for many years, even without radical curative treatment. Endocrine therapy is the mainstay of treatment for advanced prostate cancer. It has been reported that nearly 50% of all men diagnosed with prostate cancer will undergo androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) at some stage after diagnosis and men remain on such treatment for up to two decades. Despite trends in a reduction of inappropriate ADT use in the USA the situation in other health care systems where these agents are widespread, such as the UK, remains uncertain. Part of the problem in evaluating the size of the issue is that in most countries, data on the precise timing of ADT in men with prostate cancer are not routinely collected. Guidelines produced by the European Association of Urology, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and The British Association of Urological Surgeons refer to caution being exercised with regards to timing of introduction of ADT in men with advanced prostate cancer, however controversy surrounds the concept of what constitutes 'early' or 'late' in this context.

Observational evidence has been accumulating suggesting that men on long-term conventional ADT may be at risk of treatment-related adverse events, in particular cardiovascular disease (CVD). Links have already been made between low testosterone levels (hypogonadism) and CVD in other settings. The severe iatrogenic hypogonadal state induced by medical or surgical castration to treat prostate cancer could augment CVD risk in these men.

What of the costs of such therapy? With increasing lead-time bias and thus treatment duration, costs are spiralling upwards. Data from the 2010 NHS prescription cost analysis reports that around £100 million was spent on ADT in England (inclusive of Bicalutamide, Buserelin, Cyproterone Acetate, Degarelix, Flutamide, Goserelin Acetate, Leuprorelin Acetate and Triptorelin Acetate). This represents 28% of the total spend on malignant disease & immunosuppressive drugs. The situation in the United States is similar and this probably reflects the situation in every healthcare system in the developed world.

### Monitoring of testosterone replacement therapy to optimize the benefit-to-risk ratio [^114VZDBG]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

For hypogonadal men treated with testosterone, the goal is to ensure that benefits are optimized, risks are minimized, and any adverse effects are identified early and managed appropriately. This can best be achieved by careful patient selection, excluding men with contraindications and addressing any modifiable risk factors in those at increased risk. A standardized plan should be used for monitoring that includes evaluation of symptoms, side effects, adherence, and measurement of testosterone and hematocrit. Shared decision making should be used to determine whether to screen for prostate cancer and informed by age, baseline cancer risk, and patient preference.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1173ZWyW]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Prostate cancer — principles of androgen deprivation therapy: Medical castration (ie, LHRH agonist or antagonist) and surgical castration (ie, bilateral orchiectomy) are equally effective. Patients who do not achieve adequate suppression of serum testosterone (< 50 ng/dL) with medical or surgical castration can be considered for additional hormonal manipulations (with antiandrogens, LHRH antagonists, or steroids), although the clinical benefit remains uncertain. Consider monitoring testosterone levels 12 weeks after first dose of LHRH therapy, then upon increase in PSA. The optimal level of serum testosterone to affect "castration" has yet to be determined. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Breast cancer incidence after hormonal infertility treatment in Sweden: a cohort study [^116K3pwH]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the impact of infertility treatment with causes of infertility on incidence of breast cancer.

Study Design

Historical prospective cohort study of 1135 women attending major university clinics for treatment of infertility in Sweden, 1961–1976. Women were classified as users of clomiphene citrate or gonadotropins, or a combination of both therapies. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated to estimate relative risk of breast cancer.

Results

We observed 54 cases of breast cancer during 1961–2004, which did not significantly exceed those expected. Users of high-dose clomiphene citrate had an almost 2-fold increased risk (standardized incidence ratio, 1.90; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–3.35). This association was more pronounced among women referred for nonovulatory factors, with 3-fold increased risk (standardized incidence ratio, 3.00; 95% confidence interval, 1.35–6.67).

Conclusion

No overall increased risk for breast cancer was shown with infertility treatment. Women with nonovulatory causes treated with high-dose clomiphene citrate therapy may have an elevated risk for breast cancer.

### Does testosterone therapy increase the risk of prostate cancer? [^117NPPzn]. Endocrine Practice (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To review factors affecting use of testosterone therapy for hypogonadism including the persistent controversial link between testosterone therapy and prostate cancer.

Methods

We reviewed studies investigating the relationship between testosterone therapy and prostate cancer progression and summarized strategies for hypogonadism management and prostate monitoring.

Results

Trials of up to 36 months in length and longitudinal studies consistently fail to demonstrate an increased prostate cancer risk associated with increased testosterone levels. No evidence of an associated relationship between exogenous testosterone therapy and prostate cancer has emerged from clinical trials or adverse event reports. It does not appear that exogenous testosterone accumulates in the prostate or provokes major biologic change in the prostate gland. In addition, preliminary evidence indicates that low endogenous testosterone may confer an increased risk of prostate cancer.

Conclusions

Mounting evidence demonstrates that there is a lack of association between testosterone therapy and prostate cancer progression. Testosterone therapy may be prescribed for men for whom it was once not considered. Careful monitoring of patients with hypogonadism who are receiving testosterone therapy is imperative. Well-designed, large-scale prospective clinical trials are necessary to adequately address prostate safety in hypogonadal men receiving testosterone therapy.

### Clomiphene citrate for unexplained subfertility in women [^111zmqyK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The effectiveness of clomiphene citrate has been demonstrated in the treatment of subfertility associated with infrequent or irregular ovulation. The physiologic effects and clinical benefits in ovulatory women with unexplained subfertility are less clear. The drug is associated with an increased risk of multiple pregnancy and a suggestion of potentially increased ovarian cancer risks. In light of these concerns, defining the effectiveness of clomiphene citrate for ovulatory women with unexplained subfertility is extremely important.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of clomiphene citrate in improving pregnancy outcomes in women with unexplained subfertility, used in a dose range of 50 to 250 mg for up to 10 days. The primary outcome was live births.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register (June 2009), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2009), EMBASE (1980 to June 2009) and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised controlled trials were included. Quasi-randomised designs were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Fourteen potentially relevant trials were identified of which seven were included in this review. All trials were assessed for risk of bias using standardised Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group methodology.

Main Results

Data relating to 1159 participants from seven trials were collated. There was no evidence that clomiphene citrate was more effective than no treatment or placebo for live birth (odds ratio (OR) 0.79, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.38; P = 0.41) or for clinical pregnancy per woman randomised both with intrauterine insemination (IUI) (OR 2.40, 95% CI 0.70 to 8.19; P = 0.16), without IUI (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.66; P = 0.91) and without IUI but using human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (OR 1.66, 95% CI 0.56 to 4.80; P = 0.35). It should be noted that heterogeneity between studies ranged from 34% to 58% using the I(2) statistic.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence of clinical benefit of clomiphene citrate for unexplained fertility. When making this treatment choice, potential side effects should be discussed. These include the increased risk of multiple pregnancy and the concern that use for more that 12 cycles has been associated with a three-fold increase in risk of ovarian cancer.

### Effects of fertility drugs on cancers other than breast and gynecologic malignancies [^1135mytU]. Fertility and Sterility (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the relationship of ovulation-stimulating drugs to risk of cancers other than breast and gynecologic malignancies.

Design

Retrospective cohort study, with additional follow-up since initial report.

Setting

Reproductive endocrinology practices.

Patient(S)

Among a cohort of 12,193 women evaluated for infertility between 1965 and 1988, a total of 9,892 women (81.1% of the eligible population) were followed through 2010, via passive and active (questionnaire) approaches.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for various fertility treatment parameters for select cancers.

Result(S)

During 30.0 median years of follow-up (285,332 person-years), 91 colorectal cancers, 84 lung cancers, 55 thyroid cancers, and 70 melanomas were diagnosed among study subjects. Clomiphene citrate (CC), used by 38.1% of patients, was not associated with colorectal or lung cancer risks, but was related significantly to melanoma (HR = 1.95; 95% CI: 1.18–3.22), and non-significantly to thyroid cancer risks (HR = 1.57; 95% CI: 0.89–2.75). The highest melanoma risks were seen among those with the lowest drug exposure levels, but thyroid cancer risk was greatest among the heavily exposed patients (HR = 1.96; 95% CI: 0.92–4.17 for those receiving > 2,250 mg). Clomiphene citrate-associated risks for thyroid cancer were somewhat higher among nulligravid, compared with gravid, women, but did not differ according to distinct causes of infertility. Gonadotropins, used by only 9.7% of subjects, were not related to risk of any of the assessed cancers.

Conclusion(S)

Our results provide support for continued monitoring of both melanoma and thyroid cancer risk among patients receiving fertility drugs.

### Fertility drugs and cancer: a guideline [^1116jHuc]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Cervical cancer — fertility medications and in vitro fertilization (IVF): Multiple studies have found no increased risk of cervical cancer after the use of fertility medications when compared with the general population and with patients with infertility, and three studies have shown a significant decrease after IVF; one study noted a significant decrease after the use of clomiphene (CC) (RR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2–0.8). Most studies have shown no increased risk of cervical cancer after the use of fertility medications; 4 studies showed a decreased risk. Women should be informed that fertility drugs are not associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer (strength of evidence, B/C; strength of recommendation, weak/moderate).

### Clomiphene citrtae (clomiphene citrate) [^112vA263]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Animal Data

Oral administration of clomiphene citrate to pregnant rats during organogenesis at doses of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day resulted in hydramnion and weak, edematous fetuses with wavy ribs and other temporary bone changes. Doses of 8 mg/kg/day or more also caused increased resorptions and dead fetuses, dystocia, and delayed parturition, and 40 mg/kg/day resulted in increased maternal mortality. Single doses of 50 mg/kg caused fetal cataracts, while 200 mg/kg caused cleft palate. Following injection of clomiphene citrate 2 mg/kg to mice and rats during pregnancy, the offspring exhibited metaplastic changes of the reproductive tract. Newborn mice and rats injected during the first few days of life also developed metaplastic changes in uterine and vaginal mucosa, as well as premature vaginal opening and anovulatory ovaries. These findings are similar to the abnormal reproductive behavior and sterility described with other estrogens and antiestrogens.

In rabbits, some temporary bone alterations were seen in fetuses from dams given oral doses of 20 or 40 mg/kg/day during pregnancy, but not following 8 mg/kg/day.

No permanent malformations were observed in those studies. Also, rhesus monkeys given oral doses of 1.5 to 4.5 mg/kg/day for various periods during pregnancy did not have any abnormal offspring.

NURSING MOTHERS

It is not known whether clomiphene citrate is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised if clomiphene citrate is administered to a nursing woman. In some patients, clomiphene citrate may reduce lactation.

Ovarian Cancer

Prolonged use of clomiphene citrate tablets may increase the risk of a borderline or invasive ovarian tumor (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Hypogonadism is a common clinical condition affecting men, with older men having an increased incidence. Clinicians (endocrinologists and urologists) who may be involved in providing testosterone therapy should be familiar with the effects of testosterone on the prostate. Before initiating testosterone therapy, physicians and patients should partake in shared decision-making, including pretreatment testing, risks and benefits of testosterone therapy relating to benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms, a discussion on prostate cancer in those who have not been diagnosed with malignancy, and a thorough discussion with patients who may have a previous diagnosis of prostate cancer.

### Non-steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy compared with luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonists or surgical castration monotherapy for advanced prostate cancer [^112XxbV6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Non-steroidal antiandrogens and castration are the main therapy options for advanced stages of prostate cancer. However, debate regarding the value of these treatment options continues.

Objectives

To assess the effects of non-steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy compared with luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonists or surgical castration monotherapy for treating advanced stages of prostate cancer.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Prostatic Diseases and Urologic Cancers Group Specialized Register (PROSTATE), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science with Conference Proceedings, three trial registries and abstracts from three major conferences to 23 December 2013, together with reference lists, and contacted selected experts in the field and manufacturers.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing non-steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy with medical or surgical castration monotherapy for men in advanced stages of prostate cancer.

Data Collection and Analysis

One review author screened all titles and abstracts; only citations that were clearly irrelevant were excluded at this stage. Then, two review authors independently examined full-text reports, identified relevant studies, assessed the eligibility of studies for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted the study authors to request additional information. We used Review Manager 5 for data synthesis and used the fixed-effect model for heterogeneity less than 50%; we used the random-effects model for substantial or considerable heterogeneity.

Main Results

Eleven studies involving 3060 randomly assigned participants were included in this review. The quality of evidence is hampered by risk of bias. Use of non-steroidal antiandrogens decreased overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 1.48, six studies, 2712 participants) and increased clinical progression (one year: risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.45, five studies, 2067 participants; 70 weeks: RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.45, six studies, 2373 participants; two years: RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.25, three studies, 1336 participants), as well as treatment failure (one year: RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.38, four studies, 1539 participants; 70 weeks: RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.52, five studies, 1845 participants; two years: RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.24, two studies, 808 participants), compared with medical or surgical castration. The quality of evidence for overall survival, clinical progression and treatment failure was rated as moderate according to GRADE. Predefined subgroup analyses showed that use of non-steroidal antiandrogens, compared with castration, was less favourable for overall survival, clinical progression (at one year, 70 weeks, two years) and treatment failure (at one year, 70 weeks, two years) in men with metastatic disease. Use of non-steroidal antiandrogens also increased the risk for treatment discontinuation due to adverse events (RR 1.82, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.94, eight studies, 1559 participants), including events such as breast pain (RR 22.97, 95% CI 14.79 to 35.67, eight studies, 2670 participants), gynaecomastia (RR 8.43, 95% CI 3.19 to 22.28, nine studies, 2774 participants) and asthenia (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.36 to 2.31, five studies, 2073 participants). The risk of other adverse events, such as hot flashes (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.27, nine studies, 2774 participants), haemorrhage (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.54, two studies, 546 participants), nocturia (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.69, one study, 480 participants), fatigue (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.88, one study, 51 participants), loss of sexual interest (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.83, one study, 51 participants) and urinary frequency (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.47, one study, 480 participants) was decreased when non-steroidal antiandrogens were used. The quality of evidence for breast pain, gynaecomastia and hot flashes was rated as moderate according to GRADE. The effects of non-steroidal antiandrogens on cancer-specific survival and biochemical progression remained unclear.

Authors' Conclusions

Currently available evidence suggests that use of non-steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy compared with medical or surgical castration monotherapy for advanced prostate cancer is less effective in terms of overall survival, clinical progression, treatment failure and treatment discontinuation due to adverse events. Evidence quality was rated as moderate according to GRADE. Further research is likely to have an important impact on results for patients with advanced but non-metastatic prostate cancer treated with non-steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy. However, we believe that research is likely not necessary on non-steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy for men with metastatic prostate cancer. Only high-quality, randomised controlled trials with long-term follow-up should be conducted. If further research is planned to investigate biochemical progression, studies with standardised follow-up schedules using measurements of prostate-specific antigen based on current guidelines should be conducted.

### Prostate cancer, nutrition, and dietary supplements-NCI… [^1147Gmm4]. NCI (2012). Low credibility.

- Men who have prostate cancer use CAM treatments to help boost the immune system, improve quality of life, and lower the risk of the cancer coming back, but only half of them tell their doctors about their use of CAM. Studies of CAM use to lower prostate cancer risk or to prevent it from coming back have shown the following: Have any studies of MCP been done in people. Few studies have been done in men with prostate cancer. There is not enough evidence to know whether MCP has any effect on prostate cancer. Have any side effects or risks been reported from MCP. Side effects that have been reported include itching, upset stomach, abdominal cramps, increased gas, and diarrhea. Is MCP approved by the FDA for use to prevent or treat cancer in the United States. The FDA has not approved the use of MCP as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition.

In several large studies, men with high selenium levels were at greater risk of being diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer or dying from prostate cancer. Is selenium approved by the FDA for use as a cancer treatment in the United States. The FDA has not approved the use of selenium supplements for the treatment or prevention of cancer. Studies often look at specific factors that affect a person's vitamin D levels to see how those factors influence prostate cancer risk. Factors that have been studied include:

- Low sun exposure.
- Levels of vitamin D in the diet and blood.
- Genetic changes. Some genetic changes in tumor features that interact with vitamin D might affect the growth and spread of prostate cancer. One of those features is a molecule called a vitamin D receptor. Studies suggest that changes in this receptor could influence a person's risk of prostate cancer or increase the chance that the cancer will spread.

More research is needed to confirm that vitamin D receptors play a role in prostate cancer. In a group of 26 studies, Vitamin D was reviewed for safety, how well it works, and whether it interacts with drugs used to treat prostate cancer and other tumors. The reviewers found the risk of side effects and interactions with other drugs to be low. Several studies looked at the safety of high-dose vitamin D and how well it works with chemotherapy to treat men with prostate cancer that did not respond to hormone therapy. The side effects that occurred after treatment with high-dose vitamin D and docetaxel were the same as the side effects noted after treatment with docetaxel alone. Is vitamin D approved by the FDA for use as a cancer treatme.

Regarding medical management for prostate cancer, more specifically with respect to management of castration-resistant prostate cancer, non-metastatic, observation and androgen deprivation therapy, CUA/CUOG 2022 guidelines recommend to maintain androgen deprivation therapy in the non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer state. Discontinue first-generation androgen receptor antagonists (such as bicalutamide, flutamide).

### Risk of ovarian cancer in women treated with ovarian stimulating drugs for infertility [^117KjCCY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in the Cochrane Library in 2013 (Issue 8) on the risk of ovarian cancer in women using infertility drugs when compared to the general population or to infertile women not treated. The link between fertility drugs and ovarian cancer remains controversial.

Objectives

To evaluate the risk of invasive ovarian cancer and borderline ovarian tumours in women treated with ovarian stimulating drugs for subfertility.

Search Methods

The original review included published and unpublished observational studies from 1990 to February 2013. For this update, we extended the searches from February 2013 to November 2018; we evaluated the quality of the included studies and judged the certainty of evidence by using the GRADE approach. We have reported the results in a Summary of findings table to present effect sizes across all outcome types.

Selection Criteria

In the original review and in this update, we searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised studies and case series including more than 30 participants.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently conducted eligibility and 'Risk of bias' assessments and extracted data. We grouped studies based on the fertility drug used for two outcomes: borderline ovarian tumours and invasive ovarian cancer. We conducted no meta-analyses due to expected methodological and clinical heterogeneity.

Main Results

We included 13 case-control and 24 cohort studies (an additional nine new cohort and two case-control studies), which included a total of 4,684,724 women. Two cohort studies reported an increased incidence of invasive ovarian cancer in exposed subfertile women compared with unexposed women. One reported a standardised incidence ratio (SIR) of 1.19 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 2.25) based on 17 cancer cases. The other cohort study reported a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.93 (95% CI 1.18 to 3.18), and this risk was increased in women remaining nulligravid after using clomiphene citrate (HR 2.49, 95% CI 1.30 to 4.78) versus multiparous women (HR 1.52, 95% CI 0.67 to 3.42) (very low-certainty evidence). The slight increase in ovarian cancer risk among women having between one and three cycles of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) was reported, but this was not clinically significant (P = 0.18). There was no increase in risk of invasive ovarian cancer after use of infertility drugs in women with the BRCA mutation according to one cohort and one case-control study. The certainty of evidence as assessed using GRADE was very low. For borderline ovarian tumours, one cohort study reported increased risk in exposed women with an SIR of 3.61 (95% CI 1.45 to 7.44), and this risk was greater after treatment with clomiphene citrate (SIR 7.47, 95% CI 1.54 to 21.83) based on 12 cases. In another cohort study, the risk of a borderline ovarian tumour was increased, with an HR of 4.23 (95% CI 1.25 to 14.33), for subfertile women treated with IVF compared with a non-IVF-treated group with more than one year of follow-up. A large cohort reported increased risk of borderline ovarian tumours, with HR of 2.46 (95% CI 1.20 to 5.04), and this was based on 17 cases. A significant increase in serous borderline ovarian tumours was reported in one cohort study after the use of progesterone for more than four cycles (risk ratio (RR) 2.63, 95% CI 1.04 to 6.64). A case-control study reported increased risk after clomiphene citrate was taken, with an SIR of 2.5 (95% CI 1.3 to 4.5) based on 11 cases, and another reported an increase especially after human menopausal gonadotrophin was taken (odds ratio (OR) 9.38, 95% CI 1.66 to 52.08). Another study estimated an increased risk of borderline ovarian tumour, but this estimation was based on four cases with no control reporting use of fertility drugs. The certainty of evidence as assessed using GRADE was very low. However, although some studies suggested a slight increase in risks of ovarian cancer and borderline ovarian tumour, none provided moderate- or high-certainty evidence, as summarised in the GRADE tables.

Authors' Conclusions

Since the last version of this review, only a few new relevant studies have provided additional findings with supporting evidence to suggest that infertility drugs may increase the risk of ovarian cancer slightly in subfertile women treated with infertility drugs when compared to the general population or to subfertile women not treated. The risk is slightly higher in nulliparous than in multiparous women treated with infertility drugs, and for borderline ovarian tumours. However, few studies have been conducted, the number of cancers is very small, and information on the dose or type of fertility drugs used is insufficient.

### Risk of endometrial cancer in women treated with ovary-stimulating drugs for subfertility [^113f7Zot]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Medical treatment for subfertility principally involves the use of ovary-stimulating agents, including selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), such as clomiphene citrate, gonadotropins, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists and antagonists, as well as human chorionic gonadotropin. Ovary-stimulating drugs may act directly or indirectly upon the endometrium (lining of the womb). Nulliparity and some causes of subfertility are recognized as risk factors for endometrial cancer.

Objectives

To evaluate the association between the use of ovary-stimulating drugs for the treatment of subfertility and the risk of endometrial cancer.

Search Methods

A search was performed in CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid) and Embase (Ovid) databases up to July 2016, using a predefined search algorithm. A search in OpenGrey, ProQuest, ClinicalTrials.gov, ZETOC and reports of major conferences was also performed. We did not impose language and publication status restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Cohort and case-control studies reporting on the association between endometrial cancer and exposure to ovary-stimulating drugs for subfertility in adult women were deemed eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study characteristics and findings were extracted by review authors independently working in pairs. Inconsistency between studies was quantified by estimating I 2. Random-effects (RE) models were used to calculate pooled effect estimates. Separate analyses were performed, comparing treated subfertile women versus general population and/or unexposed subfertile women, to address the superimposition of subfertility as an independent risk factor for endometrial cancer.

Main Results

Nineteen studies were eligible for inclusion (1,937,880 participants). Overall, the quality of evidence was very low, due to serious risk of bias and indirectness (non-randomised studies (NRS), which was reflected on the GRADE assessment. Six eligible studies, including subfertile women, without a general population control group, found that exposure to any ovary-stimulating drug was not associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.37; 156,774 participants; very low quality evidence). Fifteen eligible studies, using a general population as the control group, found an increased risk after exposure to any ovary-stimulating drug (RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.61; 1,762,829 participants; very low quality evidence). Five eligible studies, confined to subfertile women (92,849 participants), reported on exposure to clomiphene citrate; the pooled studies indicated a positive association (RR 1.32; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.71; 88,618 participants; very low quality evidence), although only at high dosage (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.68; two studies; 12,073 participants) and at a high number of cycles (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.47; three studies; 13,757 participants). Four studies found an increased risk of endometrial cancer in subfertile women who required clomiphene citrate compared to a general population control group (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.00 to 3.48; four studies, 19,614 participants; very low quality evidence). These data do not tell us whether the association is due to the underlying conditions requiring clomiphene or the treatment itself. Using unexposed subfertile women as controls, exposure to gonadotropins was associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.34; four studies; 17,769 participants; very low quality evidence). The respective analysis of two studies (1595 participants) versus the general population found no difference in risk (RR 2.12, 95% CI 0.79 to 5.64: very low quality evidence). Exposure to a combination of clomiphene citrate and gonadotropins, compared to unexposed subfertile women, produced no difference in risk of endometrial cancer (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.44; two studies; 6345 participants; very low quality evidence). However, when compared to the general population, an increased risk was found, suggesting that the key factor might be subfertility, rather than treatment (RR 2.99, 95% CI 1.53 to 5.86; three studies; 7789 participants; very low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The synthesis of the currently available evidence does not allow us to draw robust conclusions, due to the very low quality of evidence. It seems that exposure to clomiphene citrate as an ovary-stimulating drug in subfertile women is associated with increased risk of endometrial cancer, especially at doses greater than 2000 mg and high (more than 7) number of cycles. This may largely be due to underlying risk factors in women who need treatment with clomiphene citrate, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, rather than exposure to the drug itself. The evidence regarding exposure to gonadotropins was inconclusive.

### Cancer and fertility preservation: international recommendations from an expert meeting [^1177Zab1]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Recently, a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies evaluated the association between hormonal infertility treatments and risk of developing breast cancer. A total of 20 studies with 207,914 women exposed to hormonal treatments for infertility and 2,347 incident cases of breast cancer were included. Overall, no increased risk was detected with the use of hormonal treatments for infertility (summary RR [SRR] = 1.05; 95% CI 0.96–1.14) but a significant heterogeneity among studies was detected (I 2 = 59%; P = 0.001). In subgroup analyses, when considering only the seven studies with the in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure, no increase in breast cancer risk was detected (SRR = 0.96; 95% CI 0.81–1.14). On the contrary, a moderately increased breast cancer risk was observed in the three studies where women were treated outside IVF protocols (SRR = 1.26; 95% CI 1.06–1.50): however, to note, in these studies patients were enrolled before 1980. Overall, the meta-analysis did not support the hypothesis that hormonal treatments for infertility are associated with an increased breast cancer risk.

Recently, a large US cohort study reported reassuring results about the long-term effects of ovarian stimulating drugs with clomiphene or gonadotropins. After a median follow up of 30 years, out of 9,892 women evaluated for infertility, 749 developed breast cancer. Ever use of clomiphene citrate was not associated with risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.05; 95% CI 0.90–1.22). However, a significantly elevated risk was observed for patients who received both a high cumulative dose (i.e. ≥ 2251 mg) and multiple cycles (i.e. ≥ 6 cycles), with an HR of 1.27 (95% CI 1.02–1.59). Ever use of gonadotropins was not significantly associated with the risk of developing breast cancer (HR = 1.14; 95% CI 0.89–1.44), with no trends according to dosage, number of cycles, or age at first use.

### Is there a role for chemotherapy in prostate cancer? [^112V7bDn]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

ESTROGENS

Estrogens were used originally as therapy for hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and provided similar efficacy to orchiectomy. However, they increase the risk of thromboembolic events and for this reason estrogens are now used rarely in the treatment of hormone-sensitive disease. More recently, there is evidence that some patients with 'hormone-resistant' disease (i.e. after primary androgen ablation and addition and withdrawal of a peripheral antiandrogen) may have transient responses to estrogens such as diethylstilbestrol. The mechanism is unknown, but this effect might also account for responses to the agent PC-SPES, which contains phytoestrogens, that have been reported for patients with 'hormone-resistant' disease. In view of the potential toxicity of estrogens in elderly men, they are recommended for use only in selected patients who have progressed after other types of treatment.

### Anabolic-androgenic steroid use in sports, health, and society [^111pFXeL]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2021). High credibility.

Testosterone therapy and prostate outcomes — There is no evidence that testosterone (T) causes prostate cancer, but testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) is associated with a small increase in prostate specific antigen levels in older men with low T, which increases the risk of urological referral for prostate biopsy; because many older men harbor subclinical prostate cancer, a prostate biopsy may lead to subclinical low-grade prostate cancer detection, and notably TRT increases the risk of prostate biopsy.

### Fertility drugs and cancer: a guideline [^114zkTQD]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Assisted reproductive technology (ART) and breast cancer risk — most studies and meta-analyses report no overall increase in risk after infertility treatment, including a meta-analysis of 20 studies reporting that hormonal infertility treatments are not associated with increased breast cancer risk. In a cohort of infertile women, incidence among those who underwent in vitro fertilization (IVF) did not differ from those who did not (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.88–1.36), and a separate cohort with 30 years' follow-up found no increased risk with ever use of clomiphene citrate (CC) or gonadotropins compared with never use (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.90–1.22, and HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.89–1.44). In the OMEGA historical cohort from all 12 IVF clinics in the Netherlands, with complete follow-up for 96% of the cohort, 19,158 IVF-treated women and 5,950 non-IVF–treated women were included, and breast cancer risk among ART-treated women was not significantly higher than in non-ART–treated women or the general population. Contrasting data include a Norwegian registry comparison of 16,626 ART-exposed women with 972,208 non–ART-exposed women reporting an increased risk of breast cancer (aHR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01–1.42), and a United Kingdom analysis of 255,756 women with ART finding no increased risk of invasive breast cancer but an increased risk of in situ breast cancer. Follow-up duration may influence findings, as higher risk has been observed with follow-up of > 10 years, whereas in 2 studies with > 30 years of follow-up no association was noted. Despite limitations, the page states there does not appear to be an increased risk of breast cancer associated with ART treatments at a population level.

### Managing congenital hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism: a contemporary approach directed at optimizing fertility and long-term outcomes in males [^11783YRU]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Further considerations

Long-term management of classical hypogonadism

Approximately 10–20% of men with CHH experience reversal of hypogonadism, albeit with risk of relapse. Otherwise, the vast majority of men with organic HH would require lifelong physiological testosterone replacement to avoid androgen deficiency-related end-organ deficits, including anaemia, osteoporosis and muscle wasting. Among the formulations available, long-acting testosterone undecanoate depot injection and transdermal applications are preferred because of their favourable pharmacokinetics in providing stable circulating testosterone concentrations. Once appropriate dosing has been established, annual monitoring of testosterone, haematocrit/haemoglobin for testosterone-induced erythrocytosis, as well as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in men aged ⩾55 years (40 years if high risk) is recommended. In addition, baseline bone mineral density (BMD) measurements is useful to identify patients with low bone mass; testosterone replacement in hypogonadal men has been shown to be effective in improving BMD, and thus antiresorptive agents should be deferred until later life, unless the patient has already sustained a fragility fracture.

Alternative treatment for functional HH: aromatase inhibitors and selective oestrogen receptor modulators

In recent years, there is increasing interest in the use of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) and selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) as alternative modalities in the treatment of male hypogonadism and subfertility. It is crucial to recognize that, in order for these agents to work, hypothalamic–pituitary function must be intact because these act by decreasing oestradiol-mediated negative feedback inhibition. Therefore, AIs/SERMs are only potentially viable in patients with functional, but not organic, causes of HH. Some common scenarios include severe obesity, chronic opiate use, and withdrawal from AASs. But in the absence of robust data on the safety and efficacy of these agents, measures to address the underlying cause and avoidance of testosterone treatment are preferred instead. However, if aetiological factors cannot be resolved satisfactorily, or recovery of spermatogenesis does not occur within a reasonable timeframe, an off-label trial of AIs/SERMs for a limited course (e.g. clomiphene 25 mg, three times per week to 50 mg daily, anastrozole 1 mg, three times per week)might be considered for selected patients before embarking on definitive fertility-induction treatment with gonadotrophins.

Testosterone therapy — indication and regimen selection — We recommend testosterone therapy in hypogonadal men to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and correct symptoms of testosterone deficiency. Clinicians can initiate testosterone therapy with any of the therapeutic regimens described in Tables 5 and 6, based on the patient's preference, consideration of pharmacokinetics, treatment burden, and cost, and clomiphene citrate has been used empirically in men with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism; however, neither its efficacy nor its safety has been demonstrated in randomized trials.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — ovarian cancer risk and surveillance: One large study reported 4,547 women with 476 ovarian cancer cases (7 with PCOS) and 4,081 controls (24 with PCOS), with a calculated odds ratio of 2.5 (1.08–5.89), translating into a risk of 17.4 to 44 per 100,000 women; the PCOS proportion was 1.5% among cancer cases and 0.06% among controls. Small studies reported that clomiphene citrate treatment is associated with a 2.3-fold increase in ovarian cancer, whereas another study documented a standardized mortality rate lower than women without PCOS (SMR 0.39; 95% CI, 0.01 to 2.17). Use of combined OCPs is known to be a preventive measure for ovarian cancer risk. There is no recommended routine surveillance strategy for the detection of ovarian cancer in women with PCOS.

### Incidence of prostate cancer in men with testosterone deficiency and a family history of prostate cancer receiving testosterone therapy: a comparative study [^114QE8HN]. BMJ Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Lastly, the biological rationale behind studies supporting the safety of TTh in terms of PCa development requires further exploration. One speculation relates to the androgen saturation theory, which proposes that prostate tissue becomes less responsive to androgens beyond a certain threshold of circulating testosterone. This theory potentially explains why TTh may not increase PCa risk, even in men considered high risk. Additionally, TTh may also potentially be involved in reducing inflammation and oxidative stress in the prostate, factors that could be implicated in carcinogenesis. As such, the time-dependent pattern observed in our study could reflect these competing mechanisms, with initial protective effects potentially giving way to growth stimulation in susceptible individuals over time. To our knowledge, this is the first study addressing this clinical question, and our findings underscore the need for further investigation, particularly through prospective studies, to better understand the relationship between TTh and PCa in men considered at high risk for PCa. Despite this, it is important to highlight the study's limitations. First, the analysed data come from a TriNetX which relies on electronic health records from participating healthcare organisations. As such, incomplete, inaccurate or inconsistently recorded data could have affected the reliability of our study results. Moreover, we may have not captured all relevant confounding factors (ie, treatment compliance). For instance, the TriNetX system used in our study does not provide specific data on prostate nodules, further limiting the ability to exclude all men with undiagnosed PCa based on this clinical feature. In this regard, our approach to handling mortality differed from traditional competing risk analyses. We excluded patients who died without PSA testing rather than treating deaths as competing events, while patients who developed PCa were counted in the outcome regardless of subsequent death. This could affect risk estimates if excluded patients had different characteristics. Additionally, the healthcare organisations contributing data to TriNetX may not be representative of the entire population, potentially leading to selection bias. Moreover, the use of 1:1 propensity score matching is mandated by the TriNetX database software. As such, 2:1 or 5:1 matching could have potentially increased the statistical power of the present study; however, this is not possible to perform with TriNetX due to the database's intrinsic capabilities. Similarly, the platform's aggregate data structure prevents additional propensity score adjustments beyond the matching process already implemented. These limitations may have restricted our ability to detect smaller differences between groups. Second, the retrospective nature of the study raises concerns about potential confounding factors. For example, patients in the TTh group could have been followed up more closely, increasing the likelihood of detecting PCa in respect to those who never received TTh. Third, the study focused on the diagnosis of PCa rather than its incidence, as determining incidence would have required to prostate biopsy of all men. Fourth, there is a lack of data on clinically significant PCa in the TriNetX database (ie, Gleason Score). As a proxy, we used active treatment to approximate the definitions, but this should be referred to as 'active treatment for PCa' rather than 'clinically significant PCa'. It is also possible that some patients with a diagnosis of clinically insignificant PCa (ie, Gleason score 3+3) might have chosen to undergo active treatment, although the paradigm for treating low-grade group PCa has evolved over the analysed time period, making it challenging to entirely account for this factor.

### Clomiphene citrtae (clomiphene citrate) [^115xXBSV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

To minimize the hazard associated with occasional abnormal ovarian enlargement associated with clomiphene citrate therapy, the lowest dose consistent with expected clinical results should be used. Maximal enlargement of the ovary, whether physiologic or abnormal, may not occur until several days after discontinuation of the recommended dose of clomiphene citrate. Some patients with polycystic ovary syndrome who are unusually sensitive to gonadotropin may have an exaggerated response to usual doses of clomiphene citrate. Therefore, patients with polycystic ovary syndrome should be started on the lowest recommended dose and shortest treatment duration for the first course of therapy (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

If enlargement of the ovary occurs, additional clomiphene citrate therapy should not be given until the ovaries have returned to pretreatment size, and the dosage or duration of the next course should be reduced. Ovarian enlargement and cyst formation associated with clomiphene citrate therapy usually regresses spontaneously within a few days or weeks after discontinuing treatment. The potential benefit of subsequent clomiphene citrate therapy in these cases should exceed the risk. Unless surgical indication for laparotomy exists, such cystic enlargement should always be managed conservatively.

A causal relationship between ovarian hyperstimulation and ovarian cancer has not been determined. However, because a correlation between ovarian cancer and nulliparity, infertility, and age has been suggested, if ovarian cysts do not regress spontaneously, a thorough evaluation should be performed to rule out the presence of ovarian neoplasia.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113jp7Ba]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society testosterone therapy guideline — prostate cancer risk discussion and monitoring: In hypogonadal men 55 to 69 years old, who are being considered for testosterone therapy and have a life expectancy > 10 years, we suggest discussing the potential benefits and risks of evaluating prostate cancer risk and prostate monitoring and engaging the patient in shared decision making regarding prostate cancer monitoring. For patients who choose monitoring, clinicians should assess prostate cancer risk before starting testosterone treatment and 3 to 12 months after starting testosterone. In hypogonadal men being considered for testosterone therapy who are 40 to 69 years old and at increased risk of prostate cancer, we suggest discussing prostate cancer risk with the patient and offering monitoring options.

### Sildenafil citrate and risk of biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer patients treated with radiation therapy: post-hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial [^117BMveE]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Sildenafil citrate has been shown to be protective of sexual function when given concurrently and following prostate radiation therapy (RT), but some evidence suggests an increased biochemical recurrence (BCR) risk in patients taking sildenafil after radical prostatectomy.

Aim

To evaluate whether sildenafil use is associated with increased risk of BCR in patients receiving prostate RT, we performed a secondary analysis of a randomized placebo-controlled trial (RPCT) that compared sildenafil citrate to placebo during and after prostate RT.

Methods

The study population consisted of prostate cancer patients who initiated radiation treatment at our institution and participated in our multi-institutional RPCT that compared 6 months of sildenafil 50 mg once a day to placebo with a 24-month follow-up. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) was allowed. Prostate cancer prognostic risk grouping was not an exclusion criterion, but most study participants had low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank testing.

Outcomes

The primary outcomes of this report were biochemical recurrence and overall survival rates, where BCR was defined according to the Phoenix definition.

Results

Data of 162 men were analyzed. Nine men had inadequate PSA follow-up and the remaining 153 men were included in the final report. Median age was 61 years. At a median follow-up of 8.3 years (range: 3.0–12.2), 5/94 (5.3%) and 2/59 (3.4%) patients developed BCR in the sildenafil and placebo groups, respectively. The 6-year BCR-free survival was 98.8% for all patients, 98.1% for the sildenafil cohort, and 100% for the placebo cohort. The 10-year BCR-free survival was 94.4% for all patients, 95.6% for the sildenafil cohort, and 92.9% for the placebo cohort. There was no difference in BCR-free survival between the sildenafil and placebo groups by log-rank comparison (p = 0.36).

Clinical Implications

This analysis informs clinical decision making about the safety of using sildenafil during and after prostate RT.

Strengths and Limitations

This study included patients who were treated in the setting of a prospective, randomized placebo-controlled trial, and who attained high medication compliance. However, the study was limited by the post-hoc nature of the analysis, use of ADT in some patients, inadequate study power to detect a difference in BCR between sildenafil and placebo groups.

Conclusion

Prophylactic sildenafil citrate was not associated with biochemical recurrence risk in prostate cancer patients treated with radiation. However, the study was inadequately powered to definitively conclude a negative finding.

### Prostate cancer treatment (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^116CEdX8]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

The contemporary Gleason score readings were an average of 0. 85 points higher than the same slides read a decade earlier. As a result, Gleason-score standardized prostate cancer mortality rates for these men were artifactually improved from 2. 08 to

1. 50 deaths per 100-person years — a 28% decrease even though overall outcomes were unchanged. Prostate-specific antigen level PSA, an organ-specific marker, is often used as a tumor marker. The higher the level of PSA at baseline, the higher the risk of metastatic disease or subsequent disease progression. However, it is an imprecise marker of risk.

For example, baseline PSA and rate of PSA change were associated with subsequent metastasis or prostate cancer death in a cohort of 267 men with clinically localized prostate cancer who were managed by watchful waiting or active surveillance in the control arm of a randomized trial comparing radical prostatectomy with watchful waiting or active surveillance. Nevertheless, the accuracy of classifying men into groups whose cancer remained indolent versus those whose cancer progressed was poor at all examined cut points of PSA or PSA rate of change. For example, in a retrospective analysis of nearly 2, 000 men who had undergone radical prostatectomy with curative intent and were followed for a mean of 5. 3 years, 315 men demonstrated an abnormal PSA of
0. 2 ng/mL or higher, which is considered evidence of biochemical recurrence. Among these 315 men, 103 developed clinical evidence of recurrence.

The median time to the development of clinical metastasis after biochemical recurrence was 8 years. After the men developed metastatic disease, the median time to death was an additional 5 years. Follow-up after radiation therapy For patients treated with radiation therapy, the combination of clinical tumor stage, Gleason score, and pretreatment PSA level is often used to estimate the risk of relapse. As is the case after prostatectomy, PSA is often followed for signs of tumor recurrence after radiation therapy. After radiation therapy with curative intent, persistently elevated or rising PSA may be a prognostic factor for clinical disease recurrence; however, reported case series have used a variety of definitions of PSA failure.

### Anticancer drugs-related hypogonadism in male patients with advanced cancers on active treatment: a systematic review [^115LaXq5]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Implications for Practice

This review highlights the occurrence of male hypogonadism as a possible anti-cancer treatment toxicity, even if the quality of evidence is still low. As such, it could be useful to develop trial to better understand this adverse event. In clinical practice, it could be useful to evaluate gonadal axis before treatment at risk and in case of typical symptoms, since testosterone replacement therapy may be beneficial in these patients.

### Serum metabolomic profiling of prostate cancer risk in the prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancer screening trial [^117VVwyH]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Among the top metabolites related to prostate cancer in our earlier investigation that served as our a priori hypotheses for the present analysis, only three associations with overall prostate cancer replicated in the present data: the lipids 1-palmitoleoyl-2-linoleoyl-GPC (16:1/18:2) (OR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.40–0.88, P = 0.0096) and tauro-beta-muricholate (OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.48–0.97, P = 0.033), and the nucleotide 2′-deoxyuridine (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.07–2.03, P = 0.019; Table 2). By contrast, the inverse association between aggressive prostate cancer, and the energy metabolites, alpha-AKG or citrate, did not replicate, and appeared to have opposite associations (AKG OR = 1.45, P = 0.098, and citrate OR = 1.48, P = 0.077). It is noteworthy that these positive associations appeared stronger among cases diagnosed 10–20 years after blood collection (AKG OR = 1.83, 95% CI 0.99–3.38, P = 0.053; citrate OR = 2.04, 95% CI 1.06–3.91, P = 0.032) compared with those diagnosed within 10 years (OR = 1.11, P = 0.76 for AKG, and OR = 1.13, P = 0.68 for citrate). The present data also did not replicate the previous positive associations with aggressive prostate cancer for phenylpyruvate, thyroxine, and arginine (Table 3), and trimethylamine- N -oxide (data not shown).

### Testosterone therapy in hypogonadal men and potential prostate cancer risk: a systematic review [^113YPLcw]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2008). Low credibility.

This paper provides a systematic review of the literature about prostate cancer risk associated with testosterone therapy for hypogonadism. A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and other resources was conducted to identify articles that highlight occurrences of prostate cancer in men receiving testosterone therapy for hypogonadism treatment. Articles that met study inclusion criteria were assessed for causality between testosterone treatment and prostate cancer, increased prostate-specific antigen or abnormal digital rectal examination findings. Of 197 articles relating to testosterone therapy, 44 met inclusion criteria: 11 placebo-controlled, randomized studies; 29 non-placebo-controlled studies of men with no prostate cancer history; and 4 studies of hypogonadal men with history of prostate cancer. Of studies that met inclusion criteria, none demonstrated that testosterone therapy for hypogonadism increased prostate cancer risk or increased Gleason grade of cancer detected in treated vs untreated men. Testosterone therapy did not have a consistent effect on prostate-specific antigen levels.

### Clinical review: why is androgen replacement in males controversial? [^11757dfP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Symptoms and signs consistent with androgen deficiency and low testosterone levels are recognized frequently in clinical practice. Recent population-based epidemiological studies indicate that low testosterone levels in men are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The clinician must be able to counsel patients to help them determine whether testosterone replacement therapy is appropriate for them.

Evidence Acquisition

The authors have conducted a literature search in PubMed, and we have reviewed references in the multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses that have been published on this topic.

Evidence Synthesis

We have attempted to provide the reader with an appreciation of the evidence that can be used to support the diagnosis of androgen deficiency, the efficacy of treatment, the potential risks of treatment, the therapeutic options, and the recommendations for monitoring treatment.

Conclusions

We think that published clinical experience justifies testosterone replacement therapy in males who have not initiated puberty by age 14 and in males with low testosterone levels due to classical diseases of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. The benefit:risk ratio is less certain in older men and in those with chronic diseases associated with low testosterone levels. The decision to treat in this setting is much more controversial because there are few large clinical trials that have demonstrated efficacy and no large clinical trials that have determined potential risks of increasing the incidence of clinical prostate cancers or cardiovascular events. We provide a critical review of the evidence that supports treatment and potential risks and ways to reduce the risks if the physician and patient elect testosterone replacement.

### Statins and prostate cancer-hype or hope? The epidemiological perspective [^113E54Ca]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Current treatment landscape: statins and androgen deprivation therapy

As statins are associated with reduced risk of advanced prostate cancer and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the main treatment for this patient subgroup, it is not surprising that recent investigations have focused on statins in the context of patients managed with ADT (Table 1). A 2017 analysis of the Finnish Randomised Study for Prostate Cancer Screening found that post-diagnosis statin use was more strongly associated with reduced prostate cancer-specific mortality in men undergoing ADT, relative to other treatment modalities. Subsequent studies focused on ADT-treated men only, and overwhelmingly support an inverse association between statin use and prostate cancer-specific mortality in the context of ADT (Table 1).

Table 1
Published studies evaluating associations between statin use and prostate cancer outcomes in the setting of ADT, ordered by proportion of primary ADT.

By inhibiting androgen synthesis in the testes, ADTs lower systemic androgen levels, limiting androgen signalling pathways driving prostate cancer survival and proliferation. However, tumour progression inevitably occurs in spite of low availability of circulating androgens through a variety of documented mechanisms including intratumoral androgen synthesis from cholesterol. As such, it has been hypothesised that statins may synergise with ADT by blocking accumulation of intratumoral cholesterol thereby reducing the substrate for de novo androgen synthesis within the prostate. Given that more advanced tumours upregulate enzymes necessary for de novo androgen synthesis, it may be that statins have a stronger effect in later-stage tumours, enriched in the context of salvage ADT. Indeed, inverse associations reported by the various observational studies completed to date (Table 1) appear slightly stronger among patients receiving salvage ADT, typically administrated later during the disease course compared to primary ADT. Among studies where the majority were using salvage ADT, estimates for statin use in association with prostate cancer-specific mortality ranged from HR 0.65 (95% CI 0.48–0.97) to HR 0.86 (95% CI 0.69–1.07), whereas among studies in the context of majority primary ADT, estimates ranged from HR 0.82 (95% CI 0.69–0.96) to HR 0.98 (95% CI 0.72–1.32). These estimates could support a biological mechanism or be the result of greater difficulty with controlling time-varying confounding in settings of salvage ADT, where data on patient and tumour characteristics are typically known only at diagnosis.
