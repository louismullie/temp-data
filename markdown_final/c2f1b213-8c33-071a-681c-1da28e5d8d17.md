## Question

Metformin in COVID-19 infection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether metformin should be used for COVID-19 infection, including its effects on acute outcomes, long COVID, safety, and how to apply the evidence in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why metformin is biologically plausible. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence from randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses. Next, I will examine mechanistic data and observational signals, including sex-specific and BMI-related findings. After that, I need to assess safety, especially lactic acidosis risk. Finally, I will align conclusions with guideline positions and translate this into practical recommendations, including who might reasonably consider metformin and who should not.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and biological plausibility. Patients with diabetes or obesity have higher risks of severe COVID-19, and metformin has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and potential antiviral effects that could theoretically mitigate hyperinflammation and viral replication, which makes it a rational candidate for repurposing in acute COVID-19 and possibly in long COVID prevention [^115VK8wJ] [^115mHL6z] [^111NS4pp].

> Wait, let me verify the highest-quality evidence before drawing conclusions. The most definitive data come from randomized controlled trials and WHO-commissioned meta-analyses of RCTs, which consistently show that metformin does not significantly improve acute clinical outcomes such as mortality, hospitalization, or mechanical ventilation in non-severe COVID-19, although a signal for reduced long COVID incidence has been reported in a single trial with low certainty of evidence [^115shVgx] [^1176iEkQ].

> I will now examine the pivotal RCTs. The COVID-OUT trial in nonhospitalized adults found no significant benefit on a composite of hypoxemia, ED visit, hospitalization, or death, but did show a 42% reduction in long COVID at 10 months in a prespecified analysis; however, this long COVID outcome is based on participant-reported diagnoses and has a high risk of bias from missing data, so I should be cautious about overinterpreting it despite its biological plausibility [^116KZCgw] [^112PHvXo] [^116v1Esw]. The ACTIV-6 platform trial, which enrolled participants during the JN.1 era, likewise found no shortening of time to sustained symptom recovery with metformin versus placebo, reinforcing the lack of acute symptom benefit in low-risk outpatients [^112MAJrB] [^1126owR9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from observational data. Multiple observational studies and meta-analyses have associated metformin use with lower mortality and severity, but these designs are vulnerable to confounding by indication, disease severity, and comorbidity burden; indeed, network meta-analyses of observational data place metformin among agents with relatively lower risk of adverse outcomes, yet this cannot establish causality and should be viewed as hypothesis-generating rather than practice-changing [^112zF15f] [^113qsjtU] [^1172K2YA].

> Let me consider mechanistic and virologic signals that might explain a long COVID effect. Metformin reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral load by approximately 3.6-fold in the COVID-OUT substudy, and in vitro studies show suppression of viral replication via AMPK-dependent and mTOR-related pathways; however, translating a modest early viral load reduction into durable clinical benefit for post-acute sequelae remains speculative and requires replication in larger, diverse RCTs with standardized long COVID definitions [^112PHvXo] [^113Gg3om] [^115zUkGk].

> I need to check safety carefully, especially the concern about lactic acidosis. In RCTs of nonhospitalized patients, metformin was generally well tolerated with no excess serious adverse events or lactic acidosis signals, and WHO meta-analytic safety data show little or no difference in discontinuations versus placebo; however, in hospitalized or critically ill patients with hypoxia or organ dysfunction, the risk of lactic acidosis may rise, so metformin should be held in severe illness or when eGFR is below 30 mL/min or in other classic contraindications [^116v1Esw] [^115wwa3q] [^1136zPse].

> But wait, what if there are subgroup effects that change the risk-benefit calculus. A large retrospective emulation analysis suggested that starting metformin within 90 days of COVID-19 diagnosis reduced post-COVID conditions by about 36% in adults with overweight or obesity, and COVID-OUT's long COVID signal appeared stronger in those with higher BMI; sex-specific observational data also hint at mortality benefit in women, though these findings require prospective confirmation before routine use is justified [^1159Dnsb].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure alignment. The WHO living guidance does not recommend metformin for acute COVID-19 treatment, and the IDSA COVID-19 guideline does not include metformin as a recommended therapy, reflecting the current absence of convincing benefit on acute outcomes; both bodies emphasize that decisions about chronic medications, including metformin, should be individualized based on clinical status and contraindications during acute illness [^116v1Esw] [^112P7V5J].

> Let me translate this into practical recommendations. For patients with COVID-19 who are already taking metformin for diabetes, I should confirm kidney function and clinical severity; if eGFR is adequate and the patient is not severely ill, it is reasonable to continue metformin, but if hypoxia, shock, or acute kidney injury develop, it should be held to mitigate lactic acidosis risk; for patients without diabetes, routine initiation of metformin for acute COVID-19 is not supported by current evidence and should not be recommended outside of a clinical trial [^115wwa3q] [^116v1Esw].

> I should double-check the long COVID angle. Given the low-certainty but intriguing signal that metformin may reduce long COVID incidence, especially in those with overweight or obesity, shared decision-making could consider a time-limited trial in appropriately selected, nonpregnant adults with recent infection and preserved renal function, ideally within research frameworks or with explicit counseling about uncertain benefits and the need for more definitive data [^116v1Esw] [^114sqFeU].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. High-quality RCTs and meta-analyses show no significant benefit of metformin on acute COVID-19 outcomes, while a single RCT suggests a possible reduction in long COVID with low certainty; observational associations with improved outcomes exist but are likely confounded, and safety is acceptable in nonhospitalized settings with appropriate precautions, so metformin should not be used as standard treatment for COVID-19 outside trials, though continuation in stable patients with diabetes is generally reasonable [^116v1Esw] [^115shVgx] [^116KZCgw].

---

Metformin is **not recommended for routine treatment** of COVID-19 outside clinical trials, as high-quality evidence shows no significant benefit on acute outcomes such as mortality, hospitalization, or mechanical ventilation [^116v1Esw] [^115shVgx]. However, metformin may reduce the risk of long COVID by about 40% in nonhospitalized adults with acute infection, though this finding is based on low-certainty evidence from a single trial and requires confirmation [^116v1Esw] [^115shVgx]. Metformin is **safe to continue in patients with diabetes** who have COVID-19, provided renal function is monitored and contraindications are avoided [^115wwa3q] [^1136zPse]. Routine use for COVID-19 treatment is not supported by current guidelines, and any off-label use should be individualized and evidence-informed [^116v1Esw].

## Clinical evidence for metformin in COVID-19

### Acute outcomes

- **COVID-OUT trial**: In nonhospitalized adults with acute COVID-19, metformin did not significantly reduce a composite of hypoxemia, ED visit, hospitalization, or death (23.6% vs 27.4%; OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.66–1.09) [^116KZCgw].

- **ACTIV-6 trial**: Metformin did not shorten time to sustained symptom recovery (median 9 vs 10 days; adjusted HR 0.96, 95% CrI 0.89–1.03) and did not reduce hospitalization or death (1.1% vs 1.3%) [^112MAJrB] [^1126owR9].

- **Meta-analyses**: Multiple high-quality meta-analyses conclude metformin has little or no impact on mortality, hospitalization, or mechanical ventilation in acute COVID-19 [^116v1Esw] [^115shVgx].

---

### Long COVID outcomes

In the COVID-OUT trial, metformin reduced the incidence of long COVID by about 40% (10.6% vs 18.3%; OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.39–0.89) over 10 months, but this is **low-certainty evidence** from a single trial with missing data and unvaccinated participants [^116v1Esw] [^115shVgx].

---

## Safety considerations

- **Lactic acidosis risk**: Metformin is generally safe, but lactic acidosis risk rises with hypoxia, renal impairment, or severe illness; monitor renal function and hold in severe disease [^115wwa3q] [^1136zPse].

- **Clinical guidance**: For patients with COVID-19 and diabetes, continue metformin if renal function is adequate and no contraindications exist; adjust if illness is severe or organ dysfunction develops [^115wwa3q] [^112P7V5J].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Current guidelines from WHO and IDSA **do not recommend routine metformin use** for COVID-19 treatment outside trials, citing insufficient evidence for acute outcomes [^116v1Esw] [^115shVgx]. For patients with diabetes and COVID-19, continue metformin with close monitoring unless contraindicated [^115wwa3q] [^112P7V5J].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

Ongoing studies aim to clarify metformin's role in long COVID, optimal timing, dosing, and patient selection, especially in **overweight/obese individuals** and those with metabolic risk [^114sqFeU]. Larger, diverse RCTs are needed to confirm the long COVID signal and define any subgroup benefits [^1176iEkQ].

## Summary of evidence

| **Outcome** | **Evidence summary** |
|-|-|
| Mortality | No significant benefit [^116v1Esw] [^115shVgx] |
| Hospitalization | No significant benefit [^116v1Esw] [^115shVgx] |
| Mechanical ventilation | No significant benefit [^116v1Esw] [^115shVgx] |
| Long COVID | Possible 40% reduction; low-certainty evidence [^116v1Esw] [^115shVgx] |
| Safety | Generally safe; monitor renal function and contraindications [^115wwa3q] [^1136zPse] |

---

Metformin is **not recommended for routine COVID-19 treatment** given the lack of benefit on acute outcomes, but it may reduce long COVID risk in nonhospitalized adults; evidence is limited and awaits confirmation. Continue metformin in patients with diabetes who have COVID-19 if clinically appropriate, and use off-label only with shared decision-making and careful monitoring.

## References

### Mechanisms and potential roles of glucose-lowering agents in COVID-19: a review [^111NS4pp]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To explore mechanistic benefits of glucose-lowering agents that extend beyond glycemic control with the potential to mitigate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) complications.

Data Sources

The following PubMed literature search terms were used from July 2020 to January 2, 2021: diabetes, COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), glucose-lowering agents, and pharmacology.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language studies reporting on the association between diabetes, COVID-19 adverse outcomes, and the potential roles of glucose-lowering agents were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

Selected glucose-lowering agents have benefits beyond glycemic control, with the potential to reduce the risks of severe complications during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Key benefits include anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, immune modulating, and enzyme/receptor effects.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

This review summarizes the current knowledge of glucose-lowering agents and their potential roles in COVID-19 outcomes. Considering beneficial mechanisms on COVID-19 outcomes that extend beyond glycemic control as well as safety profiles, current data suggest that dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors and metformin may have the most promise and warrant further investigation.

Conclusions

Certain glucose-lowering agents may offer additional benefits beyond glucose control-namely, by modulating the mechanisms contributing to adverse outcomes related to COVID-19 in patients with diabetes. DPP-IV inhibitors and metformin appear to have the most promise. However, current published literature on diabetes medications and COVID-19 should be interpreted with caution. Most published studies are retrospective and consist of convenience samples, and some lack adequate analytical approaches with confounding biases. Ongoing trials aim to evaluate the effects of glucose-lowering agents in reducing the severity of COVID-19 outcomes.

### Metformin for COVID-19: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116v1Esw]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Objective

To summarise the effects of metformin on covid-19 to inform a World Health Organization (WHO) clinical practice guideline.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

As part of a living systematic review and network meta-analysis of drug treatments for covid-19 (covid-19 LNMA), a search was performed of the WHO covid-19 database, six Chinese databases, and the Epistemonikos Foundation's Living Overview of the Evidence covid-19 Repository (covid-19 L-OVE).

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Randomised controlled trials that compared metformin with placebo in patients with acute covid-19 infection.

Data Synthesis

Frequentist pairwise meta-analyses were performed using the restricted maximum likelihood random effects model. The effects of interventions on selected outcomes were summarised using risk ratios, risk difference, and mean difference when appropriate, along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). To estimate absolute effects, the control arm event rate was used as the baseline risk. The risk of bias of the included studies was assessed using a modification of the Cochrane risk of bias 2.0 tool and the certainty of evidence using the GRADE (grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation) approach, with the minimally important difference in effect as the threshold.

Results

Three randomised controlled trials of 1869 patients were included; one study provided long term follow-up on long covid. Metformin might have little or no impact on mortality (risk ratio 0.76, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.90; risk difference 3 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 8 fewer to 11 more; low certainty). The effects of metformin on admission to hospital because of covid-19 remain uncertain (risk ratio 0.74, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.95; risk difference 15 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 42 fewer to 55 more; very low certainty). Metformin results in little or no difference in adverse effects leading to discontinuation (risk difference 0.2 more per 1000, 95% CI 2.7 fewer to 3.1 more; high certainty). Metformin might decrease the development of long covid (risk ratio 0.6, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.9; risk difference 41 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 62 fewer to 10 fewer; low certainty). However, the effect is based on a single trial of 1126 patients, which has a high risk of bias owing to missing data, and nearly half of the participants were unvaccinated.

Conclusions

Current evidence based on randomised trials suggests no significant effect of metformin on acute clinical outcomes in patients with non-severe covid-19. Metformin might reduce the incidence of long covid when used to treat patients with non-severe acute covid-19 infection, but this was suggested by low certainty evidence from a single trial.

### Metformin for treatment of acute COVID-19: systematic review of clinical trial data against SARS-CoV-2 [^114sdato]. Diabetes Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Observational and preclinical data suggest metformin may prevent severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes.

Purpose

We conducted a systematic review of randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of metformin treatment for COVID-19 to determine whether metformin affects clinical or laboratory outcomes in individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and present a structured summary of preclinical data.

Study Selection

Two independent reviewers searched PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 1 February 2023 with no date restrictions for trials where investigators randomized adults with COVID-19 to metformin versus control and assessed clinical and/or laboratory outcomes of interest. The Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool was used to assess bias.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers extracted data pertaining to prespecified outcomes of each interest from each included trial.

Data Synthesis

The synthesis plan was developed a priori and was guided by Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) guidelines. Summary tables and narrative synthesis were used (PROSPERO, 2022, CRD42022349896). Three randomized trials met inclusion criteria. In two of the trials investigators found that metformin improved clinical outcomes (prevented need for oxygen and prevented need for acute health care use), and in the third trial a larger portion of adults with diabetes were enrolled but results did show a direction of benefit similar to that of the other trials in the per-protocol group. In the largest trial, subjects were enrolled during the delta and omicron waves and vaccinated individuals were included. The certainty of evidence that metformin prevents health care use due to COVID-19 was moderate per Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Many preclinical studies have shown metformin to be effective against SARS-CoV-2.

Limitations

Limitations include inclusion of only three trials and heterogeneity between trials.

Conclusions

Future trials will help define the role of metformin in COVID-19 treatment guidelines.

### Metformin for COVID-19: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114rz56i]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Given the biological rationale for metformin use in covid-19, investigators have conducted several observational studies and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with results summarised in systematic reviews; however, these reviews have limitations. Several reviews included low quality observational studies and did not incorporate data from recent randomised controlled trials. One review of randomised controlled trials omitted a formal quantitative meta-analysis and did not adhere to current GRADE (grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluations) guidance. Initial randomised controlled trials assessing intervention effects on non-severe covid-19 did not address long covid, and the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline development group (GDG) responsible for WHO covid-19 guidelines did not identify long covid as a key outcome. Additionally, previous reviews did not consider the role of metformin in preventing and treating long covid. When the metformin trial addressing long covid was published, the GDG added long covid as a key outcome for studies of treatment for non-severe covid-19. The GDG also commissioned this review to support their clinical guidelines on metformin in patients with non-severe covid-19, including long covid, a previously unaddressed outcome.

Implications for practice and research

The findings from this systematic review and meta-analysis will inform the WHO clinical practice guideline on metformin in patients with non-severe covid-19. Because the only finding suggesting a beneficial effect of metformin is the reduction in long covid, and that finding is informed by low certainty evidence from a single trial, more randomised trials are needed to provide definitive evidence. Future randomised controlled trials should aim to include larger and more diverse populations to ensure broader applicability of findings. Studies should prioritise enrolling patients admitted to hospital and those who have been vaccinated because these groups are underrepresented in existing randomised controlled trials. Establishing a consistent diagnostic approach and a standardised definition for long covid would strengthen outcome assessment and comparability across studies. Additional research into the mechanisms through which metformin might affect viral dynamics and inflammatory responses could further clarify its role in long covid and as an adjunct treatment in covid-19. Future research addressing these gaps might provide more substantial evidence to guide clinical practice and optimise the use of metformin in managing patients with covid-19.

Conclusions

Low certainty evidence suggests that metformin might have little or no impact on mortality when used to treat patients with non-severe acute covid-19 infection. The effects of metformin on admission to hospital remain uncertain, and it shows little or no difference in adverse effects leading to discontinuation. Metformin might reduce incidence of long covid when used to treat patients with non-severe acute covid-19 infection, but this was suggested by low certainty evidence from a single trial. Further research is required to establish the impact of metformin on long covid.

Certainty of evidence assessment

We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. We made judgments of imprecision using the minimally important difference as a threshold and therefore rated certainty for each outcome in an important or unimportant effect. The corresponding WHO GDG decided and agreed on the following minimally important differences to inform therapeutic recommendations for patients with non-severe covid-19: mortality — 3 per 1000; mechanical ventilation — 15 per 1000; admission to hospital — 15 per 1000; adverse effects leading to discontinuation — 15 per 1000; patients with long covid — 20 per 1000; duration of hospital stay — 1 day; time to symptom resolution — 1 day.

Reviewers rated the certainty of outcome as high, moderate, low, or very low based on considerations of risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias. As fewer than 10 studies are included in the pooled estimate, we could not assess publication bias statistically. However, our search strategy included several databases, trial registries, and preprint repositories to capture published and unpublished studies, reducing the likelihood of missing relevant trials. Therefore, our approach reduces the risk of publication bias, but does not rule it out. We used standardised lay language to interpret and communicate the results, reflecting the level of certainty in the evidence.

Patient and public involvement

Patients were part of the WHO guideline development group and were involved in the outcome selection and generation of WHO recommendations, and therefore, in the outcome selection for this systematic review. On publication, the findings of the review will be disseminated to relevant patients and the public.

### Metformin for COVID-19: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113hAXN7]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Study selection

This review included reports of randomised controlled trials that compared metformin with placebo in patients with suspected, probable, or confirmed acute covid-19 infection, as defined by the study authors. Using systematic review software, Covidence, pairs of reviewers worked independently to screen titles and abstracts of search records, followed by full texts of records identified as potentially eligible at the title and abstract screening stage. Reviewers resolved disagreements through consensus and, if necessary, adjudication with a third party reviewer.

Data collection and risk of bias assessment

After receiving training and undergoing calibration exercises, two reviewers independently gathered information from each eligible trial using a standardised and pilot tested form. This information included trial characteristics (such as trial registration, publication status, and study design), patient characteristics (such as country, age, sex, comorbidities, type of care, and severity of covid-19 symptoms), intervention characteristics, and outcomes of interest (such as the number of participants analysed and the number of participants who experienced an event). Reviewers resolved discrepancies through discussion and, when necessary, third party adjudication. We updated our data when a study preprint was published as a peer reviewed article.

Guided by the corresponding WHO covid-19 GDG, we concentrated on the following patient important outcomes: all cause mortality within 90 days, mechanical ventilation, admission to hospital, adverse effects leading to discontinuation, patients with long covid, duration of hospital stay, and time to symptom resolution. Long covid was not prespecified in the protocol of our covid-19 LNMA project, and therefore, it is a post hoc outcome in this review.

To assess the risk of bias, reviewers, after training and calibration exercises, used a modified version of the Cochrane tool to assess the risk of bias in randomised trials (RoB 2.0). Reviewers rated trials as having a low risk of bias, probably low risk of bias, probably high risk of bias, or high risk of bias across the following domains: bias arising from the randomisation process, bias owing to deviations from the intended intervention, bias from missing outcome data, bias in outcome measurement, bias in the selection of reported results, and bias from competing risks. Reviewers resolved discrepancies by consensus and, when necessary, by third party adjudication. An online supplemental file includes our modified risk of bias tool.

### Metformin in SARS-CoV-2 infection: a hidden path-from altered inflammation to reduced mortality. A review from the literature [^115usRry]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2023). Medium credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 infection has been a major threat to human health and a huge challenge to Medicine. In only two years, COVID-19 affected > 350 million people, causing > 5.6 million deaths. Chronic inflammatory states, such as diabetes or obesity, are known risk factors for COVID-19 poorest outcomes, with higher risk for disease severity and greater mortality. Metformin remains on the first line of the management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes. Through its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory mechanisms, metformin appears as an opportunity to control the dysregulated cytokine storm secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recent studies point towards a potential protective role of metformin in the course of COVID-19, showing that current or previous treatment with metformin associates with better outcomes.

### Metformin and time to sustained recovery in adults with COVID-19: the ACTIV-6 randomized clinical trial [^112MAJrB]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Importance

The effect of metformin on reducing symptom duration among outpatient adults with COVID-19 has not been studied.

Objective

To assess metformin compared with placebo for symptom resolution during acute infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines platform evaluated repurposed medications for mild to moderate COVID-19. Between September 19, 2023, and May 1, 2024, participants 30 years or older with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 2 or more COVID-19 symptoms for 7 days or less were included at 90 US sites.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to receive metformin (titrated to 1500 mg, daily) or placebo for 14 days.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was time to sustained recovery (3 consecutive days without COVID-19 symptoms) within 28 days of receiving the study drug. Secondary outcomes included time to clinic visit, emergency department (ED) visit, hospitalization, or death. Safety events of interest were hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis.

Results

Among 2991 participants who were randomized and received study drug, the median age was 47 (IQR, 38–58) years; 1895 (63.4%) were female, 25 (0.8%) were American Indian of Alaska Native, 77 (2.6%) were Asian, 350 (11.7%) were Black, African American, or African, 1392 (46.5%) identified as Hispanic or Latino, 8 (0.3%) were Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 2395 (80.1%) were White, and 2044 (68.3%) reported 2 or more doses of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Among 1443 (48.2%) participants who received metformin and 1548 (51.8%) who received placebo, differences in time to sustained recovery were not observed (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.89–1.03; P for efficacy = .11). The median time to sustained recovery was 9 days (95% CI, 9–10) for metformin and 10 days (95% CI, 9–10) for placebo. No deaths were reported; 103 participants reported clinic visits, ED visits, or hospitalization: 54 in the metformin group and 49 in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% CrI, 0.82–1.78; P for efficacy = .13). Overall, 35 (1.2%) reported ED visits or hospitalization (1.1% in the metformin and 1.3% in the placebo group). Seven participants who received metformin and 3 who received placebo experienced a serious adverse event over 180 days. There were 4 episodes of participant-reported hypoglycemia in the placebo group and 2 in the metformin group.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, metformin was not shown to shorten the time to symptom resolution in low-risk adults with COVID-19. The median days to symptom resolution was numerically but not significantly lower for metformin. Safety was not a limitation in the study population.

Trial Registration

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04885530.

### Metformin for COVID-19: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111DSKDZ]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we summarised the effects of metformin on patients with non-severe acute covid-19 infection. Metformin might have little or no impact on mortality, and little or no difference was shown for mechanical ventilation. Similarly, the effects of metformin on admission to hospital and duration of hospital stay remain uncertain, and it has little or no impact on adverse effects leading to treatment discontinuation.

The findings suggest that metformin might decrease post-covid-19 conditions; the certainty of the evidence was low. The COVID-OUT trial was the only eligible trial that reported on long covid. The authors evaluated the effects of metformin on long covid based on participant reported receipt of a diagonosis of long covid from a medical provider. Analysis of data with 1126 participants revealed that outpatient treatment with metformin reduced long covid incidence by 40%, with an absolute risk reduction of 41 per 1000 compared with placebo after 300 days of follow-up.

Strengths and limitations

The strengths of this review include our comprehensive search, duplicate assessment of eligibility, risk of bias, and data extraction. We evaluated the certainty of evidence with the formal application of the GRADE approach, using the minimally important differences chosen by the WHO GDG as thresholds.

The review had potential limitations. The studies included a limited range of patients in terms of presentation and severity. We identified only three relevant studies with a very limited total sample size. The effects of metformin on mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, and long covid were based on a single trial. We could not analyse the time to symptom resolution because studies did not report any data. Only one study included long term follow-up, and there is a high risk of bias owing to missing data for long covid. Although the study was blinded, the reliance on participant reported diagnoses of long covid by a medical provider, without a unified diagnostic criterion, could lead to misclassification. The generalisability of the findings is limited because almost half of the participants were non-vaccinated. Moreover, WHO commissioned this review when the appearance of the trial alerted the WHO GDG to the potential importance of long covid as a key outcome of trials primarily focused on the immediate consequences of covid-19 treatment. The apparent effect of metformin on long covid could have influenced the decision to commission the review, and might contribute to lower certainty in the existence of this effect.

Abstract

Objective

To summarise the effects of metformin on covid-19 to inform a World Health Organization (WHO) clinical practice guideline.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sources

As part of a living systematic review and network meta-analysis of drug treatments for covid-19 (covid-19 LNMA), a search was performed of the WHO covid-19 database, six Chinese databases, and the Epistemonikos Foundation's Living Overview of the Evidence covid-19 Repository (covid-19 L-OVE).

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies

Randomised controlled trials that compared metformin with placebo in patients with acute covid-19 infection.

Data synthesis

Frequentist pairwise meta-analyses were performed using the restricted maximum likelihood random effects model. The effects of interventions on selected outcomes were summarised using risk ratios, risk difference, and mean difference when appropriate, along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). To estimate absolute effects, the control arm event rate was used as the baseline risk. The risk of bias of the included studies was assessed using a modification of the Cochrane risk of bias 2.0 tool and the certainty of evidence using the GRADE (grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation) approach, with the minimally important difference in effect as the threshold.

Results

Three randomised controlled trials of 1869 patients were included; one study provided long term follow-up on long covid. Metformin might have little or no impact on mortality (risk ratio 0.76, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.90; risk difference 3 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 8 fewer to 11 more; low certainty). The effects of metformin on admission to hospital because of covid-19 remain uncertain (risk ratio 0.74, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.95; risk difference 15 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 42 fewer to 55 more; very low certainty). Metformin results in little or no difference in adverse effects leading to discontinuation (risk difference 0.2 more per 1000, 95% CI 2.7 fewer to 3.1 more; high certainty). Metformin might decrease the development of long covid (risk ratio 0.6, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.9; risk difference 41 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 62 fewer to 10 fewer; low certainty). However, the effect is based on a single trial of 1126 patients, which has a high risk of bias owing to missing data, and nearly half of the participants were unvaccinated.

Conclusions

Current evidence based on randomised trials suggests no significant effect of metformin on acute clinical outcomes in patients with non-severe covid-19. Metformin might reduce the incidence of long covid when used to treat patients with non-severe acute covid-19 infection, but this was suggested by low certainty evidence from a single trial.

Effects of intervention

Mortality

Two randomised controlled trials including 1615 patients with maximum follow-up of 28 days reported mortality. The pooled estimate suggests that metformin might result in little or no difference in mortality (risk ratio 0.76, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.90; risk difference 3 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 8 fewer to 11 more; low certainty). The certainty of the evidence was low owing to very serious imprecision (table 2 and online supplemental figure S1).

Table 2
Summary of effects of metformin on patients with covid-19

Mechanical ventilation

Based on data from 1197 participants in one randomised controlled trial with a follow-up time of 28 days, metformin has little or no impact on mechanical ventilation (risk difference 3 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 9 fewer to 2.3 more; high certainty (table 2; and online supplemental figure S2).

Admission to hospital

Two studies reported on admission to hospital within 28 days and included 1615 patients. The evidence is uncertain regarding the effect of metformin on admission to hospital because of covid-19 (risk ratio 0.74, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.95; risk difference 15 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 42 fewer to 55 more; very low certainty). The certainty of the evidence was very low because of serious inconsistency and very serious imprecision (table 2 and online supplemental figure S3).

Adverse effects leading to discontinuation

Based on data from 1761 participants in all three included studies, metformin has little or no impact on adverse effects leading to discontinuation (risk difference 0.2 more per 1000, 95% CI 2.7 fewer to 3.1 more; high certainty; table 2 and online supplemental figure S4).

Long covid

Data from one randomised controlled trial that followed 1126 patients for 300 days provided evidence that metformin might decrease incidence of long covid (risk ratio 0.6, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.9; risk difference 41 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 62 fewer to 10 fewer; low certainty). The certainty of the evidence was low owing to the serious risk of bias and serious imprecision (table 2 and online supplemental figure S5).

Results

Study characteristics

As of 23 May 2024, we identified 139 233 records after removing duplicates, and we assessed 3496 full texts for our living systematic review and network meta-analysis. Ultimately, we identified 759 eligible unique randomised controlled trials, including three trials focused on the effects of metformin for covid-19 that enrolled 1869 patients (figure 1); one study had a long term follow-up on long covid. These three trials were conducted in Brazil, Mexico, and the United States. The mean age of participants ranged from 46 to 52 years. The TOGETHER trialand COVID-OUT trialenrolled patients with non-severe covid-19 who were not admitted to hospital, and Ventura-López and colleagues recruited a mixed population admitted to hospital with only 20 participants. Table 1 presents the characteristics of the included studies.

Risk of bias in included studies

For mortality, mechanical ventilation, admission to hospital, adverse effects leading to discontinuation, and duration of hospital stay, all studies had a low risk of bias across all domains, including bias from the randomisation process, bias owing to deviations from the intended intervention, missing data, measurement of the outcome, bias in the selection of the reported results, and bias because of competing risks. In the COVID-OUT trial, for long covid, the risk of bias from missing data was likely high owing to 14.9% missing outcome data (1126 of 1323 participants consented to participate in long term follow-up). Bias because of measurement of the outcome and bias in the selection of the reported results were probably low (figure 2). The online supplemental material provides details of the risk of bias assessment.

Introduction

As a result of ongoing global efforts in medical treatment, vaccination, and public health measures, most patients with covid-19 experience only mild illness. However, some people, particularly those with underlying health conditions, could face complications requiring medical intervention. Additionally, people who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection might experience prolonged effects on various organs and systems, collectively referred to as "long covid" or "post covid-19 condition". This condition manifests as a multisystem disorder affecting the respiratory, cardiovascular, nervous, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal systems. Studies have reported over 200 associated symptoms, including pain, fatigue, cognitive impairment, and respiratory difficulties, with 66 of these symptoms sometimes persisting for longer than seven months. Conservative estimates suggest that approximately 10% of patients with covid-19 will develop persistent long covid symptoms, with a major impact on individual health and socioeconomic dynamics. Consequently, both acute and long term impacts of covid-19, including long covid, have emerged as a pressing global public health concern.

Metformin is a widely used, cost effective, and safe antidiabetic treatment. Metformin could have anti-inflammatory properties, potentially reducing mortality rates and the development of prolonged covid-19 symptoms through various mechanisms. Metformin elicits angiotensin converting enzyme 2 phosphorylation, impedes viral adhesion, hinders covid-19 cellular entry, and curtails the release of inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, metformin attenuates dipeptidyl peptidase 4 activity, impeding viral entry and diminishing the expression of inflammatory markers. Metformin has been proposed as an antiviral and a disease modifying drug to treat covid-19. Viral load analysis of specimens collected in the COVID-OUT trial showed that the mean SARS-CoV-2 viral load was reduced 3.6-fold with metformin compared with placebo (−0.56 log 10 copies/mL, 95% confidence interval (CI) −1.05 to −0.06, P = 0.027).

There is also only limited, if any, guidance on how to de-intensify insulin regimens after discharge in patients initiated with insulin during hospitalization – — a scenario that has become more common due to the frequent need for insulin in patients hospitalized with Covid-19. For these patients, we can apply our existing knowledge from discharging patients in non-Covid-19 settings, as the principles are similar; the challenge is only to ensure that expertise on best practice is shared with the greater number of clinicians who may now be managing patients in such a scenario.

Overall, evidence is conflicting as to which glucose-lowering drugs are associated with the most favourable outcomes in patients with Covid-19 (Fig. 1 b) and for the most part relies on observational data rather than randomized controlled trials. Large mortality studies have suggested either a benefit or no significant difference with metformin – and SGLT2i; – a benefit or neutral effect or even a negative effect with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i); – a benefit or neutral effect with GLP-1 RA; and a negative effect with insulin (Table 2) –. However, these observations may well be largely explained by confounders, and it is still not clear whether any of glucose-lowering agents provide true protection from Covid-19. Despite our reservations, the data do provide some reassurance on the lack of a safety signal, even for insulin where confounding factors were considered the likely explanation for the apparent negative effect.

Some recommendations also note that DPP-4i can be considered in addition to insulin in the hospital setting, which may be highly relevant given the overlap in the elderly profile of DPP-4i recipients and patients hospitalized with Covid-19.

Where recommendations disagree is on how to apply sick day rules for SGLT2i and metformin during Covid-19 infection, with some advocating for sick day rules with any degree of illness and others reserving this for hospitalized or even critically ill patients –. There is more agreement that no change to normal glucose-lowering treatment is needed in patients who may be at risk of infection but who are not currently infected.

If patients requiring hospitalization for Covid-19 continue on SGLT2i, they should be monitored for DKA, which can occur in patients with Covid-19 independently of treatment, but can sometimes also be associated with SGLT2i use. For patients with Covid-19 who are not hospitalized, we suggest that factors that may increase the risk for DKA are considered, namely fluid loss due to diarrhoea or low intake of food and drink due to a suppressed appetite or gastrointestinal symptoms. Patients on metformin with hypoxaemia or organ failure should be monitored for the risk of lactic acidosis, which can occur under these conditions.

Due to the paucity of data, all recommendations are based on clinical judgement alone, and made out of necessity without extensive, robust evidence. For this reason, and until such data are available, recommendations should be treated with caution and considered to be heavily caveated.

We are also mindful that the harm of suboptimal management of diabetes should not be overlooked, especially as inadequate glycaemic control has been linked to poor outcomes in patients with Covid-19 –. Similarly, losing the cardiorenal protective effects and weight loss benefits of SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA may be detrimental given the cardiorenal risk posed by both type 2 diabetes and Covid-19, a question that remains open after the inconclusive results of the DARE-19 study. Finally, while data on hypoglycaemia in patients with Covid-19 are limited, this should not deter clinicians from preferring therapies with a low risk of these events.

Metformin's anti-inflammatory capabilities and function in modifying the immune response could explain the reported reduction in long covid. Bramante and colleagues underlined the anti-inflammatory capabilities of metformin, which might contribute to its long term covid-19 efficacy. Studies have shown that metformin lowers inflammatory mediator release and limits viral adherence, potentially decreasing the prolonged inflammatory state associated with covid-19. However, understanding the hypothetical mechanisms involved in long covid is challenging because the underlying processes of the condition are not well understood. Several potential disease modifying mechanisms of action have been proposed, each with varying degrees of plausibility. There is no direct in vitro or in vivo preclinical evidence supporting a specific mechanism of action for long covid. The indirect evidence available for various mechanisms varies in quality, particularly concerning the concentrations used (physiological v supraphysiological) and the sophistication of the methodologies applied. A retrospective study based on electronic health records assessed the risk of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection by comparing 5596 prevalent users of metformin with 1451 prevalent users of sulfonylureas or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The effects of metformin on the risk of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection at three month follow-up (risk ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.32; risk difference 14 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 45 fewer to 33 more; very low certainty) or at six month follow-up (0.81, 0.55 to 1.20; 20 fewer per 1000, 46 fewer to 21 more; very low certainty) were uncertain.

4 Discussion

The anti-diabetic drug, metformin, has been projected to influence the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. As patients with comorbidities fared worse when infected with SARS-CoV-2, management of an ongoing illness alongside COVID-19 treatment became paramount. Some studies early during the pandemic identified a positive correlation between improved glucose levels in diabetic patients on metformin and better clinical outcome. A number of reports proposed metformin as a possible "miracle or menace" in COVID-afflicted patients, based on retrospective data from hospitalisations, comparing the length of hospitalisation, severity of symptoms, or mortality. In this study, we demonstrate that metformin profoundly lowers SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. While extrapolating these results to a clinical setup may not be appropriate, our data indicate that metformin can be effective not only as a treatment option, but as a prophylactic agent as well. With this data, we suggest that treatment of patients with metformin prior to infection with SARS-CoV-2 may have assisted in decreasing their symptoms of COVID-19. Our results also suggest that metformin could be beneficial in non-diabetic, COVID-19 patients and expand the scope of its coverage. In summary, this data lies in agreement with the numerous case studies published during the pandemic that suggested an antiviral role for this known anti-diabetic drug.

### Randomized trial of metformin, ivermectin, and fluvoxamine for COVID-19 [^116KZCgw]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study COVID-OUT (metformin) was published by Carolyn T Bramante and colleagues in 2022 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: COVID-19 infection. In the COVID-OUT (metformin) study, the trial question was: what is the role of metformin in patients with COVID-19 infection? In the COVID-OUT (metformin) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the COVID-OUT (metformin) study, the population was: 1323 patients (741 female, 582 male). The inclusion criteria were nonhospitalized adult patients aged 30–85 years with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 within the past 3 days. The key exclusion criteria were hospitalization for COVID-19 infection or other reasons; symptom onset > 7 days; immunocompromised patient; hepatic impairment; alcohol use disorder; history of severe kidney disease. In the COVID-OUT (metformin) study, the interventions were: n = 663 metformin (immediate-release metformin alone, with an increase in dose over 6 days to 1,500 mg/day for 14 days, or metformin in combination with either fluvoxamine or ivermectin) n = 660 placebo (receipt of placebo, fluvoxamine alone or ivermectin alone). In the COVID-OUT (metformin) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in composite outcome of hypoxemia, emergency department visit, hospitalization, or death (23.6% vs. 27.4%; OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.09). In the COVID-OUT (metformin) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in composite outcome of emergency department visit, hospitalization, or death (4.1% vs. 7.3%; OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.94) No significant difference in hospitalization or death from any cause (1.2% vs. 2.7%; OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.2 to 1.11) No significant difference in hypoxemia (22.6% vs. 24.3%; OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.22). In the COVID-OUT (metformin) study, the conclusion was: in nonhospitalized adult patients aged 30–85 years with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 within the past 3 days, metformin was not superior to placebo with respect to the composite outcome of hypoxemia, emergency department visit, hospitalization, or death.

### The effect of metformin consumption on mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1172K2YA]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Diabetes is one of the most common comorbidities, and it is associated with poorer outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Preliminary findings showed that mortality was reduced in those who consume metformin compared to those who did not, and given its low cost and widespread availability; metformin is an attractive and potential agent to mitigate excessive risk in diabetic populations.

Methods

Several medical databases (Pubmed, EuropePMC, EBSCOhost, Proquest, Cochrane library) and two health-science preprint servers (preprint.org and Medrxiv) were systematically searched for relevant literature.

Results

Nine studies with 10,233 subjects were included in the qualitative and quantitative synthesis. Meta-analysis showed that metformin is associated with lower mortality in pooled non-adjusted model (OR 0.45 [0.25, 0.81], p = 0.008; I 2: 63.9%, p = 0.026) and pooled adjusted model (OR 0.64 [0.43, 0.97], p = 0.035; I 2: 52.1%, p = 0.064).

Conclusion

The analysis showed that metformin consumption was associated with lower mortality. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm this finding.

1 Introduction

COVID-19 prevails and rages on in several parts of the world. While vaccination drives continue to ensure its spread is limited, newer worrying aspects of long-COVID are a cause for concern. Patients with comorbidities such as cancer, auto-immune diseases, cardiovascular conditions, and diabetes, are still highly susceptible to contracting the disease. The hospitalization rate for patients with comorbidities who contracted COVID-19 was significantly higher during the first wave of the pandemic, associated with poor prognosis. Growing evidence of long-COVID indicates that long-term effects of the illness along with a possibility of latency of SARS-CoV-2 can drastically affect the complete recovery of COVID-19 patients. Evidences of SARS-CoV-2 for prolonged periods have been observed in lung, and intestinal epithelium. The prospect of repurposing drugs to combat prolonged presence of the virus is of utmost importance to manage disease outcomes.

Type 2 diabetes, one of the most common metabolic disorders, is universally treated using insulin and a number of other drugs, chiefly metformin. Metformin is a biguanide compound, used as first-line antidiabetic medication worldwide. It acts primarily by increasing glucose intake and limiting gluconeogenesis in the liver, and its action is mediated in part by the energy-sensing kinase, 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Metformin inhibits Complex I of the electron transport chain and suppresses ATP synthesis, which triggers AMPK activation. This results in a cascade of events that decreases anabolic processes and initiates macromolecular breakdown to reinstate homeostasis. AMPK is a trimeric complex where the α subunit harbors the kinase and activating domains. The regulatory subunit γ is where AMP or ATP binds, thereby determining the allosteric regulation of AMPK. Competitive binding of AMP or ATP to one of four binding domains on the γ subunit is believed to cause a conformational change that makes the kinase domain on the α subunit more accessible for phosphorylation, although this notion has been debated.

### Effect of metformin on the risk of post-coronavirus disease 2019 condition among individuals with overweight or obese: a population-based retrospective cohort study [^114sqFeU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

A subgroup analysis of the COVID-OUT trial's long-term outcome found that starting metformin within 3 days of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis reduced post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) incidence by 63% in overweight or obese individuals. However, its generalizability remains uncertain.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of metformin in preventing PCC in adults with overweight or obesity who had a recent COVID-19 infection.

Design

A retrospective cohort study using a sequential target trial emulation framework.

Data Sources

The United Kingdom primary care data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum database from March 2020 to July 2023.

Participants

Adults with overweight or obesity (body mass index ≥ 25kg/m²) and a record of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were included. Exclusions included metformin use in the prior year or metformin contraindications.

Measurements

The outcome was PCC, defined by a PCC diagnostic code or at least 1 World Health Organization-listed symptoms between 90 and 365 days after diagnosis, with no prior history of the symptom within 180 days before infection. The pooled hazard ratio and risk difference for the incidence of PCC were adjust for baseline characteristics.

Results

Among 624 308 patients, 2976 initiated metformin within 90 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. The 1-year risk difference for PCC in the intention-to-treat analysis was -12.58% (hazard ratio 0.36; 95% CI, 0.32–0.41), with consistent results in subgroup analyses.

Limitations

Findings may not apply to individuals with a normal body mass index.

Conclusions

Early metformin treatment in overweight or obese individuals may reduce PCC risk. Further research is needed to confirm causality and clarify metformin's role in PCC management.

### Practical recommendations for the management of diabetes in patients with COVID-19 [^115YmgYM]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Diabetes is one of the most important comorbidities linked to the severity of all three known human pathogenic coronavirus infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Patients with diabetes have an increased risk of severe complications including Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome and multi-organ failure. Depending on the global region, 20–50% of patients in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had diabetes. Given the importance of the link between COVID-19 and diabetes, we have formed an international panel of experts in the field of diabetes and endocrinology to provide some guidance and practical recommendations for the management of diabetes during the pandemic. We aim to briefly provide insight into potential mechanistic links between the novel coronavirus infection and diabetes, present practical management recommendations, and elaborate on the differential needs of several patient groups.

Comparison with other studies

Our findings suggest that metformin might result in little or no reduction in mortality, which contrasts with results from some observational studies suggesting a substantial reduction in mortality. There are a few possible explanations for the differences found between results from randomised controlled trials and those from observational studies. Patients in observational studies were admitted to hospital and received long term metformin treatment for diabetes, which was not the case for the trials. Therefore, the variation could be attributed to differences in non-severe versus severe disease or dose dependency — prolonged use of metformin might offer greater benefits than short term administration. Alternatively, biases inherent in observational studies could be responsible for the differences. Our own data and meta-analysis of observational studies suggest that metformin does not reduce the incidence of mechanical ventilation. A meta-analysis of two observational studies did not identify a statistically significant association between metformin and intubation. Similar results were reported in a retrospective observational study.

Results for hospital admission were inconsistent among the eligible randomised controlled trials in our systematic review, which failed to find a benefit for metformin in the pooled estimate. The eligible TOGETHER trial did not find any clinical benefit of metformin compared with placebo in ambulatory patients with covid-19; no reduction was reported in the need for retention in an emergency setting or hospital admission because of worsening covid-19. However, the COVID-OUT trial found that metformin resulted in a 58% reduction in hospital admissions over 28 days because of covid-19 (hazard ratio 0.42, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.95). The results from observational studies were inconsistent; however, the pooled estimate from a meta-analysis showed only a borderline significant reduction in hospital admission with metformin (odds ratio 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.00). Similar to the findings from our systematic review, a meta-analysis of four observational studies with 1646 patients did not find any significant difference in hospital stay (mean difference 1.07, 95% CI −0.55 to 2.69).

### Association of metformin with susceptibility to COVID-19 in people with type 2 diabetes [^115BtNLn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Type 2 diabetes has been identified as a predictor of severe COVID-19 and mortality. However, little is currently known about which specific glucose-lowering agents can be used to safely maintain or improve glycemic control amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In our primary care–based study, we found that patients with type 2 diabetes who received a prescription of metformin (plus other glucose-lowering agents) within 90 days of the study start period were not more likely to present to primary care with confirmed or suspected COVID-19-related disease compared with those not taking metformin. There was no significant increase in COVID-19-related mortality or all-cause mortality.

### Metformin treatment was associated with decreased mortality in COVID-19 patients with diabetes in a retrospective analysis [^111YrZiw]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

SARS-CoV-2 can cause exaggerated and aberrant noneffective host immune responses that are associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome. In these critically ill patients infected with COVID-19, the cytokine storms mediated by overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines have been observed in a large population. The exaggerated immune responses lead to long-term lung damage and fibrosis, causing functional disability, reduced quality of life, and even death. For these reasons, host-directed therapies were proposed to be a promising treatment for COVID-19.

The goal of host-directed therapies is to modulate immune mechanisms that relieve exaggerated inflammation to reduce lung tissue damage. Metformin, a most commonly used medication for type 2 diabetes, was proposed to be a candidate for host-directed therapy for COVID-19 to reduce mortality. However, its efficacy remains to be validated.

In this retrospective observational study, we aimed to identify the role of metformin as a host-directed therapy in COVID-19 by comparing the outcome of metformin users and nonusers in these COVID-19 patients with diabetic complications.

Duration of hospital stay

Ventura-López and colleagues reported on the duration of hospital stay, with 20 patients in one randomised controlled trial. The effects of metformin on the duration of hospital stay because of covid-19 remain uncertain (mean difference 1 fewer, 95% CI 6.05 fewer to 4.05 more; very low certainty). The certainty of the evidence was very low because of extremely serious imprecision (table 2 and online supplemental figure S6). Studies did not report any data on time to symptom resolution.

### Diabetes and novel coronavirus infection: implications for treatment [^115CRs1B]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

COVID-19 is a worldwide pandemic which has resulted in an extraordinary number of infections and deaths worldwide. People with diabetes are particularly vulnerable to develop more severe forms of the disease, possibly due to a clustering of risk factors, such as hypertension, ischaemic heart disease and chronic renal disease. Common pathways appear to exist that may explain the susceptibility of this patient population to COVID-19, and some medications commonly used for people with diabetes may interact with these pathways. However, little is known to date on whether these interactions lead to clinical harm or benefit or indeed whether they have any impact at all, although a recent analysis of people with diabetes hospitalised in France with COVID-19 demonstrated no association with the need for mechanical ventilation or death within 7 days with glucose-lowering therapies such as metformin and insulin. Safe trials exploring such medications are welcomed, and we hope these will shed light on this rapidly evolving area in a time of great uncertainty whilst we continue to rapidly learn more about this novel disease.

### COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus: may old anti-diabetic agents become the new philosopher's stone? [^113L46od]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Pioglitazone is another classical antidiabetic agent with pleiotropic anti-inflammatory properties. Interestingly, this agent has proven to be helpful in the management of viral diseases. In a randomised controlled trial, pioglitazone reduced HCV viral load, even in subjects who did not receive specific antiviral treatment. Furthermore, pioglitazone is a drug of choice for non-alcoholic fatty liver. Taken together, this evidence appears to encourage, at least in theory, new therapeutic vistas for pioglitazone in COVID 19 treatment, indicating an option to improve liver injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nonetheless, there is a considerably long way to go before this assumption is substantiated.

In conclusion, it is essential to find an effective therapy for the new pandemic. In this endeavour, it is worth reconsidering the therapeutic potential of older drugs, including metformin and pioglitazone.

### Metformin and time to sustained recovery in adults with COVID-19… [^1126owR9]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Question Does immediate-release metformin shorten symptom duration among outpatient adults with mild to moderate COVID-19 compared with placebo. Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 2991 participants enrolled primarily during the JN-1 subvariant of COVID-19, the median time to sustained recovery was 9 days for metformin and 10 days for placebo. There were no episodes of lactic acidosis and 6 episodes of participant-reported hypoglycemia. Meaning The trial results suggest that there were no differences observed between metformin and placebo in the time to recovery in low-risk outpatient adults with COVID-19, and the safety of metformin was not a limitation in the study population. Importance The effect of metformin on reducing symptom duration among outpatient adults with COVID-19 has not been studied.

Objective To assess metformin compared with placebo for symptom resolution during acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. Design, Setting, and Participants The Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines platform evaluated repurposed medications for mild to moderate COVID-19. Between September 19, 2023, and May 1, 2024, participants 30 years or older with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 2 or more COVID-19 symptoms for 7 days or less were included at 90 US sites. Interventions Participants were randomized to receive metformin or placebo for 14 days. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was time to sustained recovery within 28 days of receiving the study drug. Secondary outcomes included time to clinic visit, emergency department visit, hospitalization, or death. Safety events of interest were hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis.

The median time to sustained recovery was 9 days for metformin and 10 days for placebo. No deaths were reported; 103 participants reported clinic visits, ED visits, or hospitalization: 54 in the metformin group and 49 in the placebo group.

### Evaluation and management of COVID-19-related severity in people with type 2 diabetes [^113ctvw8]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Four types of commonly prescribed medications for people with T2D (two glucose-lowering agents: metformin and insulin, two blood pressure-lowering agents: ACEIs and ARBs) were examined to determine whether their continued use interferes with COVID-19 progression. Corticosteroids, although imposing the risk of elevating blood glucose level, have shown beneficial effects in reducing COVID-19 mortality in the general population. The evaluation of all medications should be interpreted with caution since this study is not a randomly controlled trial. Insulin, when administered individually (ie, no metformin use), despite having an HR of 0.93, did not demonstrate a significant effect. In contrast, consistent with previous studies, metformin individually was associated with significantly lower risk of ICU use by 12%. It can be hypothesized that the beneficial effects of metformin besides glycemic control, such as anti-inflammation and inhibition of viral entry, could help prevent the patients with T2D from becoming critically ill, whereas the stronger glucose-lowering effect of insulin might be more crucial in patients with T2D who are already in a critical condition. It is worth noting that the metformin users potentially have a shorter history of diabetes and less severity in terms of diabetic comorbidities. That being said, the association of medications was adjusted based on their longitudinal HbA1c level and comorbidity conditions. The group with combined use of metformin and insulin displayed the best effect compared with the individual use, suggesting that more intensive glycemic control may further reduce the risk of COVID-19-related severity in people with T2D.

### Association of metformin with susceptibility to COVID-19 in people with type 2 diabetes [^113aFgWD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our findings suggest that prescription of metformin in primary care does not influence susceptibility to COVID-19, COVID-19-related mortality, or all-cause mortality. This is reassuring given that patients with diabetes are more susceptible to mortality with COVID-19, and that metformin is the most commonly prescribed glucose-lowering medication. Optimizing glycemic control should continue to be the best advice for patients with diabetes, especially if rates of COVID-19 rise.

### Randomized trial of metformin, ivermectin, and fluvoxamine for COVID-19 [^115EovSi]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study COVID-OUT (ivermectin) was published by Carolyn T Bramante and colleagues in 2022 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: COVID-19 infection. In the COVID-OUT (ivermectin) study, the trial question was: what is the role of ivermectin in patients with COVID-19 infection? In the COVID-OUT (ivermectin) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the COVID-OUT (ivermectin) study, the population was: 808 patients (442 female, 366 male). The inclusion criteria were nonhospitalized adult patients aged 30–85 years with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 within the past 3 days. The key exclusion criteria were hospitalization for COVID-19 infection or other reasons; symptom onset > 7 days; immunocompromised patient; hepatic impairment; alcohol use disorder; history of severe kidney disease. In the COVID-OUT (ivermectin) study, the interventions were: n = 410 ivermectin (ivermectin alone at a dose of 390–470 mcg/kg/day for 3 days or ivermectin in combination with metformin) n = 398 placebo (matching placebo or metformin alone). In the COVID-OUT (ivermectin) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in composite outcome of hypoxemia, emergency department visit, hospitalization, or death (25.8% vs. 24.6%; aOR 1.05, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.45). In the COVID-OUT (ivermectin) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in composite outcome of emergency department visit, hospitalization, or death (5.7% vs. 4.1%; aOR 1.39, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.69) No significant difference in hospitalization or death (1% vs. 1.3%; aOR 0.73, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.77) No significant difference in hypoxemia (23.6% vs. 22.6%; aOR 1.04, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.46). In the COVID-OUT (ivermectin) study, the conclusion was: in nonhospitalized adult patients aged 30–85 years with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 within the past 3 days, ivermectin was not superior to placebo with respect to the composite outcome of hypoxemia, emergency department visit, hospitalization, or death.

### COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus: may old anti-diabetic agents become the new philosopher's stone? [^1163sa11]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Corona virus infectious disease (COVID-19) is a new pandemic. In subjects with diabetes mellitus, infection may be more frequent and severe. We discuss the potential contribution of two traditional oral antidiabetic agents, metformin and pioglitazone, to the improvement of liver injury in COVID-19. Clearly, further experience is needed to shed light on these hypotheses.

### Mortality and other adverse outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus admitted for COVID-19 in association with glucose-lowering drugs: a nationwide cohort study [^111qCvv5]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

We conducted this study based on the premise that patients with T2DM seem particularly prone to a worse prognosis if infected by SARS-CoV-2, and in response to the fact that there is only controversial, limited evidence on the role of glucose-lowering drugs on clinical adverse outcomes. Our main objective was to examine the association between in-hospital death and each routine at-home glucose-lowering drug both individually and in combination with metformin in patients with T2DM admitted for COVID-19. We also evaluated their association with the composite outcome of need for ICU admission, invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital death as well as on the development of in-hospital complications and a long-time hospital stay.

### Metformin treatment was associated with decreased mortality in COVID-19 patients with diabetes in a retrospective analysis [^111mZdrZ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

It is apparent that diabetes will increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and can worsen the outcome of this new coronavirus disease. Given the many metabolic similarities, including hyperglycemia, higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress, between these two diseases, these facts may help to identify candidate host-directed therapy targets for COVID-19 timely. – Therefore, it would be reasonable to expect that the most frequently prescribed medication for diabetes, metformin, may be a candidate host-directed therapy for COVID-19. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the beneficial effect of metformin in COVID-19 patients with diabetes. The data showed that antidiabetic treatment with metformin appears to be associated with a decreased mortality in COVID-19 patients. And surprisingly, multivariate analysis suggested that application of Chinese traditional medicine may also have a potential benefit in reducing mortality in COVID-19 patients.

There has been accumulation of evidence pertaining to the underlying mechanisms of metformin as a potential agent in host-directed therapy. Metformin has been shown to improve the immune response and reduce inflammation by promoting the formation of M2 macrophages and T-regulatory and CD8 memory T cells. It also reduces the expression of genes encoding cytokines and chemokines associated with inflammation response. Moreover, metformin has been found to be benefit for microbiota composition and consequently reduce inflammation. In addition, metformin use can induce autophagy, which has a role in killing or containing pathogens, controlling inflammation, and activating innate and adaptive immune response in the host. Furthermore, metformin can stimulate adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase activity, then enhance protection against oxidative stress, and change the activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase. These roles suggest that metformin may be beneficial for COVID-19 control.

### Association of metformin with susceptibility to COVID-19 in people with type 2 diabetes [^112KiSbE]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

A novel strain of coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread swiftly across countries and continents and become a global pandemic, crippling health systems and economies. This infection was often found to cause a severe multisystem illness with increased severity particularly in older adults and those with comorbidities, including obesity. As of February 21, 2021, COVID-19 was estimated to have infected over 111 million people and caused more than 2.4 million deaths. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes have been recognized as significant risk factors for adverse outcomes and associated mortality from COVID-19. On the other hand, glucose-lowering medications commonly prescribed in diabetes are also known to have modulatory effects on inflammation. The potential impact of these therapeutic agents on susceptibility to COVID-19 is therefore of significant clinical and public health interest.

A number of retrospective cohort and observational studies have suggested that concomitant use of metformin is associated with beneficial clinical outcome in respiratory diseases including tuberculosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, and asthma. Furthermore, metanalysis suggests pre-admission use of metformin improves septic shock outcomes in patients with diabetes. Metformin has been associated with a reduction in CVD in a subgroup of patients with obesity and is the recommended first-line therapy in type 2 diabetes. There is therefore an urgent need to clarify whether metformin influences susceptibility to COVID-19. Two recent meta-analyses of observational studies have suggested reduced mortality from COVID-19 in patients taking metformin. These studies only included patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19, and they do not address the important public health question of susceptibility in the general population. Just 1 in 5 patients with COVID-19 are admitted to hospital, therefore studies in these settings are not well placed to assess susceptibility in the community. Furthermore, there was limited adjustment for confounders in some of these studies and the source populations in some studies included patients without diabetes. Only 2 papers included any propensity score matching to mitigate the effect of prescription by indication bias. None of the studies considered unobserved confounders.

### Favorable antiviral effect of metformin on SARS-CoV-2 viral load in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of COVID-19 [^112PHvXo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Metformin has antiviral activity against RNA viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The mechanism appears to be suppression of protein translation via targeting the host mechanistic target of rapamycin pathway. In the COVID-OUT randomized trial for outpatient coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), metformin reduced the odds of hospitalizations/death through 28 days by 58%, of emergency department visits/hospitalizations/death through 14 days by 42%, and of long COVID through 10 months by 42%.

Methods

COVID-OUT was a 2 × 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial that assessed metformin, fluvoxamine, and ivermectin; 999 participants self-collected anterior nasal swabs on day 1 (n = 945), day 5 (n = 871), and day 10 (n = 775). Viral load was quantified using reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

Results

The mean SARS-CoV-2 viral load was reduced 3.6-fold with metformin relative to placebo (-0.56 log10 copies/mL; 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.05 to -.06; P = 0.027). Those who received metformin were less likely to have a detectable viral load than placebo at day 5 or day 10 (odds ratio [OR], 0.72; 95% CI, .55 to .94). Viral rebound, defined as a higher viral load at day 10 than day 5, was less frequent with metformin (3.28%) than placebo (5.95%; OR, 0.68; 95% CI, .36 to 1.29). The metformin effect was consistent across subgroups and increased over time. Neither ivermectin nor fluvoxamine showed effect over placebo.

Conclusions

In this randomized, placebo-controlled trial of outpatient treatment of SARS-CoV-2, metformin significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral load, which may explain the clinical benefits in this trial. Metformin is pleiotropic with other actions that are relevant to COVID-19 pathophysiology.

### Repurposing existing drugs for COVID-19: an endocrinology perspective [^114Qqytn]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Metformin, the first-line therapy for T2DM with undisputed efficacy and safety and additional antineoplastic, antiaging, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, cardio-, neuro-, hepato-, and nephroprotective actions, has been proposed as a multi-action protection drug candidate for COVID-19, particularly due to its strong systemic reparatory and modulatory mechanisms. While its effects on RAAS seem to be neutral, lung injury can be efficiently prevented and relieved by metformin, specially by the promotion of microvascular repairing actions, and has also exhibited antiviral activity, enhanced lymphocyte B function and enhanced innate immunity. Conversely, metformin has formal contraindication for severe conditions due to the risk of lactic acidosis. For these reasons, metformin could be a candidate for the second stage of COVID-19, before the development of severe respiratory manifestations, although no specific clinical trials are being currently conducted.

Sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, canagliflozin, ipragliflozin, ertugliflozin) are a newly developed anti-diabetic drug class that promotes glycosuria through inhibition of renal glucose reabsorption, alleviating hyperglycemic states. Unexpected improvements of cardiovascular events, overall mortality, liver metabolic dysfunctions, kidney function, and pancreas activity observed in larger and longer randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and real-life studies were not completely justifiable by its glucose-, body weight-, and blood pressure-lowering effects. Although effects on overall viral replication or lung injury are yet to be unraveled, SGLT2i's have shown active suppression of the overall RAAS due to the negative water balance induced by its concurrent natriuresis, and additional selective mitigation of the angiotensin II-AT1R axis. Among SGLT2i, dapagliflozin has been proposed as a protective tool against COVID-19, particularly in the first and second stages, and is currently undergoing two specific clinical trials.

### Pharmacological management of COVID-19 in type 2 diabetes [^112sXetM]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2021). Medium credibility.

Evidence suggests that diabetes is one the most relevant comorbidity in affecting the prognosis of COVID-19. Albeit there are no specific trials nor subgroup analysis showing the effect of COVID-19 therapies in patients with diabetes, selected features of this disease and the side effects associated with certain drugs require a proper knowledge to optimize the pharmacological therapy of patients with diabetes and COVID-19. While chronic anti-hypertensive and glucose-lowering therapies should not be discontinued nor preferred for preventive purposes, the low-grade pro-inflammatory, the thrombosis-prone status of diabetes, the role of acute hyperglycaemia in promoting adverse outcomes in patients admitted to ICU, and the observed increased mortality in patients with poor long-term glycaemic control delineate a delicate balance in case of severe forms of COVID-19. Here, we briefly summarized some of the key pharmacological issues linked to the management of patients with diabetes and COVID-19, in order to provide indications to minimize the deleterious effects of the concomitant presentation of these diseases and to use the existing pharmacological options in an appropriate manner.

### Outpatient metformin use is associated with reduced severity of COVID-19 disease in adults with overweight or obesity [^115njTrW]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS

In this large comprehensive population of persons with a positive SARS‐CoV‐2 PCR result, persons with outpatient metformin use had nonsignificantly lower odds of hospitalization and significantly lower odds of mortality from COVID‐19 disease. Our data add to the growing observational evidence suggesting reduced severity of COVID‐19 disease in persons with metformin use. Given the biologic plausibility of benefit, metformin should be prospectively assessed for prevention and early outpatient treatment of SARS‐CoV‐2.

### Mortality and other adverse outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus admitted for COVID-19 in association with glucose-lowering drugs: a nationwide cohort study [^115ZpWxx]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study found that the at-home use of metformin, DPP-4i, insulin, metformin plus DPP-4i, metformin plus SGLT-2i, and metformin plus insulin showed no significant association with in-hospital deaths; the composite outcome of need for ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital death; in-hospital complications; or long-time hospital stay in patients with T2DM admitted for COVID-19. Given the large number of patients with T2DM and COVID-19 infection, the ominous relationship between these pathologies, and the limited evidence on the role of glucose-lowering drugs, prospective studies are needed.

### Outpatient metformin use is associated with reduced severity of COVID-19 disease in adults with overweight or obesity [^112t7Wu7]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Observational studies suggest outpatient metformin use is associated with reduced mortality from coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Metformin is known to decrease interleukin-6 and tumor-necrosis factor-α, which appear to contribute to morbidity in COVID-19. We sought to understand whether outpatient metformin use was associated with reduced odds of severe COVID-19 disease in a large US healthcare data set. Retrospective cohort analysis of electronic health record (EHR) data that was pooled across multiple EHR systems from 12 hospitals and 60 primary care clinics in the Midwest between March 4, 2020 and December 4, 2020. Inclusion criteria: data for body mass index (BMI) > 25kg/m 2 and a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test; age ≥ 30 and ≤ 85 years. Exclusion criteria: patient opt-out of research. Metformin is the exposure of interest, and death, admission, and intensive care unit admission are the outcomes of interest. Metformin was associated with a decrease in mortality from COVID-19, OR 0.32 (0.15, 0.66; p = .002), and in the propensity-matched cohorts, OR 0.38 (0.16, 0.91; p = .030). Metformin was associated with a nonsignificant decrease in hospital admission for COVID-19 in the overall cohort, OR 0.78 (0.58–1.04, p = .087). Among the subgroup with a hemoglobin HbA1c available (n = 1193), the adjusted odds of hospitalization (including adjustment for HbA1c) for metformin users was OR 0.75 (0.53–1.06, p = .105). Outpatient metformin use was associated with lower mortality and a trend towards decreased admission for COVID-19. Given metformin's low cost, established safety, and the mounting evidence of reduced severity of COVID-19 disease, metformin should be prospectively assessed for outpatient treatment of COVID-19.

### Metformin: update on mechanisms of action and repurposing potential [^115mHL6z]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Currently, metformin is the first-line medication to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in most guidelines and is used daily by > 200 million patients. Surprisingly, the mechanisms underlying its therapeutic action are complex and are still not fully understood. Early evidence highlighted the liver as the major organ involved in the effect of metformin on reducing blood levels of glucose. However, increasing evidence points towards other sites of action that might also have an important role, including the gastrointestinal tract, the gut microbial communities and the tissue-resident immune cells. At the molecular level, it seems that the mechanisms of action vary depending on the dose of metformin used and duration of treatment. Initial studies have shown that metformin targets hepatic mitochondria; however, the identification of a novel target at low concentrations of metformin at the lysosome surface might reveal a new mechanism of action. Based on the efficacy and safety records in T2DM, attention has been given to the repurposing of metformin as part of adjunct therapy for the treatment of cancer, age-related diseases, inflammatory diseases and COVID-19. In this Review, we highlight the latest advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of action of metformin and discuss potential emerging novel therapeutic uses.

### Investigating the impact of metformin on severity of COVID-19 in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: focusing on laboratory findings [^111uYg9f]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

The current study revealed that metformin may be associated with improved COVID‐19 outcomes in patients with T2DM. Nevertheless, more research with larger sample size is required to prove the protective effect of metformin against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

### Association of glucose-lowering drugs with outcomes in patients with diabetes before hospitalization for COVID-19: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116Xo5Mf]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Our study also found that GLP-1RAs and metformin were associated with a relatively low risk of adverse outcomes. Some researchers have speculated that GLP-1RAs were a candidate for treatment of patients with or without diabetes with COVID-19 owing to their multiple beneficial effects on excessive inflammation-induced acute lung injury. Excessive inflammatory responses, such as cytokine storms and disseminated thromboembolic events, are considered fatal complications of COVID-19 infection. In addition to the expected improvement in blood glucose control or obesity, metformin has also been shown to have antifibrinolytic activities and inhibit inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, some researchers speculated that metformin might play a role in the immune response to COVID-19, which might improve the prognosis.

The result that needs further evaluation is that insulin was associated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes. This finding may be explained because insulin use may reflect more severe diabetes or longer diabetes duration, and these patients are at higher risk for adverse outcomes in the setting of COVID-19 infection. In our study, because only observational studies were available and some baseline indicators were lacking, partial selection bias could not be ruled out. Patients with severe COVID-19 infection, especially those with respiratory distress, need insulin therapy. Insulin should always be the preferred medication in any emergency situation and can be used at any stage of COVID-19.

Limitations

The study still has several limitations. First, although this study included a large number of participants, all of the included studies were observational studies. Therefore, the results of this study should be interpreted as associations. Second, the results of this study may be affected by diabetes comorbidities at baseline, baseline glycemic control, diabetes duration, and diabetes type, which were not assessed in this study. Third, differences in vaccination status, COVID-19 variants, and inpatient protocols may affect outcomes. Fourth, because of the complexity of concomitant diabetes medications, analysis of single drugs was not possible.

### Metformin is associated with higher incidence of acidosis, but not mortality, in individuals with COVID-19 and pre-existing type 2 diabetes [^1136zPse]. Cell Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The safety and efficacy of anti-diabetic drugs are critical for maximizing the beneficial impacts of well-controlled blood glucose on the prognosis of individuals with COVID-19 and pre-existing type 2 diabetes (T2D). Metformin is the most commonly prescribed first-line medication for T2D, but its impact on the outcomes of individuals with COVID-19 and T2D remains to be clarified. Our current retrospective study in a cohort of 1,213 hospitalized individuals with COVID-19 and pre-existing T2D indicated that metformin use was significantly associated with a higher incidence of acidosis, particularly in cases with severe COVID-19, but not with 28-day COVID-19-related mortality. Furthermore, metformin use was significantly associated with reduced heart failure and inflammation. Our findings provide clinical evidence in support of continuing metformin treatment in individuals with COVID-19 and pre-existing T2D, but acidosis and kidney function should be carefully monitored in individuals with severe COVID-19.

### Metformin use is associated with a decrease in the risk of hospitalization and mortality in COVID-19 patients with diabetes: a population-based study in lombardy [^116dRGEX]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Aim

To compare the association of metformin use and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes in a cohort of 31966 patients with diabetes in Lombardy.

Methods

We used a COVID-19 linkable administrative regional database to select patients with diabetes who were aged 40years or older. They had at least two prescriptions of antidiabetic drugs in 2019 and a positive test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 from 15 February 2020 to 15 March 2021. The association of metformin use and clinical outcomes was assessed by multivariable logistic regression analyses and after propensity score matching (PSM). Clinical outcomes were all-cause mortality, in-hospital mortality, hospitalization for COVID-19, and admission to an intensive care unit (ICU).

Results

In multivariable models, metformin use was associated with a significantly lower risk of total mortality (OR 0.70; 95% CI 0.66–0.75), in-hospital mortality (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.63–0.73), hospitalization for COVID-19 (OR 0.86; 95% CI 0.81–0.91), and ICU admission (OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.69–0.94) compared with metformin non-users. Results were similar after PSM; metformin was associated with a significantly lower risk of total mortality (OR 0.79; 95% CI 0.73–0.86), in-hospital mortality (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.67–0.81), and ICU admission (OR 0.77; 95% CI 0.63–0.95).

Conclusions

In this large cohort, metformin use was associated with a protective effect in COVID-19 clinical outcomes, suggesting that it might be a potentially useful drug to prevent severe COVID-19 disease, although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to confirm this. While awaiting the results of RCTs, we suggest continuing prescribing metformin to COVID-19 patients with diabetes.

### Metformin suppresses SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture [^113Gg3om]. Virus Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Comorbidities such as diabetes worsen COVID-19 severity and recovery. Metformin, a first-line medication for type 2 diabetes, has antiviral properties and certain studies have also indicated its prognostic potential in COVID-19. Here, we report that metformin significantly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 growth in cell culture models. First, a steady increase in AMPK phosphorylation was detected as infection progressed, suggesting its important role during viral infection. Activation of AMPK in Calu3 and Caco2 cell lines using metformin revealed that metformin suppresses SARS-CoV-2 infectious titers up to 99%, in both naïve as well as infected cells. IC50 values from dose-variation studies in infected cells were found to be 0.4 and 1.43 mM in Calu3 and Caco2 cells, respectively. Role of AMPK in metformin's antiviral suppression was further confirmed using other pharmacological compounds, AICAR and Compound C. Collectively, our study demonstrates that metformin is effective in limiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture and thus possibly could offer double benefits as diabetic COVID-19 patients by lowering both blood glucose levels and viral load.

### Association of glucose-lowering drugs with outcomes in patients with diabetes before hospitalization for COVID-19: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113qsjtU]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Patients with COVID-19 have a high prevalence of diabetes, and diabetes and blood glucose control are determinants of intensive care unit admission and mortality.

Objective

To evaluate the association between COVID-19-related adverse outcomes and 8 antihyperglycemic drugs in patients with diabetes who were subsequently diagnosed and hospitalized with COVID-19.

Data Sources

Data were retrieved and collected in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov from database inception to September 5, 2022.

Study Selection

For this systematic review and network meta-analysis, randomized clinical trials and observational studies conducted among patients with diabetes while receiving glucose-lowering therapies for at least 14 days before the confirmation of COVID-19 infection were included after blinded review by 2 independent reviewers and consultations of disagreement by a third independent reviewer. Of 1802 studies initially identified, 31 observational studies met the criteria for further analysis.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

This study follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guideline. Bayesian network meta-analyses were performed with random effects.

Main Outcomes and Measures

A composite adverse outcome, including the need for intensive care unit admission, invasive and noninvasive mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital death.

Results

Thirty-one distinct observational studies (3 689 010 patients with diabetes hospitalized for COVID-19) were included. The sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) were associated with relatively lower risks of adverse outcomes compared with insulin (log of odds ratio [logOR], 0.91; 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.57–1.26), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (logOR, 0.61; 95% CrI, 0.28–0.93), secretagogues (logOR, 0.37; 95% CrI, 0.02–0.72), and glucosidase inhibitors (logOR, 0.50; 95% CrI, 0.00–1.01). Based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curves value, SGLT-2is were associated with the lowest probability for adverse outcomes (6%), followed by glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (25%) and metformin (28%). A sensitivity analysis revealed that the study was reliable.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that the use of an SGLT-2i before COVID-19 infection is associated with lower COVID-19-related adverse outcomes. In addition to SGLT-2is, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and metformin were also associated with relatively low risk of adverse outcomes.

### Hospital management of hyperglycemia in the context of COVID-19: evidence-based clinical considerations [^112eU9u8]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

The DARE-19 was the first trial to randomize hospitalized patients with COVID-19 for an oral T2D medication. Dapagliflozin or placebo was given to hospitalized COVID-19 patients with at least one cardiometabolic risk factor, meaning that both patients with and without diabetes were eligible. Despite being well tolerated, dapagliflozin did not reduce the primary composite endpoint of organ dysfunction or death. Only two non-severe events of diabetes ketoacidosis (DKA) were reported in the population that received dapagliflozin, even with rigid surveillance, which is reassuring. Prior to this study, many experts discouraged the use of sodium/glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in patients with severe disease due to the increased risk of DKA. As this new data emerged, continued use of this drug if DKA is monitored is a possibility. Also important is a trend towards better outcomes with dapagliflozin. Given that the total number of primary outcome events was lower than expected, and there was a statistically nonsignificant 20% reduction in the primary outcome in the group receiving dapagliflozin, some experts advocated this study was underpowered. The RECOVERY group announced a larger trial with empagliflozin to further evaluate the hypothesis that SGLT2i can be of benefit in this setting. Importantly, this drug class is contra-indicated in the setting of acute disease in patients with T1D due to the increased risk of DKA.

Before COVID-19, several RCTs demonstrated the efficacy and safety of using GLP-1 RA and DPP4i in specific groups of hospitalized patients. This strategy is an option, but it is important to mention that the discontinuation of alogliptin and saxagliptin is recommended for patients with heart failure.

Metformin treatment prior to COVID-19 diagnosis was independently associated with a significant reduction in mortality in patients with diabetes and COVID-19 (odds ratio: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.13–0.84) in a retrospective assessment. Even tough lactic acidosis is a concern for hospitalized patients taking metformin, especially with acute illnesses, such as COVID-19, continuing this drug may be of benefit for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

In summary, non-insulin hypoglycemic agents are not the first-line treatment for hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients, but these drugs are being successfully used in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. Maintaining treatment with hypoglycemic agents used at home should be considered, especially in patients with moderate, not severe, COVID-19.

Conclusion

In this population-based cohort study of older adults with T2DM taking metformin, use of DPP4i/GLP1RA was not associated with COVID-19 infection but was associated with lower risk of all-cause hospitalization and a possible trend towards lower associated risk of CV events among those testing positive for COVID-19.

### Genetic and phenotypic analysis of the causal relationship between aging and COVID-19 [^115FzrZC]. Communications Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first emerged in late 2019 and has led to an unprecedented global health crisis. Notably, the aging population is particularly at risk of COVID-19, e.g. in Italy, 88% of the individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 were 40 years or older. A recent report based on epidemiological data from multiple countries showed that 69% of infections in people over 70 are symptomatic, whereas this number drops to 21% for 10−19-year-olds. Unsurprisingly, elderly people are also more likely to die from COVID-19, and the case fatality rate for COVID-19 grows exponentially with age. As observational evidence implies a strong link between COVID-19 and age, COVID-19 can be considered a disease of aging, and multiple clinical trials using potential lifespan-extending drugs (e.g. metformin, rapamycin, and senolytics) to protect the elderly from COVID-19 have been proposed –. Although observational data on metformin seems promising, it is unclear if other lifespan-extending drugs should be prioritized in clinical trials since the evidence of any causal link between lifespan and COVID-19 susceptibility is still missing.

### COVID-19 and metabolic disease: mechanisms and clinical management [^115VK8wJ]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

Up to 50% of the people who have died from COVID-19 had metabolic and vascular disorders. Notably, there are many direct links between COVID-19 and the metabolic and endocrine systems. Thus, not only are patients with metabolic dysfunction (eg, obesity, hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and diabetes) at an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 but also infection with SARS-CoV-2 might lead to new-onset diabetes or aggravation of pre-existing metabolic disorders. In this Review, we provide an update on the mechanisms of how metabolic and endocrine disorders might predispose patients to develop severe COVID-19. Additionally, we update the practical recommendations and management of patients with COVID-19 and post-pandemic. Furthermore, we summarise new treatment options for patients with both COVID-19 and diabetes, and highlight current challenges in clinical management.

### Effect of metformin in reducing fatigue in long COVID… [^114Exzy1]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Shortly after the beginning of the COVID-19 global pandemic, reports emerged showing that some individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 developed persistent symptoms and new health problems that arose long after the acute phase of infection and could not be explained by other factors. The patient community who first recognized and reported this new syndrome used the term 'long COVID' to describe the post-acute and chronic sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. As reported by the two systematic reviews of the total COVID-19 cases of neonates, children, and adolescents aged less than 19 years since the start of the pandemic, the persistent clinical features spectrum of long COVID is wide with fatigue having the second highest percentage of persistent long COVID symptoms within this age group. Long COVID symptoms can last for years, particularly in cases for chronic fatigue syndrome/dysautonomia which can be lifelong.

Metformin has been proposed in this study as a potential avenue for the management of chronic fatigue that is associated with long COVID. It has clinical benefits when used as an outpatient treatment for COVID-19 and is globally available, has a low-cost, and is safe. A study that was conducted recently had reported that its use in patients infected with COVID could reduce the incidence of long COVID. However, since this study had only focused on older individuals who were already infected with COVID, a pilot trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of metformin in younger individuals with long COVID is warranted.
- New or worsening symptoms since acute COVID-19 illness that have persisted for a duration of at least 90 days but less than 365 days
- Not currently hospitalized or requiring hospitalization
- Patients with childbearing potential or with partners of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate methods of contraception during the trial and through 90 days of follow-up.
- Able to complete the questionnaires
- Reports moderate to severe fatigue, defined as a score of 75 or lower on the PedsQL-MFS
- Fatigue symptoms have been present for at least 90 days since time of COVID-19 infection
- Fatigue symptoms are not attributable to another cause.
- Taking medications with known side effect of chronic fatigue
- Contraindications to metformin
- Patients with a history of seizures may participate if they have not occurred in the last 60 days and are stable, under pharmacological control
- Any condition that would make the patient, in the opinion of the investigator, unsuitable for the trial.

### Metformin and risk of mortality in patients hospitalised with COVID-19: a retrospective cohort analysis [^1159Dnsb]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2021). High credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes and obesity, as states of chronic inflammation, are risk factors for severe COVID-19. Metformin has cytokine-reducing and sex-specific immunomodulatory effects. Our aim was to identify whether metformin reduced COVID-19-related mortality and whether sex-specific interactions exist.

Methods

In this retrospective cohort analysis, we assessed de-identified claims data from UnitedHealth Group (UHG)'s Clinical Discovery Claims Database. Patient data were eligible for inclusion if they were aged 18 years or older; had type 2 diabetes or obesity (defined based on claims); at least 6 months of continuous enrolment in 2019; and admission to hospital for COVID-19 confirmed by PCR, manual chart review by UHG, or reported from the hospital to UHG. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality from COVID-19. The independent variable of interest was home metformin use, defined as more than 90 days of claims during the year before admission to hospital. Covariates were comorbidities, medications, demographics, and state. Heterogeneity of effect was assessed by sex. For the Cox proportional hazards, censoring was done on the basis of claims made after admission to hospital up to June 7, 2020, with a best outcome approach. Propensity-matched mixed-effects logistic regression was done, stratified by metformin use.

Findings

6256 of the 15380 individuals with pharmacy claims data from Jan 1 to June 7, 2020 were eligible for inclusion. 3302 (52.8%) of 6256 were women. Metformin use was not associated with significantly decreased mortality in the overall sample of men and women by either Cox proportional hazards stratified model (hazard ratio [HR] 0.887 [95% CI 0.782–1.008]) or propensity matching (odds ratio [OR] 0.912 [95% CI 0.777–1.071], p = 0.15). Metformin was associated with decreased mortality in women by Cox proportional hazards (HR 0.785, 95% CI 0.650–0.951) and propensity matching (OR 0.759, 95% CI 0.601–0.960, p = 0.021). There was no significant reduction in mortality among men (HR 0.957, 95% CI 0.82–1.14; p = 0.689 by Cox proportional hazards).

Interpretation

Metformin was significantly associated with reduced mortality in women with obesity or type 2 diabetes who were admitted to hospital for COVID-19. Prospective studies are needed to understand mechanism and causality. If findings are reproducible, metformin could be widely distributed for prevention of COVID-19 mortality, because it is safe and inexpensive.

### Metformin treatment was associated with decreased mortality in COVID-19 patients with diabetes in a retrospective analysis [^111EgCFk]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract.

Metformin was proposed to be a candidate for host-directed therapy for COVID-19. However, its efficacy remains to be validated. In this study, we compared the outcome of metformin users and nonusers in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with diabetes. Hospitalized diabetic patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the Tongji Hospital of Wuhan, China, from January 27, 2020 to March 24, 2020, were grouped into metformin and no-metformin groups according to the diabetic medications used. The demographics, characteristics, laboratory parameters, treatments, and clinical outcome in these patients were retrospectively assessed. A total of 283 patients (104 in the metformin and 179 in the no-metformin group) were included in this study. There were no significant differences between the two groups in gender, age, underlying diseases, clinical severity, and oxygen-support category at admission. The fasting blood glucose level of the metformin group was higher than that of the no-metformin group at admission and was under effective control in both groups after admission. Other laboratory parameters at admission and treatments after admission were not different between the two groups. The length of hospital stay did not differ between the two groups (21.0 days for metformin versus 19.5 days for no metformin, P = 0.74). However, in-hospital mortality was significantly lower in the metformin group (3/104 (2.9%) versus 22/179 (12.3%), P = 0.01). Antidiabetic treatment with metformin was associated with decreased mortality compared with diabetics not receiving metformin. This retrospective analysis suggests that metformin may offer benefits in patients with COVID-19 and that further study is indicated.

### Outcome and death risk of diabetes patients with COVID-19 receiving pre-hospital and in-hospital metformin therapies [^111cGv9R]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a member of the Betacoronavirus genus of the Nidovirales order, its single stranded positive polarity RNA encodes non-structural and structural proteins, one important structural protein is the Spike, which mediates recognition of the ACE2 cell receptor. The non-structural proteins play pivotal role in cell regulation, that impacts host response to viral infection. Data from the World Health Organization (WHO) points to over 178 million confirmed cases and 3,864,180 deaths until June, 21st 2021. Deaths by COVID-19 in Brazil has reached the number of 501,825 on June, 21st 2021.

Diabetes is one of the main risk factors for COVID-19, promoting a harmful pro-inflammatory state. Hyperglycemia has been reported in 51% of the COVID-19 patients and is concurrent with increase in inflammatory mediators and aberrant glycosylation of ACE2 receptor, which may favor SARS-Cov-2 infection. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention indicated an overall case fatality rate (CFR) of 2.3%, while CFR was elevated to 7.3% for diabetes patients. Prevalence of diabetes in COVID-19 patients ranges from 5 to 20% in different studies. Diabetes is also associated with high risk of severe to critical illness of 14 to 32% of the COVID-19 patients.

Several drugs have been analyzed for drug repurposing for COVID-19 treatment. Metformin is commonly used to treat diabetes patients. In the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic some hospital protocols recommended discontinuation of metformin for COVID-19 patients. It was suggested that metformin could induce lactic acidosis and therefore should be discontinued. Even tough metformin had a positive correlation with acidosis and lactic acidosis, it showed no significant difference in mortality. Only one preliminary report indicated an increased risk for life-threatening complications due to metformin use. Afterwards it had been suggested for the FDA to change metformin on-label use as adjuvant therapy against COVID-19 in obese, elderly and diabetes patients. Different reports indicated a positive correlation of survival with use of metformin prior to admission, or during hospitalization, while others have not observed any correlation with time of hospitalization, severity or death by COVID-19 patients that used metformin in admission.

### Non-insulin anti-diabetic agents in patients with type 2 diabetes and COVID-19: a critical appraisal of literature [^116PDkPj]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Several observational studies have recently reported the outcomes of non-insulin anti-diabetic agents (ADA) in patients with T2DM and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We sought to review the literature to appraise the clinicians on these outcomes.

Methods

A literature search using the specific keywords was carried out in the database of PubMed, MedRxiv and Google Scholar up till December 11, 2020 applying Boolean method. Full text of all the relevant articles that reported the outcomes of ADA in patients with T2DM and COVID-19 were retrieved. Subsequently, an appraisal of literature report was narratively presented.

Results

Available studies that reported the outcomes of ADA are either case series or retrospective cohorts or prospective observational studies, in absence of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Results from these observational studies suggest that amongst all the non-insulin ADA, metformin users prior to the hospitalization had improved outcomes compared to the non-users. Data for dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) are encouraging although inconsistent. No documentation of any harm or benefit has been observed for sulfonylureas (SUs), sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) and glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs). No data is yet available for pioglitazone.

Conclusion

Metformin and DPP-4i should be continued in patients with T2DM until hospitalization or unless contraindicated. No evidence of harm suggests that SUs, SGLT-2i or GLP-1RAs may not be stopped unless very sick, hospitalized or contraindicated. The results from RCTs are needed to claim any meaningful benefit with either metformin or DPP-4i in patients with T2DM and COVID-19.

### Hospitalization and mortality in patients with COVID-19 with or at risk of type 2 diabetes: data from five health systems in Pennsylvania and Maryland [^112L1msJ]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Patients with type 2 diabetes using insulin had significantly higher odds of adverse events, which was expected, as insulin use is an indicator of an advanced stage of diabetes. This finding was consistent with other large studies. For instance, among 64 892 veterans with diabetes and COVID-19, insulin use was associated with higher odds of hospitalization and risk of death. A meta-analysis of 33 studies reported an OR of 1.70 (95% CI 1.33 to 2.19) as comparing patients on insulin to non-users. Because the coronavirus replicates faster in a high glucose environment and glucose fluctuations make it more challenging to treat COVID-19, patients with uncontrolled diabetes may experience more severe COVID-19 outcomes. This suggests that providers treating patients with COVID-19 with diabetes should remain vigilant, and patients with diabetes on insulin may require further attention regarding COVID-19 prevention and management.

Our study also suggested that metformin use was associated with a protective effect; patients with diabetes on metformin had ~40% lower odds of severe COVID-19 outcomes than those not taking metformin, after adjusting for HbA1c levels. Some previous studies noted similar reduced risks in patients on metformin. In a nationwide observational cohort study in England, metformin use was associated with 23% reduced mortality in people with type 2 diabetes. A meta-analysis reported a pooled OR of 0.54 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.62) for metformin use and mortality. Several potential mechanisms might explain the protective effect of metformin, either by reducing the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection or by decreasing COVID-19 severity. Metformin reduces blood glucose levels; worse glucose control has been associated with higher mortality and end-organ complications in patients with COVID-19. Metformin could decrease endothelial injury, an important factor and therapeutic target in mitigating COVID-19 complications. Metformin also inhibits neutrophil extracellular trap release, alleviating the development of downstream lung injury. Metformin could also decrease the viral cycle, with efficacy against Middle East respiratory syndrome and COVID-19. While we do not have data regarding medication dosage or combination therapies to support the causal relationship between metformin and less severe COVID-19 outcomes, further research on these mechanisms may contribute to the prevention of COVID-19 and other viral infections.

### Diabetes, obesity, and insulin resistance in COVID-19: molecular interrelationship and therapeutic implications [^114V4TYL]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

The treatment of obese and/or diabetic patients with COVID-19 deserves special considerations, based on recent clinical experience associated with better understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms. For mild COVID-19 the oral glucose-lowering therapies for patients with diabetes could be maintained. In contrast, for inpatients with diabetes and severe COVID-19 the initial indications were to withdrawing ongoing treatments and initiating insulin therapy. It is important to mention that this decision is not a consensus anymore and should be based on the same considerations undertaken for inpatients with diabetes, including severity of associated diseases, nutritional status, glycemic control, and risk of hypoglycemia, hepatic, cardiac, and renal function.

In most studies, DM2 patients with COVID-19 on insulin have shown a worse prognostic, usually attributed to the severity of diabetes in these patients. However, as previously described in experimental models intracerebroventricular-injected insulin increases airway reactivity, lung resistance, and elastance. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that hyperinsulinemia in obesity and diabetes can impair airway reactivity, and that administration of high doses of insulin can worsen this effect, but by lowering the doses of insulin, by association with oral anti-hyperglycemic agents, it is possible to attenuate this potential worse effect of high doses of insulin.

A recent study has shown better clinical outcomes in patients on metformin compared with those on insulin, but again we should consider that the use of insulin may just indicate that the diabetes was more severe and should be interpreted as a potential confounder. Preliminary retrospective data have shown a reduction in death rates in DM2 with COVID-19 hospitalized patients using metformin compared with non-users. Although definitive conclusions can be obtained only by RCTs, based on previous data we can suggest that there is no reason to stop metformin therapy during COVID-19 infection unless there are severe gastrointestinal symptoms, or risk of lactic acidosis. The mechanism by which metformin may protect patients with DM2 and COVID-19 has been attributed at least in part to the effect of the drug that might prevent virus entry into target cells via AMPK activation and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Additionally, metformin also has anti-inflammatory effects that might prevent the cytokine storm.

### Investigating the impact of metformin on severity of COVID-19 in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: focusing on laboratory findings [^1178tVYU]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Given these facts, while diabetes is an independent risk factor for mortality from COVID‐19, it seems that mentioned risk is significantly reduced in people taking metformin, improving the possibility that metformin may play a protective role in this high‐risk population. On the other hand, laboratory tests are used to evaluate the improvement process in COVID‐19 patients. Thus, in the current study, common biochemical factors were compared in T2DM patients (metformin consumer and a group using agents other than metformin), and non‐diabetic COVID‐19 patients. The results of the present study may display the importance of laboratory tests in COVID‐19 patients' follow‐up and shed light on the effect of metformin in controlling infection outcomes in diabetic people.

### Investigating the impact of metformin on severity of COVID-19 in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: focusing on laboratory findings [^114BuKVU]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

In the terrifying pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, diabetic patients exhibiting more severe outcomes and mortality rate is high among them. Based on recent studies, metformin as the most prescribed drug for T2DM treatment may improve severe outcomes in diabetic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, abnormal laboratory findings can help to differentiate between the severe and non-severe form of COVID-19. According to the mentioned issues, the effect of metformin on severity of COVID-19 was examined in T2DM patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods

The study included 187 individuals diagnosed with COVID-19, 104 patients were diabetic and divided into two groups according to their anti-diabetic drugs: patients who were treated only with metformin and patients who were treated with other anti-diabetic drugs. The other participants were non-diabetic and diagnosed with COVID-19. Biochemical parameters were measured by routine laboratory methods before, during and after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Results

During infection, FBS, creatinine, ALT, AST, Ferritin and LDH were significantly lower in metformin users than non-users (p-value: .02, .01, .03, .04, .0009 and .01, respectively). Also, after recovery, there were statistically significant differences between metformin users and non-users with respect to most of the study parameters, except FBS, BUN and ALP (p-value: .51, .28 and .35, respectively).

Conclusion

Our result suggested that metformin might be associated with better outcomes in diabetic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

### Clinical trials of COVID-19 therapies should account for diabetes and hyperglycemia [^117Fzkf2]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2021). Medium credibility.

Complications of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) occur with increased frequency in people admitted to the hospital with diabetes or hyperglycemia. The increased risk for COVID-19 infections in the presence of these metabolic conditions is in part due to overlapping pathophysiologic features of COVID-19, diabetes, and glucose control. Various antiviral treatments are being tested in COVID-19 patients. We believe that in these trials, it will be useful to evaluate treatment effect differences in patients stratified according to whether they have diabetes or hyperglycemia. In this way, it will be possible to better facilitate development of antiviral treatments that are most specifically beneficial for the large subset of COVID-19 patients who have diabetes or hyperglycemia.

It has been suggested that metformin use should be interrupted by COVID-19 patients, one of the main concerns was that it could cause acidosis and lactic acidosis, one report indicated that indeed patients with COVID-19 that used metformin showed an increase in acidosis and lactic acidosis (HR of 2.45 and 4.66, respectively), however, use of metformin showed no significant difference in mortality and in fact only showed significant statistical difference in reducing heart failure (HR = 0.61) and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) (HR = 0.66). So far only one preliminary report from China with a small number of subjects indicated an increase in life-threatening complications for metformin users, but with no comparison with time of hospitalization or lethality. Comparison of metformin (n = 29,558) and non-metformin (10,271) users infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed that metformin is safe for COVID-19 patients.

### Use of novel antidiabetic agents in patients with type 2 diabetes and COVID-19: a critical review [^116RVH9B]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

The previously mentioned multicentre observational study encompassing very old patients with T2DM and COVID-19 in Spain revealed no association between preadmission use of GLP-1RAs and in-hospital mortality. Additionally, in a UK multicentre retrospective cohort study there was no association between usage of different antidiabetic medications (including GLP-1RAs, DPP4i, insulin, metformin, sulfonylurea and SGLT2i) and the risk of death and/or ICU admission within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. Finally, in an Italian retrospective observational study, only metformin usage was associated with lower case fatality, while there was no association between usage of various antidiabetic medications (GLP-1RAs, DPP4i, metformin, pioglitazone, insulin, sulfonylurea/glinides and SGLT2i) and the risk of either COVID-19 or case fatality.

A recently published meta-analysis analysed the impact of preadmission use of GLP-1RAs on mortality outcomes of COVID-19 among patients with DM. Very interestingly, the authors concluded that preadmission usage of GLP-1RAs was associated with reduction in mortality rate in patients with DM and COVID-19 independently of age, gender, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and the use of metformin and insulin. Further studies investigating the role of GLP-1RAs in COVID-19 are already planned or undergoing [e.g. NCT04615871]. Although lots of hope has been invested in the beneficial role of GLP-1RAs among patients with T2DM and COVID-19, considering the well-established and favourable metabolic and cardiorenal properties, their initiation and maintenance in critically ill patients were not fully recommended, since they require slow dose uptitration, need time to become effective and are often associated with transient gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea and vomiting. Yet, GLP-1RAs seem to represent appropriate treatment for non-critically ill patients with T2DM, and a molecular mechanism by which GLP1-RAs seem to interact with SARS-CoV-2 activity has been recently discussed; in addition, GLP1-RAs are able to reduce inflammatory cytokines, which have a critical role in both diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, therefore reducing the cytokine storm produced by SARS-CoV-2.

### Association of metformin with susceptibility to COVID-19 in people with type 2 diabetes [^1138oXz3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Diabetes has emerged as an important risk factor for mortality from COVID-19. Metformin, the most commonly prescribed glucose-lowering agent, has been proposed to influence susceptibility to and outcomes of COVID-19 via multiple mechanisms. We investigated whether, in patients with diabetes, metformin is associated with susceptibility to COVID-19 and its outcomes.

Research Design and Methods

We performed a propensity score-matched cohort study with active comparators using a large UK primary care dataset. Adults with type 2 diabetes patients and a current prescription for metformin and other glucose-lowering agents (MF+) were compared to those with a current prescription for glucose-lowering agents that did not include metformin (MF-). Outcomes were confirmed COVID-19, suspected/confirmed COVID-19, and associated mortality. A negative control outcome analysis (back pain) was also performed.

Results

There were 29 558 and 10 271 patients in the MF+ and MF- groups, respectively, who met the inclusion criteria. In the propensity score-matched analysis, the adjusted hazard ratios for suspected/confirmed COVID-19, confirmed COVID-19, and COVID-19-related mortality were 0.85 (95% CI 0.67, 1.08), 0.80 (95% CI 0.49, 1.30), and 0.87 (95% CI 0.34, 2.20) respectively. The negative outcome control analysis did not suggest unobserved confounding.

Conclusion

Current prescription of metformin was not associated with the risk of COVID-19 or COVID-19-related mortality. It is safe to continue prescribing metformin to improve glycemic control in patients with.

### COVID-19: impact of and on diabetes [^111T79mD]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors have significant cardiovascular and renal benefits in people with type 2 diabetes but are associated with a small but increased risk of ketoacidosis. There are to date only anecdotal reports of ketoacidosis in patients with SARS-CoV-2 taking SGLT2 inhibitors, but they should be suspended in any acute medical admission, vomiting or dehydration. Metformin should also be used with caution in unwell patients. Interestingly metformin has been proposed to have immunomodulatory actions. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) receptor agonists also exert anti-inflammatory actions and may even attenuate pulmonary inflammation. Although the short-term safety of GLP1 agonists has been demonstrated in critically unwell patients there is still insufficient experience to make recommendations around their use in patients with SARS-CoV-2.

With perhaps the exception of SGLT2 inhibitors, most patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms and normal oral intake can continue their usual anti-hyperglycaemic medications. Review of glucose-lowering medications should be carefully considered given the possible implications of increased glycaemic variability. Insulin has been used most extensively in the management of hyperglycaemia in critically ill patients. Insulin also exerts anti-inflammatory actions.

Challenges in fluid replacement in DKA due to concerns over acute respiratory distress syndrome and with the availability of infusion pumps for intravenous insulin administration have also been reported. Here subcutaneous insulin regimes may prove helpful in the management of hyperglycaemia where tissue perfusion has not been compromised.

Analysis of capillary blood glucose tests in patients with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to a medical centre in Wuhan suggested suboptimal adherence to current best practice for the management of hyperglycaemia. This is perhaps not surprising given the pressure on healthcare systems, and the increased exposure of healthcare staff associated with frequent capillary blood glucose monitoring and adjustment of insulin infusions, but emerging evidence suggests that good glycaemic control is associated with improved outcomes in patients hospitalised with SARS-CoV-2. Automated closed-loop insulin-delivery systems have been proven safe and effective in non-critical care environments. The feasibility of fully automated closed-loop glucose control has also been studied in critical illness and may be an option. The finding that patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 often developed acute hyperglycaemia following hospitalisation suggests that an opportunity exists for more interventional glycaemic management.

### Use of novel antidiabetic agents in patients with type 2 diabetes and COVID-19: a critical review [^115TTJ3q]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The latter is a pandemic that has the potential of developing into a severe illness manifesting as systemic inflammatory response syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ involvement and shock. In addition, advanced age and male sex and certain underlying health conditions, like type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), predispose to a higher risk of greater COVID-19 severity and mortality. This calls for an urgent identification of antidiabetic agents associated with more favourable COVID-19 outcomes among patients with T2DM, as well as recognition of their potential underlying mechanisms. It is crucial that individuals with T2DM be kept under very stringent glycaemic control in order to avoid developing various cardiovascular, renal and metabolic complications associated with more severe forms of COVID-19 that lead to increased mortality. The use of novel antidiabetic agents dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4i), sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) in subjects with T2DM may have beneficial effects on COVID-19 outcomes. However, relevant studies either show inconsistent results (DPP4i) or are still too few (SGLT2i and GLP-1RAs). Further research is therefore needed to assess the impact of these agents on COVID-19 outcomes.

### Evaluation of glycemic traits in susceptibility to COVID-19 risk: a mendelian randomization study [^117MHASa]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

One of the motivating reasons for this study is that a previous Mendelian randomization study suggested a possible role of type 2 diabetes in increased risk of COVID-19. However, that study only used ACE2 expression in the lung as a surrogate outcome, and may not necessarily translate to an effect on the actual outcome, i.e. SARS-CoV-2 infection. This difference has been demonstrated by the debates related to ACE inhibitors where concerns were raised over its use given the possibility of increasing ACE2 expression although subsequent evidence suggests that ACE inhibitors do not appear to increase the risk of COVID-19.

Previous observational studies suggested a possible link of diabetes in infection risk due to possible impairment on the immune system, and hence may be relevant to COVID-19 susceptibility and its severity. However, the discrepancies between these findings and our study may be indicative of confounding by obesity, or perhaps by medications such as metformin use which were potentially related to lower mortality among those who were admitted to hospital due to COVID-19. This would warrant further investigations such as using relevant genetic instruments for these medications to assess their impact on COVID-19 severity.

### Use of novel antidiabetic agents in patients with type 2 diabetes and COVID-19: a critical review [^117N11BY]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Appropriate treatment of people with T2DM and COVID-19 is a top priority considering the unfavourable outcomes in this vulnerable population. In this regard, the use of novel antidiabetic agents has generated considerable interest. However, studies conducted thus far either show inconsistent results (DPP4i) or are sparse in number (SGLT2i and GLP-1RAs) (Table 1). Potential mechanisms of beneficial effects of novel antidiabetic agents on COVID-19 outcome are shown in Fig. 1. Interestingly, recent meta-analysis performed to clarify effects of antidiabetic agents on COVID-19 in patients with DM showed that metformin use was associated with lower mortality and poor composite outcomes. Sulfonylurea/glinides use was associated with lower mortality, while there was no significant association for DPP4i, SGLT2i and GLP-1RAs.

Potential mechanisms of beneficial effects of novel antidiabetic agents on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality among patients with T2DM

On top of that, a nationwide observational cohort study from England, analysing 13,479 COVID-19 related deaths in patients with T2DM, showed that adjusted hazard ratios associated with different antidiabetic drugs were 0.75 for meglitinides, 0.77 for metformin, 0.82 for SGLT2i, 0.94 for thiazolidinediones, 0.94 for sulfonylureas, 0.94 for GLP-1RAs, 1.07 for DPP4i, 1.26 for α-glucosidase inhibitors and 1.42 for insulin. This data suggests that some of the traditional antidiabetic drugs, such as metformin, might have beneficial effects on COVID-19 outcomes among patients with T2DM, although there are also totally opposite data.

### Metformin use in diabetes prior to hospitalization: effects on mortality in COVID-19 [^111y7Fgo]. Endocrine Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Although type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been reported as a risk factor for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the effect of pharmacologic agents used to treat T2DM, such as metformin, on COVID-19 outcomes remains unclear. Metformin increases the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2, a known receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Data from people with T2DM hospitalized for COVID-19 were used to test the hypothesis that metformin use is associated with improved survival in this population.

Methods

Retrospective analyses were performed on de-identified clinical data from a major hospital in Wuhan, China, that included patients with T2DM hospitalized for COVID-19 during the recent epidemic. One hundred and thirty-one patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and T2DM were used in this study. The primary outcome was mortality. Demographic, clinical characteristics, laboratory data, diabetes medications, and respiratory therapy data were also included in the analysis.

Results

Of these 131 patients, 37 used metformin with or without other antidiabetes medications. Among the 37 metformin-taking patients, 35 (94.6%) survived and 2 (5.4%) did not survive. The mortality rates in the metformin-taking group versus the non-metformin group were 5.4% (2/37) versus 22.3% (21/94). Using multivariate analysis, metformin was found to be an independent predictor of survival in this cohort (P = 0.02).

Conclusion

This study reveals a significant association between metformin use and survival in people with T2DM diagnosed with COVID-19. These clinical data are consistent with potential benefits of the use of metformin for COVID-19 patients with T2DM.

Relationship to Other Studies

There are currently no comparable studies in the published or preprint literature investigating the association between therapeutic prescription of metformin and primary care consultation for symptomatic COVID-19. Several observational studies have examined the association between mortality from COVID-19 and taking metformin in more severely affected hospitalized patients and have suggested a reduction in risk. Our findings in primary care are in line with those reported by Bramante et al from a propensity score–matched observational study of mortality in over 6000 US patients hospitalized with COVID-19, which found that metformin had no effect on in-hospital mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes or obesity. However, Bramante et al found lower in-hospital mortality with COVID-19 in women taking metformin (OR 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60–0.96), while there was no significant reduction in mortality for men. In our study, we found susceptibility to COVID-19 was statistically significant lower (adjusted HR 0.68; 95% CI, 0.48–0.96) in women taking metformin, compared with those taking other glucose-lowering agents. The results of previous relevant studies and our study on the association between metformin use and COVID-19-related mortality have been shown in Fig. 3.

Figure 3.
Forest plots showing the results of previous similar studies on the association between metformin use and COVID-19-related mortality.

The pathobiology of any interaction between COVID-19 and metformin is incompletely understood but may be affected by factors that impact the ability of the virus to enter host cells, the ability of the host to clear the virus through disease resistance mechanisms, and host ability to withstand a deterioration in organ function through disease tolerance mechanisms. Firstly, metformin may prevent or reduce the SARS-CoV-2 virus from entering cells. It may decrease potentially harmful levels of proinflammatory cytokines which drive hyperinflammation through macrophage M1 to M2 class switching. Furthermore, metformin has been shown to potentially inhibit checkpoint inhibitor upregulation which may be important to avoid T-cell anergy and promote clearance of SARS-CoV-2. However, the AMPK-mediated immunomodulatory effects of metformin via the antiviral interferon pathway have also been noted to impair antibody responses following vaccination in people with diabetes so that the net effect of metformin in terms of propensity to develop or die from COVID-19 is neutral, as we have found.

### Mortality and other adverse outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus admitted for COVID-19 in association with glucose-lowering drugs: a nationwide cohort study [^112smUnV]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Two observational studies have specifically evaluated the role of metformin and DPP-4i in patients admitted for COVID-19. The study focused on metformin, conducted by Bramante et al. in the USA, found no significant reduction in in-hospital mortality in the overall sample, which is in line with our results. However, when a subgroup analysis was performed, women with obesity and T2DM who used metformin were observed to have a significantly lower mortality rate. Metformin has been proposed to reduce levels of IL-10, IL-6, and TNFα — important mediators in macrophage activation and cytokine release; improves neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio; stabilizes mast cells; decreases thrombosis; and improves endothelial function, thus reducing the adverse impacts of mortality and complication in patients with COVID-19. In the study of Rhee et al. from Korea, protective effects against severe/lethal cases were shown in patients with T2DM who used DPP-4i in monotherapy or in combination with renin-angiotensin system blockers after adjusting for age, gender, comorbidity, and medications. It is known that DPP-4i have anti-fibrotic activity and modulate inflammation and that these properties could be helpful in reducing the progression towards a hyperinflammatory state associated with severe COVID-19. All these major inflammatory mechanisms observed in some COVID-19 patients suggest that the endothelium could be a key target organ in COVID-19 infection. The role of renin-angiotensin system blockers in hypertensive patients with COVID-19 has also been widely discussed. Although hypertension has been associated with a higher risk of mortality, recent studies have shown that previous treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers did not alter the outcomes in hypertensive patients. In our study, no significant associations with adverse clinical outcomes were found among users of DPP-4i and users of the other glucose-lowering drugs. This difference could be explained by the different methodology used in our study, which includes an important adjustment using a propensity score matching in order to compare the two groups of glucose-lowering drugs, as well as the differences in the baseline characteristics, with older patients and higher comorbidity found in our study compared with Rhee et al.'s study (mean age of 74.9 ± 8.4 vs 63.7 ± 12.2 years old).

### Potentially modifiable factors to reduce severity of COVID-19 in type 2 diabetes [^115n9ZmR]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

At least three key factors that distinguish individuals with obesity and T2D from individuals without such conditions are, greater circulating levels of glucose, inflammatory cytokines, and the use of anti-diabetic drugs. These factors are linked with ACE2 expression or activity, which may in turn, influence the severity of CoV-2 infection. High blood glucose alone can increase the expression and enzymatic activity of ACE2 in cells –. Inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ, or interleukin-6, are increased in T2D. It is unclear if these cytokines facilitate CoV-2 entry or oppose it, as they have been reported to increaseor decrease ACE2 expression. In addition, the increased risk of COVID-19 for people with T2D may in part, be iatrogenic. Some anti-diabetic drugs such as those from groups, including PPARγ agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP1 receptor agonists upregulate ACE2 expression in rodent model or cells, whereas some do not (metformin, insulin)or have not yet been tested for their effect on ACE2. The drugs that upregulate ACE2 expression may inadvertently facilitate CoV-2 infection in humans, leading to an increase in disease severity and consequential mortality. Some reports suggest the use of PPAR-γ agonist agents, such as pioglitazone in COVID-19 patients to reduce pulmonary fibrosis and inflammation. Although, the anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties of PPAR-γ agonists are attractive, their role in ACE2-mediated entry of CoV-2 needs further examination. Based on the current information, we postulate that in T2D, the role of these three factors should be studied for their individual and/or collective effect on ACE-2 expression, binding of CoV-2 to the receptor, and COVID-19 severity.

### The impact of diabetes and obesity on the severity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^113Rp9vw]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

In terms of pharmacotherapy, metformin is the recommended drug. It can be used in patients with asymptomatic or mild symptoms of COVID-19. However, it poses a risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients with severe coronavirus disease. Acarbose is an inhibitor of α-glucosidase in the jejunal epithelium. It has been evaluated as monotherapy and in combination with metformin. In both cases, it resulted in a higher survival rate in patients with COVID-19. Clinical trials of the combination of pamapimod and pioglitazone, which initially revealed antiviral potential by inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication, were stopped due to a small impact on clinical outcomes. An isolated effect of pioglitazone on reducing IL-3 levels in patients has been documented without affecting other inflammatory markers compared to placebo. However, patients from the study group were more often admitted to the ICU. The use of sulfonylureas is not recommended because they can cause hypoglycemia. The adverse effects of GLP-1 agonists include nausea and vomiting. This can result in dehydration and aspiration pneumonia. For this reason, they should not be used in patients with severe COVID-19. However, in the study conducted by Benjamin M. Scirica et al. a reduced mortality due to infectious causes was observed in the group treated with Semaglutide during the Pandemic. Due to the low risk of hypoglycemia and amelioration of the course of infection, it is possible to continue treatment with DPP-4 inhibitors. Therapy with SGLT-2 inhibitors may also have positive effects. They are believed to have strong antiviral effects and reduce the level of IL-6 accompanying infection. The method of choice in the treatment of hospitalized patients is intravenous insulin administration. This approach allows for precise glycemia control and has additional anti-inflammatory effects. The issue of vaccines is controversial. Li H et al. conducted a cross-sectional study in China, which included mainly patients with diabetes (87.7%). They noted that 6% of people after both the first and second dose of the vaccine reported adverse events. The most common were fatigue, muscle pain, and insomnia. These results translated into the number of people vaccinated with subsequent doses: 16.2% received two doses, 65.2% - three. The final results did not show any serious complications. Another study raises a different issue, namely the quality of the immune response in patients with T2DM. Yuan S et al. noted that such people developed a weaker immune system reactivity in response to SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccines. This was associated with lower production of specific IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and, consequently, with poorer prevention of COVID-19 infection. Another issue of adverse effects is the occurrence of de novo diabetes in previously healthy patients. There are also cases of activation of diabetes from prediabetes or transformation of T2DM into T1DM. Almost all patients with such side effects were effectively treated with insulin, ultimately achieving optimal glycemic control. Most studies refer to post-vaccination complications and negative attitudes of people with diabetes, but positive effects of vaccination, improved outcomes, and easier survival of COVID-19 have been proven. Guoxi Cai et al. demonstrated a beneficial effect of vaccination in particularly vulnerable individuals, including obese patients. Full vaccination was associated with a lower risk of hospitalization and severe disease. Abdominal obesity, a risk factor in COVID-19 infection, was associated with a higher amount of IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients after the COVID-19 disease and after vaccination. However, they had lower avidity. The study included 5 vaccines: AZD1222, Convidecia, BNT162b2, Sputnik V, and CoronaVac. Abdominal obesity has not been shown to affect the reactivity of these vaccines. Another study showed a similar risk of disease after vaccination in obese and non-obese patients. Vaccination resulted in comparable immunogenicity. The effect of vaccination in a group of people with normal body weight, overweight and obesity was examined in the context of sleep disorders and the chance of developing long COVID. In people with obesity, the chance of developing long COVID was increased compared to the other groups. The authors linked this to dysfunctions such as insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea and the role of sleep on the functioning of the immune system. The impact of obesity on vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is not fully understood. The results differ between authors. However, as obesity is one of the factors of severe COVID, vaccination is recommended in this group of people.

### Outpatient metformin use is associated with reduced severity of COVID-19 disease in adults with overweight or obesity [^116tpdx4]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

We evaluated the odds of severe outcomes from COVID‐19 in those with outpatient metformin use at the time of infection compared to those who did not use metformin using data from a large comprehensive US healthcare database. We found an association between outpatient metformin use and decreased odds of mortality, and nonsignificant associations with hospital admission and ICU admission. Our findings are consistent with previous observational studies. If these findings are replicated in a prospective study, the implications could be significant given metformin's well‐established safety profile, low cost, and worldwide availability.

Metformin has a known history of beneficial immune‐modulatory effects, pre‐COVID‐19, including IL‐6 and TNF‐α, neutrophil extracellular traps, and improved T cell immunity. Outpatient metformin has been associated with lower IL‐6 in persons with COVID‐19. These anti‐inflammatory effects of metformin may explain its association with reduced severity of COVID‐19.

Other possible ways in which metformin could improve outcomes in COVID‐19 beyond glucose control and immune modulation could potentially include antiviral actions. Metformin reduced viral replication of Zika in vitro, another RNA virus, but was not prospectively assessed against Zika. In COVID‐19, inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), may be important for reducing viral lifecycle through the Orf9c and Nsp7 proteins. Metformin has been shown to inhibit mTOR, including inhibition of HCV‐infected cells and suppressed HCV replication via mTOR. In a study of 200 patients with H3N2 influenza, metformin was associated with reduced incidence of influenza (5% vs. 24%, p < .001). As observational studies are not conclusive, retrospective trials should assess metformin for early outpatient treatment and prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, and assess possible anti‐viral and anti‐inflammatory affects in the setting of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

### Possible involvement of adipose tissue in patients with older age, obesity, and diabetes with SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) via GRP78 (BIP / HSPA5): significance of hyperinsulinemia management in COVID-19 [^114EhQX4]. Diabetes (2021). Medium credibility.

Aging, obesity, and diabetes are major risk factors for the severe progression and outcome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), but the underlying mechanism is not yet fully understood. In this study, we found that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein physically interacts with cell surface GRP78, which promotes the binding to and accumulation in ACE2-expressing cells. GRP78 was highly expressed in adipose tissue and increased in humans and mice with older age, obesity, and diabetes. The overexpression of GRP78 was attributed to hyperinsulinemia in adipocytes, which was in part mediated by the stress-responsive transcription factor XBP-1s. Management of hyperinsulinemia by pharmacological approaches, including metformin, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, or β3-adrenergic receptor agonist, decreased GRP78 gene expression in adipose tissue. Environmental interventions, including exercise, calorie restriction, fasting, or cold exposure, reduced the gene expression of GRP78 in adipose tissue. This study provides scientific evidence for the role of GRP78 as a binding partner of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2, which might be related to the severe progression and outcome of COVID-19 in patients with older age, obesity, and diabetes. The management of hyperinsulinemia and the related GRP78 expression could be a therapeutic or preventative target.

### Preadmission metformin use is associated with reduced mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus hospitalized with COVID-19 [^111dRTro]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Observational studies have reported an association between metformin and improved outcomes in COVID-19, but most have been small and with significant limitations.

Objective

To evaluate the association between preadmission metformin exposure and mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection.

Design

Retrospective cohort analysis using electronic health records extracted from the American Heart Association COVID-19 Registry.

Participants

Adults (n = 11,993) with diabetes mellitus but without chronic kidney disease (CKD) or need for hemodialysis who were hospitalized with COVID-19 between January 25, 2020, and February 9, 2022.

Main Measures

We used propensity score modeling to address differences between metformin and non-metformin users prior to multivariable log-binomial models to examine the association between metformin use at time of hospital admission for COVID-19 infection and in-hospital death; composite of in-hospital death or discharge to hospice; composite of in-hospital death, discharge to hospice, or ICU admission; and composite of in-hospital death, discharge to hospice, ICU admission, or mechanical ventilation.

Key Results

Compared to metformin non-use, pre-admission metformin use was associated with lower risk of in-hospital death (risk ratio (RR) 0.81 [95% CI 0.75–0.90]); composite of in-hospital death or discharge to hospice (RR 0.79 [95% CI 0.74–0.87]); composite of in-hospital death, discharge to hospice, or ICU admission (RR 0.90 [95% CI 0.86–0.95]); and composite of in-hospital death, discharge to hospice, ICU admission, or mechanical ventilation (RR 0.9 [95% CI 0.84–0.98]). Metformin use was also associated with lower risk of death due to respiratory cause (RR 0.86 [95% CI 0.74–0.97]) but not cardiovascular (RR 0.84 [95% CI 0.58–1.2]) or other (RR 0.78 [95% CI 0.60–1.0]) causes.

Conclusions

Pre-admission metformin use was associated with lower risk of in-hospital mortality and markers of disease severity among adults with diabetes mellitus without CKD and not requiring hemodialysis who were hospitalized with COVID-19 infection.
