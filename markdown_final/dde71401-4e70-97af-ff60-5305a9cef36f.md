## Question

A 38-year-old woman with a 2-year history of diabetic gastroparesis presents to clinic complaining of persistent nausea, early satiety, and intermittent vomiting despite dietary modifications and glycemic control. She has tried erythromycin in the past but discontinued it due to side effects. Her physical examination is unremarkable, and laboratory studies are within normal limits. She asks about further options to help manage her symptoms.

Based on current ACG guidelines, which pharmacologic agents could be considered next for the management of her refractory gastroparesis symptoms, and what is the role of antiemetic agents in her care?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which pharmacologic agents should be considered next for a 38-year-old woman with diabetic gastroparesis who has persistent nausea, early satiety, and intermittent vomiting despite dietary modifications and glycemic control, and who previously discontinued erythromycin due to side effects. They also want to understand the role of antiemetic agents in her care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and whether she meets criteria for refractory gastroparesis. Then, I should verify that reversible contributors, especially medication-induced delays, have been addressed. Next, I will review first-line pharmacologic options and why erythromycin failed. After that, I need to consider second-line prokinetics and their evidence and risks. Then, I should examine antiemetic strategies and their limitations. Finally, I will integrate a practical, guideline-concordant plan with monitoring and escalation pathways, including procedural options if medical therapy fails.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework and whether she qualifies as refractory. Refractory gastroparesis is generally defined by persistent cardinal symptoms with objective delayed gastric emptying despite at least two appropriate medical therapies, including a prokinetic and an antiemetic, and with no better explanation for symptoms; I should double-check that her gastric emptying was documented with a 4-hour scintigraphy or equivalent, because shorter tests can miss disease and misclassify patients, and I should confirm that mechanical obstruction has been excluded with upper endoscopy or appropriate imaging [^114e89ru] [^113o95wf] [^112cPj6d] [^115nKT9e].

> Wait, let me verify that we have addressed reversible contributors before labeling her refractory. I need to check for medications that delay gastric emptying, especially opioids, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and pramlintide, and ensure they have been discontinued if present; I should also confirm that glycemic control is optimized because hyperglycemia itself impairs gastric emptying and blunts prokinetic efficacy, and I should consider coexisting conditions that can mimic or worsen symptoms, such as functional dyspepsia, rumination, or cyclic vomiting, which are common overlaps in gastroparesis cohorts [^112yZQ8G] [^11571cZg] [^116mJbJo] [^112RD4So].

> Next, I should review first-line pharmacologic therapy and why erythromycin failed. Metoclopramide is the only FDA-approved medication for gastroparesis and is recommended as first-line; however, it carries a boxed warning for tardive dyskinesia and should be limited to less than 12 weeks and used at the lowest effective dose with informed consent, so I need to ensure we have not prematurely abandoned it or used it inadequately before moving on [^116LBzaw] [^113F6LiD]. Erythromycin, a motilin agonist, is effective acutely but often limited by tachyphylaxis and gastrointestinal side effects; its failure here is not surprising and does not preclude other options, so I should not overinterpret this as class failure [^115Sixjh].

> Hold on, I should verify second-line prokinetic options and their regulatory status. Domperidone, a peripherally acting dopamine D2 antagonist, is suggested by ACG for symptom management where available, but in the U.S. it requires an FDA Investigational New Drug application and electrocardiographic screening for QT prolongation; randomized data show symptom benefit and a favorable CNS side-effect profile compared with metoclopramide, though cardiac risk must be mitigated [^116LBzaw] [^113nChBs] [^114ynaKp]. Prucalopride, a 5-HT4 agonist, can improve gastric emptying but has limited symptom data in gastroparesis and is not recommended as first-line; it may be considered in selected patients, particularly with concomitant constipation, with caution regarding mood-related adverse effects and reduced responsiveness in diabetic etiologies [^116LBzaw] [^111h5Hp7].

> I need to ensure I am precise about antiemetics and their role. Antiemetics do not improve gastric emptying but are essential for symptom control; ACG suggests using antiemetics such as 5-HT3 antagonists, H1 antagonists, and dopamine D2 antagonists as needed, and I should tailor to the predominant symptom and patient risk profile, reassessing efficacy and tolerability at 4–8 weeks to decide continuation or adjustment [^113nChBs] [^11416Ark] [^116JyUGM]. But wait, what if nausea is severe and refractory to standard agents? In that scenario, I should consider that aprepitant showed mixed results in a randomized trial and is not a routine recommendation, so I should reserve it for select cases after shared decision-making and careful monitoring for adverse effects [^116GDvxx].

> Let me consider the practical, stepwise plan for this patient. First, I should confirm the diagnosis with a 4-hour gastric emptying study if not already done and exclude obstruction; second, I should review and stop any motility-slowing drugs and optimize glycemic control; third, I should initiate or retry metoclopramide 10 mg 30 minutes before meals and at bedtime with explicit counseling on risks and a plan to limit duration; fourth, if metoclopramide is ineffective or not tolerated, I should pursue domperidone via the FDA pathway with ECG screening and dose conservatism; fifth, I should layer antiemetics targeting nausea and vomiting, choosing among ondansetron, promethazine, or prochlorperazine based on comorbidities and sedation risk, and reassess in 4–8 weeks [^112cPj6d] [^116LBzaw] [^113nChBs] [^116JyUGM].

> I should double-check escalation pathways if medical therapy continues to fail. If she meets criteria for refractory disease after appropriate trials of a prokinetic and antiemetic, multidisciplinary evaluation is recommended, with consideration of procedural options such as G-POEM, gastric electrical stimulation, or pyloric interventions; G-POEM shows promise in open-label studies but should be reserved for select patients after shared decision-making given limited randomized data, and GES may benefit a subset with diabetic gastroparesis though evidence is largely open-label and heterogeneous [^114e89ru] [^113pmd9i] [^112QKPCB] [^112oxQTw].

> Hold on, I should verify that we are not missing nutritional deterioration. I need to assess weight trajectory and dietary adequacy; if there is unintentional weight loss of 10% or more over 3–6 months or repeated hospitalizations for refractory symptoms, enteral nutrition should be considered, preferably via a jejunostomy after a trial of nasoenteric feeding, while avoiding parenteral nutrition unless absolutely necessary due to infection and thrombosis risks [^111Jmf2w] [^112noApC].

> In summary, I should confirm the diagnosis rigorously, eliminate reversible causes, and then prioritize metoclopramide as first-line with domperidone as the next prokinetic if needed, while using antiemetics purely for symptom control and reassessing in 4–8 weeks; if refractory, move to multidisciplinary care and consider G-POEM or GES in appropriately selected patients, ensuring shared decision-making throughout [^116LBzaw] [^114e89ru] [^113uFeAo].

For refractory diabetic gastroparesis with persistent nausea, early satiety, and vomiting despite diet and glycemic control, and after erythromycin intolerance, **metoclopramide is first-line** [^116LBzaw] for prokinesis and symptom control, with a 12-week limit and close monitoring for tardive dyskinesia [^113F6LiD]. If metoclopramide is ineffective or not tolerated, **domperidone is a reasonable second-line** [^114BhCjA] via FDA expanded access, with ECG screening for QT risk [^113nChBs]. Antiemetics (ondansetron, prochlorperazine, promethazine) are used as needed for nausea/vomiting [^113uFeAo], but they do not improve gastric emptying [^11416Ark]. If symptoms persist after these trials, consider G-POEM [^113pmd9i] or gastric electrical stimulation [^112QKPCB] in specialized centers [^115qP6dv].

## Pharmacologic options for refractory diabetic gastroparesis

### Prokinetic agents

Prokinetics are the cornerstone for improving gastric emptying and symptoms; however, **options are limited and evidence is modest**.

| **Medication** | **Mechanism of action** | **Evidence and recommendations** | **Limitations and considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Metoclopramide | Dopamine D2 antagonist; 5-HT4 agonist | - First-line [^116LBzaw] <br/> - Improves gastric emptying and symptoms [^116LBzaw] <br/> - Limit to 12 weeks; risk of tardive dyskinesia [^113F6LiD] | - Black box warning <br/> - Monitor for extrapyramidal effects [^113F6LiD] |
| Domperidone | Peripheral D2 antagonist | - Second-line [^notfound] <br/> - Improves symptoms and gastric emptying [^115TkzRq] <br/> - Available via FDA expanded access | - ECG for QT risk <br/> - Limited US access [^113nChBs] |
| Prucalopride | 5-HT4 agonist | - Conditional use [^116LBzaw] <br/> - Improves gastric emptying [^116LBzaw] <br/> - Less robust symptom data | - Not first-line [^1129CfmE] <br/> - Monitor for psychiatric effects [^111h5Hp7] |

---

### Antiemetic agents

Antiemetics relieve nausea and vomiting but **do not improve gastric emptying** [^113uFeAo]; they are used adjunctively for symptom control [^11416Ark].

- **5-HT3 antagonists**: ondansetron, granisetron — effective for nausea/vomiting [^116JyUGM].
- **Dopamine D2 antagonists**: prochlorperazine — useful for nausea/vomiting [^116JyUGM].
- **H1 antagonists**: promethazine — option for nausea/vomiting [^116JyUGM].

---

## Non-pharmacologic interventions for refractory cases

If pharmacologic therapy fails, **procedural options may be considered**:

- **Gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM)**: suggested for select refractory cases; improves symptoms and gastric emptying in open-label studies [^113pmd9i] [^111Z92eS].
- **Gastric electrical stimulation (GES)**: consider for refractory symptoms, particularly in diabetic gastroparesis; improves symptoms and quality of life in selected patients [^112QKPCB] [^112oxQTw].
- **Intrapyloric botulinum toxin injection**: not recommended due to lack of efficacy in RCTs [^113pmd9i] [^114mPHmg].

---

## Clinical recommendations and monitoring

- **Metoclopramide**: start 10 mg 30 minutes before meals and at bedtime; reassess at 4–8 weeks [^116JyUGM]; limit to 12 weeks [^113F6LiD].
- **Domperidone**: 10 mg three times daily, titrate to 20 mg four times daily if needed; obtain ECG and monitor for QT prolongation [^113nChBs].
- **Antiemetics**: use as needed for nausea/vomiting; monitor for sedation and extrapyramidal effects [^116JyUGM].
- **Multidisciplinary care**: involve gastroenterology, endocrinology, and dietetics; consider nutritional support if weight loss or malnutrition develops [^114e89ru] [^112noApC].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Step** | **Intervention** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Metoclopramide | First-line prokinetic; improves gastric emptying and symptoms [^116LBzaw] |
| 2 | Domperidone | Second-line if metoclopramide fails or not tolerated [^114BhCjA] |
| 3 | Antiemetics | Adjunctive control of nausea/vomiting [^113uFeAo] |
| 4 | G-POEM or GES | For refractory cases after medical therapy [^113pmd9i] [^112QKPCB] |

---

Metoclopramide remains **first-line** for refractory diabetic gastroparesis, with domperidone as a second-line option via expanded access; antiemetics are adjuncts for symptom control. If symptoms persist, consider G-POEM or GES in specialized centers [^116LBzaw] [^113pmd9i] [^112QKPCB].

AGA gastroparesis — general considerations for refractory management emphasize that a patient is considered to have gastroparesis refractory to medical therapy if they have cardinal symptoms of gastroparesis (ie, nausea, vomiting, postprandial fullness, and/or early satiety) as the predominant symptoms in addition to evidence of delayed gastric emptying with no alternative explanation for the symptoms, and have failed at least 2 medical treatments including prokinetic and antiemetic agents. In patients with gastroparesis refractory to medical therapy, it is important to ascertain the accuracy of the diagnosis and to evaluate for coexisting conditions that may be causing or contributing to the severity of the predominant symptoms. Management requires a multidisciplinary approach that optimally involves the primary care provider, a gastroenterologist, and a registered dietitian, in addition to an endocrinologist in patients with diabetes, and in select cases an interventional endoscopist and a foregut surgeon. It is also important to evaluate nutritional status and provide nutritional support, preferably orally as tolerated or, if necessary, using enteral nutrition; parenteral nutrition is rarely used as it carries risk of serious complications like infections and blood clots.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^116JyUGM]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guideline on Management of Gastroparesis — General considerations for implementing treatment recommendations: It is important to optimize glycemic control in individuals with gastroparesis in the setting of diabetes mellitus. It is important to review the patient's current medications to eliminate medications that may alter GI tract motility; medications that can delay gastric emptying include opiate pain medications and the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. One should also be cognizant of potential drug-drug interactions when considering pharmacologic interventions. It is important to consider potential coexisting conditions that may contribute to symptoms when treating individuals with gastroparesis. The Guideline Panel Content Experts use dietary interventions with small-particle and low-fat, low-residue diets before initiation of pharmacologic interventions or as a concomitant intervention. Patients with gastroparesis may need to use antiemetics as needed, including selective serotonin receptor (5HT3) antagonists (eg, ondansetron and granisetron), histamine H1 antagonists (eg, promethazine), and/or dopamine D2 antagonists (eg, prochlorperazine). In clinical practice, the Guideline Panel Content Experts assess the efficacy and tolerance of pharmacologic interventions at 4–8 weeks to decide whether the treatment should be continued or adjusted. The recommendations in this document are based on a comparison with no intervention.

Gastroparesis is characterized by symptoms suggesting retention of food in the stomach with objective evidence of delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction in the gastric outflow. This condition is increasingly encountered in clinical practice. These guidelines summarize perspectives on the risk factors, diagnosis, and management of gastroparesis in adults (including dietary, pharmacological, device, and interventions directed at the pylorus), and they represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology. The scientific evidence for these guidelines was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process. When the evidence was not appropriate for Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation, we used expert consensus to develop key concept statements. These guidelines should be considered as preferred but are not the only approaches to these conditions.

### Clinical guideline: management of gastroparesis [^115Sixjh]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

This guideline presents recommendations for the evaluation and management of patients with gastroparesis. Gastroparesis is identified in clinical practice through the recognition of the clinical symptoms and documentation of delayed gastric emptying. Symptoms from gastroparesis include nausea, vomiting, early satiety, postprandial fullness, bloating, and upper abdominal pain. Management of gastroparesis should include assessment and correction of nutritional state, relief of symptoms, improvement of gastric emptying and, in diabetics, glycemic control. Patient nutritional state should be managed by oral dietary modifications. If oral intake is not adequate, then enteral nutrition via jejunostomy tube needs to be considered. Parenteral nutrition is rarely required when hydration and nutritional state cannot be maintained. Medical treatment entails use of prokinetic and antiemetic therapies. Current approved treatment options, including metoclopramide and gastric electrical stimulation (GES, approved on a humanitarian device exemption), do not adequately address clinical need. Antiemetics have not been specifically tested in gastroparesis, but they may relieve nausea and vomiting. Other medications aimed at symptom relief include unapproved medications or off-label indications, and include domperidone, erythromycin (primarily over a short term), and centrally acting antidepressants used as symptom modulators. GES may relieve symptoms, including weekly vomiting frequency, and the need for nutritional supplementation, based on open-label studies. Second-line approaches include venting gastrostomy or feeding jejunostomy; intrapyloric botulinum toxin injection was not effective in randomized controlled trials. Most of these treatments are based on open-label treatment trials and small numbers. Partial gastrectomy and pyloroplasty should be used rarely, only in carefully selected patients. Attention should be given to the development of new effective therapies for symptomatic control.

Meta-analyses assessing effectiveness of gastric electrical stimulation (GES) for gastroparesis (GP) — Diabetics with severe symptoms may benefit from therapy, and an SRMA of 13 studies (12 lacked controls and 1 blinded and randomized) reported after GES improvements in TSS score (3/13 studies), vomiting severity (4/13), nausea severity (4/13), SF-36 physically composite score (4/13), SF-36 mental composite score (2/13), requirement for enteral or parenteral nutrition (8/13), and A- and H-RE (5/13). Another SRMA of 5 randomized trials and 16 open-label studies found TSS scores did not differ between periods with or without GES in randomized trials, whereas open-label studies showed a significant decrease in TSS scores; meta-regression showed baseline TSS differences impacted treatment ratings and argues against the use of GES outside of strict clinical trials as a viable treatment option. Additional SRMAs (21 studies; 10 studies) stated GES seems to offer significant improvement in symptom control in a subset of patients and is an effective modality for treating GP refractory to less invasive treatment.

### Gastroparesis: symptoms, evaluation, and treatment [^113QLoTF]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis presents with gastrointestinal symptoms and nongastrointestinal manifestations in association with objective delays in gastric emptying. The condition may complicate several systemic disorders or may be idiopathic in nature. The diagnosis is made by directed evaluation to exclude organic diseases, which can mimic the clinical presentation of gastroparesis coupled with quantification of gastric emptying. Current therapies rely on dietary modifications, medications to stimulate gastric evacuation, and agents to reduce vomiting. Endoscopic and surgical options are increasingly used for cases refractory to medication treatment.

Other Therapies

Intrapyloric Botulinum Injection

Pylorospasm is thought to contribute to the development of DGP. Botulinum toxin, a potent inhibitor of neuromuscular transmission, has been reported to improve emptying and symptoms for several months in DGp and idiopathic gastroparesis in several open label studies.

However, several double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials, while showing some improvement in gastric emptying demonstrated no alleviation or improvement of symptoms. Positive trials are needed before botulin toxin can be recommended for the management of pylorospasm in gastroparesis, and the 2013 ACG recommendations on gastroparesis strongly advises against using botox for the treatment this condition.

Pyloroplasty

Pyloroplasty can be done either surgically or endoscopically; the latter is known as G-POEM (gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy). Renewed interest in the role of the pylorus in delayed gastric emptying has resulted in a number of ways to open the pyloric sphincter, including surgical and endoscopic approaches. While the analogy of the pyloric sphincter for the stomach to the lower esophageal sphincter for the esophagus is attractive, there have been very few controlled studies in this area, and there are currently no published guidelines for pyloric therapy.

Gastric Electrical Stimulation

For a subset of patients with severe, refractory gastroparesis that is unresponsive to medical therapy, gastric electric stimulation (GES) may be an option. GES improves nausea, vomiting, quality of life and nutritional status in patients with refractory DGp.

Three principal methods of GES have been described: gastric electrical pacing, high-frequency GES and sequential neural electrical stimulation. Based on the number of stimulation electrodes, GES can be classified into single-channel GES and multichannel GES. Gastric pacing by high-energy, low-frequency GES (long pulses) attempts to restore the regular slow wave rhythm of 3 cycles/min of normal gastric myoelectric activity and has been found to improve symptoms and gastric emptying. Only high-frequency GES is approved by the U.S. FDA, and this therapy was recommended for certain drug-refractory patients, particularly those with DGp, in the 2013 ACG review. A randomized trial of temporary endoscopic GES has shown the effectiveness of this strategy; it may be useful as a screening method.

### Management of the patient with gastroparesis [^116EcTn3]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis may be related to a variety of underlying disorders, but management options are fairly universal. Dietary measures and pharmacologic agents, primarily in the form of prokinetic medications, form the foundation of standard management. Some patients will have refractory symptoms and alternative dosing schemes or drug combinations may be used. An occasional patient will still require venting gastrostomy and/or jejunal feeding. This review addresses the standard dietary and pharmacologic approaches to gastroparesis, as well as issues pertaining to gastrostomy/jejunostomy tubes and to surgical options for refractory cases. Finally, experimental agents and techniques, such as gastric pacing, will be discussed.

Gastroparesis can be classified into the following categories: grade 1 (easily controlled symptoms, ability to maintain weight on regular or slightly adjusted diet); grade 2 is compensated gastroparesis (moderate symptoms, partial control by medication, ability to maintain nutritional status with dietary adjustments, and occasional hospital admissions). Grade 3 is decompensated gastroparesis (refractory symptoms, nutritional status cannot be maintained via oral intake, and frequent hospital admissions 2, 12).

Due to an incomplete understanding of gastroparesis and limited therapeutic options, symptom management is challenging. Nutritional interventions are often necessary. Initial treatment generally consists of dietary interventions (eg, intake of small and frequent meals) and restoring glycemic control in diabetic patients. 13, 14 Dietary advices are often combined with use of prokinetic agents such as dopaminergic‐2‐antagonists (eg, domperidone, metoclopramide), motilin‐analogues (eg, erythromycin), or serotonin 4 (5‐HT 4)‐agonists (eg, prucalopride). However, lack of robust evidence for their effectiveness in addition to potential serious side effects (QT‐prolongation) or tachyphylaxis limit the chances for a therapeutic benefit. 15, 16, 17 With regard to nutritional support, consensus has been reached that nasoduodenal tube feeding should be considered in case patients have significant weight loss (5%‐10% in, respectively, 3‐6 months), are unable to achieve their target weight, or when repeated hospital admissions for malnutrition or dehydration are necessary. 3, 18, 19

### Idiopathic gastroparesis [^115FZQx7]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis is a chronic symptomatic disorder of the stomach characterized by delayed emptying without evidence of mechanical obstruction. Idiopathic gastroparesis refers to gastroparesis of unknown cause not from diabetes; not from prior gastric surgery; not related to other endocrine, neurologic, rheumatologic causes of gastroparesis; and not related to medications that can delay gastric emptying. There is overlap in the symptoms of idiopathic gastroparesis and functional dyspepsia. Patients with idiopathic gastroparesis often have a constellation of symptoms including nausea, vomiting, early satiety, postprandial fullness, and upper abdominal pain. Current treatment options of dietary management, prokinetics agents, antiemetic agents, and symptom modulators do not adequately address clinical need for idiopathic gastroparesis.

Background & Aims

Gastroparesis is a complex gastric motility disorder characterized by nausea, vomiting, and other symptoms associated with a delay in gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Variations in diagnostic testing and limited effective treatments make caring for this patient population challenging. The American Gastroenterological Association developed this guideline to provide recommendations for ensuring an accurate diagnosis and identifying evidence-based, effective treatments among the available pharmacologic and procedural interventions for patients with idiopathic gastroparesis or gastroparesis related to diabetes.

Methods

The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework was used to assess evidence and develop this guideline. The Guideline Panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes, conducted an evidence review, and used the Evidence to Decision Framework to develop recommendations.

Results

The Guideline Panel agreed on 12 recommendations. A conditional recommendation was issued against using 2-hour gastric emptying testing and in favor of 4-hour testing in patients with suspected gastroparesis. There are conditional recommendations for the use of metoclopramide and erythromycin in patients with gastroparesis. Conditional recommendations were issued against the use of domperidone, prucalopride, aprepitant, nortriptyline, buspirone, and cannabidiol as first-line therapies. In addition, conditional recommendations were issued against the routine initial use of gastric per-oral endoscopic pyloromyotomy or gastric electrical stimulation in patients with gastroparesis, reserving these treatments for select patients with symptoms refractory to medical therapies. No recommendation was given regarding the use of surgical pyloromyotomy and surgical pyloroplasty, which were identified as procedures with knowledge gaps in their use for treatment for gastroparesis.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of gastroparesis requires the use of 4-hour gastric emptying tests. Metoclopramide or erythromycin is appropriate for initial pharmacologic treatment. Other treatment recommendations require shared patient-physician decision making. There are still considerable unmet needs in the treatment of gastroparesis.

Purpose Of Review

Gastroparesis is a common disorder that produces symptoms of gastric retention in the absence of physical obstruction. Extensive research into the clinical features, pathophysiology, diagnostic evaluation, and therapy of gastroparesis in the past several years has offered insight into the condition. This review provides updated information on gastroparesis focusing on new findings from the past few years.

Recent Findings

Large database studies have characterized clinical profiles in idiopathic and diabetic gastroparesis and are defining roles of gastric and extragastric factors in symptom genesis. Dietary deficiencies in gastroparesis have been clarified. Histologic study of full thickness gastric tissue in severe gastroparesis shows heterogeneous enteric neuronal, smooth muscle, interstitial cell, and inflammatory abnormalities. Advances in gastric emptying testing include wireless motility capsules and nonradioactive breath tests. The importance of glycemic control in diabetic gastroparesis is a focus of current investigation. Novel therapies include new prokinetics (ghrelin agonists), increased focus on antiemetic agents including antidepressants, and next generation gastric stimulators. Studies are being initiated to delineate the natural history of gastroparesis.

Summary

Much has been learned recently on the causes, clinical presentations, and management of gastroparesis. Current ongoing investigation provides promise for further gains in the years ahead.

Regarding medical management for gastroparesis, more specifically with respect to prokinetics and antiemetics, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend to avoid using prucalopride as a first-line treatment in patients with GP.
Consider offering prucalopride in patients with GP and chronic idiopathic constipation for efficiency of care, given its established efficacy for chronic idiopathic constipation. Recognize that patients with GP due to diabetes or connective tissue diseases may be less responsive to prucalopride compared to those with idiopathic GP. Recognize that prucalopride acts as a prokinetic agent through 5HT4 receptor agonism without direct antiemetic effects. Monitor patients for potential risks of depression and suicidal thoughts when recommending prucalopride.

Gastroparesis diagnostic testing — scintigraphic gastric emptying (SGE) is emphasized as the standard method. After exclusion of mechanical obstruction, diverse tests are available to objectively document the presence of delayed GE. The gold standard is scintigraphic GE (SGE). SGE is the standard test for the evaluation of GP in patients with upper GI symptoms. The suggested method of testing includes appraising the emptying of a solid meal over a duration of 3 hours or greater (strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence). It is customary to recommend cessation for 48 hours before the test of medications.

BACKGROUND 49 50 Gastroparesis is a disorder characterized by delayed gastric emptying in the absence of 51 mechanical obstruction. Symptoms are chronic with episodic exacerbation. In addition, acute 56 hyperglycemia has the potential to slow gastric emptying and decrease the effects of prokinetic 57 drugs. 58 59 The core signs and symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea, vomiting, postprandial fullness, early satiety, and upper 61 abdominal pain. Patients may. 62 experience any combination of signs and symptoms with varying degrees of severity.

Pain is 63 more prevalent in patients with idiopathic gastroparesis than it is in patients with diabetic 64 gastroparesis. Patients with diabetic gastroparesis may experience further derangement of 65 glucose control because of unpredictable gastric emptying and altered absorption of orally. 66 administered hypoglycemic drugs. 67 68 Because the signs and symptoms of gastroparesis overlap with other gastrointestinal conditions, 69 gastroparesis may be incorrectly diagnosed as bowel obstruction, functional dyspepsia, irritable 70 bowel syndrome, or peptic ulcer disease.

Management of Diabetic Gastroparesis

The development of gastroparesis is associated with poor glucose control, and the goal of optimal glycemic control needs to be emphasized. The usual treatments for DGp include nutritional assessment and dietary modifications, glycemic control, prokinetic agents and antiemetic agents, as discussed in the following sections. Although the majority of patients have mild-to-moderate disease that can be managed effectively using these measures, a small percentage of patients have severe DGp that is characterized by inadequate oral intake, malnutrition, weight loss and frequent hospitalizations. Optimal management of these patients presents a difficult challenge for the clinician, although emerging treatment options, such as gastric neurostimulation, offer a glimmer of hope. Patients with DGp often present with gastric comorbidities, including gastroesophageal reflux disease, intestinal dysmotility and fungal and bacterial infections of the GI tract, as well as with macro- and microvascular complications of diabetes. Therefore, effective management of patients with DGP often requires an interdisciplinary approach with the involvement of a team of specialists, including the primary care physician, gastroenterologist, endocrinologist, dietician, psychologist, interventional radiologist and surgeon.

Non-glycemic endocrine issues related to DGp include mineral and vitamin deficiency, low bone mass, hypogonadism and amenorrhea related to undernourishment in severe gastroparesis.

Vitamin and micronutrient deficiencies, such as vitamin D deficiency, may impact gastric emptying and, interestingly, some studies show a paradoxical worsening of gastric emptying with higher B12 levels.

### Symptomatic management of gastroparesis [^1146JLQK]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Gastroparesis is a chronic and debilitating neuromuscular disorder of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms of gastroparesis include nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, early satiety, and weight loss. Treating gastroparesis can be difficult. Dietary changes may improve symptoms in patients with mild disease. A variety of medications can be used to treat symptoms of nausea and vomiting, although most have not been subjected to randomized controlled trials and only one is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (metoclopramide). Pain management is essential, as nearly 90% of patients report symptoms of epigastric pain. This article reviews treatment options for symptoms of gastroparesis.
