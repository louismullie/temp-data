## Question

How frequently should echocardiography be repeated for a small VSD?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how often echocardiography should be repeated for small ventricular septal defects, stratified by anatomy, hemodynamic significance, age, risk, triggers for earlier reassessment, and discharge criteria. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how defect anatomy and size drive natural history. Then, I should verify hemodynamic insignificance versus borderline significance. Next, I will consider age-specific closure probabilities, followed by assigning risk-based echo intervals. After that, I need to define clinical triggers for earlier imaging and when discharge is appropriate, and finally, I should review special populations and long-term adult surveillance, making sure each step aligns with the best available evidence and is internally consistent with observed natural history and guideline principles [^113wsiTQ] [^114SMvim].

> Let me first confirm the key anatomic determinants. Muscular defects close far more frequently than perimembranous in the first year of life, with the Copenhagen Baby Heart Study showing overall spontaneous closure of 83.5% at 1 year and a markedly higher closure rate for muscular versus perimembranous VSDs, strongly influenced by smaller initial size and absence of multiple defects. Practically, "small" is generally under about 3 to 4 mm, with the smallest defects having the highest closure probability, whereas larger defects rarely close spontaneously. Location matters as well: perimembranous and subarterial defects merit closer surveillance because of aortic valve cusp prolapse and regurgitation risk, and I should be mindful that associated lesions also affect follow-up intensity [^116eb34U] [^111UJJ5f] [^113wPujP] [^116uftT8].

> Now, I need to check hemodynamic significance because that determines whether the lesion follows a "small VSD" pathway. For a small, hemodynamically insignificant VSD, I would expect normal pulmonary artery pressures, normal right and left ventricular sizes, and a restrictive shunt with Qp:Qs less than approximately 1.5:1, with no LV volume overload and no valve involvement on echo. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should also systematically assess for associated lesions such as aortic cusp prolapse, tricuspid regurgitation, multiple VSDs, or other congenital heart anomalies, since these findings can reclassify risk and change the imaging cadence [^114SMvim] [^116uftT8].

> Next, I will examine the age context because it governs both likelihood and timing of closure and the window of potential complications. Wait, let me verify the closure kinetics again: most spontaneous closures, especially for muscular defects, occur in the first year, with the bulk by 6 to 12 months in population data, so infancy is the high-yield period for echo reassessment. In contrast, for children with persistent tiny defects beyond early childhood and for adults, the emphasis shifts toward long-term morbidities such as infective endocarditis, arrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, and late aortic regurgitation, which become more clinically salient after the third to fourth decades even when the residual shunt is small or closed surgically, so longitudinal surveillance strategy must reflect that latent risk horizon [^116eb34U] [^116jCRZi] [^113DKCrb].

> For the low-risk pathway, I should confirm criteria: an isolated muscular VSD under roughly 3 mm, hemodynamically insignificant, and without associated lesions or valve involvement. Let me think about the timing here. After a baseline neonatal or early-infant confirmatory echocardiogram, a reasonable schedule is a repeat study around 3 to 6 months to document early closure or size reduction, then another study at about 12 months if still present, given the high likelihood of closure by one year. If the defect is shrinking or closed at 12 months, spacing out or discontinuing echocardiography is appropriate, and if a tiny residual defect persists without any hemodynamic consequence, discharge from subspecialty cardiology can be considered in early childhood given the low yield of repetitive echocardiography and the absence of interventions in contemporary neonatal muscular VSD cohorts. Wait, I should double-check whether ongoing echo added management value in muscular VSDs; multiple series show heterogenous practices with minimal actionable findings, supporting early discharge when strictly low risk [^116eb34U] [^111UJJ5f] [^115rD6tf] [^116kBbqQ].

> For the intermediate-risk pathway, I need to ensure I include perimembranous defects 3 to 5 mm, muscular defects 3 to 5 mm, or any VSD with borderline hemodynamics despite being clinically "small". In infants, I would repeat echocardiography at 6 weeks to 3 months after diagnosis to check for early closure or evolving complications, then every 3 to 6 months through the first year as needed. In early childhood, if the defect is decreasing in size and remains hemodynamically insignificant, imaging every 6 to 12 months is prudent; if it is stable at 3 to 5 mm or perimembranous, annual echocardiography is reasonable to surveil for late aortic cusp prolapse or regurgitation, recognizing that although pVSD-associated aortic valve disease prompting surgery is uncommon, a targeted subset at higher risk warrants closer observation. Hold on, I should verify that perimembranous lesions have specific risk markers; indeed, studies suggest annulus-relative defect dimension and leaflet involvement predict progression, and subarterial lesions carry distinct long-term aortic regurgitation dynamics even post repair, reinforcing tailored surveillance in these anatomies [^113wPujP] [^116uftT8] [^112pXGqc].

> As patients enter school age and adolescence with persistent but hemodynamically insignificant intermediate-risk defects, I should consider echocardiography every one to two years, with annual studies if any aortic leaflet involvement or trivial aortic regurgitation is present. Let me reconsider the transition to adult care; this is a key juncture to prevent loss to follow-up. Transition to an adult congenital heart disease program in late adolescence with continued periodic imaging every two to three years if stable, and annually if any residual shunt greater than about 2 mm or aortic regurgitation is observed, aligns with population data showing accelerated morbidity from the third decade after surgical closure and from the fourth decade in unrepaired lesions, and with comparative ACHD guideline principles calling for structured adult surveillance [^116jCRZi] [^1117ubBk] [^1159y4en].

> For the high-risk category — any evidence of LV or RV volume overload, elevated pulmonary pressures, aortic regurgitation, multiple defects including "Swiss cheese" septum, or other complicating anatomy — the case falls outside the "small VSD" pathway. I should confirm that such patients require specialist-directed individualized surveillance, commonly every three to six months initially, with cadence adjusted to the hemodynamics, associated lesions, and intervention timing, because progression risks and decision points are fundamentally different from truly small, restrictive defects [^113wsiTQ] [^114SMvim] [^111qnShc].

> Regardless of the baseline schedule, I need to define triggers for earlier reevaluation. Let me list the practical ones and then verify their evidence basis: a new murmur or a clear change in murmur characteristics, new symptoms such as failure to thrive, dyspnea, exercise intolerance, palpitations or syncope, suspicion of infective endocarditis, and pregnancy planning or early pregnancy due to hemodynamic shifts. But wait, what if the patient is completely asymptomatic with a tiny muscular VSD? Even then, new fevers with bacteremia or dental procedures complicated by infection should lower my threshold for prompt evaluation given the elevated lifetime endocarditis hazard in VSD populations, especially unrepaired, despite the lesion being small [^113DKCrb] [^113wsiTQ].

> I should confirm when it is safe to discharge from follow-up. Discharge is reasonable when there is documented spontaneous closure on at least two echocardiograms six or more months apart, no residual hemodynamic burden with normal chamber sizes and no valve regurgitation, the patient is asymptomatic, and the child is beyond the highest-risk window for complications, which for isolated muscular VSDs commonly means after early childhood. Hold on, I should verify exceptions; I would not discharge if the defect is perimembranous with any tricuspid or aortic valve tissue involvement, if a residual defect exceeds about 2 mm, or with any history of infective endocarditis, and I would avoid discharging adults altogether, instead maintaining at least infrequent surveillance given the late emergence of heart failure, arrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension, and mortality signal in adult VSD cohorts even when defects are small or closed [^111UJJ5f] [^115rD6tf] [^113wPujP] [^113DKCrb] [^116jCRZi] [^1117ubBk].

> For special populations, let me first address adults with unrepaired small VSDs. Even if asymptomatic, periodic echocardiography roughly every three to five years is prudent, with shorter intervals if any valve involvement, arrhythmia, or rising pulmonary pressures are suspected, because population studies show an increasing burden of heart failure, arrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension, infective endocarditis, and excess mortality beginning in midlife. Next, for post-surgical VSD patients, I should review early and late surveillance: a reasonable pattern is echocardiography around six months post repair, at one year, then every two to five years thereafter to evaluate for residual shunts, aortic regurgitation, ventricular function, and arrhythmias, recognizing modern surgical cohorts have excellent early outcomes but still accrue meaningful late events over decades. Finally, for multiple defects or "Swiss cheese" septum and for patients with significant genetic syndromes, more continuous specialist surveillance is warranted irrespective of defect size, given higher complication rates and individualized surgical strategies [^113DKCrb] [^1117ubBk] [^115nYvm8] [^111zLCZ7] [^115T3FWD] [^111qnShc] [^116uftT8].

> In summary, I need to ensure the follow-up intensity matches risk: repetitive echocardiography beyond early infancy has low value for isolated tiny muscular VSDs and supports early discharge when closure occurs or a trivial residual without hemodynamic effect persists, whereas perimembranous or borderline-size defects merit continued, anatomy-targeted surveillance for aortic cusp prolapse and regurgitation. Let me double-check that this risk-tailored approach is consistent with contemporary data; indeed, neonatal muscular VSD cohorts show no interventions over years of follow-up, observational studies document heterogeneous but low-yield practices for small mVSD, and perimembranous lesions have a small but real aortic valve complication signal that justifies periodic imaging, with all adults carrying a late morbidity burden that argues against complete discharge in adulthood [^111UJJ5f] [^115rD6tf] [^113wPujP] [^116jCRZi].

For a small VSD, obtain an **initial echocardiogram at diagnosis, then repeat at 6–12 months** to assess for spontaneous closure or stability [^114SMvim] [^116eb34U]. If the defect remains small, hemodynamically insignificant, and the patient is asymptomatic, **extend follow-up to every 2–3 years or discharge from routine cardiology care by age 5–6 years** [^111UJJ5f] [^114RvDh2]. More frequent echocardiography is warranted if symptoms develop, the defect enlarges, or complications such as aortic regurgitation or endocarditis arise [^113wPujP] [^114C3K3Q] [^113DKCrb]. Routine annual echocardiography is **not necessary** for stable, small VSDs.

---

## Initial echocardiographic evaluation

An **initial echocardiogram** should be performed at diagnosis to confirm size, location, and hemodynamic significance [^113wsiTQ], with a **follow-up** at 6–12 months to assess for spontaneous closure or stability [^116eb34U] [^111UJJ5f].

---

## Recommended frequency of echocardiographic follow-up

The frequency of echocardiographic follow-up **depends on defect size, location, hemodynamic significance, and clinical status**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended echocardiographic follow-up** |
|-|-|
| - Small <br/> - Hemodynamically insignificant VSD <br/> - Asymptomatic | - Initial echo at diagnosis [^114SMvim] <br/> - Repeat at 6–12 months [^116eb34U] <br/> - If stable, extend to every 2–3 years or discharge by age 5–6 years [^111UJJ5f] [^114RvDh2] |
| Small VSD with mild symptoms or minimal hemodynamic significance | - Initial echo at diagnosis [^113wsiTQ] <br/> - Repeat at 6–12 months [^116J4HnA] <br/> - If stable, annual follow-up until symptoms resolve or defect closes |
| Small VSD with complications (e.g. aortic regurgitation, endocarditis) | More frequent echocardiography (every 6–12 months) until complication is stable or resolved [^113wPujP] [^114C3K3Q] |

---

## Factors influencing frequency of echocardiographic follow-up

Several factors **influence the recommended follow-up frequency**:

- **Defect size and location**: Smaller defects, especially muscular VSDs, have higher spontaneous closure rates and may require less frequent follow-up [^116eb34U] [^116J4HnA].

- **Hemodynamic significance**: Hemodynamically insignificant defects require less frequent follow-up than significant defects [^114SMvim].

- **Clinical symptoms**: Symptomatic patients require more frequent follow-up than asymptomatic patients [^113wsiTQ].

- **Complications**: Presence of complications such as aortic regurgitation or endocarditis necessitates more frequent follow-up [^113wPujP] [^114C3K3Q].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with different follow-up intervals

Outcomes associated with **different follow-up intervals** have been studied:

- **Annual follow-up**: Annual echocardiographic follow-up is common but may not be necessary for all patients with small VSDs, especially if the defect is stable and asymptomatic [^114RvDh2].

- **Biennial or triennial follow-up**: Less frequent follow-up (every 2–3 years) is appropriate for stable, asymptomatic patients with small, hemodynamically insignificant defects [^111UJJ5f].

- **No routine follow-up**: Some clinicians discharge patients from routine follow-up if the defect is stable, asymptomatic, and hemodynamically insignificant.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Guidelines and **expert consensus** recommend:

- **Initial echocardiographic evaluation**: Perform at diagnosis to confirm defect size, location, and hemodynamic significance [^114SMvim] [^1159y4en].

- **Follow-up echocardiography**: Repeat at 6–12 months to assess for spontaneous closure or stability [^116eb34U].

- **Stable, asymptomatic patients**: Extend follow-up intervals to every 2–3 years or discharge from routine cardiology care by age 5–6 years [^111UJJ5f] [^114RvDh2].

- **Symptomatic patients or complications**: More frequent follow-up (every 6–12 months) until symptoms resolve or complications are stable [^113wPujP].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Echocardiographic follow-up for small VSDs **should be individualized** based on defect size, location, hemodynamic significance, symptoms, and complications. Initial echocardiography at diagnosis with repeat imaging at **6–12 months** is recommended [^116eb34U] [^113wsiTQ]. If the defect remains small, hemodynamically insignificant, and the patient is asymptomatic, **extend follow-up to every 2–3 years or consider discharge from routine cardiology care by age 5–6 years** [^111UJJ5f] [^114RvDh2]. Use **more frequent follow-up** for symptomatic patients or when complications arise [^113wPujP].

### Follow-up of secundum ASD, muscular VSD, or PDA diagnosed during neonatal hospitalization [^111UJJ5f]. Pediatric Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

The ideal follow-up of neonates who have a secundum atrial septal defect (ASD), muscular ventricular septal defect (VSD), or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) remains uncertain. Newborns with findings limited to a secundum ASD, muscular VSD, and/or PDA on their neonatal hospitalization discharge echocardiogram, and at least one outpatient follow-up echocardiogram performed between September 1, 2017, and September 1, 2021, were evaluated, and patient follow-up assessed through September 1, 2023. A total of 95 infants met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 43 had a secundum ASD, 41 had a muscular VSD, and 54 had a PDA at newborn hospital discharge. Additionally, 39 out of 95 had more than one intracardiac shunt.

- **Outcome of follow-up**:
	- Fifty-six infants were discharged from care, 26 were still in follow-up, and 13 were lost to recommended follow-up.
	- No patients received intervention during the follow-up period of 2 to 6 years.
- **Specific findings**:
	- Of the 43 infants with a secundum ASD, 16 (37.2%) showed closure of the ASD, and 13 (30.2%) were discharged from care with an ASD less than 3.5 mm in diameter.
	- Three out of 43 infants with secundum ASD had a defect with a diameter of more than 5 mm at their last echocardiogram.
	- No infant discharged from their neonatal hospitalization with a secundum ASD, muscular VSD, or PDA required any intervention during 2 to 6 years of follow-up.

Ongoing follow-up with echocardiography for those infants with a secundum ASD is of greater value than for those with a muscular VSD or PDA.

### The prevalence and spontaneous closure of ventricular septal defects the first year of life [^116eb34U]. Neonatology (2024). High credibility.

Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is one of the most common congenital heart defects. We aimed to determine the prevalence of VSD in a population-based cohort of newborns and assess the rate of spontaneous closure during the first 12 months of life.

- **Methods**: The Copenhagen Baby Heart Study (CBHS) is a population-based cohort study, including more than 25,000 newborns born in the greater Copenhagen area. Newborns underwent echocardiography within 60 days of birth. Newborns with VSDs had echocardiographic follow-up after 3, 6, and 12 months.

- **Results**: A total of 850 newborns (3.3% of 25,556) with a VSD were identified in the CBHS. Of these, 787 (92.6% [95% CI 90.1–94.2]) were muscular VSDs, 60 (7.0% [95% CI, 5.5–9.0]) were perimembranous, and 3 (0.4% [95% CI, 0.0–1.1]) were subarterial. After 1 year, 83.5% (607 of 727) of all VSDs had closed spontaneously, resulting in a decrease of prevalence from 3.3% at birth to 0.5% in 1-year-old children. Muscular VSDs showed a significantly higher rate of spontaneous closure compared with perimembranous VSDs (86.9% (582/670) vs. 46.9% (25/54), p < 0.001). Determinants associated with spontaneous closure were smaller size of the VSD (p < 0.001) and the absence of multiple VSDs (p < 0.0025).

- **Conclusion**: The prevalence of VSDs in unselected newborns was 3.3%. Almost 9/10 of all VSDs identified in newborns close spontaneously during the first year of life, ultimately resulting in a prevalence of VSD in 1-year-old children of 0.5%. The identified factors associated with spontaneous closure were muscular type, small size, and absence of multiple VSDs.

### Ventricular septal defect with secondary left ventricular-to-right atrial shunt is associated with a higher risk for infective endocarditis and a lower late chance of closure [^114C3K3Q]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Although ventricular septal aneurysm may diminish or even close the shunt through the ventricular septal defect (VSD), developing a left ventricular-to-right atrial (LV-RA) shunt may be unfavorable. This study sought to clarify this issue based on an extended observation of such patients.

- **Methods**: Sixty-eight patients (1201 patient-years) who had small perimembranous VSD and LV-RA shunt and were not operated on before 6 years of age were studied.

- **Results**: The onset age of the LV-RA shunt was 5.8 ± 3.3 years. Clinical improvement was later observed in 23 patients (34%); the murmur disappeared, and spontaneous closure occurred in 5 patients (7%). Seven episodes of infective endocarditis were reported in 6 patients (8.7%, or 58 per 10,000 patient-years), with 2 receiving surgery. Another 4 underwent surgery during follow-up. Echocardiographic findings revealed aneurysmal transformation involving the anterior and septal leaflets of the tricuspid valve, forming a "double sac" in 56 patients (85%), while only the septal leaflet (a "single sac") was involved in 10 patients. Patients with a double sac were less likely to show improvement. Conversely, patients with a superior QRS axis and female gender showed clinical improvement more frequently.

- **Conclusions**: VSD with secondary LV-RA shunt is associated with a higher risk for infective endocarditis but still has a low chance for late improvement or closure.

### Frequency of development of aortic valve disease in unrepaired perimembranous ventricular septal defects [^113wPujP]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

We sought to determine the natural history of aortic valve disease in patients with unrepaired perimembranous ventricular septal defects (pVSDs) and to identify echocardiographic parameters predictive of increased risk of surgical repair of pVSD because of aortic valve disease. We retrospectively analyzed all echocardiograms of patients with a diagnosis of pVSD at our institution from January 1999 to January 2015. All available echocardiographic data were collected. Patients were excluded if there was another structural cardiac anomaly other than bicuspid aortic valve, small patent foramen ovale, or ductus arteriosus. The prevalences of aortic valve prolapse and regurgitation, as well as aortic valve disease progression, were determined.

A total of 2,114 echocardiograms from 657 patients with unrepaired pVSD were reviewed. Median age at the time of echocardiogram was 1.9 years (interquartile range [IQR] 0.2 to 5.4). Median duration of follow-up was 1.7 years (IQR 0.2 to 7.4). pVSD-associated aortic valve disease prompted surgical intervention in 1.5% (10 of 657) of patients. Median age at the time of surgery was 4.8 years (IQR 1.7 to 8.4). A pVSD-to-aortic annulus diameter ratio of 0.66 ± 0.05 was present in 90% (9 of 10) of patients who underwent surgical closure because of pVSD-associated aortic valve disease.

In conclusion, pVSD-associated aortic valve disease is uncommon, and progression of aortic regurgitation is rare. These data suggest that the majority of patients with pVSD do not require frequent follow-up and that frequent follow-up can be reserved for a subset with higher risk.

### 2022 ESC guidelines for the management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death [^115ARJU8]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

Concerning diagnostic investigations for ventricular arrhythmias, particularly regarding echocardiography, the ESC 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining echocardiography as a first-line evaluation in patients with newly documented ventricular arrhythmias (frequent premature ventricular complexes, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, and sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia).

### Atrial septal defect: Spectrum of care [^114yzeB6]. Pediatric cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a common congenital heart defect. Variability in management of this lesion exists among clinicians. A review of the literature reveals that there is a lack of standard guidelines for the evaluation and management of patients with different types of ASDs. This survey-based study was conducted to test the uniformity of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to the management of children with secundum, sinus venosus, and primum ASDs. Survey questionnaires were prepared to include questions regarding follow-up, diagnosis, and therapeutic intervention of different types and sizes of ASDs. Questions addressed follow-up visitations, type and frequency of investigative studies, pharmacological therapy, and choice of repair method.

Surveys were sent out to all pediatric cardiology academic programs in the United States (n = 48) and randomly selected international programs from Europe, Asia, and Australia (n = 19). A total of 23 programs (34%) responded to the survey (15 from the United States and 8 internationally). A separate questionnaire was prepared for secundum, primum, and sinus venosus ASD. In each questionnaire, lesion types were subdivided into small, moderate, and large defect sizes to address differences in management approaches to each defect type and size.

Results indicate that in secundum ASD, most participants use the size of the defect and/or evidence of right-sided volume overload as criteria for defining small, moderate, and large defects. Frequency of follow-up does not vary with the type of lesion but is more frequent with larger defects.

### Surgical repair of "swiss cheese" ventricular septal defects with two-patch and right ventricular apex-exclusion technique: Mid-term follow-up results [^111qnShc]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

This study was approved by the institutional review board of the ethics committee at the affiliated Women and Children's Hospital of Qingdao University (QFELL-YJ-2023–205) on December 31, 2023. Informed consent was obtained in all cases. Between May 2014 and October 2021, our institution performed surgical repair on 13 patients presenting with "Swiss cheese" VSDs utilizing the RVA exclusion technique. Inclusion criteria necessitated a confirmed diagnosis of "Swiss cheese" VSDs through transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). Exclusion criteria comprised patients younger than 2 months old, the presence of other associated congenital heart defects requiring palliative treatment, severe pulmonary hypertension with right-to-left shunt of VSDs, and patients whose guardians declined acceptance of this novel technique.

Prior to surgery, comprehensive assessments, including physical examination, electrocardiography (ECG), chest radiography, and TTE, were conducted for all cases. The general characteristics of the patients are detailed below:

- **Patient characteristics**: ECG, electrocardiography; iRBBB, incomplete right bundle branch block; iLBBB, incomplete left bundle branch block; cRBBB, complete right bundle branch block; TTE, transthoracic echocardiogram; LVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction; TR, tricuspid regurgitation; ASD, atrial septal defect; DORV, double-outlet right ventricle; VSD, ventricular septal defect; PDA, patent ductus arteriosus.

### Ventricular septal dysfunction after surgical closure of multiple ventricular septal defects [^1159gHNN]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

We assessed the global and regional ventricular septal functions using conventional echocardiography and two-dimensional speckle tracking imaging in children with postoperative multiple ventricular septal defects.

- **Methods**: Thirty-six children were studied: 16 with postoperative multiple ventricular septal defects and 20 normal control subjects. In children with multiple ventricular septal defects, 60 ventricular septal defects were closed using one of three different techniques (patch closure, the sandwich technique, direct closure). Speckle tracking imaging was applied to three short-axis echocardiographic images.

- **Results**: The total patch area used in the multiple ventricular septal defects group was correlated with the postoperative ejection fraction (r = 0.703) and Tei index (r = 0.778). The global septal peak systolic radial displacement and global septal peak systolic radial strain in the multiple ventricular septal defects group were significantly lower than those observed in the control subjects. The peak systolic radial strain in the segments closed with patches and the peak systolic radial displacement in the segments closed with the felt sandwich technique were significantly lower than those observed in the intact septal segments. No significant regional functional depressions were identified in the segments that were closed directly.

- **Conclusions**: The postoperative ventricular global and septal functions were significantly reduced in children with multiple ventricular septal defects, especially in cases with complex congenital heart disease.

### Long-term outcomes of surgical repair for ventricular septal defect in adults [^112m4fq1]. Pediatric Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

Data on the outcomes of ventricular septal defect (VSD) closure in adults are limited to establish recommendations. Therefore, we reviewed our experience with surgical VSD closure in adult patients. We retrospectively reviewed 152 patients who underwent surgical VSD closure between January 1996 and April 2020. The median age of the patients was 30.5 [interquartile range (IQR) 23.1–42.7] years, and the median follow-up duration was 10.9 (IQR 4.8–16.1) years.

VSDs were classified according to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons classification as type 2 (n = 66, 43.4%), type 1 (n = 59, 38.8%), and type 4 (n = 27, 17.8%). Aortic cusp prolapse (n = 86, 56.6%) and aortic valve regurgitation (AR, n = 75, 49.3%) were the most common indications for surgical closure. Four patients underwent late reoperation (2.6%) due to AR, infective endocarditis, and residual VSD.

In the log-rank test, preoperative trivial or more degree of AR (P = 0.004) and coronary cusp deformity (P = 0.031) were associated with a late moderate or greater degree of AR. Preoperative moderate or greater AR was associated with reoperation (P = 0.047). Only concomitant aortic valve (AV) repair at the time of VSD closure was a significant risk factor for late significant AR progression in the multivariable analysis.

VSD closure in adults can be performed with low mortality and morbidity rates. AR can progress after VSD closure because the aortic cusp may have irreversible damage from long-standing shunt flow exposure. We conclude that VSD with AV deformity or AR in adults should be treated aggressively before disease progression with irreversible damage occurs.

### Implementation of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2008 guidelines for the management of adults with congenital heart disease [^116yRT9C]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Although different guidelines on adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) care advocate for lifetime cardiac follow-up, a critical appraisal of the guideline implementation is lacking. We investigated the implementation of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2008 guidelines for ACHD follow-up by examining the type of healthcare professional, care setting, and frequency of outpatient visits in young adults with congenital heart disease (CHD). Furthermore, correlates for care in line with the recommendations or untraceability were investigated.

A cross-sectional observational study was conducted, including 306 patients with CHD who had a documented outpatient visit at pediatric cardiology before age 18 years. In all, 210 patients (68.6%) were in cardiac follow-up; 20 (6.5%) withdrew from follow-up and 76 (24.9%) were untraceable. Overall, 198 patients were followed up in tertiary care, one-fourth (n = 52) of whom were seen at a formalized ACHD care program and three-fourths (n = 146) remained at pediatric cardiology. Of those followed in formalized ACHD and pediatric cardiology care, the recommended frequency was implemented in 94.2% and 89%, respectively (p = 0.412). No predictors for the implementation of the guidelines were identified.

Risk factors for becoming untraceable included having none or a lower number of heart surgeries, health insurance issues, and nonwhite ethnicity. In conclusion, a significant number of adults continue to be cared for by pediatric cardiologists, indicating that transfer to adult-oriented care was not standard practice. The frequency of follow-up for most patients was in line with recommendations.

### Prevalence and development of additional cardiac abnormalities in 1448 patients with congenital ventricular septal defects [^116uftT8]. Heart (2004). Low credibility.

To determine by modern echocardiographic techniques the prevalence and development of cardiac abnormalities associated with ventricular septal defect (VSD), consecutive patients referred to a tertiary center for pediatric cardiology and attendees at an adult congenital heart disease clinic had details of clinical outcomes recorded prospectively. Patients with VSD in association with conotruncal abnormalities, atrioventricular septal defects, and univentricular heart were not included in the study.

A total of 1448 patients with VSD were assessed between 1991 and 1998. Of these, 1127 (78%) patients had isolated defects; 862 (76%) were perimembranous, and 265 (24%) were muscular. For the remainder, 284 patients (19.6% of the total population) had VSD associated with one other significant cardiac abnormality; 35 (2.4%) with two, and two (0.1%) with three other abnormalities. The most common associated cardiac abnormalities were infundibular pulmonary stenosis (5.8%), aortic valve prolapse (3.6%), pulmonary valvar stenosis (2.7%), ostium secundum atrial septal defect (2.2%), persistent ductus arteriosus (1.9%), and coarctation of the aorta (1.5%).

In the cohort of 743 patients followed up from birth, cumulative mortality was 4% by the age of 8 years, with most deaths occurring within the first year of life in infants with associated genetic abnormalities such as trisomy 13 or 18. Of the 594 patients attending the adult congenital clinic with VSD, aortic regurgitation due to aortic root prolapse developed in 45 (7.6%) patients. Most of these cases were detected before

### Subspecialty surveillance of long-term course of small and moderate muscular ventricular septal defect: Heterogenous practices, low yield [^115rD6tf]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

No clear consensus exists about the value of follow-up for small muscular ventricular septal defects (mVSD). Of 52 respondents to a small survey conducted among pediatric cardiology providers in the UK, the majority would follow up a hemodynamically insignificant VSD in three years, 15% would do so in one year, and less than 10% would dismiss the patient upon diagnosis. Our experience confirmed the striking variability in actual practice that the survey would lead us to expect. In this report, individual providers recommended pediatric cardiology follow-up for as few as 11% and as many as 100% of their patients.

Small mVSDs are common. Studies prior to the routine use of echocardiography determined an incidence of 1.3–3.3 VSD per 1000 live births. However, with the advent of echocardiography, the incidence has increased significantly. Because the population of children with small mVSDs is large, a policy of routine pediatric cardiology follow-up would consume substantial resources in the subspecialty outpatient clinic. The benefits of this investment are not obvious, given the natural history studies that show uncomplicated small mVSDs carry a high likelihood of spontaneous closure, with little if any prospect for clinical deterioration. It is impressive that the provider with the largest practice had the lowest follow-up rate of 11%, while providers with smaller clinical practices had higher rates. This suggests that provider experience might be associated with better resource utilization, perhaps driven by greater confidence.

Our data confirms that among a large number of pediatric cardiology providers, there is significant variability in follow-up practices.

### Residual shunts following isolated surgical ventricular septal defect closure: Risk factors and spontaneous closure [^111JkENF]. Pediatric Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Although isolated congenital ventricular septal defects (VSD) can be repaired with a high degree of success, residual shunts (RS) are commonplace postoperatively. Small RS are relatively innocuous and tend to spontaneously close with time, despite the emotional burden it poses for the patient and family. A large RS, however, needs ongoing surveillance and may necessitate reintervention. Factors influencing the incidence of RS, as well as the likelihood and expected timing of its spontaneous closure, are discussed in this study.

The patient records and relevant data of 362 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac operation with isolated congenital VSD closure as the primary procedure from January 2017 to December 2017 were included in the study. Postoperative transthoracic echocardiograms were performed at hospital discharge and during follow-up at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively. Residual defects were measured under echocardiogram at every follow-up. Factors expected to be associated with RS occurrence and spontaneous closure were included for logistic and Cox regression statistical analysis.

There were 113 cases where RS occurred according to the first postoperative echocardiograms performed at discharge, of which 80 were confirmed closed during subsequent follow-up, with a median follow-up of 96 days. A cutoff of 1.25 mm for the initial RS was found to be the best predictor of spontaneous closure at a 6-month follow-up. Small shunts had a higher closure rate than larger ones by a follow-up duration of 300 days, at which point the two groups tended to diverge in outcomes.

### Three decades of follow-up after surgical closure of subarterial ventricular septal defect [^112pXGqc]. Pediatric Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

We determined the occurrence of aortic regurgitation (AR), AR progression, and risk factors in patients followed up for up to three decades after closure of subarterial VSD. We reviewed the outcomes of 86 patients categorized into three groups:

- **Group I**: 37 patients without AR had VSD closure alone.
- **Group II**: 40 patients with AR had VSD closure without aortic valvoplasty.
- **Group III**: 9 patients with AR required both VSD closure and aortic valvoplasty.

Patients were followed up for an average of 18.9 ± 7.3 years (median 19.5 years, range 3.5–36.6). At the latest follow-up, 54.7% (47/86) of patients had AR. The prevalence of progression of AR from one grade to the next higher grade was 37.2% (32/86). Freedom from AR progression was 75.6%, 52.1%, and 22.2% at 20 years of follow-up for groups I, II, and III, respectively (p < 0.05). However, progression to moderate to severe AR occurred only in 4.7% (4/86). Group I and II patients were free from progression to significant AR, while only 33.3% of group III patients were free from progression on follow-up (p < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that severity of preoperative AR was the significant risk factor for the persistence and progression of postoperative AR after VSD closure. In conclusion, aortic regurgitation is common and may progress even after surgical repair of subarterial VSD. Severity of preoperative AR is the most significant predictor of persistence and progression of AR after surgical closure of subarterial VSD.

### Cause-specific mortality of patients with atrial septal defect and up to 50 years of follow-up [^114vavFw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Patients with atrial septal defect (ASD) exhibited higher overall mortality, with an adjusted mortality risk ratio (MRR) of 1.72 (95% CI, 1.61–1.83). For female patients, the MRR was 1.79 (95% CI, 1.65–1.94), while for male patients, it was 1.64 (95% CI, 1.48–1.81). Notably, female patients with ASD had lower mortality compared to their male counterparts (MRR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.59–0.74]). This mortality difference was similarly observed in the control population (MRR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.58–0.65]).

Patients with closed ASDs showed higher total mortality (MRR, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.10–1.51]). No significant difference in mortality was detected if the defect was closed before the age of 30 (MRR, 1.58 [95% CI, 0.90–2.77]). In cases of surgically closed defects, the MRR was 1.49 (95% CI, 1.26–1.76).

- **Long-term mortality according to study groups**:
	- Total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, mortality of closed atrial septal defects compared with the control population, and mortality of transcatheter and surgically closed patients are presented. Only individualized controls were included in the analysis. Mortality risk ratios are adjusted for sex, age, year at the start of follow-up, and age at the beginning of follow-up. ASD indicates atrial septal defect; TC, transcatheter.

Figures mentioned are for illustration and show Kaplan–Meier estimates of mortality and mortality risk ratios in different ASD groups compared with the control population. These figures adjust mortality risk ratios according to sex, age, year at the start of follow-up, and age at the beginning of follow-up. ASD indicates atrial septal defect; MRR, mortality risk ratio.

### AHA/ACC vs ESC guidelines for management of adults with congenital heart disease: JACC guideline comparison [^1159y4en]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

The American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology published practice guidelines for the management of adult congenital heart disease in 2018, and the European Society of Cardiology published analogous guidelines in 2020. Although there are broad areas of consensus between the two documents, important differences impact patient management. This review discusses key areas of agreement and disagreement between the two guidelines, with discussion of possible reasons for disagreement and potential implications.

### Prediction of spontaneous closure of ventricular septal defect and guidance for clinical follow-up [^116J4HnA]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

This study described the natural history and spontaneous closure rate of children with p-VSD and m-VSD. We inferred that defect size, ATVMS, and LVDD were characteristic and representative predictors for spontaneous closure of VSD. A follow-up criterion was recommended by summarizing this study, which may assist pediatricians in selecting the appropriate treatment strategy to manage children with VSD.

### Comparison of outcomes in adults with ventricular septal defect closed earlier in life versus those in whom the defect was never closed [^114PiNcd]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Ventricular septal defects (VSDs) have recently demonstrated poorer functional outcomes with disrupted ventricular contractility during exercise in young patients. It is not known whether this will change with age. Therefore, echocardiography was performed in older patients with congenital VSDs, either surgically closed or unrepaired, and all without Eisenmenger physiology, to compare functional outcomes with healthy peers.

Transthoracic echocardiography was performed at rest and during supine bicycle exercise, with tissue velocity Doppler for the assessment of primary endpoints: isovolumetric acceleration and systolic velocities. In total, 30 surgically closed VSD patients (51 ± 8 years) with 30 healthy controls (52 ± 9 years), and 30 unrepaired VSD patients (55 ± 12 years) with 30 matched controls (55 ± 10 years) were included. Surgical patients displayed lower right ventricular (RV) systolic and early diastolic-filling velocities compared with controls, p < 0.01; lower tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (17.8 ± 5 vs. 22.7 ± 3 mm, p < 0.01); and lower fractional area change (37.8 ± 6% vs. 46.4% ± 7%, p < 0.01).

Unrepaired VSDs also had lower RV fractional area change than matched controls (39.9 ± 7% vs. 48.4% ± 7%, p < 0.01). Both patient groups had more tricuspid regurgitation and larger RV outflow tract dimensions than controls, p < 0.01. During exercise, isovolumetric acceleration and systolic velocities were lower in both patient groups compared with controls, with the difference increasing with workload level.

In conclusion, adults in their mid-50s with surgically closed or unrepaired VSDs had lower functional outcomes compared to their healthy peers.

### Functional capacity past age 40 in patients with congenital ventricular septal defects [^116NQ2K5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

In total, 391 patients aged > 40 years with a congenital VSD were found through a search by diagnosis code; 74 patients with surgically closed VSDs and 67 patients with small unrepaired VSDs were eligible for inclusion, as shown in Figure 1. Between September 2018 and August 2019, 30 patients with surgically closed VSDs, 30 healthy matched control participants, 30 patients with small unrepaired VSDs, and 30 healthy matched control participants were included at Aarhus University Hospital. Patient groups and their respectively matched control groups displayed similar demographics, as presented in Table 1. No sex- or ethnicity-based differences were present.

Cardiovascular comorbidities were more prevalent in patients than controls. Regarding comorbidities of patients with surgically closed VSDs, 5 patients had arrhythmias and 8 had hypertension, compared with hypertension in 4 control participants. Among patients with unrepaired VSDs, 9 had hypertension, 1 had diabetes mellitus, 1 had a stroke, 1 had retinal artery occlusion, and 4 had arrhythmia, compared with hypertension in 6 control participants.

- **Arrhythmias**:

	- **Surgically closed group**: 4 patients had atrial fibrillation, 1 had sick sinus syndrome, 1 had first-degree atrioventricular block, and 2 had multifocal ventricular extrasystole.

	- **Unrepaired group**: 3 patients had atrial fibrillation, 1 had atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia, 1 had first-degree atrioventricular block, and 3 had supraventricular extrasystole.

### Functional capacity past age 40 in patients with congenital ventricular septal defects [^112nxpLf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Ventricular septal defects (VSD), when treated correctly in childhood, are considered to have great prognoses, and the majority of patients are discharged from follow-up when entering their teens. Young adults were previously found to have poorer functional capacity than healthy peers, but the question remains whether functional capacity degenerates further with age.

- **Methods and results**: A group of 30 patients with surgically closed VSDs (51 ± 8 years) with 30 matched, healthy control participants (52 ± 9 years) and a group of 30 patients with small unrepaired VSDs (55 ± 12 years) and 30 matched control participants (55 ± 10 years) underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing using an incremental workload protocol and non-invasive gas measurement. Peak oxygen uptake was lower in participants with closed VSDs than matched controls (24 ± 7 versus 34 ± 9 mL/min per kg, P < 0.01) and with unrepaired VSDs than matched controls (26 ± 5 versus 32 ± 8 mL/min per kg, P < 0.01). Patients demonstrated lower oxygen uptake from exercise levels at 20% of maximal workload compared with respective control groups (P < 0.01). Peak ventilation was lower in patients with surgically closed VSDs than control participants (1.0 ± 0.3 versus 1.4 ± 0.4 L/min per kg, P < 0.01) but similar in patients with unrepaired VSDs and control participants (P = 0.14). Exercise capacity was 29% lower in older patients with surgically closed VSDs than healthy peers, whereas younger patients with surgically closed VSDs previously demonstrated 18% lower capacity compared with peers. Older patients with unrepaired VSDs reached 21%.

### Subspecialty surveillance of long-term course of small and moderate muscular ventricular septal defect: Heterogeneous practices, low yield [^116kBbqQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

In all, 316 follow-up visits were recommended by fourteen pediatric cardiology providers, of which 259 were actually accomplished. There were 37 other unplanned follow-up visits. No recommendations for medical or surgical management were made at any of the follow-up visits. The mean follow-up duration was 1.4 years (range: 1 month to 5 years). For those patients who were dismissed from follow-up, the mean interval from initial visit to dismissal was 0.82 years (range: 0 days to 12.3 years). There were 12 MD (evaluated 85% of small mVSDs) and 2 non-MD physician assistant providers (evaluated 15% of small mVSDs).

Follow-up was recommended for patients with an isolated small mVSD at a rate of 32%, versus 68% for small-to-moderate and moderate isolated mVSD, and 58% for multiple small mVSD (p < 0.001). Younger age at the first visit was associated with a greater rate of recommendation for follow-up. The mean age at first visit for patients who were recommended follow-up was 11.4 months vs. 18.4 months for patients who were not recommended follow-up (p = 0.006).

There was significant variability in follow-up recommendations between providers, ranging from 11% to 100% (Table 2). Independent associations with recommendations for follow-up were limited to high clinical volume providers, the mVSD characteristics (multiple mVSD, isolated small-to-moderate, or isolated moderate mVSD), and patient age under 3 months at the first visit (Table 3). Patient gender, echo-reading provider, and non-MD provider did not appear to be independently related to subspecialty follow-up.

### Frequency of circumferential pericardial effusion by echocardiography in adults with foramen ovale type atrial septal defect versus ventricular septal defect [^116aPGP5]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Many published reports have described pericardial effusions in patients with secundum atrial septal defects. This study investigated their associated prevalence echocardiographically using 40 patients with isolated ventricular septal defects as controls in an adult patient population. Pericardial effusions accompanied atrial septal defects in 13 patients and ventricular septal defects in only 3 patients (p < 0.0001). In conclusion, pericardial effusions are much more common (p < 0.005) with uncomplicated secundum atrial septal defects than with uncomplicated ventricular septal defects.

### Lifetime burden of morbidity in patients with isolated congenital ventricular septal defect [^113DKCrb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

The lifetime burden of morbidity in patients with isolated congenital ventricular septal defect (VSD) is not completely described.

- **Methods and results**: In a population-based cohort study in Denmark, using nationwide medical registries, we included 8,006 patients diagnosed with a congenital VSD before 2018, along with 79,568 randomly selected controls from the general Danish population matched by birth year and sex. Concomitant congenital cardiac malformations and chromosomal abnormalities were excluded. Cox proportional hazard regression, Fine and Gray competing risk regression, and Kaplan-Meier survival function were used to estimate the burden of morbidity compared with matched controls. The median follow-up was 23 years (interquartile range, 11–37 years).

	- The hazard ratio (HR) of heart failure was high in both patients with unrepaired and surgically closed VSD when compared with their corresponding matched controls (5.4 [95% CI, 4.6–6.3] and 30.5 [95% CI, 21.8–42.7], respectively). Truncated analyses, with time from birth until 1 year after VSD diagnosis (unrepaired) or surgery (surgically closed) censored, revealed a reduced but persistent late hazard of heart failure. Similarly, the late hazard of arrhythmias and pulmonary arterial hypertension was high irrespective of defect closure.

	- The HR of endocarditis was 28.0 (95% CI, 19.2–40.9) in patients with unrepaired defects and 82.7 (95% CI, 37.5–183.2) in patients with surgically closed defects. The increased HR diminished after VSD surgery. In general, the incidence of morbidity among patients with unrepaired VSD accelerates…

### Prenatally diagnosed isolated perimembranous ventricular septal defect: Genetic and clinical implications [^1163DnxQ]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2022). Low credibility.

In terms of clinical outcomes, almost half of the pVSDs closed prenatally, with an additional 30.9% closing within the first year of life. Therefore, a total of three-fourths of the pVSDs closed spontaneously either during pregnancy or the first year of life without further medical or surgical intervention.

Our findings are consistent with several studies that have reported prenatal closure rates for perimembranous type VSD to be 50%–62%, with a higher probability of closure compared to muscular VSDs. This relationship between the VSD type and spontaneous closure was speculated to be linked to the different closing mechanisms of each type of VSD. The mechanism of spontaneous closure of membranous type VSD is mainly due to reduplication of the tricuspid valve tissue and its adherence. This process is presumed to initiate prenatally, as suggested by Nir et al. Young Sun Cho et al. considered that a perimembranous site as well as the small size of the VSD are two out of three good prognostic factors for fetal closure (the third factor was maternal age < 25 years). Here, as well, the prenatal evaluation of small pVSD was correlated with better chances of spontaneous closure up to the age of one year (p < 0.05). Studies have shown that VSD size is inversely proportional to the likelihood of spontaneous closure. Although there is no universally accepted definition for the relationship between VSD size and its natural history, it was reported that 3 mm is the upper limit for VSD size to result in spontaneous closure.

### Cause-specific mortality of patients with atrial septal defect and up to 50 years of follow-up [^112oh55o]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Low credibility.

This study was limited by the retrospective nature of its design. Despite the FHDR reportedly being accurate, the possibility of coding misclassifications cannot be completely excluded.

There is some selection bias in patients born before 1969, as patients with more severe defects may have died before the start of follow-up. For patients born before 1969 (n = 3739, 41.1% of the study population), the date of diagnosis cannot be known for sure. Follow-up began with the first time that the diagnosis appeared in the FHDR; in patients born before 1969, this could mean the date of diagnosis or a follow-up visit.

The closure rate for patients with ASD in the whole cohort is unknown, as procedural codes were included in the discharge registry only after 1986. Information about the ASD subtypes was limited because ICD-8 and ICD-9 (used from 1969 to 1995) were not specific enough to describe various types of ASD. Thus, 36.9% of defects were labeled as undetermined.

### Prediction of spontaneous closure of ventricular septal defect and guidance for clinical follow-up [^111rYmDL]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is the most common congenital heart disease (CHD), accounting for almost 50% of all CHD. The estimated prevalence of VSD is 2 to 3.94 per 1000 live births diagnosed by echocardiography. Two-dimensional (2D) combined with color Doppler echocardiography facilitates the diagnosis of VSD, allowing measurement of the size and position of the defect and evaluation of its anatomical relationship with surrounding tissue. The spontaneous closure rate of VSD is controversial, with closures occurring in 12% to 84% of cases, a range attributed to factors such as age, size, position of VSD, diagnostic methods, and follow-up period.

Recent studies focus on describing the incidence and natural history of VSD, though some have had short follow-up periods. In this study, patients were followed from infancy to six years of age, revealing the spontaneous closure rates of perimembranous VSD (p-VSD) and muscular VSD (m-VSD). The aim was to identify predictive factors for spontaneous VSD closure and recommend follow-up criteria to assist pediatricians in selecting the best management scheme for children with VSD.

### Surgical repair of ventricular septal defect; contemporary results and risk factors for a complicated course [^111zLCZ7]. Pediatric Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Only one study group described the long-term effects of surgical repair of a VSD at a young age. According to the first study, patients may be at a higher risk for sick sinus syndrome, as 4% developed this condition following a mean follow-up of fifteen years. Aortic regurgitation was another late complication reported in 16% of all patients in this study, which described 22–34 years of follow-up from operations that took place between 1968 and 1980. The second study of the same cohort, with a follow-up of up to 40 years, shows systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle in 21% and systolic dysfunction of the right ventricle in 17%. The percentage of aortic regurgitation increased to 21%. The postoperative mortality rate at that time was high (14%). Surgical techniques and pre-and postoperative care have improved dramatically since that era, given the mortality rate of 0% today. It is unknown if these long-term complications will appear in our cohort, but it would be interesting to evaluate late echocardiographic results in our patients. New long-term follow-up studies should be performed to see whether the long-term outcomes have changed.

Our aim was to define risk factors for complications and major adverse events. Because complications and major adverse events are rare, multivariate analysis was not possible in our study. To actually define risk factors for complications and major adverse events, future research with larger cohorts should be conducted.

The limitations of this study are primarily defined by the limitations of all retrospective studies.

### Lifetime burden of morbidity in patients with isolated congenital ventricular septal defect [^116jCRZi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Patients with a congenital isolated VSD, either unrepaired or surgically closed, displayed a substantial burden of arrhythmias, infectious endocarditis, heart failure, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. For patients with unrepaired defects, the incidence of morbidity was trivial before their fourth decade of life; however, it was amplified significantly thereafter. Patients with surgically closed defects present with significant morbidity earlier, after the second decade of life, and, noticeably, a survival free from events is clearly inferior compared with both unrepaired patients and controls from the general population. This difference persists even when morbidity from birth until the first year after surgery is censored.

Our data support the latest recommendations on the regular follow-up of patients with VSD and highlight the potential development of significant cardiac morbidity after the fourth decade of life in patients with unrepaired VSD and the third decade of life in patients with surgically closed VSD. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying these significant burdens of mortality and morbidity are an area of unmet research need that may have a transformational impact on patients in the future.

### Prediction of spontaneous closure of ventricular septal defect and guidance for clinical follow-up [^115Vct7z]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve**: The area under the ROC curve for perimembranous ventricular septal defect (VSD) was 0.854. Prognostic factors were statistically significant for VSDs in children older than 6 months (39%). Small defects showed the highest frequency (80%) of spontaneous closure. Apical defects closed at a higher rate (67%) than mid‐ventricular (66%) and apical (67%). Pulmonary hypertension (PH) was identified as a negative factor for spontaneous closure, as three patients with PH did not experience closure. Left ventricular diastolic dimension (LVDD) was smaller in patients with spontaneous closure than those without.

- **Binary logistic regression analysis**: This analysis demonstrated that defect size (P = 0.002) and LVDD (P = 0.004) statistically discriminated between spontaneous closure and non-closure.

The differences in results between patients with and without spontaneous closure of muscular VSDs are detailed in Table 2. A logistic regression model was created using the indicators identified.

### Current expectations for surgical repair of isolated ventricular septal defects [^115nYvm8]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is the most commonly recognized congenital heart defect. With the development of device closure for intracardiac defects, we sought to evaluate expectations for surgical closure of isolated VSD.

- **Methods**: Between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2006, 215 patients underwent isolated VSD repair at a median age of 10 months (range, 20 days to 18 years) and a median weight of 7 kg (range, 2 to 66 kg). The following VSD types were found: 172 perimembranous (80%), 28 supracristal (13%), 6 inlet (3%), and 9 muscular (4%). One hundred eight patients (50%) had evidence of congestive heart failure or failure to thrive preoperatively. Thirty-one patients (14%) had aortic valve cusp prolapse, and 63 (29%) had genetic abnormalities.

- **Results**: Incidence of significant postoperative complications was extremely low. No patient underwent reoperation for a residual VSD. None had complete heart block. One operative mortality (0.5%) and 2 late deaths (0.9%) occurred. Median postoperative hospital length of stay was 5 days (range, 2 to 187 days). In the immediate postoperative period, 6 patients (2.8%) required reoperation. No patients were discharged on antiarrhythmic agents, had complete heart block, or required permanent pacing. At mean follow-up of 2.1 ± 2.0 years, 99.5% (211 of 212) of patients were asymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint. None exhibited greater than mild new-onset tricuspid valve regurgitation. No aortic valve injuries occurred.

- **Conclusions**: Surgical closure of isolated VSD is a safe, effective therapy. Risk of death remains low, and overall outcomes are favorable for patients undergoing this procedure.

### The unnatural history of the ventricular septal defect: outcome up to 40 years after surgical closure [^115T3FWD]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Few prospective data are available regarding long-term outcomes after the surgical closure of a ventricular septal defect (VSD). The objective of this study was to investigate clinical outcomes more than 30 years after surgical VSD closure. Patients who underwent surgical VSD closure during childhood between 1968 and 1980 were reexamined every 10 years. In 2012, eligible patients were invited to undergo another examination, which included electrocardiography, Holter monitoring, echocardiography, bicycle ergometry, measurement of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, and a subjective health assessment.

- **Results**: Cumulative survival was 86% at 40 years. Causes of mortality included arrhythmia, heart failure, endocarditis, during valvular surgery, pulmonary hypertension, non-cardiac causes, and unknown causes. Cumulative event-free survival after surgery was 72% at 40 years. Symptomatic arrhythmias occurred in 13% of patients, and surgical or catheter-based reinterventions were noted in 12%.

	- Prevalence of impaired right ventricular systolic function increased from 1% in 2001 to 17% in 2012 (p = 0.001), while left ventricular systolic function was impaired but stable in 21% of patients. Aortic regurgitation was more frequent in the last 20 years (p = 0.039), and mean exercise capacity decreased (p = 0.003). N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels (median: 11.6 pmol/l [interquartile range: 7.0 to 19.8 pmol/l]) were elevated (> 14 pmol/l) in 38% of patients. A concomitant cardiac lesion, such as a patent ductus arteriosus, and aortic cross-clamp time were determinants of late events.

### Subspecialty surveillance of long-term course of small and moderate muscular ventricular septal defect: Heterogeneous practices, low yield [^111cFTyT]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

No expert consensus guides the practice for the intensity of ongoing pediatric cardiology surveillance of hemodynamically insignificant small and moderate muscular ventricular septal defects (mVSD), despite the well-established benign natural history of mVSD. This lack of consensus leads to the potential for widely divergent follow-up practices. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate: (1) variations in follow-up of mVSD within an academic children's hospital-based pediatric cardiology practice, and (2) the frequency of active medical or surgical management resulting from follow-up of mVSD.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed records of 600 patients with isolated mVSD echocardiographically diagnosed between 2006 and 2012. Large mVSD were excluded (n = 4). Patient age, gender, echocardiographic findings, provider recommendations for follow-up, and medical and surgical management were tabulated at initial and follow-up visits. Independent associations with follow-up recommendations were sought using multivariate analysis.

- **Results**: Initial echocardiography showed small single mVSD in 509 (85%), multiple small mVSD in 60 (10%), and small-to-moderate or moderate single mVSD in 31 (5%). The mean age at diagnosis was 15.9 months (0–18.5 years) and 25.7 months (0–18.5 years) at the last follow-up. There was a slight female predominance (56.3%). Fourteen pediatric cardiology providers recommended 316 follow-up visits, of which 259 were actually accomplished. There were 37 other unplanned follow-up visits.

### What is blocking transcatheter ventricular septal defect closure [^112LCSKr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Ventricular septal defects (VSDs) are among the most common congenital heart defects, with an incidence rate of 3 to 3.5 per 1000 live births. VSDs range in size from tiny pinholes to the near absence of the ventricular septum. Perimembranous VSDs (pmVSDs) account for 80% of VSDs, involving the membranous septum. The membranous septum is adjacent to the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve on its right ventricular aspect and to the aortic valve on its left ventricular aspect, while its inferoposterior margin closely relates to the bundle of His and bundle branches.

Spontaneous VSD closure is common, but invasive closure is indicated in a subset. Although surgery has long been the standard approach, transcatheter options have been available for decades. The first human experience of transcatheter closure (of muscular VSDs) was reported in 1988 by Lock et al. Investigators have since explored various approaches and devices for transcatheter device VSD closure, with widely varying rates of success and risk of complications. With improvements in device technology and techniques, transcatheter VSD closure is increasingly appealing, given the associated shorter hospital stay and faster recovery. Despite this, the US Food and Drug Administration has yet to approve any device for the indication of transcatheter closure of a pmVSD.

### Subspecialty surveillance of long-term course of small and moderate muscular ventricular septal defect: Heterogenous practices, low yield [^114RvDh2]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

No expert consensus guides the practice for the intensity of ongoing pediatric cardiology surveillance of hemodynamically insignificant small and moderate muscular ventricular septal defect (mVSD). Therefore, despite the well-established benign natural history of mVSD, there is potential for widely divergent follow-up practices. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate variations in the follow-up of mVSD within an academic children's hospital-based pediatric cardiology practice and to assess the frequency of active medical or surgical management resulting from the follow-up of mVSD.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed records of 600 patients with isolated mVSD echocardiographically diagnosed between 2006 and 2012. Large mVSDs were excluded (n = 4). Patient age, gender, echocardiographic findings, provider recommendations for follow-up, and medical and surgical management were tabulated at initial and follow-up visits. Independent associations with follow-up recommendations were sought using multivariate analysis.

- **Results**: Initial echocardiography showed small single mVSD in 509 (85%), multiple small mVSD in 60 (10%), and small-to-moderate or moderate single mVSD in 31 (5%). The mean age at diagnosis was 15.9 months (ranging from 0 to 18.5 years) and 25.7 months (ranging from 0 to 18.5 years) at last follow-up. There was a slight female predominance (56.3%). Fourteen pediatric cardiology providers recommended 316 follow-up visits, 259 of which were actually accomplished. There were 37 other unplanned follow-up visits. No medical or surgical management changes were associated with any of the follow-up visits.

### Ventricular septal defect [^113wsiTQ]. Lancet (2011).

Ventricular septal defects account for up to 40% of all congenital cardiac malformations. The diagnosis encompasses a broad range of anomalies, including isolated defects and those associated with other congenital cardiac malformations. Presentation, symptoms, natural history, and management of ventricular septal defects depend on the size and anatomical associations of the anomaly, patient's age, and local diagnostic and interventional expertise. In this seminar, we describe the anatomical range of ventricular septal defects and discuss the present management of these malformations. Genetic determinants, diagnostic techniques, physiological considerations, and management challenges are examined in detail. Unfortunately, in many circumstances, evidence to guide optimum management is scarce. We present some longer-term considerations of ventricular septal defects in adolescents and adults, with particular emphasis on patients with raised pulmonary vascular resistance and Eisenmenger's syndrome.

### Prediction of spontaneous closure of ventricular septal defect and guidance for clinical follow-up [^115g4VRD]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

The process of ventricular septal defect (VSD) closure in children can be observed through echocardiography. A notable case involves a 32-day-old girl who underwent echocardiography due to a heart murmur.

- **Echocardiographic observations**:
	- At day 32, color Doppler echocardiography displayed a parasternal long-axis view of a perimembranous defect with a width of 4.0 mm.
	- At 90 days, the echocardiography showed a reduced defect in the parasternal short-axis view with a width of 3.1 mm.
	- At 8 months, the defect diminished to 2.0 mm.
	- By 14 months, the defect had spontaneously closed, and the heart murmur resolved.

- **Abbreviations**: AO (aortic), LA (left atrium), LV (left ventricular), PA (pulmonary artery), RA (right atrium), RV (right ventricular), VSD (ventricular septal defect).

- **Differences in outcomes**:
	- The differences between patients with and without spontaneous closure of perimembranous VSD were analyzed. Binary logistic regression identified defect size (P = 0.003), ATVMS (P = 0.005), and LVDD (P = 0.010) as significant indicators.

- **Logistic regression model**:
	- A model was constructed using these indicators as independent variables: Logit(P) = 7.143 − 1.438X₁ + 1.887X₂ − 0.222X₃. The likelihood ratio test yielded χ² = 70.187 (P < 0.001), indicating the model's validity. The model's prediction accuracy for the spontaneous closure of p-VSD was 75.7%, as assessed by the area under the curve, which was calculated to be 0.

### Intermediate-term clinical outcomes of primary biventricular repair for left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and ventricular septal defect [^111JF4DS]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Primary biventricular repair for left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and ventricular septal defect remains challenging. The intermediate-term outcomes and risk factors for mortality remain undefined.

- **Methods**: All patients undergoing primary biventricular repair of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and ventricular septal defect from 1995 to 2008 at the C. S. Mott Children's Hospital, University of Michigan Health Systems were analyzed.

- **Results**: Thirty-one patients (mean age, 18 days; 20 male) with a median follow-up of 6.7 years (range, 0.3–13.5 years) were identified. The ventricular septal defect was enlarged in 15 patients, and a limited atrial septal defect was constructed in 16 patients. There were 6 hospital and 2 late deaths. Ten-year patient survival was 72.3%. Lower body weight (P = 0.040), complete atrial septal defect closure (P = 0.026), and longer cardiopulmonary bypass time (P = 0.026) were risk factors for hospital mortality. An atrial septal defect was patent in 16 patients at discharge, 2 of whom required later surgical closure. Relief of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction was performed in 1 patient. No patient required pacemaker implantation. Five-year freedom from right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery conduit replacement was 39.3%. Smaller-sized conduit (P = 0.020) and use of aortic allograft (P = 0.048) were risk factors for early failure.

- **Conclusion**: Primary biventricular repair for patients with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and ventricular septal defect provides good early and intermediate-term outcomes.

### Functional capacity past age 40 in patients with congenital ventricular septal defects [^112gj4GG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Clinical studies have previously investigated young adult patients with isolated VSDs and reported lower-than-expected functional parameters, but not to the same extent as the findings. Although we compared different patient cohorts rather than conducting a follow-up study over a number of years, the equipment used and the research personnel performing the tests were unchanged, which strengthens the comparison of data. We may not be able to conclude indisputably that our findings reflect the true evolution of functional capacity in isolated VSDs; however, they clearly suggest further deterioration of parameters with increasing age — an effect that is more pronounced in patients than in age-matched healthy controls.

In the literature, only 1 long-term follow-up study, including exercise testing on VSDs, exists. In a Dutch follow-up study from 2015, 69 patients with surgically corrected VSDs and a mean age of 40 years were followed with 10-year intervals with exercise testing among other measurements. Median oxygen uptake was 87% of expected compared with undocumented reference values. In this cohort, exercise capacity decreased from 100% of expected values in 1990 to 91% of expected values in 2001. In the newest study in 2015, 48% of patients demonstrated decreased exercise capacity. Furthermore, cumulative survival in the cohort of patients with surgically closed VSDs was 86% at 40 years (excluding in-hospital operative mortality), which was slightly lower than in the background population. Interestingly, in more than half of cases, late mortality…

### Risk factors and long-term outcomes of tricuspid regurgitation after transcatheter closure of pediatric perimembranous ventricular septal defects [^1176p5p8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Low credibility.

- **Results**:

- **Study population**: After excluding 67 patients due to incomplete follow-up data, a total of 1,343 patients aged from 1 year 8 months to 18 years, with complete baseline and follow-up data and a median follow-up of 78 (range, 12–244) months, were included in this study cohort. The baseline patient characteristics and VSD-related measurements are listed in Table 1.

- **Postprocedural**: Postprocedural TR occurred in 163 patients (12.1%), comprising 143 new-onset cases and 20 cases with progression of preexisting regurgitation. Among new-onset cases, 1 was severe, 15 were moderate, and the rest were mild. Of the 20 cases with aggravated regurgitation, 1 was severe, 5 were moderate, and 14 were mild. The vast majority of TR cases (137/163) occurred within 1 day after the procedure, while the remaining 26 appeared during follow-up.

A case of severe postprocedural TR occurred in a 3-year-old girl without membranous aneurysms, who had preexisting mild TR. A 5-mm symmetrical VSD occluder was successfully deployed. Bedside TTE showed moderate TR both before and after the occluder release. On the first day after the procedure, TTE revealed enlargement of the right atrium and ventricle, severe TR, and dilation of the tricuspid annulus, with no abnormalities observed in the chordae tendineae. After 12 days of observation with no improvement, the patient underwent cardiac surgery for occluder removal, VSD repair, and tricuspid valve repair.

### Subspecialty surveillance of long-term course of small and moderate muscular ventricular septal defect: Heterogeneous practices, low yield [^111rpPJv]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

After the exclusion of four patients with large muscular ventricular septal defect (mVSD), the study population consisted of 600 patients with mVSD. None of the patients had a Swiss cheese septum. The cohort included 262 males (43.7%) and 338 females (56.3%). The mean age at diagnosis was 15.9 months (range: 0–18.5 years), and at the last follow-up, it was 25.7 months (range: 0–18.5 years). Initial echocardiography showed the following: isolated small mVSD in 509 patients (85%), multiple small mVSD in 60 patients (10%), isolated small-to-moderate mVSD in 12 patients (2%), and isolated moderate mVSD in 19 patients (3%).

### Prediction of spontaneous closure of ventricular septal defect and guidance for clinical follow-up [^113AyhL7]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

With the improvement in the sensitivity and clarity of 2D combined with color Doppler echocardiography in recent years, the detection rate of ventricular septal defect (VSD) has increased. This has both advantages and disadvantages. Echocardiographic follow-up can enhance the understanding of the natural history of VSD and assess the severity of the disease. Conversely, due to the increased detection rate, parents are anxious about VSD in children, and pediatricians face significant pressure to manage patients with VSD. Our study, which included commonly used and easily acquired factors, might help predict the spontaneous closure of VSD and assist pediatricians in selecting management schemes for children with VSD.

In this study, children with VSD were followed up to the age of 6 using echocardiography. We thoroughly studied the natural history of perimembranous VSD (p-VSD) and muscular VSD (m-VSD). We found that the prevalence of p-VSD was more common, with 74 cases (58%), than m-VSD, which had 53 cases (42%). This confirmed previous observations that the incidence of p-VSD is higher than m-VSD. Additionally, we demonstrated that the rate of spontaneous closure was 60% in VSD, with m-VSDs more likely to close easily compared to p-VSDs. This finding is similar to the conclusions of Eroglu et al. and Axt-Fliedner et al. This difference may be attributed to different closure mechanisms. P-VSD closure is thought to occur as a result of damage caused by a high-velocity jet that damages the endothelium at the edge of the VSD or the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve. Both can lead to platelet accumulation and production.

### Lifetime burden of morbidity in patients with isolated congenital ventricular septal defect [^11438t4Q]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

We lack morbidity data until the introduction of the DNPR in 1977 for both patients and controls. This limitation might potentially result in a delayed diagnosis of morbidity for a minority of the cohort and consequently an underestimation of the true HR. However, as the investigated morbidity most often debuts during adulthood, we consider that a long follow-up is paramount in this regard.

The DNPR does not include clinical data, such as data from ECGs, echocardiography, and catheterizations. The lack of clinical data is not a limitation per se, but hinders a more detailed and precise patient group stratification and limits any physiologic insights into possible causation. For example, as shunt data were unavailable, we were not able to define the unrepaired defects as small and restrictive, but can only assume that the defect was unrepaired because it was considered so. Furthermore, patients with spontaneously closed VSD are also likely to have been included in the study, given our knowledge of the natural history of such defects diagnosed in early life.

Consequently, the specific contribution of, and burden in, this subgroup of patients on the risk of morbidity is unknown. However, it further emphasizes that the late burden of morbidity is not only related to late hemodynamic burden of VSD, but is also related to the "presence" of a VSD, whether persistent or spontaneously or surgically closed. Future studies should examine the possibility that VSD is just one manifestation of a "cardiovascular phenotype" that is itself a target for mechanistic studies and possible treatment.

### Lifetime burden of morbidity in patients with isolated congenital ventricular septal defect [^113QYec1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Infants with a large VSD can present with heart failure. Otherwise, heart failure in childhood is a rare condition in patients with isolated VSD. Nonetheless, abnormal left ventricle dimensions and systolic and diastolic left ventricle dysfunction have been demonstrated in surgically closed, and even restrictive unrepaired, VSDs in patients in their early 40s. Furthermore, almost 20% of patients with small unrepaired VSDs aged over 40 years developed heart failure in a report of over 700 patients in a French study reported in 1977. Additionally, 28% of patients with closed VSDs needed medication for heart failure 30 years after surgical repair in a recently reported study of congenital heart disease outcomes in Finnish patients. Our data revealed a considerable incidence of heart failure in both patients with unrepaired defects and in those with a surgically closed defect, accelerating after the fourth or fifth decade of life.

Dissecting the data, it is obvious that patients with VSD carry a risk of heart failure not only around the time of VSD diagnosis or surgery but also many years later. Several hypotheses have been postulated as to the underlying pathogenesis. This includes an inappropriate adaption to the hemodynamics with age, a consequence of acquired cardiac morbidities, such as aortic or mitral valve regurgitation, or a consequence of chronic pressure and volume overload, leading to disturbed systolic function. Left ventricular disease as part of a diffuse cardiovascular disease unrelated to the actual defect, or an associated cardiomyopathy, has also been proposed.

### Ventricular septal defects in adults [^115qzaNM]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Congenital ventricular septal defects vary in size and location, leading to diverse clinical presentations, natural histories, and treatment options. This review discusses the common types of ventricular septal defects seen in adults based on the authors' experience and published literature. Ventricular septal defects can be isolated small defects or larger defects associated with pulmonary stenosis, pulmonary hypertension, or aortic regurgitation. These associations significantly influence the pathophysiological consequences, long-term complications, and treatment strategies. Understanding the different clinical presentations in adulthood and the specific features of these defects is crucial for the assessment and care of adult patients with this common congenital cardiac malformation.

### Prediction of spontaneous closure of ventricular septal defect and guidance for clinical follow-up [^116woCLA]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

It is well known that spontaneous closure of ventricular septal defect (VSD) can occur at any age, but most commonly occurs in childhood. According to the statistics, the mean age of closure of perimembranous ventricular septal defect (p-VSD) was 28.88 ± 15.95 months (median 24.50 months), and the mean age of closure of muscular ventricular septal defect (m-VSD) was 28.61 ± 20.14 months (median 26.20 months), indicating that spontaneous closure occurred mainly in the first three years. In a study by Yang et al, spontaneous closure of VSD in the first three years accounted for 78.50% of all spontaneous closure events, which decreased dramatically after four years of age.

Clinical management of isolated VSD is imperative because long-term persistence of defects may cause complications such as infective endocarditis, left ventricular (LV) volume overload, double-chambered right ventricle, and arrhythmia. Appropriate follow-up of patients with VSD may assist the pediatrician in understanding the patient's condition and changes in the disease. Convenient and efficient echocardiography is used to measure the predictors of the spontaneous closure of VSD. It is helpful for pediatricians to assess spontaneous closure of VSD and reduce parental anxiety. This can also help pediatricians detect complications as soon as possible, and treat children with adverse conditions promptly to improve the prognosis of patients. Our model had good discriminatory ability. The areas under the curve for predicting p-VSD and m-VSD models were 0.854 and 0.898, respectively. Based on the findings of this study, we recommend the follow-up criteria for patients with isolated VSD.

### Long-term outcome of patients with ventricular septal defect considered not to require surgical closure during childhood [^1165oJpD]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of the study was to assess the long-term outcome of patients with small ventricular septal defects (VSDs) considered not to require surgical closure during childhood.

Although patients with small VSDs have generally been considered not to require surgery, more recent data suggest that a significant percentage of these patients develop serious problems during adult life.

A total of 229 consecutive patients (115 females) with a VSD considered too small to require surgery during childhood — defined by normal pulmonary artery pressure, less than 50% shunt, pulmonary vascular resistance ≤ 200 dynes x s cm(-5), no VSD-related aortic regurgitation (AR), and no symptoms — who had no additional hemodynamically relevant heart defect were followed in an adult congenital heart disease program.

- **Physical examination, electrocardiography, and echocardiography**: Performed in all patients at one- to three-year intervals.
- **Exercise tests and Holter monitoring**: Performed in 140 and 127 patients, respectively.

Follow-up was completed in 222 patients (97%). The mean age at the last visit was 30 ± 10 years. Spontaneous VSD closure was observed in 14 patients (6%). No patients died; however, four patients (1.8%) had an episode of endocarditis, of whom two required aortic valve replacement. One additional patient (0.4%) had surgical closure for hemodynamic reasons. For 118 patients who entered the study between 1993 and 1996 and were prospectively followed for 7.4 ± 1.2 years, event-free survival included endpoints defined as death and endocarditis.

### Functional capacity past age 40 in patients with congenital ventricular septal defects [^113xhMJA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

The isolated ventricular septal defect (VSD) belongs to the simple types of congenital cardiac defects, with good surgical results for hemodynamically significant lesions and subsequent discharge from further follow-up. Treatment of patients with small, insignificant defects is conservative, and following visits in outpatient clinics for the first two decades of life, patients are usually discharged from further follow-up, although no clear consensus on this area exists. According to some earlier guidelines, neither surgically closed nor small unrepaired defects require continuous follow-up at specialized centers, reflecting that late outcome is generally considered benign. However, there is a paucity of data investigating long-term outcomes in these patients. The true burden of late morbidity may not become manifest until later in life.

Our research group has previously demonstrated a number of abnormal outcomes when young adults with congenital VSDs were compared with healthy peers. Young adults with surgically closed VSDs display impaired ventricular contractility, compromised ventilatory response, and reduced cardiac output during exercise, as well as decreased heart rate variability and altered pulmonary function at rest. Moreover, both surgically closed and unrepaired VSDs have demonstrated lower functional capacity and abnormal biventricular morphology during exercise. An increasing number of studies, both clinical and register-based, likewise note a significant burden of cardiovascular events in patients with a congenital VSD.

### Survival of patients with congenital ventricular septal defect [^1117ubBk]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

The long-term survival of patients with isolated congenital ventricular septal defect (VSD) is not well described. This study aimed to describe the survival of a national cohort of patients with VSD compared with the general population.

Using Danish nationwide medical registries, all patients diagnosed with congenital VSD (n = 9,136) in the period 1977–2018 were included. Patients with chromosomal abnormalities and concomitant congenital cardiac malformations, other than atrial septal defect, were excluded. Each patient was matched by birth year and sex with ten controls from the general Danish population. Kaplan−Meier survival function and Cox proportional hazard regression were used to compute survival and mortality risk. The median follow-up was 22 years (interquartile range: 11–37). VSD patients displayed lower survival (P < 0.001), yielding a hazard ratio (HR) for mortality of 2.7 [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.4–3.0] compared with matched controls.

- **Mortality risk**: The adjusted HR for mortality among patients with unrepaired VSD was 2.7 (95% CI: 2.4–3.0) and 2.8 (95% CI: 2.1–3.7) for patients with surgically closed VSD. Stratified by era of VSD diagnosis, the HR for mortality was 3.2 (95% CI: 2.8–3.7) for unrepaired patients diagnosed before 1990 and 2.4 (95% CI: 2.0–2.7) for patients diagnosed later. Cardiac-related death was the most common cause of death among unrepaired (30%) and surgically closed (65%) patients.

Patients with VSD had lower survival compared with the general population. The HR for mortality was increased over 2.5.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) is the most common adult congenital heart defect and can present with a wide variation in clinical findings. With the intention of preventing morbidity and mortality associated with the late presentation of ASD, consensus guidelines have recommended surgical or percutaneous ASD closure in adults with right heart enlargement, with or without symptoms. The aim of the present analysis was to determine if the protective effect of secundum ASD closure in adults could be qualified by pooling data from published studies.

A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed using EMBASE, MEDLINE (through PubMed), and the Cochrane Library databases to assess the effect of secundum ASD percutaneous or surgical closure in unoperated adults ≥ 18 years of age. Data were pooled across studies with the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model or a Bayesian meta-analysis model. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed with Cochran's Q test. Bias assessment was performed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, and statistical risk of bias was assessed with Begg and Mazumdar's test and Egger's test.

A total of 11 nonrandomized studies met the inclusion criteria, contributing 603 patients. Pooled analysis showed a protective effect of ASD closure on New York Heart Association functional class, right ventricular systolic pressure, volumes, and dimensions. Two additional studies comprising 652 patients were reviewed separately for mortality outcomes and the primary outcome of interest because they did not meet the inclusion criteria.

- **Methods**: Fetal echocardiographic examinations for pregnant women referred to our obstetrical ultrasound unit at the Shamir Medical Center were collected retrospectively from January 1, 2015, to May 31, 2021. Inclusion criteria were women with a singleton pregnancy where the perimembranous ventricular septal defect (pVSD) was the only abnormal fetal finding. All women were subjected to at least two fetal echocardiograms, and the newborns were followed postnatally within the first month of life with at least one echocardiogram. These women were offered genetic counseling and evaluation. Patient demographics and clinical information were retrieved from medical records and computerized patient management software. Postnatal clinical outcomes were obtained through routine follow-up using telephone interviews. The parents were asked about the cognitive development, general physical health of their child, and specifically whether there was a need for surgical intervention due to the pVSD.

- **Echocardiographic parameters**: Fetal echocardiography was performed by a single senior certified pediatric cardiologist specializing in fetal and pediatric cardiology, who also reviewed all the prenatal echo exams for this study. Ultrasound scans were performed trans-abdominally with an E10 system (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). Perimembranous ventricular septal defects were demonstrated by greyscale and color Doppler using at least two standard views.
