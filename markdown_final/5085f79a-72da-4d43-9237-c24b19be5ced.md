## Question

What is the recommended treatment for refractory allergic conjunctivitis in an annoying nurse?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the recommended treatment for refractory allergic conjunctivitis in an "annoying" nurse. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "refractory" means and whether prior standard therapies have already been optimized. Then, I should verify which guideline-supported escalation options have the best evidence for efficacy and safety. Next, I will consider adherence and dosing burden given the practical constraints of a nurse's schedule. Finally, I need to outline monitoring, adverse effects, and a clear, low-burden plan with disease‑modifying options if needed.

> Let me first confirm the scenario details. "Refractory" allergic conjunctivitis generally implies persistent or severe symptoms despite dual‑action topical antihistamine/mast‑cell stabilizers and short, carefully limited steroid pulses for flares. Wait, the phrase "annoying nurse" looks atypical; I initially thought it meant "adult nurse", but hold on, I should not jump to conclusions — the more clinically relevant interpretation is a busy, likely annoyed patient in healthcare who needs effective therapy with minimal drop burden, which will influence the choice of longer‑acting or drop‑sparing options.

> Next, I should review the guideline‑based treatment hierarchy before escalating. Standard care uses topical antihistamines with mast‑cell–stabilizing activity, with short courses of low‑potency topical corticosteroids reserved for acute exacerbations due to well‑known risks of IOP elevation and cataract with prolonged use; this informs why "refractory" disease requires steroid‑sparing escalation rather than chronic steroids. I need to ensure first‑line has truly been optimized, including consideration of once‑daily agents for adherence, before labeling a case as refractory [^1154NSKo] [^117YCyuQ] [^116ccxXX].

> Now, I will examine steroid‑sparing immunomodulators. The AAO recommends considering topical cyclosporine for severe allergic, vernal, or atopic forms, and suggests topical tacrolimus for severe or steroid‑dependent disease; I should confirm their role precisely in "refractory" cases. Tacrolimus 0.1% twice daily demonstrated significant reductions in signs and symptoms, including corneal involvement and giant papillae, and enabled about half of steroid‑dependent patients to wean off steroids, which is directly relevant to a refractory phenotype. Let me double‑check: yes, these are appropriate next‑line choices when antihistamine/mast‑cell stabilizers and intermittent steroids are insufficient, with tacrolimus supported by large prospective data for refractory disease [^116XvM4c] [^1138bV9j] [^1138bV9j] [^115V8ctM].

> But wait, adherence remains crucial in a nurse with limited time for drops. I should consider sustained‑release steroid delivery that avoids self‑instillation. Dexamethasone intracanalicular insert (DEXTENZA) provides approximately 30 days of tapered steroid exposure and has shown superiority to vehicle in phase 3 trials, positive pooled RCT meta‑analytic data on itch and redness, and real‑world preference and better outcomes versus topical loteprednol, with efficacy similar to a topical antihistamine/mast‑cell stabilizer. Hold on, I should verify safety: across RCTs, adverse event rates were similar to placebo, but steroid risks still mandate IOP monitoring; nevertheless, for a busy clinician‑patient, this drop‑sparing option is highly pragmatic [^112KecqA] [^112Qn4Py] [^115mBKDb].

> Let me consider disease modification. For patients with persistent rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms despite pharmacotherapy, allergen immunotherapy (SCIT or SLIT) reduces symptoms and medication use and is endorsed by guidelines through shared decision‑making, especially when medication burden or control is problematic. I should confirm the ocular component is included — yes, recommendations for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis extend to ocular symptoms and are recognized by ophthalmic guidance as well, with pediatric evidence stronger but adult benefit still meaningful in practice [^111rAJqm] [^113QTJnB] [^113a27BG].

> Synthesis for this busy nurse now: I would maintain or initiate a once‑daily dual‑action antihistamine/mast‑cell stabilizer to cover immediate and late‑phase reactions, reassessing after a short interval for control. If flaring, I would use a brief, low‑potency topical steroid pulse to gain rapid control, then transition off to avoid chronic steroid exposure. If control remains inadequate or recurs, I would escalate to a topical immunomodulator such as cyclosporine or, when more refractory or steroid‑dependent, tacrolimus 0.1% twice daily given its strong data in difficult disease. If adherence to drops is the barrier — or if frequent instillation is impractical — I would place a dexamethasone intracanalicular insert to deliver one month of therapy without daily drops, aligning efficacy with the patient's workflow [^117YCyuQ] [^116ccxXX] [^1138bV9j] [^112KecqA].

> I should confirm safety monitoring and follow‑up. With any steroid exposure, including an intracanalicular insert, I need baseline and early follow‑up intraocular pressure checks, watching for steroid response. While on calcineurin inhibitors, I will reassess the ocular surface at intervals for tolerability and corneal status; tacrolimus can cause transient burning, which I should counsel about. Hold on, I should verify frequency: early IOP assessment within the first few weeks is prudent and consistent with steroid risk management in ophthalmic practice [^116ccxXX] [^1138bV9j].

> I will now reinforce supportive and avoidance strategies that reduce overall inflammatory load. Cold compresses and preservative‑free lubricants can help symptoms and protect the ocular surface, while environmental modification and allergen avoidance lessen triggers and may reduce medication needs. I need to ensure these measures are emphasized even in refractory cases as adjuncts to pharmacologic therapy [^1112uF8z] [^111QnCkC].

> Bottom line, after verifying guideline consistency and practical constraints: for refractory allergic conjunctivitis in a busy nurse, optimize or initiate a once‑daily dual‑action antihistamine/mast‑cell stabilizer, use a short steroid pulse only for acute flares, escalate to a topical immunomodulator such as cyclosporine or tacrolimus for steroid‑sparing control, and strongly consider a dexamethasone intracanalicular insert when adherence to drops is problematic; incorporate allergen immunotherapy for persistent rhinoconjunctivitis despite optimal topical therapy, and monitor IOP with any steroid exposure [^117YCyuQ] [^116XvM4c] [^112KecqA] [^111rAJqm].

---

For resistant allergic conjunctivitis, escalate to **topical calcineurin inhibitors** [^115V8ctM] (cyclosporine 0.05–0.1% or tacrolimus 0.03–0.1% twice daily) [^1138bV9j] for steroid-sparing control [^1138bV9j] [^116XvM4c], and use **short-course topical corticosteroids** (loteprednol or fluorometholone) for acute flares [^116ccxXX] with close IOP monitoring. Add **allergen immunotherapy** (SCIT/SLIT) for persistent symptoms despite maximal topical therapy [^113QTJnB], and consider a dexamethasone intracanalicular insert (DEXTENZA) [^112Qn4Py] for sustained relief [^112R1Y3c]. Support with cold compresses [^1112uF8z], preservative-free lubricants, and strict allergen avoidance [^111QnCkC]; refer to ophthalmology for corneal involvement or steroid dependence [^notfound].

## Pharmacological management

### Topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers

For topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers, **first-line therapy** [^1154NSKo] uses dual-action agents (olopatadine, ketotifen, alcaftadine, bepotastine) for rapid itch relief and mast cell stabilization [^117YCyuQ] [^115XUFL2]. However, their **limitations** are evident in resistant cases, where they may be insufficient alone, necessitating escalation [^111wZqCy].

---

### Topical corticosteroids

For topical corticosteroids, the **indication** is short courses (≤ 2 weeks) [^116ccxXX] for acute flares or severe inflammation, with monitoring of IOP and cataract risk [^112R1Y3c]. Preferred agents are **loteprednol or fluorometholone** for lower IOP risk [^116ccxXX].

---

### Topical calcineurin inhibitors

For topical calcineurin inhibitors, **cyclosporine** 0.05–0.1% twice daily [^115V8ctM] provides steroid-sparing control in severe or chronic disease [^116XvM4c]. **Tacrolimus** 0.03–0.1% twice daily is used for refractory cases, including proliferative lesions or corneal involvement [^112E4fiD] [^1138bV9j].

---

### Systemic antihistamines and leukotriene receptor antagonists

For systemic antihistamines and leukotriene receptor antagonists, **systemic antihistamines** can be added for significant systemic allergy symptoms [^112FVUn4]. Leukotriene receptor antagonists, such as **montelukast**, may be considered for coexisting allergic rhinitis or asthma [^111WwGv3] [^116audpU].

---

### Allergen immunotherapy

For allergen immunotherapy, the **indication** is **SCIT or SLIT** for persistent symptoms despite maximal topical therapy [^113QTJnB], with greater effectiveness in pediatric patients [^115D33mv].

---

### Novel therapies

Among novel therapies, the **dexamethasone intracanalicular insert (DEXTENZA)** provides sustained corticosteroid delivery for up to 30 days [^112KecqA] and is effective in reducing itching and redness [^112Qn4Py]. **Intense pulsed light (IPL)** is an emerging adjunct for refractory cases, particularly with meibomian gland dysfunction.

---

## Non-pharmacological management

- **Allergen avoidance**: Environmental modifications to reduce exposure [^111QnCkC].

- **Cold compresses and lubricants**: Symptom relief and ocular surface protection [^1112uF8z].

- **Eye hygiene**: Regular lid hygiene to reduce allergen load [^1112uF8z].

---

## Indications for ophthalmology referral

- **Corneal involvement**: Shield ulcers, keratitis, or vision-threatening disease.

- **Steroid dependence**: Need for prolonged corticosteroids.

- **Refractory disease**: Persistent symptoms despite maximal therapy [^114ZswsT].

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Step** | **Treatment** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Topical antihistamines/mast cell stabilizers | First-line therapy |
| 2 | Short-course topical corticosteroids | Acute flares/severe inflammation |
| 3 | Topical calcineurin inhibitors | Steroid-sparing control |
| 4 | Systemic antihistamines/leukotriene antagonists | Significant systemic symptoms |
| 5 | Allergen immunotherapy | Persistent symptoms |
| 6 | Novel therapies (DEXTENZA, IPL) | Refractory cases |

---

Resistant allergic conjunctivitis requires a **stepwise approach**, escalating from dual-action antihistamines to corticosteroids and then to calcineurin inhibitors, with immunotherapy and novel options for persistent disease [^112E4fiD]. Close monitoring and **ophthalmology referral** are essential for complications or steroid dependence [^114ZswsT].

### Dextenza versus topical steroid or antihistamine therapy for treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^112R1Y3c]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

Allergic conjunctivitis is a common cause of ocular itching, conjunctival hyperemia, and watering and can be triggered by both seasonal and perennial allergens. Its prevalence has been estimated at up to 40%. The condition negatively impacts quality of life and work productivity.

The pathophysiology of allergic conjunctivitis involves immune responses mediated by histamine and mast cells. Treatment consists of antihistamines for immediate relief and mast-cell stabilizers for long-term control. Corticosteroids can be used for short periods to manage acute flares, but safety issues such as elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and cataract formation limit long-term use. Recently, Dextenza, a 0.4 mg dexamethasone intracanalicular insert (Ocular Therapeutix, Bedford, MA), has been approved for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. It is also approved for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain following ocular surgery.

The dexamethasone intracanalicular insert is a rod-shaped depot of 0.4 mg preservative-free dexamethasone encapsulated within polyethylene glycol-based hydrogel that expands after contact with fluid to occlude the punctum and secure its placement. Fluorescein is conjugated to the hydrogel to enable visualization. The insert delivers a sustained and tapered dose of dexamethasone to the ocular surface for up to 30 days and resorbs completely.

In Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, the dexamethasone insert relieved ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis more effectively than placebo when evaluated using a mo.

### Therapeutic effects of 0.1% tacrolimus eye drops for refractory allergic ocular diseases with proliferative lesion or corneal involvement [^1138bV9j]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of topical 0.1% tacrolimus in treating refractory allergic conjunctivitis with proliferative lesions and/or corneal involvement.

- **Methods**: This prospective observational study included 1,436 patients with refractory allergic conjunctivitis whose condition had responded poorly to conventional antiallergic drugs and/or topical steroids and/or topical cyclosporine. All patients received tacrolimus eye drops twice daily during the study period. Ten clinical signs and six clinical symptoms were rated on a four-grade scale. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in total clinical signs and symptoms score at the last observation or following 6 months of treatment.

- **Results**: Total signs and symptoms score significantly decreased after 1 month of treatment (p < 0.001). Giant papillae and corneal lesions were also reduced by tacrolimus eye drop use (p < 0.001). The drug proved effective in patients whose condition did not respond well to topical cyclosporine therapy. About 50% of all patients using topical steroids were weaned. The most common adverse reaction was a transient burning sensation (3.20%).

- **Conclusions**: Tacrolimus eye drops are highly effective in treating refractory allergic conjunctivitis with proliferative lesions and/or corneal involvement, and may reduce or replace topical steroid use.

### Update and clinical utility of alcaftadine ophthalmic solution 0.25% in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^117P2bzk]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

The conjunctivae are highly vascularized and immunologically active semitransparent mucous membranes that line the globe. The conjunctiva consists of two layers: epithelium and the substantia propria (conjunctival stroma). The conjunctival epithelium is a nonkeratinized mucosal tissue with mucin-secreting goblet cells and intraepithelial leukocytes. The substantia propria is composed of vascular connective tissue with lymphatics, immune cells, and nonimmune cells.

The normal conjunctiva has neutrophils and intraepithelial lymphocytes in the epithelium and the substantia propria. However, macrophages and mast cells are present in the substantia propria but absent in the normal conjunctival epithelium. Eosinophils are not normally found in either the epithelium or the substantia propria. The conjunctiva has an abundance of Langerhans' cells that initiate allergen-induced immune response when these antigen-presenting cells encounter an allergen on the conjunctiva.

The immune cells, such as lymphocytes, distributed over the conjunctiva form a mucosal immune system known as the conjunctiva-associated lymphoid tissue (CALT). CALT is a component of the eye-associated lymphoid tissue, which consists of organized lymphoid tissue made up predominantly of lymphocytes. In normal conjunctiva, the mast cells are concentrated in the substantia propria. Immunohistochemical staining is the basis for characterizing the human mast cell as either tryptase-containing (mucosal mast cell) or tryptase/chymase-containing.

### Vernal keratoconjunctivitis [^1175xtke]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

There is currently no defined gold-standard treatment algorithm for vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC), but many options are available, and treatment should be tailored to the individual. Whatever treatment regimen is prescribed, it should be initiated promptly, and the patient should be monitored closely for the development of any corneal complications.

A Cochrane review by Mantelli et al. included 27 randomized controlled trials encompassing 2,184 eyes in an effort to evaluate topical therapies for the treatment of VKC. They found that all common antiallergic eye drops are effective in reducing signs and symptoms of the disease and that some patients even respond to placebo. A critical initial component of all allergic disease involves avoidance of inciting factors. Patients should be encouraged to wash hands frequently and avoid touching or rubbing their eyes. Cold compresses and artificial tears may help to alleviate symptoms in mild cases or as adjunctive therapy to pharmacologic treatment.

First-line pharmacologic therapy for VKC is topical treatment, and there is considerable therapeutic overlap with other forms of allergic conjunctivitis. Mast cell stabilizers are a mainstay for prophylaxis. In milder cases, antihistamines may be of benefit, but more severe cases may require corticosteroid treatment. Long-term steroid use is associated with many complications, so other immunomodulatory treatments have been studied extensively.

- **Mast cell stabilizers**: Mast cell stabilizers are thought to prevent mast cell degranulation via inhibition of calcium channels.

### The efficacy and safety of dexamethasone intracanalicular insert use in patients with chronic seasonal/perennial allergic conjunctivitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115C487g]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

The management of allergic conjunctivitis necessitates a multifaceted approach involving both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Initial measures focus on avoiding environmental irritants to minimize exposure and subsequent allergic reactions. Pharmacological management includes both prophylactic and therapeutic medications, administered via topical ocular drops or systemic routes. Prophylactic drugs, such as sodium cromoglycate and nedocromil, function as mast cell stabilizers, exerting their effect by blocking the release of inflammatory mediators, thereby preventing the onset of symptoms. Symptomatic relief is achieved through the use of decongestants, including astringents (e.g. silver nitrate or zinc sulfate), vessel vasoconstrictors (alpha and beta sympathomimetics), or antihistamines (e.g. astemizole or cetirizine). These medications work by reducing conjunctival congestion, constricting blood vessels, and inhibiting histamine-mediated allergic responses. Furthermore, anti-inflammatory drugs such as NSAIDs and corticosteroids play a key role in reducing inflammation and suppressing immune-mediated responses. These agents act by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory mediators and modulating the immune response, thereby alleviating symptoms and promoting ocular comfort.

Corticosteroids are effective for allergic reactions by inhibiting the production of inflammatory substances such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, reducing inflammatory cells, and suppressing mast cell proliferation. These pleiotropic actions make corticosteroids a valuable therapeutic option in managing allergic conjunctivitis.

### Pooled analysis of two studies evaluating efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis [^114YtKzx]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017).

Allergic conjunctivitis, caused by an immunoglobulin E-mediated inflammatory reaction to an allergen, is the most common form of ocular allergy. Several epidemiological reports estimate its prevalence ranging from 15% to 20% worldwide, depending on the geographic location and patients' age. According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III data, annually, approximately 40% of the population in the US has at least one occurrence of ocular symptoms indicative of allergic conjunctivitis, with the most common being ocular itching, redness, eyelid swelling, chemosis, and tearing.

Several treatment options with different mechanisms of action are available for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. Olopatadine, an antiallergic agent, exhibits its effects through selective antagonism of histamine H1 receptors, mast cell stabilization, and prevention of histamine-induced inflammatory cytokine production.

Olopatadine HCl ophthalmic solution at concentrations of 0.1% and 0.2% (Patanol ® and Pataday ®, respectively; Alcon Research Ltd, Fort Worth, TX, USA) has been approved for the management of allergic conjunctivitis in over 100 countries, including the US and Canada, as twice-daily and once-daily treatments, respectively. Once-daily doses of olopatadine 0.2% and alcaftadine 0.25% reduce signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis for no more than 16 hours.

Despite the efficacy of available formulations of olopatadine and other topical ocular antiallergy treatments, there is a need for products that address the incomplete symptom relief and/or provide longer duration of action.

### Clinical trials in allergic conjunctivitis: A systematic review [^115XneoP]. Allergy (2011). Low credibility.

Ocular allergy represents one of the most common conditions encountered by allergists and ophthalmologists. However, there is wide variability in study designs in clinical trials of allergic conjunctivitis, resulting in conflicting evidence on optimal management. We conducted a systematic review of clinical trials to critically evaluate their quality and highlight biases to be avoided in future clinical research in ocular allergy.

- **Methods**: Clinical trials in allergic conjunctivitis performed since 1965 were retrieved. Data on patients, interventions, comparison of interventions, and outcomes were extracted. Four authors independently assessed articles for inclusion in the systematic review and evaluated the quality of trials using the Jadad scale.

- **Results**: Three hundred and sixty-two trials were included in the study. Only a minority of trials fulfilled all the criteria of proper clinical trial design. In most studies, there was a very limited use of objective (quantifiable) parameters for both patient selection and evaluation of drug efficacy and safety. Several outcomes of primary importance, such as disease relapses and recurrence rate, were omitted in clinical trials of allergic conjunctivitis.

- **Conclusions**: Evidence from clinical trials in ocular allergy is limited, affecting the strength of recommendations to healthcare providers and policymakers for optimal management. Standardized diagnostic criteria for patient selection and quantifiable primary outcomes are recommended to improve the design of future clinical trials.

### Dextenza versus topical steroid or antihistamine therapy for treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^115mBKDb]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Overall, this real-world study demonstrated that the dexamethasone intracanalicular insert was preferred over topical therapy and was as effective as a topical antihistamine/mast cell stabilizer, and more effective than topical steroids, in relieving the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. This insert should be considered as an alternative to topical therapy for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. Larger head-to-head trials of therapies for allergic conjunctivitis can further clarify the roles of these agents in disease management.

### Phase III trials examining the efficacy of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% compared to vehicle for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis in the conjunctival allergen challenge model [^114yLcWL]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Most of the approved treatments for ocular allergies are antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers, or both, and act to reduce the signs and symptoms of the early-phase reaction. Cetirizine hydrochloride (Zyrtec®; Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.; New Brunswick, NJ, USA) is the number one oral antihistamine allergy treatment recommended by allergists. Cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% used in these studies was a sterile, buffered, clear, colorless aqueous solution containing cetirizine 0.24% (equivalent to cetirizine hydrochloride 0.29%) and 0.010% benzalkonium chloride (preservative).

Cetirizine hydrochloride selectively inhibits H1 histamine receptors to treat seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, idiopathic urticaria, and itching due to chronic hives and has a long-standing record of approval in different formulations. Cetirizine hydrochloride is safe and well tolerated and was approved in tablet form (5 and 10 mg) in the United States in 1995, as a syrup formulation in 1996, for children aged 2–5 years in 1998, for children aged 6 months and older in 2002, and for non-prescription use as a chewable tablet and syrup in 2007. The long-standing therapeutic success and safety of cetirizine hydrochloride in different formulations and pronounced ocular symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis supported the development of cetirizine hydrochloride as an ophthalmic solution to combat the ocular effects of allergic conjunctivitis.

In 2018, cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% (Zerviate™) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ocular itch associated with allergic conjunctivitis.

### A randomized, multicenter phase 3 clinical trial evaluating intracanalicular dexamethasone insert for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^112KecqA]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Allergic conjunctivitis is an inflammatory-mediated disorder induced by seasonal or perennial allergens and affects up to approximately 40% of the general United States (US) population. However, it is often underdiagnosed and undertreated due to its association with other disorders such as dry eye disease and allergic rhinitis. Two of the most common symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis are itching and redness. For patients with moderate to severe symptoms, there is a detrimental impact on quality of life.

Several studies have examined the impact of allergic conjunctivitis on patients' quality of life. In a study of 220 patients with ocular allergy, nearly half rated their disease severity of at least 6 on a scale of 1 to 10; moreover, patient-reported quality of life significantly declined during allergic conjunctivitis episodes (P < 0.001). A study of more than 1000 patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis found that allergic conjunctivitis was associated with a decrease in productivity, illustrated by an impairment while working and an increase in hours of work missed.

Treatment options for allergic conjunctivitis include topical antihistamines, which have a rapid onset and short duration of action, and topical mast-cell stabilizers, which require a long loading period. Topical corticosteroids are effective in both the early and late phases of the allergic response but are generally limited to a short course (1–2 weeks) for patients with more severe or persistent symptoms due to the potential for misuse or abuse of steroids, which can lead to complications.

### Undertreatment of allergy: Exploring the utility of sublingual immunotherapy [^1167gcnX]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Allergic syndromes are highly prevalent and comprise a wide variety of clinical problems, including rhinitis, conjunctivitis, atopic dermatitis, urticaria, asthma, and food allergies. Numerous studies have shown that allergic syndromes are both underdiagnosed and undertreated. This is linked to factors such as the trivialization of allergic conditions by physicians and patients, failure to adhere to diagnostic and treatment guidelines, and dissatisfaction with conventional pharmacologic treatments.

Immunotherapy involves the administration of allergen extracts to induce immunologic tolerance and has been used for treating allergic syndromes and preventing long-term complications. Conventional subcutaneous immunotherapy is effective but carries a risk of serious adverse events, requires administration by a trained health care professional, and is contraindicated in certain populations. In contrast, sublingual immunotherapy has been extensively used in Europe and possesses most of the benefits of subcutaneous immunotherapy, along with increased safety, tolerability, and convenience.

This narrative review explores data from selected clinical studies and concludes that sublingual immunotherapy may be well-suited to address the gap posed by the undertreatment of allergic syndromes in the United States.

### Efficacy of N-acetyl aspartyl glutamic acid versus fluorometholone for treating allergic conjunctivitis in an environmental exposure chamber [^113YnMqR]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

The estimated prevalence of allergic conjunctivitis is 15%–20% in general populations of developed countries and 40%–60% among individuals with allergies. The signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis are mostly benign, but they significantly impact quality of life. Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC) occurs in 55% of allergic ocular pathologies, including perennial allergic conjunctivitis, vernal keratoconjunctivitis, lid skin involvement, and keratitis. In central and northern Europe, SAC is most frequently triggered by birch pollen. SAC is a type I hypersensitivity response to airborne allergens, with mast cell degranulation and the release of histamine, prostaglandins, tryptases, and leukotrienes. Histamine causes ocular pruritus, the main symptom of allergic conjunctivitis. Other symptoms include tearing, redness, and swollen eyelids.

Patients with SAC are commonly prescribed a local anti-allergy treatment that includes mast cell stabilizers and antihistamine eye drops to improve the symptoms and quality of life. The gold standard for establishing the efficacy and safety of an anti-allergy treatment is a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study. However, field studies are challenging because environmental humidity, air pressure, and temperature are difficult to control. Moreover, during the pollen season, variations in pollen concentrations can lead to widely variable symptoms. Consequently, a large cohort is required to obtain significant results on treatment efficacy. The European Medicines Agency previously considered conjunctival provocation.

### A randomized, multicenter phase 3 clinical trial evaluating intracanalicular dexamethasone insert for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^112avBPu]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

The dexamethasone insert is a preservative-free steroid treatment. Exposure to preservatives in topical ocular therapies may be associated with a compromised ocular surface due to dry eye disease and inflammatory irritation. The most common ophthalmic antimicrobial preservative utilized is benzalkonium chloride (BAK), which is associated with discomfort and pain following instillation, as well as ocular surface toxicity, conjunctival hyperemia, decreased tear production, tear film instability, and superficial punctate keratitis. There are currently no other commercially available preservative-free ophthalmic steroid therapy options for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.

Untreated allergic conjunctivitis can result in ocular complications, underscoring the need for safe, effective treatments for allergic conjunctivitis. Eye rubbing due to ocular itching is associated with corneal ectasia, including keratoconus, which can lead to acute corneal hydrops, corneal perforation, corneal scarring, and vision loss. Potential complications associated with untreated allergic conjunctivitis are detrimental to quality of life, especially for individuals who have concomitant dry eye disease. Concomitant dry eye disease is common in individuals with allergic conjunctivitis, and future studies in this population are needed. The two conditions interact with each other, and the symptoms of dry eye disease may exacerbate the itching, redness, and chemosis experienced during allergen challenge in subjects with allergic conjunctivitis.

### Conjunctivitis: A systematic review of diagnosis and treatment [^1138Wf4y]. JAMA (2013). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on infectious conjunctivitis:

- **Definition**: Infectious conjunctivitis is the inflammation of the conjunctiva caused by bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens.

- **Pathophysiology**: Viruses account for 80% of all cases of acute conjunctivitis, with most cases caused by adenoviruses. Other viral causes include HSV, VZV, EBV, influenza, enterovirus, and coxsackievirus. Bacterial conjunctivitis is commonly caused by *S. aureus*, *S. pneumoniae*, and *H. influenzae*. Ophthalmia neonatorum is typically caused by *C. trachomatis* or *N. gonorrhoeae*. Fungal conjunctivitis is rare and usually occurs in immunocompromised patients.

- **Epidemiology**: It is estimated that approximately 6 million cases of acute conjunctivitis occur annually in the US.

- **Risk factors**: These include close contact with infected individuals, poor hand hygiene, use of contaminated contact lenses, and exposure to contaminated water.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, infectious conjunctivitis presents with redness, itching, tearing, discharge, and crusting. Bacterial conjunctivitis often presents with purulent discharge, while viral conjunctivitis usually has a watery discharge and may be associated with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms. Fungal conjunctivitis may present with chronic, indolent symptoms.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Most cases of infectious conjunctivitis are self-limiting, lasting 1–2 weeks. Mild bacterial conjunctivitis typically resolves spontaneously without specific treatment in immunocompetent adults.

### Update and clinical utility of alcaftadine ophthalmic solution 0.25% in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^115HQn6P]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Allergic disorders of the ocular surface are primarily characterized as IgE- and/or T-lymphocyte-mediated disorders that affect the cornea, conjunctiva, and eyelid. Approximately 40% of individuals in developed countries have allergic conjunctivitis, making it the most common form of ocular allergy. Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis is the most prevalent type and significantly impacts the quality of life of patients. This article reviews the pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical trials, clinical efficacy, and safety of alcaftadine. Histamine and the pathological mechanism of ocular allergy are briefly reviewed to provide a background for the detailed discussion on the clinical utility of alcaftadine in allergic conjunctivitis.

The Medline PubMed, Elsevier Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases were used to search for evidence-based literature on histamine and the immunopathological mechanism of allergic conjunctivitis, as well as on the pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical trials, and clinical efficacy of alcaftadine. The treatment and management goals of allergic conjunctivitis are to prevent or minimize the inflammatory cascade associated with allergic response in the early stages of the pathological mechanism. It is noteworthy that activation of histamine receptors on immune and non-immune cells is associated with allergen-induced inflammation of the conjunctiva and its associated ocular allergic manifestations, including itching, edema, hyperemia, and tearing.

### Sublingual immunotherapy for treating allergic conjunctivitis [^1127AmKB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Allergic ocular symptoms, although frequently trivialized, are common and represent an important comorbidity of allergic rhinitis. Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for allergic rhinitis, but its effects on ocular allergy symptoms have not been well established.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy of SLIT compared with placebo for reductions in ocular symptoms, topical ocular medication requirements, and conjunctival immediate allergen sensitivity.

- **Search strategy**: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1950 to January 2011), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2011), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to January 2011), Web of Science (January 1970 to January 2011), Biosis Previews (January 1979 to January 2011), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com) (January 2011), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) (January 2011), the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) (www.actr.org.au) (July 2010), SCOPUS (November 2008), and the UK Clinical Trials Gateway (January 2010). There were no language or date restrictions in the search for trials. All electronic databases, except for SCOPUS, the UK Clinical Trials Gateway, and ANZCTR, were last searched on 19 January 2011.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), double-masked and placebo-controlled, which evaluated the efficacy of SLIT in patients with symptoms.

### Update and clinical utility of alcaftadine ophthalmic solution 0.25% in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^113hfRa1]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Eleven clinical studies were submitted as part of the FDA approval application for alcaftadine 0.25%, including three randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled studies. Additionally, published clinical studies have displayed the clinical efficacy and safety of the drop. Each published study utilized the conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) model.

The CAC model is a well-utilized study design to evaluate antiallergy medications in a controlled environment. The CAC has been employed as a study model for over 20 years and utilized as a standard clinical method by the FDA in evaluating allergic diseases. The typical CAC format includes two baseline visits. The first visit allows the investigators to titrate the allergen dose to achieve the desired clinical response. The second visit then confirms the initial titration results.

Patients who demonstrate reproducible results and the desired clinical response proceed to a third visit. During the third and fourth visits of the study, the onset and duration of action are measured by administering the medication (active ingredient) and comparative agents (placebo and comparator) followed by challenging the patient with the appropriate dose of allergen. Ocular allergy manifestations including hyperemia, chemosis, and pruritus are then evaluated.

The patient rates the itch symptoms on a scale from 0 (least symptomatic) to 4 (most symptomatic). Study personnel utilize the same scale to rate ocular redness and chemosis signs of allergic conjunctivitis. The onset can be measured within minutes after drug administration.

### Efficacy and toxicity evaluation of bepotastine besilate 1.5% preservative-free eye drops vs olopatadine hydrochloride 0.2% BAK-preserved eye drops in patients with allergic conjunctivitis [^112cXZUB]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Allergic conjunctivitis (AC) is the most common allergic ocular disorder, affecting approximately 20% of the global population. The prevalence of AC is region-dependent and appears to be increasing worldwide. This pathology is associated with seasonal pollen sensitivity, although perennial forms are associated with exposure to animal dander, mites, and molds. AC is a type-1, IgE-mediated hypersensitivity immune reaction that occurs in individuals previously exposed to a specific allergen. The immune response involves the release of inflammatory mediators, including histamine, leukotrienes, bradykinin, prostaglandins, proteases, and cytokines, which contribute to the development of signs and symptoms. Histamines from degranulated mast cells are the principal immune mediators related to early allergic responses. This molecule binds to receptors (H1, H2, H3, and H4) on vascular endothelial cells, neuronal fibers, goblet cells, immune cells, and conjunctival epithelium, culminating in clinical manifestations of allergic conjunctivitis including redness, periocular swelling, chemosis, itching, and tearing. This is followed by a late phase that is manifested by pro-inflammatory mediators and the recruitment of immune cells, including eosinophils and neutrophils.

The keystone of the treatments is histamine antagonists (also called antihistamines), which inhibit the action of histamine by blocking histamine receptors and, consequently, inhibiting clinical manifestations related to this mediator. Mast cell stabilizers inhibit mast cell degranulation and, consequently, the release of inflammatory mediators.

### Update and clinical utility of alcaftadine ophthalmic solution 0.25% in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^1117Ui2E]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Mean ocular itching was the single primary endpoint in this study. Secondary endpoints — conjunctival redness, chemosis, lid swelling, and tearing — were also measured. An allergen challenge was performed during visit 1, in which subjects received bilateral ocular instillation of antigen followed by subject-reported itch 10 minutes after administration. The same scoring criteria utilized by Torkildsen and Shedden, as described above, were employed in this study. Allergen concentrations were then titrated until the subjects reported scores of ≥ 2, and conjunctival redness was graded by investigators at ≥ 2. An allergen challenge was performed at visit 2 for baseline data, and subjects scored their ocular itching at 3 minutes, 5 minutes, and 7 minutes. Secondary endpoints were assessed at 7 minutes, 15 minutes, and 20 minutes after allergen instillation.

Subjects who met the screening criteria of ≥ 2 for both ocular itching and conjunctival redness continued to the third visit. Subjects were randomized at visit 3a and received one drop bilaterally of masked treatment. Visit 3b consisted of an allergen challenge 16 hours after the drop administration. Ocular itching was subjectively graded at 3 minutes, 5 minutes, and 7 minutes after the allergen was introduced. Secondary endpoints were assessed at 7 minutes, 15 minutes, and 20 minutes. Investigators evaluated conjunctival, ciliary, and episcleral redness in addition to chemosis, whereas subjects reported lid swelling and tearing scores. Visit 4a occurred 14 days (± 3 days) later, and masked drops were again instilled.

### ICON: Diagnosis and management of allergic conjunctivitis [^116DcWjy]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

Ocular allergy (OA), interchangeably known as allergic conjunctivitis, is a common immunological hypersensitivity disorder affecting up to 40% of the population. The prevalence of OA is on the rise, with symptoms such as itching, redness, and swelling, which significantly impact an individual's quality of life (QOL). Despite its prevalence, OA is often underdiagnosed and undertreated as only 10% of patients with OA symptoms seek medical attention, while most patients resort to over-the-counter medications and complementary non-pharmacological remedies.

- **Clinical course and symptoms**: The clinical course, duration, severity, and co-morbidities are varied and depend, in part, on the specific ocular tissues that are affected and the immunologic mechanisms involved, both local and systemic. OA is frequently associated with allergic rhinitis (commonly known as allergic rhino conjunctivitis) and other allergic comorbidities.

- **Self-management and risks**: The predominance of self-management increases the risk of suboptimal therapy, which can lead to exacerbations and the potential development of more chronic conditions that may result in corneal complications and interference with the visual axis.

- **Diagnosis challenges**: Multiple, often co-existing causes complicate OA, making it difficult to arrive at the correct diagnosis. OA commonly overlaps with other anterior ocular diseases, including infectious disorders and dry eye syndromes. Therefore, successful management includes overcoming challenges related to underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis.

### Executive summary: Japanese guidelines for allergic conjunctival diseases 2021 [^117GNZc6]. Allergology International (2022). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on allergic conjunctivitis:

- **Definition**: Allergic conjunctivitis is an inflammatory disease of the conjunctiva caused by an allergic reaction.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of allergic conjunctivitis involves exposure to allergens triggering an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction, leading to mucosal inflammation and associated ocular symptoms.

- **Epidemiology**: Allergic conjunctivitis is estimated to affect 6–30% of the general population.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for allergic conjunctivitis include a personal or familial predisposition to allergies, along with environmental elements that augment exposure to allergens. These allergens may include pollen, dust mites, animal dander, pollutants, and fungal allergens.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, allergic conjunctivitis presents with symptoms such as redness, itching, eye discharge, foreign body sensation, and swollen eyelids. Some patients may also experience burning and stinging, which can be attributed to chronic neuropathic pain.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of allergic conjunctivitis is generally good. While it is a chronic condition, it can be effectively managed with treatment, including allergen avoidance, the use of antihistamines, and in some cases, specific immunotherapy.

### Allergic conjunctivitis: Update on pathophysiology and prospects for future treatment [^116njrWC]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Allergic conjunctivitis is, in actuality, a group of diseases affecting the ocular surface and is usually associated with type 1 hypersensitivity reactions. Two acute disorders, seasonal allergic conjunctivitis and perennial allergic conjunctivitis, exist, as do three chronic diseases: vernal keratoconjunctivitis, atopic keratoconjunctivitis, and giant papillary conjunctivitis. The ocular surface inflammation, usually mast cell driven, results in itching, tearing, lid and conjunctival edema-redness, and photophobia during the acute phase and can lead to a classic late-phase response, with associated eosinophilia and neutrophilia, in a subset of individuals. As is the case in other allergic diseases, a chronic disease can also develop, accompanied by remodeling of the ocular surface tissues. In severe cases, the patient experiences extreme discomfort and sustains damage to the ocular surface.

For such cases, there is no highly effective and safe treatment regimen. Topical administration of corticosteroids is used in severe cases but is associated with an increased risk for the development of cataracts and glaucoma. Thus, there is a worldwide search for new biotargets for the treatment of these diseases. Here we provide a brief update on the clinical symptoms associated with these diseases, the rationale for disease classification, recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of the diseases, and an update on both preclinical and clinical advances toward refined therapies for these conditions.

### Clinical trials in allergen immunotherapy: Current concepts and future needs [^116myyEZ]. Allergy (2018). High credibility.

A large body of evidence from meta-analyses and systematic reviews of double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials (DBPC RCTs) shows that allergen immunotherapy (AIT), whether delivered subcutaneously (SCIT) or sublingually (SLIT), is a safe and effective treatment for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (AR) and allergic asthma.

AIT is the only causal treatment option for allergic patients, as it directly targets the pro-inflammatory immune response and thus has disease-modifying properties. AIT has the potential to decrease the neo-sensitization rate, which is the development of sensitizations to secondary allergens, and has been shown to reduce the risk of developing allergic asthma in AR patients. Accordingly, many medical societies and expert groups have recommended the use of AIT in selected individuals. This mainly includes patients with moderate-to-severe AR who either do not gain sufficient relief from symptomatic medications or do obtain sufficient relief from such medications but consider that AIT may counter the severity of their AR symptoms and prevent progression to asthma.

Despite these observations, levels of AIT acceptance among both patients and physicians are rather modest, with only a minority of eligible patients receiving this treatment option.

### Treatment of allergic conjunctivitis with bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution 1.5% [^112t1Fzq]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Allergic conjunctivitis (AC) is classified as a type 1, IgE-mediated hypersensitivity immune reaction that occurs in individuals previously exposed to the offending allergen. The signs and symptoms of AC are primarily caused by mast cell-derived histamine acting on H1 and H2 histamine receptors in the surrounding ocular tissues. Consequently, medications that stabilize mast cells and reduce degranulation, along with those that directly antagonize the action of histamine at its receptors, have become the first-line therapy for AC. Medications of this class, dual-action antihistamines, offer both an improved safety profile and increased therapeutic effect compared to older topical agents, such as pheniramine maleate, previously used in the treatment of AC.

Bepotastine besilate is an anti-allergic agent with multiple mechanisms of action extensively investigated in both preclinical and clinical studies. Bepotastine besilate acts as a dual-action agent and is a highly selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist with potent mast cell-stabilizing effects. Its anti-inflammatory actions include the inhibition of leukotriene B4 and attenuation of eosinophil chemotaxis and activation. Bepotastine has also been shown to inhibit the biosynthesis of proinflammatory IL-5 in vitro. Oral formulations of bepotastine besilate have been well-characterized in Japan through both preclinical and clinical reports, as well as in several clinical safety studies. Positive results from these studies led to the approval by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare in July 2000 of an oral bepotastine besilate formulation.

### Update and clinical utility of alcaftadine ophthalmic solution 0.25% in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^114peA54]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

An allergic reaction is initiated when previously sensitized eyes are re-exposed to the allergen. The allergens activate Th2-lymphocytes to secrete Th2-lymphocyte-derived cytokines. The binding of multivalent allergens to IgE molecules on FcεRI induces cross-linking of the IgE–FcεRI complex on the primed mast cells, which in turn activates the mast cells to undergo degranulation.

Degranulation of the mast cells leads to three immunobiological responses characterized by the release of preformed mediators such as biogenic amines (e.g. histamine) and neutral proteases (e.g. tryptase). Additionally, there is the synthesis and release of lipid mediators (e.g. prostaglandin) and the production and release of cytokines (e.g. IL-4). This is the activation phase of the allergic response in allergic conjunctivitis. Notably, the early-phase response occurs within 3–5 minutes of allergen exposure and usually lasts for less than an hour.

Histamine binding to receptors on the ocular surface is associated with altered permeability of the epithelium, disrupting the epithelial barrier function of the conjunctiva. It also stimulates epithelial cells of the conjunctiva to release adhesion molecules, chemokines, and proinflammatory cytokines. The interaction of histamine with histamine receptors expressed on immature dendritic cells (DCs) recruits and activates DCs to become mature antigen-presenting cells. These cells can then activate naïve T lymphocytes to become activated CD4 T lymphocytes, which subsequently differentiate into Th2-lymphocytes. Thus, Th2-lymphocytes, along with mast cells, play a major role in this process.

### Conjunctivitis in dupilumab clinical trials for adolescents with atopic dermatitis or asthma [^114p776G]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Several types of topical treatment for conjunctivitis were used in these studies, including anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-infective therapies, combination therapies, decongestants, and anti-allergic agents such as mast cell inhibitors/stabilizers and antihistamines. Sodium chloride and artificial tears were also utilized. Regardless of the type of treatment used, most cases recovered during the study treatment period in both the asthma trial and the atopic dermatitis (AD) trials.

A number of treatment protocols for conjunctivitis in dupilumab-treated patients with AD have been proposed in the literature. These include warm compresses, artificial tears, eyedrops or ointments with antihistamines, anti-inflammatories, corticosteroid drops and ointments, anti-infective therapies, calcineurin inhibitors, topical cyclosporine A, and combination treatments. It should be noted that topical corticosteroid eye treatments increase the risk of eye infection, and longer-term use increases the risk of cataracts and glaucoma.

Some prescribers have used prophylactic tears at the start of dupilumab therapy to address potential issues of eye dryness. Currently, there is no consensus on an optimal approach to prevent and manage conjunctivitis in dupilumab-treated patients. Further studies are needed to evaluate the various treatments currently being used.

### Tezspire [^1119QDSb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Hypersensitivity reactions were observed in the clinical trials (e.g. rash and allergic conjunctivitis) following the administration of Tezspire. Postmarketing cases of anaphylaxis have also been reported [see Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6)]. These reactions can occur within hours of administration, but in some instances have a delayed onset (i.e. days). In the event of a hypersensitivity reaction, consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient to determine whether to continue or discontinue treatment with Tezspire.

- **Acute asthma symptoms or deteriorating disease**: Tezspire should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms or acute exacerbations. Do not use Tezspire to treat acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus. Patients should seek medical advice if their asthma remains uncontrolled or worsens after initiation of treatment with Tezspire.

- **Risk associated with abrupt reduction of corticosteroid dosage**: Do not discontinue systemic or inhaled corticosteroids abruptly upon initiation of therapy with Tezspire. Reductions in corticosteroid dose, if appropriate, should be gradual and performed under the direct supervision of a physician. Reduction in corticosteroid dose may be associated with systemic withdrawal symptoms and/or unmask conditions previously suppressed by systemic corticosteroid therapy.

- **Parasitic (helminth) infection**: Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections. Patients with known helminth infections were excluded from clinical trials.

### Epithelial barrier dysfunction in ocular allergy [^1138bJPx]. Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

Ocular allergy, commonly referred to as allergic conjunctivitis, encompasses a spectrum of hypersensitivity disorders that primarily affect the eyelid and conjunctiva. This includes various phenotypes: seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC), perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC), atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC), and contact blepharoconjunctivitis.

Successful management of ocular allergy involves both preventive and treatment measures:

- **Preventive and non-pharmacologic measures**: These strategies are essential in managing and reducing the occurrence of symptoms.
- **Pharmacologic measures**: Over the years, various therapeutic options have been developed to manage symptoms:
	- **Topical antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, and dual-acting agents**: These are commonly used.
	- **Corticosteroids and immunomodulators**: Utilized in severe cases, especially in chronic forms. However, these do not completely control signs, symptoms, or prevent recurrences.

The inflammation of the ocular surface, particularly in VKC and AKC, often leads to severe suffering and complications such as corneal ulcers, tissue remodeling, and scars. Rarely, it leads to limbal stem cell (LSC) deficiency, where conjunctival epithelial cells invade the cornea. Moreover, treatment-related complications such as increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and cataracts may arise due to the side effects of steroid overuse, necessitating the development of safer therapeutic options.

Given that eyes are directly exposed to the external environment, defective barriers are likely a primary factor in the pathology of ocular allergy. Epithelial barrier integrity is compromised in dry eye pathologies, suggesting that barrier dysfunction plays a critical role in various ocular surface disorders.

### Conjunctivitis: Diagnosis and management [^114ZswsT]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis caused by viruses, bacteria, or allergies is one of the most common eye conditions in primary care. There is no single sign or symptom that accurately differentiates viral from bacterial conjunctivitis. A comprehensive history and physical examination can guide diagnosis. Viral and allergic conjunctivitis are more common in adults and typically present with watery discharge. Supportive care options for viral conjunctivitis include artificial tears, cold compresses, and antihistamine eye drops. Strict personal hygiene, including frequent handwashing, is essential to decrease the risk of transmission.

- **Treatment for allergic conjunctivitis**: Topical antihistamines with mast cell-stabilizing activity are the treatment of choice.
- **Characteristics of bacterial conjunctivitis**: More common in children, it typically presents as mucopurulent discharge with the eyelids matted shut. Delayed antibiotic prescribing has been found to have similar symptom control as immediate prescribing.
- **Indications for ophthalmology referral**: Necessary for conjunctivitis in a neonate or patients with severe pain, decreased vision, recent ocular surgery, vesicular rash on the eyelids or nose, history of rheumatologic disease, or immunocompromised state.

### Update and clinical utility of alcaftadine ophthalmic solution 0.25% in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^114BsmRK]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Ocular allergic reactions are dependent on the allergen load on the ocular surface, the stability of the mast cells, and the integrity of the conjunctival epithelial cells. Most allergens can secrete proteolytic enzymes that enhance disruption of the epithelial barrier function via degradation of tight junction proteins, which facilitates the access of allergens to the conjunctival stroma. Moreover, eosinophils can be recruited to the conjunctiva of patients with allergic conjunctivitis via H4 receptor interaction. The recruited eosinophils degranulate to release mediators that destabilize the barrier function of the conjunctival epithelium.

Preclinical studies have shown that alcaftadine can inhibit eosinophil recruitment and allergen-induced degradation of tight junction proteins, as well as promote the stability of the tight junction proteins of the conjunctival epithelium. The ability of alcaftadine to inhibit the influx of eosinophils could possibly explain why alcaftadine prevents disruption of the tight junction proteins. Activation of H1 and H2 receptors results in itching sensation, conjunctival injection, upregulation of adhesion molecules, cytokine release, vasopermeability, collagen synthesis, and proliferation of conjunctival fibroblasts. H4 receptor activation is associated with the release of cytokines and chemokines, upregulation of adhesion molecules, and activation and recruitment of immune cells. It is noteworthy that the histamine released following mast cell degranulation recruits and activates dendritic cells (DCs) that induce Th2-lymphocyte-mediated responses.

Antigen-specific immunotherapy is expected to be a desirable treatment for allergic diseases. Currently, antigen-specific immunotherapy is performed by administering disease-causing antigens subcutaneously or sublingually, which induces long-term remission in patients with allergic rhinitis or asthma. The oral route is an alternative to these methods and can also induce long-term remission through a phenomenon known as "oral tolerance". The effectiveness of oral tolerance has been reported in the context of autoimmune diseases, food allergies, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis in both human patients and animal models. However, few studies have examined its efficacy in animal models of allergic conjunctivitis.

Previously, we showed that ovalbumin feeding suppressed ovalbumin-induced experimental allergic conjunctivitis, indicating that the induction of oral tolerance is effective in treating experimental allergic conjunctivitis. In recent years, transgenic rice has been developed that can induce oral tolerance and reduce the severity of anaphylaxis. The major Japanese cedar pollen antigens in transgenic rice, Cryptomeria japonica 1 and C. japonica 2, were deconstructed by molecular shuffling, fragmentation, and changes in the oligomeric structure. Thus, transgenic rice may be an effective treatment for allergic conjunctivitis.

### Clinical practice guideline: Allergic rhinitis [^112FVUn4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). High credibility.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) is one of the most common diseases affecting adults and is the most prevalent chronic disease among children in the United States today. It ranks as the fifth most common chronic disease in the United States overall, affecting nearly 1 in every 6 Americans. AR generates $2 to $5 billion in direct health expenditures annually and can significantly impair quality of life. Additionally, due to loss of work and school attendance, it accounts for as much as $2 to $4 billion in lost productivity each year. A myriad of diagnostic tests and treatments are employed in managing this disorder; however, there is considerable variation in their use. This clinical practice guideline was developed to optimize the care of patients with AR by addressing quality improvement opportunities through an evaluation of the available evidence and an assessment of the harm-benefit balance of various diagnostic and management options.

The primary purpose of this guideline is to address quality improvement opportunities for all clinicians, in any setting, who are likely to manage patients with AR, as well as to optimize patient care, promote effective diagnosis and therapy, and reduce harmful or unnecessary variations in care. The guideline is intended to be applicable for both pediatric and adult patients with AR, with the exception of children under the age of 2 years. Rhinitis in this younger population may differ from that in older patients and is not informed by the same evidence base. The guideline focuses on a limited number of key areas to provide clear, evidence-based recommendations.

### Management of ocular allergy [^111wZqCy]. Allergy (2019). Low credibility.

The treatment and management of ocular allergy (OA) remain a major concern for various specialties, including allergists, ophthalmologists, primary care physicians, rhinologists, pediatricians, dermatologists, clinical immunologists, and pharmacists. We conducted a systematic review of all relevant publications in MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web Science, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Publications were considered relevant if they addressed treatments or management strategies for OA. A further comprehensive systematic literature search was performed if no evidence or good quality evidence was found.

- **Treatment options**: There are effective drugs for the treatment of OA; however, there is a lack of an optimal treatment for the perennial and severe forms. Topical antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, or double-action drugs are the first choice of treatment. All of them are effective in reducing signs and symptoms of OA.

- **Safety concerns**: The safety and optimal dosing regimen of the most effective topical anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, remain a significant concern. Topical calcineurin inhibitors may be used in steroid-dependent or resistant cases of severe allergic keratoconjunctivitis.

- **Advanced treatments**: Allergen-specific immunotherapy may be considered in cases of failure of first-line treatments or to modify the natural course of OA disease. Based on the wealth of publications and collective experience, recommendations on the management of OA have been proposed.

### Effect of alcaftadine 0.25% on ocular itch associated with seasonal or perennial allergic conjunctivitis: A pooled analysis of two multicenter randomized clinical trials [^116GBp9u]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). High credibility.

After all evaluations were completed at the end of each visit, the use of over-the-counter antiallergy eye drop Visine-A® was permitted. Systemic and/or topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin or aspirin-containing products, prescription, over-the-counter or homeopathic antiallergy therapies (including over-the-counter sleeping aids that contain an antihistamine and all antihistamines), all other topical ophthalmic preparations (including tear substitutes), and H1 antagonist antihistamines/mast cell stabilizers (i.e. olopatadine) were not permitted up to 72 hours prior to the start of the study or during the course of the study. Systemic and/or topical corticosteroids were not permitted up to 14 days prior to the start of the study or during the course of the study.

- **Efficacy and safety endpoints**: The primary efficacy measure was ocular itching, 16 hours after instillation of study medication, evaluated by the subject at 3 minutes post-CAC (primary endpoint) and at 5 and 7 minutes post-CAC (secondary endpoints). For safety assessment, the incidence of adverse events was monitored, and the severity and relationship to the study drug were determined by the investigator. Adverse events were coded to system organ class and preferred terms using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, version 13.1.

### DEXTENZA versus topical steroid or antihistamine therapy for treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^116PRV6E]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first real-world study of the dexamethasone intracanalicular insert for allergic conjunctivitis. Patients experienced greater improvements in signs and symptoms with the dexamethasone intracanalicular insert than with the topical steroid loteprednol. They preferred the insert to topical therapy by more than a 2-to-1 margin. Conversely, outcomes were similar, and no clear preference was demonstrated between the insert and the use of the topical antihistamine/mast cell stabilizer olopatadine.

Statistical differences in signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis favoring the dexamethasone insert over topical loteprednol therapy may be explained in several ways.

- **Relative potency**: Dexamethasone is considered a highly potent corticosteroid, while loteprednol is considered a weak corticosteroid.

- **Differences in formulation**: Solutions typically clear from the ocular surface within 15 minutes and suspensions within 2 hours. In contrast, the intracanalicular insert provides constant tapered delivery of dexamethasone over its ~30-day dosing period. Consequently, the bioavailability of drug at the ocular surface is likely greater with the dexamethasone insert compared to the loteprednol solution.

Regarding the strong preference expressed by patients for the dexamethasone insert over topical loteprednol, part may be explained by the superior efficacy of the insert over topical drops in relieving the signs and symptoms of ocular allergy, while part may be related to the freedom from self-administration of topical drops.

### Conjunctivitis: A systematic review of diagnosis and treatment [^115mqPVn]. JAMA (2013). Low credibility.

Conjunctivitis is a common problem that primarily affects the eyes. This review examines the diagnosis, management, and treatment of conjunctivitis, exploring both antibiotic and non-antibiotic approaches for infectious conjunctivitis, as well as the use of antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers in allergic conjunctivitis.

The evidence review involved a search of the literature published through March 2013, utilizing databases such as PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, and the Cochrane Library. Articles were selected based on a thorough review of titles, abstracts, and references.

Viral conjunctivitis emerges as the most prevalent form of infectious conjunctivitis, typically not requiring treatment. Symptoms and signs vary at presentation. Conversely, bacterial conjunctivitis is the second most common cause and generally resolves in 1 to 2 weeks without complications. Key indications of bacterial conjunctivitis include mattering and adherence of the eyelids in the morning, absence of itching, and no history of conjunctivitis. Topical antibiotics can reduce the duration of bacterial conjunctivitis and facilitate an earlier return to school or work.

Conjunctivitis related to sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia and gonorrhea necessitates systemic treatment in addition to topical antibiotics. Allergic conjunctivitis affects up to 40% of the population, although only a minor segment seeks medical intervention. The most consistent symptom is itching, typically managed with topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers.

### Topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers for treating seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis [^115XUFL2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis is the most common form of allergic conjunctivitis. It typically presents with acute symptoms when a person is exposed to allergens, including itching, redness, and tearing. These clinical signs and symptoms occur due to the release of histamine by mast cells. Histamine antagonists, or antihistamines, inhibit histamine action by blocking histamine H1 receptors, antagonizing the vasoconstrictor, and to a lesser extent, the vasodilator effects of histamine. Mast cell stabilisers prevent degranulation and the subsequent release of histamine by interrupting the normal chain of intracellular signals.

Topical treatments available include eye drops with antihistamines, mast cell stabilisers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, combinations of these treatments, and corticosteroids. Standard treatment involves either topical antihistamines alone, topical mast cell stabilisers alone, or a combination of treatments. There is clinical uncertainty about the relative efficacy and safety of these topical treatments.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review was to assess the effects of topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers, alone or in combination, for treating seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register (2014, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, and Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to July 2014), as well as EMBASE.

### Phase III trials examining the efficacy of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% compared to vehicle for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis in the conjunctival allergen challenge model [^115PRSm4]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Allergic conjunctivitis affects less than 15% of the global population, including as much as 30% of the U.S. population and up to 50% of the European population. Allergic conjunctivitis reactions range from a mild, self-limiting disease to a debilitating condition that significantly impairs one's quality of life. An individual's allergic response can be triggered by a variety of stimuli, including tree and grass pollens, animal hair and dander, and other environmental insults. This response manifests in a cascade of ocular symptoms including itching, redness, chemosis, tearing, and eyelid swelling.

The signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis progress through an early acute phase and a late phase in response to an allergen. Allergens interact with IgE bound to sensitized mast cells, activating enhanced levels of histamine and causing degranulation. In the acute phase, the release of histamine and other proallergic mediators induces itching, vasodilation, and vascular leakage, leading to ocular redness, chemosis, and lid swelling. Mast cells synthesize and release cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors that initiate a cascade of inflammatory events, culminating in a late phase reaction characterized by the recruitment of eosinophils, neutrophils, and macrophages in the conjunctival tissues.

### Zerviate [^1167Tquj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The efficacy of ZERVIATE was established in three randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) clinical trials in patients with a history of allergic conjunctivitis.

- **Clinical studies**: Onset and duration of action were evaluated in two of these trials, where patients were randomized to receive ZERVIATE or vehicle ophthalmic solutions. Patients were evaluated with an ocular itching severity score ranging from 0 (no itching) to 4 (incapacitating itch) at several time points after CAC administration.

Table 1 displays data from the mean ocular itching severity scores after ocular administration of an antigen using the CAC model. A one-unit difference compared to the vehicle is considered a clinically meaningful change in the ocular itching severity score.

Patients treated with ZERVIATE demonstrated statistically and clinically significantly less ocular itching compared to vehicle at 15 minutes and 8 hours after treatment.

### Therapeutic effects of 0.1% tacrolimus eye drops for refractory allergic ocular diseases with proliferative lesion or corneal involvement [^114EinJf]. The British journal of ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of topical 0.1% tacrolimus in treating refractory allergic conjunctivitis with proliferative lesions and/or corneal involvement. This prospective observational study included 1,436 patients with refractory allergic conjunctivitis whose condition had responded poorly to conventional antiallergic drugs, topical steroids, and/or topical cyclosporine. All patients received tacrolimus eye drops twice daily during the study period. Ten clinical signs and six clinical symptoms were rated on a four-grade scale. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in the total clinical signs and symptoms score at the last observation or following 6 months of treatment.

Total signs and symptoms score significantly decreased after 1 month of treatment (p < 0.001). Giant papillae and corneal lesions were also reduced by tacrolimus eye drop use (p < 0.001). The drug proved effective in patients whose condition did not respond well to topical cyclosporine therapy. About 50% of all patients using topical steroids were weaned. The most common adverse reaction was a transient burning sensation (3.20%).

Tacrolimus eye drops are highly effective in treating refractory allergic conjunctivitis with proliferative lesions and/or corneal involvement, and may reduce or replace topical steroid use.

### Clinical practice of allergen immunotherapy for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma: An expert panel report [^114rmRjQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) reduces symptoms and medication use associated with allergic rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis and allergic asthma. Although several AIT guidelines exist, there remain unanswered questions about AIT that are relevant to everyday practice. Our objective was to prepare an evidence-based overview addressing the practical aspects of AIT in clinical practice based on published evidence and the experience of international experts in the field.

- **Topics covered**: Interpretation and translation of clinical trial data into everyday clinical practice (e.g. allergen doses and treatment duration), assessment of risk and treatment of local and systemic allergic reactions, recommendations for improvement of AIT guidelines, and identification of appropriate data for seeking regulatory approval.

Many informational gaps in AIT practice need further evaluation as products and practices evolve.

### Sublingual immunotherapy for the treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma: a systematic review [^111iP8Md]. JAMA (2013). Low credibility.

Allergic rhinitis affects up to 40% of the US population. To desensitize allergic individuals, subcutaneous injection immunotherapy or sublingual immunotherapy may be administered. In the United States, sublingual immunotherapy is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration; however, some US physicians use aqueous allergens off-label for sublingual desensitization.

- **Objective**: To systematically review the effectiveness and safety of aqueous sublingual immunotherapy for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma.
- **Evidence acquisition**: The databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched through December 22, 2012. English-language randomized controlled trials were included if they compared sublingual immunotherapy with placebo, pharmacotherapy, or other sublingual immunotherapy regimens and reported clinical outcomes. Studies of sublingual immunotherapy that are unavailable in the United States and for which a related immunotherapy is unavailable in the United States were excluded. Paired reviewers selected articles and extracted the data. The strength of the evidence for each comparison and outcome was graded based on the risk of bias (scored on allocation, concealment of intervention, incomplete data, sponsor company involvement, and other bias), consistency, magnitude of effect, and the directness of the evidence.
- **Results**: Sixty-three studies with 5131 participants met the inclusion criteria. Participants' ages ranged from 4 to 74 years. Twenty studies (n = 1814 patients) enrolled only children.

### The efficacy and safety of dexamethasone intracanalicular insert use in patients with chronic seasonal/perennial allergic conjunctivitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Qn4Py]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

This meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of DEXTENZA, an intracanalicular dexamethasone insert, for the treatment of seasonal/perennial allergic conjunctivitis.

- **Methods**: Multiple databases, including PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), ClinicalTrials.gov, the Directory of Open Access Journals, and Scopus, were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy of DEXTENZA with a placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in the conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) model. The GRADE approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence, and the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials was employed to assess bias.

- **Results**: Four RCTs involving 323 participants met the eligibility criteria, and all had a low risk of bias. A meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant increase in the mean CAC change for conjunctival itching, with low heterogeneity among measurements at 3 minutes (P < 0.00001, I2 = 47%), 5 minutes (P < 0.00001, I2 = 46%), and 7 minutes (P < 0.00001, I2 = 41%). Additionally, the meta-analysis found a statistically significant increase in the mean CAC change for conjunctival redness with low heterogeneity (P < 0.00001, I2 = 15%). The pooled analysis showed no significant difference (P = 0.57, I2 = 0%) between the DEXTENZA and placebo groups in the frequency of adverse events.

- **Conclusion**: DEXTENZA has emerged as a promising and viable treatment option for patients with seasonal/perennial allergic conjunctivitis and is an effective alternative to current therapies.
