## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about borderline personality disorder (BPD) covering diagnostic criteria, clinical features, prevalence and epidemiology, assessment methods, course and prognosis, comorbidities, differential diagnosis, and cultural considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core diagnostic frameworks and how they differ. Then, I should verify the clinical phenotype and its subcomponents. Next, I will review prevalence estimates across settings and reconcile discrepancies. After that, I need to check best-practice assessment approaches and tools. Then, I will examine longitudinal course and remission data. I will now examine comorbidity patterns and their clinical implications. Next, I should review differential diagnosis, especially with bipolar spectrum disorders. Finally, I will consider cultural and sex/gender biases and synthesize practical takeaways for clinicians.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic criteria and models. In DSM-5 Section II, BPD is defined by a pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affect, with marked impulsivity, requiring at least five of nine criteria, including abandonment fears, unstable relationships, identity disturbance, impulsivity, suicidal/self-harm behavior, affective instability, chronic emptiness, inappropriate anger, and transient stress-related paranoia or dissociation [^1145FCEd]. Wait, let me verify the dimensional alternative: DSM-5 Section III (AMPD) requires moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning (Criterion A) plus pathological-range traits, with BPD linked to negative affectivity, disinhibition, and psychoticism, which helps explain comorbidity and within-diagnosis heterogeneity more transparently than the categorical model [^111wppy9] [^116vapp8]. I should also confirm ICD-11's approach: it uses a severity-based PD framework with an optional Borderline Pattern specifier aligned to DSM-5 features, reflecting global convergence toward dimensional severity plus trait specification [^116nYXtE] [^116i5ReS].

> Now, I will delineate the clinical features and their subdomains. Core features include emotional dysregulation with affective instability and intense anger, impulsive behaviors such as self-harm, suicidality, and reckless actions, interpersonal instability with abandonment fears and alternating idealization/devaluation, and identity disturbance with chronic emptiness and distorted self-image, often with transient dissociation or stress-related paranoia [^1145FCEd] [^115vQmXH]. Hold on, I should verify the most discriminating criteria: affective instability shows the strongest diagnostic efficiency, with abandonment fears, unstable relationships, identity disturbance, impulsivity, and chronic emptiness also contributing meaningfully, supporting a six-criterion optimized set with excellent classification accuracy in ROC analyses [^115zEiRK].

> Next, I should review prevalence and epidemiology and reconcile divergent estimates. Community lifetime prevalence is commonly cited around 5.9% in U.S. samples, but wait, I should double-check newer syntheses: a 2025 meta-analysis estimates a pooled prevalence of 2.41% with substantial heterogeneity, suggesting prior figures may overestimate due to methodological differences [^114V8XAx] [^116Gcg8K]. In clinical settings, prevalence is markedly higher, roughly 10–12% in outpatient psychiatric populations and 20–22% among inpatients, consistent across multiple studies and reviews [^115kit2D] [^1145FCEd]. I need to ensure I note sociodemographic correlates: BPD is associated with younger age, lower socioeconomic status, unemployment, and lower education, and while often perceived as more common in women, population-based data increasingly show a more balanced sex distribution, with historical female predominance likely reflecting diagnostic bias [^116Gcg8K] [^114V8XAx].

> I will now examine assessment methods and best practices. The APA 2024 guideline recommends a comprehensive initial evaluation including presenting problem, goals, psychiatric history, medical status, psychosocial and cultural context, mental status exam, and risk assessment for suicide, self-harm, and aggression, with consideration of quantitative measures to identify and track symptom severity and functional impairment [^111x454X] [^115Kc9yr]. Hold on, I should verify preferred instruments: semi-structured interviews such as the SCID-II, DIPD, or DIB-R improve reliability over unstructured clinical evaluations, while dimensional tools like the LPFS for Criterion A and PID-5 for traits operationalize the AMPD and enhance diagnostic precision and case formulation [^1145FCEd] [^114DaSqA]. But wait, what if resources are limited? Even brief, validated screens can be used first-line, with structured follow-up to confirm diagnosis and quantify severity, aligning with emerging calls for higher assessment standards in PD care [^115WB2No].

> Let me consider the longitudinal course and prognosis. I should confirm remission rates: prospective data show high symptomatic remission over time, with up to 85% achieving remission by 10 years, though functional recovery often lags and remains incomplete for many, indicating a need for rehabilitation and social support alongside symptom-targeted treatments [^115vQmXH] [^111E6tbp]. Wait, let me verify adolescent data: adolescent-onset BPD predicts broad, persistent psychosocial impairment into early adulthood, underscoring the value of early identification and intervention for youth with BPD features or diagnoses [^112U4AVL]. I need to ensure I note symptom trajectories: impulsive symptoms tend to resolve faster, while affective and interpersonal/cognitive symptoms are more chronic, guiding treatment sequencing and expectations [^111XAUvd].

> Next, I should review comorbidity patterns and their clinical implications. Psychiatric comorbidity is the rule rather than the exception, with registry data showing 95.7% of individuals with BPD having at least one comorbid psychiatric diagnosis, including mood disorders, PTSD, substance use disorders, ADHD, bipolar spectrum disorders, and other personality disorders, which complicate course and treatment response [^114KNyvu]. Hold on, I should verify specific associations: BPD and bipolar disorder co-occur at rates around 18–22% in either direction, with meaningful clinical distinctions despite symptom overlap, and ADHD co-occurs in roughly one-third to one-half of BPD cases, suggesting shared neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities and implications for treatment planning [^111Mw8zR] [^115Uixmn]. I need to check somatic comorbidity too: BPD is linked to higher rates of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic pain, and sexually transmitted infections, and is overrepresented in chronic pain populations, which should prompt integrated medical-psychiatric care [^114KNyvu] [^113fd4KW].

> I will now examine differential diagnosis, especially the BPD–bipolar interface. Let me first confirm the overlap: affective instability, impulsivity, and suicidality are shared, but BPD mood shifts are reactive, short-lived, and tied to interpersonal stressors, whereas bipolar mood episodes are sustained with clear intervals and episodic course; careful longitudinal assessment and collateral history reduce misclassification [^115w5s6a] [^116Kf9Ur]. Wait, I should double-check screening pitfalls: the Mood Disorder Questionnaire flags many with BPD as positive, so a positive screen should trigger a structured diagnostic interview rather than a bipolar diagnosis by default, to avoid overdiagnosis and mismatched treatments [^1141TwtJ] [^1111MV1s]. I need to ensure I note other differentials: PTSD and complex PTSD, ADHD, major depressive disorder, and other personality disorders can mimic or co-occur with BPD, requiring attention to temporal relationships, trauma exposure, and trait-level profiles to disentangle [^1151ZMqJ] [^115w5s6a].

> But wait, what about cultural and sex/gender considerations. Historically, BPD has been overdiagnosed in women and underrecognized in men, partly due to gendered expressions of distress and clinician bias; men may show more externalizing features and substance use, while women may show more internalizing and identity-related symptoms, so I should actively counteract bias by using standardized assessments and considering context [^117VdM2t] [^11385bab]. Hold on, I should verify measurement invariance: psychometric work shows differential item functioning by sex and age for impulsivity and affective instability, reinforcing the need to interpret criteria within demographic context and avoid overpathologizing normative developmental or culturally shaped behaviors [^115XHxwi]. I need to ensure trauma-informed, culturally sensitive care is emphasized, given high rates of childhood adversity and the risk of retraumatization in insensitive diagnostic processes [^115vQmXH] [^117VdM2t].

> Finally, I should synthesize practical clinical takeaways. BPD is best conceptualized as a dimensional syndrome of personality dysfunction with trait expressions rather than a discrete categorical disease, so I should assess severity and trait profiles to guide individualized care and anticipate comorbidity patterns [^111wppy9] [^112D86VU]. I should confirm diagnosis with structured interviews when possible, quantify severity with validated measures, and embed risk assessment for suicide and self-harm into routine care, targeting identity disturbance and chronic emptiness as independent risk markers [^111x454X] [^116YwsEL]. Given high remission but persistent functional deficits, I should prioritize evidence-based psychotherapies and coordinate care for comorbidities, while educating patients and families to reduce stigma and enhance engagement [^111E6tbp] [^116qV3M2].

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is defined by **instability in affect, self-image, relationships, and impulse control** [^115vQmXH], with **high suicide risk** and substantial functional impairment [^111x454X]. Diagnosis requires **five or more DSM-5 criteria** [^111x454X] and is best confirmed by structured interviews [^1145FCEd]; the **Alternative Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD)** offers a dimensional approach [^111wppy9] [^1127xB9A]. Prevalence is about 1.6% in the general population [^114KNyvu], 10–20% in psychiatric outpatients, and up to 22% in inpatients [^115kit2D] [^1145FCEd]. Common comorbidities include mood, anxiety, substance use, PTSD, ADHD, and eating disorders [^114KNyvu] [^111Mw8zR] [^115Uixmn] [^111PXNuC]. The course is **chronic with fluctuating symptoms** [^111E6tbp]; remission is common over time, but relapse is frequent and functional recovery lags behind symptom remission [^111XAUvd]. Assessment should include structured interviews, validated scales, and suicide risk evaluation [^111x454X] [^115Kc9yr]. Differential diagnosis includes bipolar spectrum, PTSD, and other personality disorders [^115w5s6a] [^1151ZMqJ]. Cultural factors influence symptom expression and diagnosis, and trauma is a key risk factor [^117VdM2t] [^115vQmXH].

---

## Diagnostic criteria

According to **DSM-5**, BPD is diagnosed when at least five of the following nine criteria are present, beginning by early adulthood and persisting across contexts:

- Frantic efforts to avoid abandonment
- Unstable, intense relationships alternating between extremes
- Identity disturbance with unstable self-image or sense of self
- Impulsivity in at least two self-damaging areas (e.g. spending, sex, substance use, reckless driving, binge eating)
- Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or self-mutilation
- Affective instability due to marked reactivity of mood
- Chronic feelings of emptiness
- Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger
- Transient stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms

The **Alternative Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD)** in DSM-5 Section III provides a dimensional approach emphasizing impairment in personality functioning (identity, self-direction, empathy, intimacy) and pathological personality traits (negative affectivity, disinhibition, antagonism, psychoticism) [^114DaSqA] [^116i5ReS].

---

## Clinical features

Core features include **emotional dysregulation** with intense, labile emotions and reactivity to stressors [^115vQmXH]; **impulsive behaviors** such as self-harm, suicidal ideation/attempts, substance misuse, reckless driving, and binge eating [^116XbXmc]; **unstable relationships** characterized by intense, volatile interpersonal dynamics with alternating idealization and devaluation [^1145FCEd]; and **identity disturbance** with a fragmented or unstable self-image and chronic emptiness [^1145FCEd]. These features cause significant functional impairment, including occupational, social, and role dysfunction, and confer high suicide risk with frequent attempts and chronic ideation [^112amCw9] [^116YwsEL].

---

## Prevalence and epidemiology

- **General population**: Approximately 1.6% (range 0.7–2.7%) [^114KNyvu] [^1145FCEd].
- **Psychiatric outpatients**: 10–20% [^notfound].
- **Psychiatric inpatients**: Up to 22% [^115kit2D] [^1145FCEd].
- **Gender distribution**: Historically female-predominant, but recent data suggest a more balanced sex ratio, with potential diagnostic bias toward underdiagnosis in males [^116Gcg8K] [^116ffS1G].
- **Socioeconomic correlates**: Higher prevalence among individuals with lower socioeconomic status, unemployment, and lower education [^116Gcg8K] [^114V8XAx].

---

## Assessment methods

- **Structured clinical interviews**: Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorders (DIPD-IV), Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders (SCID-II), Personality Disorder Interview-IV (PDI-IV) [^notfound].
- **Self-report questionnaires**: McLean Screening Instrument for BPD (MSI-BPD), Personality Assessment Inventory-Borderline Features (PAI-BOR), Borderline Symptom List-23 (BSL-23) [^notfound].
- **Dimensional measures**: Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5), Level of Personality Functioning Scale (LPFS) [^114DaSqA].
- **Risk assessment**: Comprehensive evaluation of suicide risk, self-harm, and aggressive behaviors is essential [^111x454X] [^112amCw9].

---

## Course of disorder

- **Chronic course**: Symptoms typically persist for years, with fluctuations in severity [^111XAUvd].
- **Remission and relapse**: High remission rates (up to 85% over 10 years), but relapse is common and functional recovery often lags behind symptom remission [^115vQmXH] [^111E6tbp].
- **Functional impairment**: Persistent social, occupational, and role dysfunction despite symptom improvement [^111E6tbp] [^112U4AVL].

---

## Common comorbidities

- **Mood disorders**: Major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder [^114KNyvu] [^111Mw8zR].
- **Anxiety disorders**: PTSD, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder [^114KNyvu] [^116tFhMU].
- **Substance use disorders**: Alcohol and drug use disorders [^1145FCEd] [^114H9unG].
- **Eating disorders**: Bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder [^111N7hNB] [^111PXNuC].
- **ADHD**: Significant comorbidity, particularly in adolescents and young adults [^112U4AVL] [^115Uixmn].

---

## Common differentials

- **Bipolar spectrum disorders**: Differentiating BPD from bipolar disorder requires careful evaluation of mood episode duration, cyclicity, and presence of mania/hypomania [^115w5s6a] [^1111MV1s].
- **Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**: Overlap in trauma-related symptoms, but PTSD lacks the pervasive identity disturbance and chronic emptiness characteristic of BPD [^notfound].
- **Other personality disorders**: Narcissistic, histrionic, antisocial personality disorders share features but differ in core motivations and behavioral patterns [^notfound].

---

## Cultural considerations

Cultural factors shape the **expression of symptoms**, diagnostic thresholds, and treatment engagement; trauma exposure — especially childhood abuse and neglect — is a major risk factor across cultures [^117VdM2t] [^115vQmXH]. Diagnostic bias may lead to overdiagnosis in women and underdiagnosis in men, as well as misattribution of symptoms in minority populations [^117VdM2t] [^116Gcg8K]. Culturally sensitive, trauma-informed care improves diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes [^notfound].

---

Borderline personality disorder is characterized by **instability in affect, self-image, relationships, and impulse control**, with significant functional impairment and high suicide risk. Accurate diagnosis relies on structured interviews and dimensional measures, and management must address comorbidities, cultural context, and trauma history to optimize outcomes [^1145FCEd] [^115Kc9yr] [^111x454X].

### Classification, assessment, prevalence, and effect of personality disorder [^112Grh4U]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Personality disorders are common and ubiquitous in all medical settings, so every medical practitioner will encounter them frequently. People with personality disorder have problems in interpersonal relationships but often attribute them wrongly to others. No clear threshold exists between types and degrees of personality dysfunction and its pathology is best classified by a single dimension, ranging from normal personality at one extreme through to severe personality disorder at the other. The description of personality disorders has been complicated over the years by undue adherence to overlapping and unvalidated categories that represent specific characteristics rather than the core components of personality disorder. Many people with personality disorder remain undetected in clinical practice and might be given treatments that are ineffective or harmful as a result. Comorbidity with other mental disorders is common, and the presence of personality disorder often has a negative effect on course and treatment outcome. Personality disorder is also associated with premature mortality and suicide, and needs to be identified more often in clinical practice than it is at present.

- a review of psychiatric symptoms, including core features of personality disorders and common co-occurring disorders

- a psychiatric treatment history

- an assessment of physical health

- an assessment of psychosocial and cultural factors

- a mental status examination

- an assessment of the risk of suicide, self-injury, and aggressive behaviors.

Several studies of the prevalence of borderline personality disorder in community and clinical settings have been carried out to date. Although results vary according to sampling method and assessment method, median point prevalence is roughly 1%, with higher or lower rates in certain community subpopulations. In clinical settings, the prevalence is around 10% to 12% in outpatient psychiatric clinics and 20% to 22% among inpatient clinics. Further research is needed to identify the prevalence and correlates of borderline personality disorder in other clinical settings (eg, primary care) and to investigate the impact of demographic variables on borderline personality disorder prevalence.

### Conceptual models of borderline personality disorder, part 1: overview of prevailing and emergent models [^1127xB9A]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a debilitating condition with significant personal and societal costs. Throughout the history of the conceptualization of borderline pathology as a form of psychopathology, there has been debate concerning the essential attributes of this disorder, which has significant implications for its assessment and treatment. The first of this 2-part review evaluates the major approaches to conceptualizing BPD, from the traditional DSM diagnosis through the more recent Alternative Model in DSM-5, Section III, and the research domain criteria initiative of the National Institute of Mental Health that was articulated largely in response to limitations of the DSM.

### Differential diagnosis of borderline personality disorder [^115w5s6a]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) has a wide range of symptoms and clinical features that overlap with other diagnostic categories. Diagnosis is important because different disorders respond to different forms of treatment. Differential diagnosis is particularly relevant for distinguishing BPD from bipolar spectrum disorders, requiring a careful evaluation of affective instability and hypomania. BPD may also be confused with major depression, schizophrenia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder.

### Borderline personality disorder [^115vQmXH]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on borderline personality disorder:

- **Definition**: Borderline personality disorder is a mental health disorder characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability in affect regulation, impulse control, interpersonal relationships, and self-image.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathogenesis of borderline personality disorder is complex and not fully understood. It is believed to involve interactions among genetic, neurobiological, and environmental factors. Genetic factors and adverse life events, such as physical and sexual abuse during childhood, are thought to contribute to the development of the disorder.
- **Epidemiology**: The lifetime prevalence of borderline personality disorder in the US is estimated at 5.9%.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for borderline personality disorder are multifaceted and include temperamental factors, including high impulsivity and emotional instability; environmental factors, including maltreatment such as physical, emotional, and sexual abuse; and genetic factors.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, borderline personality disorder is marked by emotional dysregulation, impulsive aggression, repeated self-injury, and chronic suicidal tendencies. Other key manifestations include intense mood swings, fear of abandonment, unstable relationships, and a distorted self-image.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of borderline personality disorder is variable. While the disorder is traditionally considered chronic and intractable, up to 85% of patients remit over a 10-year period.

### Epidemiology of borderline personality disorder in the general population: prevalence, sociodemographic factors, and comorbidities – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Gcg8K]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a severe mental health condition with significant public health relevance. Although traditionally viewed as more prevalent in clinical populations, its true prevalence and associated sociodemographic factors in the general population remain subject to debate. This systematic review aims to synthesize epidemiological evidence on the prevalence, sociodemographic correlates, and psychiatric comorbidities of BPD in community-based samples.

Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed and Web of Science Core Collection (2000–2024). Eligible studies assessed the prevalence of BPD, its sociodemographic correlates, and psychiatric comorbidities in community-based samples, using DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, or DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. Study quality was evaluated using the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Prevalence Studies.

Results

Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of BPD was 2.41% (95% CI: 1.70%-3.40%), with reported estimates across studies ranging from 0.7% to 7.35%, reflecting substantial heterogeneity in the literature. Although BPD has historically been considered more common in women, population-based data indicate a more balanced sex distribution. Prevalence tended to decrease with age and was associated with lower socioeconomic status, unemployment, and lower education levels. High psychiatric comorbidity was observed, with BPD emerging as the strongest independent predictor of suicide attempts.

Conclusions

BPD prevalence in the general population appears higher than previously estimated. Its strong association with sociodemographic disadvantage, psychiatric comorbidity, and increased suicide risk highlights the need for early detection and timely access to comprehensive, evidence-based treatment. Therefore, addressing diagnostic biases and improving access to mental health care are essential for reducing the long-term burden of BPD on both affected individuals and healthcare systems.

### The prevalence of DSM-IV personality disorders in psychiatric outpatients [^117XKGAm]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The largest clinical epidemiological surveys of personality disorders have been based on unstructured clinical evaluations. However, several recent studies have questioned the accuracy and thoroughness of clinical diagnostic interviews; consequently, clinical epidemiological studies, like community-based studies, should be based on standardized evaluations. The Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services project is one of the largest clinical epidemiological studies to use semistructured interviews to assess a wide range of psychiatric disorders conducted in general clinical outpatient practice. In the present report, the authors examined the frequency of DSM-IV personality disorders in a patient group and the comorbidity among them.

Method

Eight hundred fifty-nine psychiatric outpatients were interviewed with the Structured Interview for DSM-IV Personality upon presentation for treatment.

Results

Slightly less than one-third of the patients were diagnosed with one of the 10 official DSM-IV personality disorders (N = 270, 31.4%). When the patients with personality disorder not otherwise specified were included, the rate of any personality disorder increased to almost half of the group (N = 391, 45.5%). The majority of patients meeting criteria for one of the specific personality disorders were diagnosed with more than one. Avoidant, borderline, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder were the most frequent specific diagnoses.

Conclusions

Personality disorders, as a group, are among the most frequent disorders treated by psychiatrists. They should be evaluated in all psychiatric patients because their presence can influence the course and treatment of the axis I disorder that patients typically identify as their chief complaint.

### The global epidemiology of personality disorder: a systematic review and meta-regression [^114Bny3U]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Background

Personality disorder is a persistent and pervasive mental disorder, defined as an enduring pattern of inner experience and behaviour that deviates markedly from the expectations of an individual's culture, but it remains under-recognised in global mental health estimates. To our knowledge, no comprehensive synthesis has quantified the global prevalence, mortality, or diagnostic stability of personality disorder using population-representative data. We aimed to address these gaps to support future burden of disease modelling.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-regression of population-based surveys following PRISMA and GATHER guidelines. Eligible studies were cross-sectional or longitudinal studies published in peer-reviewed journals that reported prevalence or mortality associated with any personality disorder using DSM or ICD diagnostic criteria on representative samples. Personality disorder encompassed paranoid, schizoid, schizotypal, antisocial, borderline, histrionic, narcissistic, avoidant, dependent, obsessive-compulsive, and other specified and unspecified personality disorders. Studies using self-report instruments and non-representative samples (eg, clinical, incarcerated, or university populations) were excluded. Studies were identified through systematic searches in PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO from Jan 1, 1980, to Feb 13, 2024. Studies were reviewed (by JS and a research assistant), and eligible data were extracted by JS. All data were non-identifiable and pre-aggregated from existing sources. Study quality was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. Due to data availability, we did two separate meta-regression analyses to estimate the prevalence and standardised mortality ratios associated with personality disorder, and a descriptive analysis to examine diagnostic stability. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistic. Meta-regression models assessed the effect of study-level covariates. Members of our authorship team have lived personal experience with mental disorders, but we did not consult individuals diagnosed with personality disorder for this work. The study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021269169.

Findings

We identified 60 studies across 28 countries. Prevalence analyses included 139373 individuals, and mortality analyses included 392420 individuals with a personality disorder. Between-study heterogeneity was high for prevalence (I 2 = 98·8%) and mortality (I 2 = 99·4%). Study quality assessment indicated that 59 studies were of high quality, with only one study of moderate quality. Pooled prevalence of any personality disorder ranged from 4·1% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 2·8–6·0) in low-income and middle-income countries to 5·2% (3·7–7·3) in high-income countries for mid-age 43 years. Prevalence was found to be higher among male individuals (compared with female individuals) and to decrease with age. Meta-regression results identified heterogeneity linked to diagnostic criteria, interviewer type, and region. Publication bias was identified in prevalence analyses. Personality disorder was associated with elevated mortality, with pooled standardised mortality ratios of 4·7 (95% UI 3·7–5·8) for inpatients, 1·8 (1·4–2·2) for outpatients, and 2·2 (1·8–2·9) for both inpatients and outpatients. Data indicated that personality disorder shows moderate diagnostic stability over time.

Interpretation

Personality disorder is common, associated with premature mortality, and diagnostically stable, yet remains excluded from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study. We provide a comprehensive synthesis of personality disorder epidemiology, offering the foundation needed to inform future global estimates and policy responses.

### DSM-5 borderline personality disorder: at the border between a dimensional and a categorical view [^1173Zqj4]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Recently, the DSM-5 Personality Disorders Workgroup offered its proposed revision for borderline personality disorder (BPD) and other personality disorder types (http://www.dsm5.org). According to the workgroup, this revision reflects an attempt to address excessive comorbidity among personality disorders, place personality pathology on continua, and replace individual behavioral criteria with personality traits. Essentially, the committee proposes a hybrid model of BPD (ie, categorical and dimensional)-one that combines the notion of a borderline "type" with supplemental dimensional ratings of relevant personality traits. In this article, we review recent findings on the dimensionality of BPD from phenotypic, genetic, and endophenotypic perspectives. Finally, we evaluate the current DSM-5 proposal for diagnosing BPD-one that ostensibly combines a categorical and dimensional perspective-in light of these findings.

### Borderline personality disorder: a comprehensive review of diagnosis and clinical presentation, etiology, treatment, and current controversies [^1145FCEd]. World Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) was introduced in the DSM-III in 1980. From the DSM-III to the DSM-5, no major changes have occurred in its defining criteria. The disorder is characterized by instability of self-image, interpersonal relationships and affects. Further symptoms include impulsivity, intense anger, feelings of emptiness, strong abandonment fears, suicidal or self-mutilation behavior, and transient stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms. There is evidence that BPD can be reliably diagnosed and differentiated from other mental disorders by semi-structured interviews. The disorder is associated with considerable functional impairment, intensive treatment utilization, and high societal costs. The risk of self-mutilation and suicide is high. In the general adult population, the lifetime prevalence of BPD has been reported to be from 0.7 to 2.7%, while its prevalence is about 12% in outpatient and 22% in inpatient psychiatric services. BPD is significantly associated with other mental disorders, including depressive disorders, substance use disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, bulimia nervosa, and other personality disorders. There is convincing evidence to suggest that the interaction between genetic factors and adverse childhood experiences plays a central role in the etiology of BPD. In spite of considerable research, the neurobiological underpinnings of the disorder remain to be clarified. Psychotherapy is the treatment of choice for BPD. Various approaches have been empirically supported in randomized controlled trials, including dialectical behavior therapy, mentalization-based therapy, transference-focused therapy, and schema therapy. No approach has proved to be superior to others. Compared to treatment as usual, psychotherapy has proved to be more efficacious, with effect sizes between 0.50 and 0.65 with regard to core BPD symptom severity. However, almost half of the patients do not respond sufficiently to psychotherapy, and further research in this area is warranted. It is not clear whether some patients may benefit more from one psychotherapeutic approach than from others. No evidence is available consistently showing that any psychoactive medication is efficacious for the core features of BPD. For discrete and severe comorbid anxiety or depressive symptoms or psychotic-like features, pharmacotherapy may be useful. Early diagnosis and treatment of BPD can reduce individual suffering and societal costs. However, more high-quality studies are required, in both adolescents and adults. This review provides a comprehensive update of the BPD diagnosis and clinical characterization, risk factors, neurobiology, cognition, and management. It also discusses the current controversies concerning the disorder, and highlights the areas in which further research is needed.

### Borderline personality disorder: associations with psychiatric disorders, somatic illnesses, trauma, and adverse behaviors [^114KNyvu]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [DSM] terminology), or Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (International Classification of Diseases [ICD] terminology), is a serious psychiatric disorder estimated to affect 1.7% of the worldwide population. The core features of this diagnosis include: unstable interpersonal relationships, recurring self-harm, and emotional dysregulation.

Receiving a BPD diagnosis has been repeatedly associated with a high degree of psychiatric and somatic comorbidities, traumatic events, and criminal behavior. These results have shaped the clinical perception and research directions of BPD, however specific estimates across psychiatric disorders, somatic illnesses, trauma, and adverse behavior have never been comprehensively presented in one study. Moreover, the majority of past studies were limited to smaller clinical samples or cross-sectional community samples, which did not allow for unselected samples nor longitudinal data. Additional longitudinal trait-based epidemiological studies have examined BPD symptoms in twins, however, few participants reached the full diagnostic criteria and thus may not be reflective of individuals with severe BPD symptoms. Therefore, it is of interest to examine these estimates in a representative and well-powered population-based study in order to provide the context for a BPD diagnosis and reframe misconceptions.

Psychiatric disorders

Psychiatric comorbidities are the rule rather than the exception in patients with BPD. A Swedish national study reported that 95.7% of individuals with a BPD diagnosis had a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis. Mood disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), impulsive disorders, and bipolar disorders are commonly associated with BPD symptoms and diagnosis. Precise estimates for these comorbidities are lacking, especially for rare and serious disorders, e.g. psychotic disorders.

Somatic illnesses

Individuals with BPD use health care services at a higher rate than those with other personality disorders, and even elevated BPD symptoms are associated with receiving disability. BPD has been linked to poor somatic health, such as obesity, diabetes, gastrointestinal disease, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic pain, and sexually transmitted infections. It is likely that somatic illnesses associated with BPD have been overlooked in smaller studies, for example, infertility. Moreover, patients often perceive the severity of their illness worse than reports based on medical records, highlighting the importance of objective measurement.

### Neurocognitive features in subgroups of bipolar disorder [^114hF913]. Bipolar Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

The age range for the onset of BD is very wide, with no gender differences. Previous research has focused on early versus late onset, but recent large multisite studies have identified three potential age at onset-based subgroups with different clinical presentation, across different cultural settings and birth cohorts–: i.e. early onset (mean age at onset ≈ 17 years), intermediate onset (mean age at onset ≈ 26 years), and late onset (mean age at onset ≈ 42 years). The characteristics of the disorder may vary with the age at onset, and those with an early onset appear as a separate subgroup with specific clinical manifestations including higher recurrence rates of mood episodes, more elevated episodes at least in BD-I, more often depressive onsets, more suicide attempts, higher risk for comorbid borderline personality disorder, higher rates of psychotic symptoms, more frequent neurocognitive impairment, more BD-I than BD-II, and more often a family history of BD,–compared to patients with later onsets.

Thus, there is considerable empirical evidence of subgroups in BD that are associated with differences in clinical course and outcome. There has, however, been limited attention paid to the possibility that the different subgroups describe overlapping phenomena, as indicated by several characteristics common to the suggested groups. Even if we focused here on different aspects or subgroups of a specific disorder, some of the same validating principles should apply here, as for disease entities. Suggested validation criteria for psychiatric illness can be divided into three major categories: antecedent validators (family history, demographic, and precipitating factors); concurrent validators (psychological factors derived from, for example, symptom interviews); and predictive validators (relapse, treatment response, and other course descriptions). As the definitions of the proposed subgroups encompass either antecedent and predictive characteristics (age at onset, type, and order of episodes) or antecedent and concurrent clinical syndromes (for BD-I/BD-II and history of psychosis), differentiation based on these characteristics may increase the risk for tautological conclusions. A step forward could be to show subgroup differences in concurrent characteristics that are not directly associated with criteria for subgroup formation. One candidate here is neurocognitive functioning.

### Borderline personality disorder [^115hZNLw]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Borderline personality disorder is characterised by a pervasive pattern of instability in affect regulation, impulse control, interpersonal relationships, and self-image. Clinical signs of the disorder include emotional dysregulation, impulsive aggression, repeated self-injury, and chronic suicidal tendencies, which make these patients frequent users of mental-health resources. Causal factors are only partly known, but genetic factors and adverse events during childhood, such as physical and sexual abuse, contribute to the development of the disorder. Dialectical behaviour therapy and psychodynamic partial hospital programmes are effective treatments for out-of-control patients, and drug therapy can reduce depression, anxiety, and impulsive aggression. More research is needed for the understanding and management of this disabling clinical condition. Current strategies are focusing on the neurobiological underpinnings of the disorder and the development and dissemination of better and more cost-effective treatments to clinicians.

### The prevalence and predictors of bipolar and borderline personality disorders comorbidity: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Mw8zR]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Data about the prevalence of borderline personality (BPD) and bipolar (BD) disorders comorbidity are scarce and the boundaries remain controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the prevalence of BPD in BD and BD in people with BPD.

Methods

Two independent authors searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library from inception till November 4, 2015. Articles reporting the prevalence of BPD and BD were included. A random effects meta-analysis and meta-regression were conducted.

Results

Overall, 42 papers were included: 28 considering BPD in BD and 14 considering BD in BPD. The trim and fill adjusted analysis demonstrated the prevalence of BPD among 5273 people with BD (39.94 ± 11.78 years, 44% males) was 21.6% (95% CI 17.0–27.1). Higher comorbid BPD in BD were noted in BD II participants (37.7%, 95% CI 21.9–56.6, studies = 6) and North American studies (26.2%, 95% CI 18.7–35.3, studies = 11). Meta regression established that a higher percentage of males and higher mean age significantly (p < 0.05) predicted a lower prevalence of comorbid BPD in BD participants. The trim and fill adjusted prevalence of BD among 1814 people with BPD (32.22 ± 7.35 years, 21.5% male) was 18.5% (95% CI 12.7–26.1).

Limitations

Paucity of longitudinal/control group studies and accurate treatment records.

Conclusions

BPD-BD comorbidity is common, with approximately one in five people experiencing a comorbid diagnosis. Based on current diagnostic constructs, and a critical interpretation of results, both qualitative and quantitative syntheses of the evidence prompt out the relevance of differences rather similarities between BD and BPD.

### Somatic symptom disorder: a scoping review on the empirical evidence of a new diagnosis [^116JebdU]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In 2013, the diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder (SSD) was introduced into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). This review aims to comprehensively synthesize contemporary evidence related to SSD.

Methods

A scoping review was conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library. The main inclusion criteria were SSD and publication in the English language between 01/2009 and 05/2020. Systematic search terms also included subheadings for the DSM-5 text sections; i.e. diagnostic features, prevalence, development and course, risk and prognostic factors, culture, gender, suicide risk, functional consequences, differential diagnosis, and comorbidity.

Results

Eight hundred and eighty-two articles were identified, of which 59 full texts were included for analysis. Empirical evidence supports the reliability, validity, and clinical utility of SSD diagnostic criteria, but the further specification of the psychological SSD B-criteria criteria seems necessary. General population studies using self-report questionnaires reported mean frequencies for SSD of 12.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 12.5–13.3%], while prevalence studies based on criterion standard interviews are lacking. SSD was associated with increased functional impairment, decreased quality of life, and high comorbidity with anxiety and depressive disorders. Relevant research gaps remain regarding developmental aspects, risk and prognostic factors, suicide risk as well as culture- and gender-associated issues.

Conclusions

Strengths of the SSD diagnosis are its good reliability, validity, and clinical utility, which substantially improved on its predecessors. SSD characterizes a specific patient population that is significantly impaired both physically and psychologically. However, substantial research gaps exist, e.g. regarding SSD prevalence assessed with criterion standard diagnostic interviews.

Full text of the manuscript is not available

Study selection and data management

A bespoke data extraction form was developed in Microsoft Excel prior manuscript review. Two independent authors (BD, NA) performed all the initial screening steps on the pre-defined eligibility criteria, and disagreements were solved through discussion with a third reviewer (SM). No publication or language restrictions were applied. Title and abstract screening were conducted using the Endnote X9 reference management tool for full text retrieval. Authors independently searched the full-text articles for inclusion in the review. BD and NA managed and extracted relevant data in duplicate from each eligible study on the extraction form relating to relevant study information (e.g. sample characteristics, aims, number of databases sourced and searched, type of factor studied and outcomes) and risk of bias quality assessment. The results of the extracted data were then cross-checked.

Risk of bias assessment

Two authors (BD, NA) independently assessed the methodological quality of each included SR and MA using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR; Shea et al.).

Data synthesis and analysis

Data were qualitatively synthesised within the review as the data were not suitable for quantitative synthesis due to the high heterogeneity among reviews.

### Personality disorder coverage, prevalence, and convergence: do the's two models of personality disorder identify the same patients? [^111wppy9]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Problems with DSM-5 -Section II's traditional, categorical model of personality disorders (PDs) are well known, particularly (a) high levels of comorbidity among PDs and with clinical syndromes, all of which are supposed to be distinct disorders and (b) significant within-PD heterogeneity, which undermines the expectation that each personality disorder is a coherent entity. One major goal of the Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD) in Section-III, 'Emerging Measures and Models', was to address these shortcomings. It offers a PD conceptualization with two main elements: Criterion A – impairment in personality functioning (self- and/or interpersonal functioning) – which is expressed via Criterion B – one or more pathological-range personality traits. Both criteria are dimensional, spanning from no impairment and adaptive-range traits to extreme impairment and pathological expression of one or more personality traits.

To provide a bridge from the traditional model, the AMPD also includes six specific PDs: Antisocial, Avoidant, Borderline, Narcissistic, Obsessive-compulsive, and Schizotypal PD. Each is defined by a specific version of moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning and a particular set of traits with a specific number and configuration of traits required for diagnosis. Finally, the AMPD includes PD-Trait Specified (PD-TS) for specification of PD in anyone meeting the general PD criteria. (Note that per the AMPD, PD-TS should be used only when individuals meet the general PD criteria but not the criteria for any specific PD. However, previous research (Clark et al.) has demonstrated the utility of an expanded definition of PD-TS.) Notably, these AMPD diagnoses suffer from the same problems of comorbidity and heterogeneity as those in Section II (see Tables 1 and 2), with the one difference that the reasons for the comorbidity and heterogeneity are more transparent (see Lynam & Widiger, for an excellent example of how traits explain comorbidity).

### Sex differences in personality disorders [^115RYZca]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review aims to give an overview on the current literature on sex differences in personality disorders and to highlight the potential of dimensional approaches.

Recent Findings

Empirical findings on sex differences in personality disorders are inconsistent and appear to be highly dependent on study settings. Current studies have mainly focused on borderline and antisocial personality disorder and the question whether these are sex-specific representations of a common substrate. In general, sexes differ in the manifestation of personality disorders as well as in comorbidities. Criticism of the established categorical model led to an additional dimensional model of personality disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. Investigations on sex differences in personality disorders are sparse and mainly limited to antisocial and borderline personality disorder. The introduction of a dimensional model offers the chance to re-think the construct of "personality disorder" and thereby also opens the possibility for a better understanding of sex differences.

### Does the presence of one feature of borderline personality disorder have clinical significance? Implications for dimensional ratings of personality disorders [^116fnKtQ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

In the draft proposal for DSM-5, the Work Group for Personality and Personality Disorders recommended that dimensional ratings of personality disorders replace DSM-IV's categorical approach toward classification. If a dimensional rating of personality disorder pathology is to be adopted, then the clinical significance of minimal levels of pathology should be established before they are formally incorporated into the diagnostic system because of the potential unforeseen consequences of such ratings. In the present report from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project, we examined the low end of the severity dimension and compared psychiatric outpatients with 0 or 1 DSM-IV criterion for borderline personality disorder on various indices of psychosocial morbidity.

Method

Three thousand two hundred psychiatric outpatients were evaluated with semistructured diagnostic interviews for DSM-IV Axis I and Axis II disorders. The present report is based on the 1,976 patients meeting 0 or 1 DSM-IV criterion for borderline personality disorder.

Results

The reliability of determining if a patient was rated with 0 or 1 criterion for borderline personality disorder was good (κ = 0.70). Compared to patients with 0 borderline personality disorder criteria, patients with 1 criterion had significantly more current Axis I disorders (P < .001), suicide attempts (P < .01), suicidal ideation at the time of the evaluation (P < .001), psychiatric hospitalizations (P < .001), and time missed from work due to psychiatric illness (P < .001) and lower ratings on the Global Assessment of Functioning (P < .001).

Conclusions

Low-severity levels of borderline personality disorder pathology, defined as the presence of 1 criterion, can be determined reliably and have validity.

### The frequency of personality disorders in psychiatric patients [^112Zfo21]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Community-based epidemiological studies of psychiatric disorders provide important information about the public health burden of these problems; however, because seeking treatment is related to a number of clinical and demographic factors, studies of the frequency and correlates of psychiatric disorders in the general population should be replicated in clinical populations to provide the practicing clinician with information that might have more direct clinical utility. Diagnosing co-occuring personality disorders in psychiatric patients with an Axis I disorder is clinically important because of their association with the duration, recurrence, and outcome of Axis I disorders. This article reviews clinical epidemiological studies of personality disorders and finds that in studies using semi-structured diagnostic interviews, approximately half of the patients interviewed have a personality disorder. Thus, as a group, personality disorders are among the most frequent disorders treated by psychiatrists.

### Problematic boundaries in the diagnosis of bipolar disorder: the interface with borderline personality disorder [^116Kf9Ur]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

It is clinically important to recognize both bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder (BPD) in patients seeking treatment for depression, and it is important to distinguish between the two. The most studied question on the relationship between BPD and bipolar disorder is their diagnostic concordance. Across studies approximately 10% of patients with BPD had bipolar I disorder and another 10% had bipolar II disorder. Likewise, approximately 20% of bipolar II patients were diagnosed with BPD, though only 10% of bipolar I patients were diagnosed with BPD. While the comorbidity rates are substantial, each disorder is, nonetheless, diagnosed in the absence of the other in the vast majority of cases (80–90%). In studies examining personality disorders broadly, other personality disorders were more commonly diagnosed in bipolar patients than was BPD. Likewise, the converse is also true: other axis I disorders such as major depression, substance abuse, and post-traumatic stress disorder are more commonly diagnosed in patients with BPD than is bipolar disorder. Studies comparing patients with BPD and bipolar disorder find significant differences on a range of variables. These findings challenge the notion that BPD is part of the bipolar spectrum. While a substantial literature has documented problems with the under-recognition and under-diagnosis of bipolar disorder, more recent studies have found evidence of bipolar disorder over-diagnosis and that BPD is a significant contributor to over-diagnosis. Re-conceptualizing the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition, diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder as a type of test, rather than the final word on diagnosis, shifts the diagnostician from thinking solely whether a patient does or does not have a disorder to considering the risks of false-positive and false-negative diagnoses, and the ease by which each type of diagnostic error can be corrected by longitudinal observation.

### Personality disorder diagnosis [^112a3bZc]. World Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Every person has a characteristic manner of thinking, feeling, and relating to others. Some of these personality traits can be so dysfunctional as to warrant a diagnosis of personality disorder. The World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases (ICD- 10) includes ten personality disorder diagnoses. Three issues of particular importance for the diagnosis of personality disorders are their differentiation from other mental disorders, from general personality functioning, and from each other. Each of these issues is discussed in turn, and it is suggested that personality disorders are more accurately and effectively diagnosed as maladaptive variants of common personality traits.

### Prevalence, correlates, disability, and comorbidity of DSM-IV borderline personality disorder: results from the wave 2 national epidemiologic survey on alcohol and related conditions [^114V8XAx]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To present nationally representative findings on prevalence, sociodemographic correlates, disability, and comorbidity of borderline personality disorder (BPD) among men and women.

Method

Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 34,653 adults participating in the 2004–2005 Wave 2 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. Personality disorder diagnoses were made using the Wave 2 Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule-DSM-IV Version.

Results

Prevalence of lifetime BPD was 5.9% (99% CI = 5.4 to 6.4). There were no differences in the rates of BPD among men (5.6%, 99% CI = 5.0 to 6.2) and women (6.2%, 99% CI = 5.6 to 6.9). BPD was more prevalent among Native American men, younger and separated/divorced/widowed adults, and those with lower incomes and education and was less prevalent among Hispanic men and women and Asian women. BPD was associated with substantial mental and physical disability, especially among women. High co-occurrence rates of mood and anxiety disorders with BPD were similar. With additional comorbidity controlled for, associations with bipolar disorder and schizotypal and narcissistic personality disorders remained strong and significant (odds ratios ≥ 4.3). Associations of BPD with other specific disorders were no longer significant or were considerably weakened.

Conclusions

BPD is much more prevalent in the general population than previously recognized, is equally prevalent among men and women, and is associated with considerable mental and physical disability, especially among women. Unique and common factors may differentially contribute to disorder-specific comorbidity with BPD, and some of these associations appear to be sex-specific. There is a need for future epidemiologic, clinical, and genetically informed studies to identify unique and common factors that underlie disorder-specific comorbidity with BPD. Important sex differences observed in rates of BPD and associations with BPD can inform more focused, hypothesis-driven investigations of these factors.

### Epidemiology of personality disorders [^117E9Bus]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The prevalence of personality disorders (PDs) in the nonclinical community population was largely unknown through the early 1990s. Over the past 10 years the epidemiology of PD in the community has been resolved through the study of large, nonclinical populations that have used validated structured psychiatric interviews designed specifically for PDs. The median prevalence for "any PD" is 10.6%, which is reasonably consistent across six major studies spanning three nations. Because 1 in 10 people suffers from a diagnosable PD and the disorders are associated with high levels of service use, it follows that personality pathology represents a major public health concern, a major research target for psychopathologists, and a consuming focus for clinicians.

2.4 Selection Process and Data Collection

The study selection process was carried out by two independent assessors (TP and FTE) in two steps, taking into account eligibility criteria. The first step was based on titles and abstracts, and for the second one, we retrieved and analysed full texts of the articles that remained after the initial selection. We resolved discrepancies by consensual decisions or through the intervention of a third assessor (FN). At the end of the selection process, we extracted data using a predefined form that included the following elements:
Study characteristics including first author name, publication year, study design, study location (country and region) and data collection period;
Participants characteristics, including the percentage of females, whether or not adolescents were included, mean age, sample size and types of EDs studied;
Information on the instrument/tool used to identify (diagnose) BPD and EDs among people with BPD;
Prevalence data or data that allowed the prevalence of EDs to be calculated in people with BPD.

In addition, we sought information that would allow us to assess the methodological quality of included studies.

2.5 Study Risk of Bias Assessment

The risk of bias of included studies was assessed independently by two investigators (TP and FTE) using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist for studies reporting prevalence data (Moola et al.). This checklist is designed to assess the following nine aspects: (a) sample frame adequacy, (b) recruitment method, (c) sample size, (d) participants and the setting, (e) coverage, (f) diagnostic methods, (g) the reliability and standardisation of measurements, (h) statistical analysis and (i) the response rate. Specific questions correspond to each aspect/item, with 'yes', 'no', or 'unclear' as response options. The total amount of 'yes' allow to be classified as low risk of bias (≥ 70%), moderate risk of bias (≥ 50% and < 70%) and high risk of bias (< 50%).

### The influence of borderline personality traits on clinical outcomes in bipolar disorder [^115hPD2z]. Bipolar Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Systematic reviews suggest comorbid borderline personality disorder is present in approximately 20% of individuals who have bipolar disorder, but current diagnostic systems demonstrate a move towards dimensional rather than categorical approaches to classifying personality pathology. We aimed to examine the presence and severity of borderline personality traits in bipolar I and bipolar II disorder, and to explore associations between the presence/severity of borderline personality traits and clinical outcomes in bipolar disorder.

Methods

Borderline personality traits were measured in 1447 individuals with DSM-IV bipolar disorder (1008 bipolar I disorder and 439 bipolar II disorder) using the Borderline Evaluation of Severity over Time (BEST) questionnaire. Lifetime clinical outcomes were assessed via Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) semi-structured interview and clinical case notes.

Results

Borderline personality traits were common in both bipolar disorder groups, with 86.2% participants reporting at least one trait. These included traits that overlap with (eg mood instability) and those that are distinct from the symptoms of bipolar disorder (eg fear of abandonment). Borderline personality traits were significantly more frequent and more severe in bipolar II disorder compared to bipolar I disorder. More severe borderline traits, and even the presence of a single borderline personality trait, were significantly associated with younger age of bipolar disorder onset and higher prevalence of lifetime alcohol misuse in both bipolar disorder groups.

Conclusions

The presence of comorbid borderline personality traits should be considered in the management of all patients with bipolar disorder irrespective of whether criteria for a categorical borderline personality disorder diagnosis are met.

### A life span perspective on borderline personality disorder [^116vapp8]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The term borderline was first coined by Adolph Stern in 1938 when he identified a "border line group of patients" who "fit frankly neither into the psychotic nor into the psychoneurotic group, and are extremely difficult to handle by any psychotherapeutic method". The acceptance of borderline personality disorder (BPD) as a mental disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) 3rd edition in 1980 has stimulated both clinical and scientific attention. BPD is characterized by impulsivity, self-harm, suicidality, and emotional and interpersonal instability. DSM-5, like DSM-IV, allows diagnosing BPD under the age of 18, if the symptoms are pervasive, persistent, not limited to a particular developmental stage or another mental disorder, and if the symptoms have been present for at least 1 year.

The categorical DSM concept of BPD, and of personality disorders in general, has been criticized because of its heterogeneity, diagnostic overlap with other disorders, arbitrary threshold, low reliability, and poor empirical base. Factor analytic studies found support for one general factor of personality pathology underlying the nine criteria of BPD. Moreover, BPD presents with many comorbid disorders. Because of these limitations, a growing number of studies focuses on dimensional models of personality disorders, such as the Alternative Model of Personality Disorders (AMPD) in the DSM-5 and the new personality disorder concept of the International Classifications of Diseases 11th Edition (ICD-11). Both models combine a severity dimension of personality pathology and a description of five personality trait domains. In the DSM-5 AMPD, BPD is defined by negative affectivity, disinhibition and psychoticism, and several studies have indicated general support for these traits proposed for BPD. Interestingly, ICD-11 does not retain any specific personality type with the exception of an optional specifier for "borderline pattern", operationalized as requiring at least five out of nine criteria adapted from the DSM-5 criteria for BPD.

Table 6
Features of depression that may increase suspicion of a bipolar vs unipolar illness

In addition to this under‐diagnosis, there are also concerns that BD may be over‐diagnosed in some circumstances. 41 For instance, the symptoms of borderline personality disorder, substance use disorder (SUD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) overlap significantly those of hypomania/mania, and some reports suggest that patients with these conditions often get misdiagnosed with BD. These conditions also are often comorbid with BD, which makes the diagnosis of this condition often challenging. 42

Validated self‐report instruments, such as the Mood Disorders Questionnaire (MDQ), may be used as a screening tool to flag patients for whom a more detailed assessment is needed. It is important to note, that such tools have poor sensitivity and specificity, especially in community or highly comorbid populations, and will thus have an elevated risk of also flagging those with borderline traits. 43 As such, tools such as the MDQ should be used only as an adjunct for screening clinical populations and not for diagnostic or treatment planning purposes.

To improve the accuracy of diagnosis, it is important that clinicians strictly adhere to diagnostic criteria rather than relying on heuristics. 44 It is important to complete a careful psychiatric history, including in first‐degree relatives, with attention paid to any suspected periods of increased activity, irritability, or other change in behaviours. Collateral information from friends and family members should be included wherever possible. Ongoing monitoring of symptoms, such as mood charting, can also help to detect bipolarity that may only become apparent over time. Confirmation of the diagnosis can then be made more confidently when episodes are prospectively observed.

2.2.5 Comorbidities and mimics

As described in Section 6, patients diagnosed with BD very commonly have one or more comorbid psychiatric diagnoses, with SUDs, impulse control disorders, anxiety disorders, and personality disorders (especially cluster B disorders) particularly common. 45 The presence of comorbidity increases the complexity of the illness and can make an accurate diagnosis even more difficult.

In addition to differentiating BD from other psychiatric diagnoses, alternative causes of mood symptoms, such as personality disorders, medical or neurological conditions, substance use, and medications must be considered in the differential diagnosis (Table 7).

### Guidelines for psychological practice with girls and women [^117VdM2t]. The American Psychologist (2007). Medium credibility.

Guideline 7 — diagnosis and assessment for girls and women states that psychologists strive to assign diagnoses only if and when diagnosis is necessary, use unbiased assessment tools, and incorporate an understanding of the history of misuses and gender biases in diagnosis and assessment. The rationale highlights identified gender bias across clinical judgment, theoretical foundations of assessment, diagnostic processes, psychological assessment measures, and conceptualization of developmental experiences, and notes that diagnoses in DSM-5 are not differentiated by source of distress and that contexts, identities, and experiences of oppression should be considered and integrated in practice. The accompanying literature review reports that many specific diagnoses, including histrionic and borderline personality disorders, have been problematically applied to women and/or girls without consideration of critical contextual factors.

### Is comorbid borderline personality disorder in patients with major depressive episode and bipolarity a developmental subtype? Findings from the international BRIDGE study [^116YbjdN]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The nature of the relationship between bipolar disorder (BD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD) is controversial. The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical profile of patients with BD and comorbid BPD in a world-wide sample selected during a major depressive episode (MDE).

Methods

From a general sample of 5635 in and out-patients with an MDE, who were enrolled in the multicenter, multinational, transcultural BRIDGE study, we identified 2658 subjects who met bipolarity specifier criteria. Bipolar specifier patients with (BPD+) and without (BPD-) comorbid BPD were compared on diagnostic, socio-demographic, familial and clinical characteristics.

Results

386 patients (14.5%) met criteria for BPD. A diagnosis of BD according to DSM-IV criteria was significantly more frequent in the BPD- than in BPD+, while similar rates in the two groups occurred using DSM-IV-Modified criteria. A subset of the BD criteria with an atypical connotation, such as irritability, mood instability and reactivity to drugs were significantly associated withthe presence of BPD. BPD+ patients were significantly younger than BPD- bipolar patients for age, age at onset of first psychiatric symptoms and age at first diagnosis of depression. They also reported significantly more comorbid Alcohol and Substance abuse, Anxiety disorders, Eating Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. In comparison with BPD-, BPD+ patients showed significantly more psychotic symptoms, history of suicide attempts, mixed states, mood reactivity, atypical features, seasonality of mood episodes, antidepressants induced mood lability and irritability, and resistance to antidepressant treatments.

Limitations

Centers were selected for their strong mood disorder clinical programs, recall bias is possible with a cross-sectional design, and participating psychiatrists received limited training.

Conclusions

We confirm in a large sample of BD patients with MDE the high prevalence of patients who meet DSM-IV criteria for BPD. Further prospective researches should clarify whether the mood reactivity and instability captured by BPD DSM-IV criteria are distinguishable from the subjective mood of an instable, dysphoric, irritable manic/hypomanic/mixed state or simply represent a phenotypic variant of BD, related to developmental factors.

### Understanding the development of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder in young people: a meta-review of systematic reviews [^11418UrU]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Differential diagnosis between bipolar disorder (BD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD) is often difficult due to the high frequency of comorbidity and overlap of symptoms between the two disorders (Baryshnikov et al.). The prevalence of BD and BPD was 21.6% and 18.5% respectively (Fornaro et al.). There is an ongoing debate over whether BPD should be considered as part of the spectrum of BD disorders (Akiskal; Benazzi; Deltito et al; McGlashan; Zimmerman, Ruggero, Chelminski, & Young,) or not (Bassett et al; Paris & Black).

Although BD and BPD are defined as distinct psychopathologies in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association,) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD; World Health Organisation,), there are many common features between these disorders that contribute to diagnostic confusion. The common features that are frequently stated in the literature are affective instability (AI), impulsivity, troubled relationships, distractibility, irritability, suicidality, flight of thoughts and childhood adversity (John & Sharma). The clinical evidence against for the existence of a 'bipolar-borderline continuum' argue that although there are common symptoms between the two, they present these traits differently (e.g. Henry et al; Renaud, Corbalan, and Beaulieu). However, in practical terms these distinctions are far from clear, particularly when there is no history of manic episodes (Sanches). For instance, differences in intensity or frequency might exist when comparing the two conditions for AI, but it is also unclear whether the anger and anxiety that BPD patients experience are distinct in nature than the mood experienced in a dysphoric or irritable manic state (MacKinnon & Pies). A concern that has compounded these issues is the increasing recognition that mood can be highly variable in people with BD outside of frank manic or depressive episodes, a move away from the traditional view of euthymia in BD (Bonsall, Wallace-Hadrill, Geddes, Goodwin, & Holmes).

### Association of borderline personality disorder criteria with suicide attempts among US adults [^112amCw9]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Rates of suicide are increasing. Although borderline personality disorder (BPD) and other psychiatric disorders are associated with suicide, there is a dearth of epidemiological research on associations between BPD and suicide attempts (SAs). Delineating the SA risk associated with BPD and its specific criteria in a nationally representative sample of individuals could inform recognition and intervention efforts for SAs.

Objective

To examine the association of a BPD diagnosis and specific BPD criteria with SAs in US adults.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study analyzed data from the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III (NESARC-III), a psychiatric epidemiological survey of noninstitutionalized US adults aged 18 or older conducted from April 2012 to June 2013. Eligible adults were randomly selected from households within census-defined counties or groups of counties. Data were analyzed from December 2020 to January 2021.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Prevalence of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) psychiatric and personality disorders, BPD and its specific criteria, SAs, and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), as assessed by structured diagnostic or clinical interviews; prevalence is expressed as weighted means. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression was used to compare the risk of lifetime and past-year SAs by BPD diagnosis and by each specific BPD criterion. Analyses were adjusted for demographic and clinical factors, including psychiatric comorbidity, age at BPD onset, and ACEs.

Results

Of 36 309 respondents, 20 442 (56.3%) were women and 52.9% were non-Hispanic White; the mean (SD) age was 45.6 (17.5) years. The prevalence (SE) of lifetime and past-year SAs among participants with a lifetime diagnosis of BPD based on original NESARC-III diagnostic codes was 22.7% (0.8%) (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 8.40; 95% CI, 7.53–9.37) and 2.1% (0.2%) (AOR, 11.77; 95% CI, 7.86–17.62), respectively. With use of diagnostic codes requiring 5 BPD criteria to meet social-occupational dysfunction, prevalence (SE) of lifetime and past-year SAs was 30.4% (1.1%) (AOR, 9.15; 95% CI, 7.99–10.47) and 3.2% (0.4%) (AOR, 11.42; 95% CI, 7.71–16.91), respectively. After excluding the BPD criterion of self-injurious behavior (to eliminate criterion overlap), the prevalence (SE) of lifetime and past-year SAs was 28.1% (1.1%) (AOR, 7.61; 95% CI, 6.67–8.69) and 3.0% (0.4%) (AOR, 9.83; 95% CI, 6.63–14.55), respectively. In analyses adjusting for sociodemographic variables, psychiatric disorders, age at BPD onset, and ACEs, BPD diagnosis and specific BPD criteria of self-injurious behaviors and chronic feelings of emptiness were significantly associated with increased odds of lifetime SAs (BPD diagnosis: AOR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.79–2.45; self-injurious behaviors: AOR, 24.28; 95 CI, 16.83–32.03; feelings of emptiness: AOR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.16–2.14) and past-year SAs (BPD diagnosis: AOR, 11.42; 95% CI, 7.71–16.91; self-injurious behaviors: AOR, 19.32; 95% CI, 5.22–71.58; feelings of emptiness: AOR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.08–3.66). In analysis with BPD criteria simultaneously entered (excluding self-injurious behavior), chronic feelings of emptiness were significantly associated with increased odds of lifetime SAs (AOR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.23–2.24) and past-year SAs (AOR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.18–5.08).

Conclusions and Relevance

In a national sample of adults, after adjusting for demographic and clinical variables, a BPD diagnosis and the specific BPD criteria of self-injurious behaviors and chronic emptiness were significantly associated with increased SA risk. Although BPD is a complex heterogeneous diagnosis, the results of this study suggest that the criteria of self-injurious behaviors and chronic feelings of emptiness should be routinely considered in suicide risk assessment.

### Clinical implications of ICD-11 for diagnosing and treating personality disorders [^116nYXtE]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The International Classification of Diseases 11th revision (ICD-11) introduced a new approach to personality disorders and related traits. This paper reviews recent literature on the assessment of ICD-11 personality disorders and implications for clinical diagnosis, decision-making, and treatment.

Recent Findings

We reviewed findings on two measures developed for the ICD-11 model of personality dysfunction and six inventories for the ICD-11 trait specifiers. The psychometric qualities of these tools are promising, and they allow for both rapid screening and fine-grained assessment. Implications for clinical diagnosis and treatment of personality disorders are reviewed including utility for forensic practice. Based on evidence and our experience, we provide some recommendations for severity- and trait-informed interventions. Initial evidence supports the available instruments for assessing ICD-11 personality disorders. More research is needed including development of clinician-rating forms and diagnostic interviews as well as treatment protocols and trials based on the new ICD-11 classification.

### Borderline personality disorder: associations with psychiatric disorders, somatic illnesses, trauma, and adverse behaviors [^116ffS1G]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Trauma and adverse behaviors

Up to 90% of patients with BPD are estimated to have a history of childhood trauma. BPD has been linked to an increased risk for sexual abuse victimization in adulthood and physical trauma resulting from accidents. However, the association between BPD and other trauma types, e.g. death of a family member, is unclear. The relationship between trauma and BPD is theorized to be bidirectional, although the evidence for this is conflicting. Similar to somatic reports, capturing objective measures of trauma would prevent biases that may arise from self-reports.

The association between violent crime and a BPD diagnosis is well documented, however less literature exists on nonviolent offenses. It is unclear which nonviolent offenses are predominant in patients with BPD, although it is likely borne from impulsive actions. As recurrent self-harm is a core feature of BPD, we expect the rate of self-harm requiring medical attention to be higher than the general population. However, a precise estimate from a population sample is unknown.

Sex differences

BPD is predominately diagnosed in females, although evidence suggests that this is largely the result of a diagnostic bias. Moreover, gender differences have been found for symptom expression and comorbidities. Males have a higher prevalence of substance use disorders and antisocial personality disorder and exhibit symptoms related to aggression; while females show increased rates of risky behavior and an increased prevalence of comorbid mood disorders, eating disorders, and PTSD. Males are typically underrepresented in BPD studies, thus potential differences in outcomes and precursors of BPD is of particular importance. Given a diagnostic bias, males would need greater symptom severity in order to be diagnosed, leading to a difference in symptom severity between the sexes. With this, we hypothesize elevated rates across most categories for males with BPD compared to their female counterparts.

Further, this raises etiological questions about the differences between the sexes. With our hypothesis that males with BPD will have more severe symptomatology, we postulate that individuals with a brother diagnosed with BPD will have higher rates of diagnoses and adverse outcomes across all domains compared to those with a sister with a BPD diagnosis, similar to the so-called female protective effect in autism, with the sexes reversed.

Present study

The primary aim of this study was to describe the extent of the association for individuals with BPD and (1) psychiatric disorders, (2) somatic illnesses, and (3) trauma and adverse behaviors in a Swedish nationwide sample. As sensitivity analyses, we examined the temporal order of these associations, sex-specific differences for individuals, and those with siblings diagnosed with BPD.

### Personality disorder coverage, prevalence, and convergence: do the's two models of personality disorder identify the same patients? [^113a1gEk]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 1.
Percentage of comorbid diagnoses between each pair of section II personality disorders

Table 2.
Percentage of comorbid diagnoses between each pair of section-III (AMPD) personality disorders

Regarding comorbidity, the AM-PDs all have Criterion A in common and the Criterion B traits shared by pairs of PDs are a known source of overlap. In contrast, except for a few cases in which Section-II PDs have a criterion in common (e.g. Schizoid and Schizotypal PD share the criterion 'Lacks close friends or confidants other than first-degree relatives'), the reason for comorbidity between Section-II PDs is less clear. Regarding heterogeneity, the average internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's α) of the Section-II PDs in the study sample is 0.67, with an average within-PD criterion r of 0.20. The AM-PDs fare little better: Their average α is also 0.67, with only a slightly higher average within-PD trait r of 0.34.

The difference between the models is again transparency: The Section-II PDs are presumed to be coherent entities, so the fact that they are only moderately so is problematic. In the AMPD, however, variation across the six PDs' consistency v. heterogeneity is based in their component facets. For example, Antisocial PD may have the highest α (0.86) and among the higher average trait-criterion r s (0.46) because its six trait components are three facets from each of two domains (Antagonism and Disinhibition) that are themselves correlated (r = 0.61). In contrast, Borderline PD may be more heterogeneous (i.e. its α = 0.75 and average trait-criterion r = 0.30, somewhat lower than Antisocial PD's) because five of its components come from three different domains (APA; Clark & Watson). Accordingly, when individuals are diagnosed with AMPD Borderline PD, heterogeneity among them may be explained by reference to their trait profiles. Similarly, Section II PD heterogeneity could be explained by reference to which diagnostic criteria are met, but this is not customary practice, perhaps because it requires assessing all 79 diagnostic criteria (i.e. all PD criteria contribute to heterogeneity, not just the focal PD's).

### Prevalence of eating disorders in people with borderline personality disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111N7hNB]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusions

Through this systematic review and meta‐analysis, we found a high prevalence of EDs and their subtypes in patients with BPD. Through subgroup analyses, we found some influencing factors such as screening methods for EDs and BPD identification, study location and exclusive inclusion of women (for AN). Notwithstanding the need to strengthen the data and knowledge on this topic by other studies, this meta‐analytic synthesis draws the attention of clinicians to the need to consider the comorbidity represented by EDs in people with BPD.

5.1 Public Significance

This study highlights the prevalence of EDs across the BPD population. These findings suggest the importance of assessing and monitoring all individuals with borderline personality disorder for the presence of EDs.

### Subthreshold bipolarity: diagnostic issues and challenges [^114Eqz5T]. Bipolar Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Research suggests that current diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorders may fail to include milder, but clinically significant, bipolar syndromes and that a substantial percentage of these conditions are diagnosed, by default, as unipolar major depression. Accordingly, a number of researchers have argued for the upcoming 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) to better account for subsyndromal hypomanic presentations.

Methods

The present paper is a critical review of research on subthreshold bipolarity, and an assessment of some of the challenges that researchers and clinicians might face if the DSM-5 were designed to systematically document subsyndromal hypomanic presentations.

Results

Individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) who display subsyndromal hypomanic features, not concurrent with a major depressive episode, have a more severe course compared to individuals with MDD and no hypomanic features, and more closely resemble individuals with bipolar disorder on a number of clinical validators.

Conclusion

There are clinical and scientific reasons for systematically documenting subsyndromal hypomanic presentations in the assessment and diagnosis of mood disorders. However, these benefits are balanced with important challenges, including (i) the difficulty in reliably identifying subsyndromal hypomanic presentations, (ii) operationalizing subthreshold bipolarity, (iii) differentiating subthreshold bipolarity from borderline personality disorder, (iv) the risk of over-diagnosing bipolar spectrum disorders, and (v) uncertainties about optimal interventions for subthreshold bipolarity.

### The longitudinal course of borderline psychopathology: 6-year prospective follow-up of the phenomenology of borderline personality disorder [^111XAUvd]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The syndromal and subsyndromal phenomenology of borderline personality disorder was tracked over 6 years of prospective follow-up.

Method

The psychopathology of 362 inpatients with personality disorders was assessed with the Revised Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines (DIB-R) and borderline personality disorder module of the Revised Diagnostic Interview for DSM-III-R Personality Disorders. Of these patients, 290 met DIB-R and DSM-III-R criteria for borderline personality disorder and 72 met DSM-III-R criteria for other axis II disorders (and neither criteria set for borderline personality disorder). Most of the borderline patients received multiple treatments before the index admission and during the study. Over 94% of the total surviving subjects were reassessed at 2, 4, and 6 years by interviewers blind to previously collected information.

Results

Of the subjects with borderline personality disorder, 34.5% met the criteria for remission at 2 years, 49.4% at 4 years, 68.6% at 6 years, and 73.5% over the entire follow-up. Only 5.9% of those with remissions experienced recurrences. None of the comparison subjects with other axis II disorders developed borderline personality disorder during follow-up. The patients with borderline personality disorder had declining rates of 24 symptom patterns but remained symptomatically distinct from the comparison subjects. Impulsive symptoms resolved the most quickly, affective symptoms were the most chronic, and cognitive and interpersonal symptoms were intermediate.

Conclusions

These results suggest that symptomatic improvement is both common and stable, even among the most disturbed borderline patients, and that the symptomatic prognosis for most, but not all, severely ill borderline patients is better than previously recognized.

### Personality disorder coverage, prevalence, and convergence: do the's two models of personality disorder identify the same patients? [^115WB2No]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Further, the AMPD advances PD theoretically by distinguishing function from form; specifically, by separating personality dysfunction (Criterion A) – the core aspect of PD that is shared across all personality pathology – from the form that personality dysfunction takes, the way it is expressed via personality traits (Criterion B). That said, although this theoretical distinction has some empirical support (e.g. Hopwood et al; Sharp et al.), most current measures of Criterion A and B overlap considerably. Moreover, results are mixed regarding whether Criterion A has incremental predictive power over Criterion B, whereas Criterion B almost always shows incremental predictive power over Criterion A; plus, Criterion A correlates strongly with clinical syndromes as well as PDs, indicating that current measures of the construct are not specific to PD (Roche & Jaweed; Sleep, Lynam, Widiger, Crowe, & Miller). Thus, taken together, these data – along with considerable other data published since 2013 – suggest that a shift to the AMPD is promising, although there remain areas for improvement, particularly in its assessment.

Practical considerations

In the introduction, we noted that use of a semi-structured interview may be impractical in many clinical settings. However, given the importance of accurate diagnosis, perhaps it is time for the field to determine how best to incorporate reliable and valid measures into standard clinical practice so as to provide a way for clinicians to use the AMPD to characterize all their PD patients' personality pathology, not just the subset that can be described with specific PDs (~60%) or diagnosed unhelpfully with PD-NEC (~40%). (We thank an anonymous reviewer for encouraging us to include this 'editorial' calling for higher standards for assessment in the field.) Some of this responsibility falls on clinicians to adopt 'best practices'. For example, clinicians refer patients for neuropsychological testing rather than judging the degree to which patients may be cognitive impaired based on an unstructured interview. Perhaps a similar standard should be applied to PD assessment, particularly if the AMPD were to be adopted by APA. Currently, the American Psychiatric Association's Clinical Practice Guidelines include only two assessment tools – for the care of patients with schizophrenia and for management of patients at risk for suicide – but perhaps there also should be assessment and treatment guidelines for PD traits, such as the Unified Protocol for the transdiagnostic treatment of negative affectivity (neuroticism; Sauer-Zavala et al.).

### Do eating disorders co-occur with personality disorders? Comparison groups matter [^1111yzRR]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess and compare lifetime rates of occurrence of eating disorders (ED) with four Axis II personality disorders (PD) and with major depressive disorder (MDD) without PD. The eating disorders met criteria outlined in the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).

Method

Six hundred sixty-eight patients recruited for the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study (CLPS) were reliably assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders and the Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorders. The distribution of ED diagnoses was compared among four PD study groups (schizotypal, borderline, avoidant, obsessive-compulsive) and a fifth study group with MDD without any PD.

Results

The distribution of lifetime diagnoses of anorexia nervosa (N = 40), bulimia nervosa (N = 56), and eating disorder not otherwise specified (N = 118) did not differ significantly across the five study groups, between the MDD group versus all PD groups, and among the four PD study groups.

Conclusions

ED diagnoses did not differentially co-occur significantly across common Axis I and II disorders. The pattern of ED lifetime co-occurrence rates demonstrates the powerful influence of base rates and highlights that declarations of comorbidity demand significant variations from base-rate patterns.

### Association of borderline personality disorder criteria with suicide attempts among US adults [^113cNc6x]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Yen and colleagues, also found that certain specific criteria of the BPD diagnosis were significantly associated with SAs. This finding is important for multiple reasons. First, BPD is a complex heterogeneous diagnostic construct. Because the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) (DSM-5)requires that any 5 of the 9 possible criteria for BPD be met, there are at least 126 possible combinations of criteria that could indicate a minimal threshold for the diagnosis. In addition, the 9 criteria (unstable relationships, affective instability, abandonment fears, anger, identity disturbance, chronic emptiness, dissociation, impulsivity, and self-injurious behavior) are heterogeneous, comprising traits, behaviors, and symptoms. One of the BPD criteria involves repetitive self-injurious behavior, which both can reflect SAs and is associated with SAs, and this creates the problem of criterion overlap when trying to assess risk for SAs. These complexities notwithstanding, delineating specific features of BPD that are associated with increased risk for SAs could clinically inform early identification and targeted intervention efforts. Research with diverse clinical samples has produced isolated findings suggesting associations between SAs and some of these variables, including affective instability, dissociation, impulsivity, and chronic emptiness. Yen and colleagues, in their analysis of all BPD criteria (adjusting for sociodemographic and related clinical variables), found that the specific criteria of identity disturbance, chronic feelings of emptiness, and frantic efforts to avoid abandonment were significantly associated with SAs.

Various potential confounds may limit the representativeness of findings from treatment-seeking and clinical studies. Persons who seek treatment for a concern and who also participate in research may differ from persons who do not seek treatment or choose not to participate in research at the treatment facility. Complex factors characterize treatment seeking, and various disparities (eg, racial/ethnic, sex, and economic) exist for different types of facilities for all psychiatric disorders. Representativeness of clinical samples has also long been questionedbecause of the well-known mathematical bias (ie, Berkson bias) that a person with 2 or more disorders can seek treatment for either disorder as well as the related, yet distinct, clinical biases whereby different comorbidities are associated with whether treatments are sought, and if so, for which disorder. Given high rates of comorbidity among patients with BPD, studies with clinical samples may be especially confounded and skewed by more severe clinical presentations.

### Borderline personality disorder symptom networks across adolescent and adult clinical samples: examining symptom centrality and replicability [^113Xysm4]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Replications across more samples with age and BPD severity differences are needed to test whether these sample characteristics are reliably linked to these differences in network characteristics or shared markers for varied prognoses. Future work should include multiple adolescent samples of varying levels of BPD, as well as samples of older adults, to better examine network constancy and changes over developmental course. Of note, none of these differences was sufficient to prevent strong correlations between the networks across all samples, suggesting an overall robust syndrome.

It is important to note that although network models are based on a causal theory, all analyses in the present manuscript are cross-sectional and correlational, and therefore causal inferences cannot be made from these findings. Rather, a key takeaway is that across each of these samples, generally similar patterns of associations between these symptoms emerge. These findings support a reproducible BPD syndrome, although given typically high rates of diagnostic co-occurrence with BPD, we acknowledge that this syndrome may be a broad indicator of personality pathology in general, and that more nuanced differences might emerge if symptoms of other disorders were also modeled (Sharp et al.). To test hypotheses that these pathways may be causal, longitudinal data are needed to model network development and flux over time, particularly across key developmental time periods such as adolescence. In addition, variables that may validate causal explanations (e.g. neurobiological data) would be important in future work. Another potential limitation in the analytic approach includes the potential for the NCT procedure to have limited power, so the null findings should be conservatively considered. Future research with other samples may benefit from utilizing new analytic approaches to compare networks as these are developed and validated.

A strength of this study is the use of three clinical samples with differing levels of care and recruitment approaches; however, generalizability is limited given that the samples are from two geographic regions in the US with majority White participants. It is essential to extend this line of enquiry to samples representing all forms of diversity that may affect BPD network structure, with adequate numbers to test whether differences exist across those groups or based on environmental factors. Although a strength of the study was the use of validated clinical interviews to establish BPD criteria and the assessment tools had notable similarities across samples (clinician-administered, semi-structured, delivered by experienced and trained interviewers who were monitored to prevent drift), the exact interviews and rating scales varied slightly between samples, and this may have affected results. Using interviews with the same coding scales would be ideal in future work.

### Evidence for a single latent class of diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders borderline personality pathology [^114xyZAk]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) has been described as clinically heterogeneous, with numerous subtypes of the disorder posited. The present study investigated this potential heterogeneity by conducting both confirmatory factor analysis and latent class analysis of consensus ratings of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) Revised Third Edition BPD criteria in a mixed clinical and nonclinical sample (n = 411). Confirmatory factor analysis results suggested that a single factor fit the data most parsimoniously. Latent class analysis results supported 2 latent classes: those with a high likelihood of BPD symptoms (n = 171) and those with a low likelihood (n = 240). The borderline latent class was more inclusive than diagnoses made based on DSM-III-R thresholds and improved prediction of symptom severity and interpersonal dysfunction, suggesting the clinical importance of 3 or more BPD criteria. Future research on subtypes of BPD may benefit by focusing on variables that supplement the DSM criteria.

However, there also are notable differences. Most notably, (1) ICD-11 's essential features tend to be more descriptive than the more prescriptive AMPD criteria (i.e. a non-exhaustive list of characteristics in the ICD-11 model vs. e.g. " manifested by characteristic difficulties in two or more of the following four areas " in the AMPD); (2) five maladaptive-range traits are provided as optional specifiers rather than included among the essential (required) features; (3) only four of each model's five traits are shared — NA, DET, ANT (call Dyssocial in ICD-11), and DIS — PSY is not among the ICD-11 traits because Schizotypal Disorder is placed in the Schizophrenia and Related Psychoses chapter in ICD-11 and Anankastia, which encompasses traits relevant to obsessive–compulsive PD such as rigid perfectionism and behavioral and emotional constraint; and (4) the ICD-11 model also provides an optional Borderline Pattern specifier that may be applied to individuals whose pattern of personality disturbance is characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self- image, and affects, and marked impulsivity as indicated by many of the criteria for DSM-5, Section II Borderline personality disorder. See Table 1 for a detailed side-by-side comparison of the two models.

Table 1
Comparison of DSM-5 and ICD-11 models of personality disorder

DSM-5 = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). ICD-11 = International Classification of Diseases, 11th Edition (World Health Organization, 2022)

The differences summarized above and detailed in Table 1 are largely due to the different purposes and constituencies of the documents. More specifically, (1) the ICD-11 is designed to be used globally, in all countries that are member states of the World Health Organization. By international treaty, these 193 countries have agreed to use the ICD and its codes for reporting national health information. This agreement ensures that the reported data will be internationally comparable for communicating about diseases and health conditions (note that the ICD covers all medical diagnoses, not just mental disorders). Moreover, because WHO's ultimate objective is "the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health", p. 2, a public-health focus is fundamental to the goals and internal organization of the ICD.

### Suicide risk in personality disorders: a systematic review [^113StUWr]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Suicide is a global health concern with approximately 703,000 people dying by suicide each year. Although research has identified myriad factors which may increase an individual's risk of suicide (e.g. depression, lack of social support, social disadvantage), our ability to predict suicide remains limited. The most consistent predictors of a future suicide attempt are a history of self-injurious behaviour including suicide attempt or non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), with literature also indicating that repeated suicidal behaviour becomes more medically severe over time.

It is well established that suicidal behaviour is more common in those with mental health diagnosis than in those without. Indeed, some estimates suggest that as many as 90% of those who die by suicide have a diagnosable psychiatric disorder at the time of their death. A recent meta-analysis which focused on repetition of suicide attempts found that the presence of any mental health diagnosis was associated with approximately double the increased risk of further suicide attempt. What is more, the risk of repeated suicide attempt was particularly elevated in those diagnosed with a psychotic or personality disorder.

Personality disorders (PD) are common, chronic mental health conditions. A recent meta-analysis of 46 studies from 21 countries found rates of PD in community-based research samples of 7.8%. In clinical samples, estimates range from 30% for inpatient populations to 67% in outpatient samples. Globally, Borderline PD is estimated to occur in 1.6% of the general population and 20% of the psychiatric inpatient population. Cross-national prevalence rates for other PDs in the general population are harder to establish. In some cases, prevalence rates are reported for PD clusters, as identifying specific PDs can be challenging. For instance, to receive a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder, a diagnosis of conduct disorder prior to the age of 15 is required.

Symptoms of PD often present first in adolescence or early adulthood, causing clinically significant distress or impairment over a long period of time. Personality disorders are generally characterised by distressing patterns of emotions, thoughts and behaviours, and impaired interpersonal functioning. There are three main clusters of personality disorders; Cluster A encompasses patterns of unusual thinking or behaviours, Cluster B is characterised by unstable emotions, and problems with impulse control, and Cluster C features very anxious emotions, thoughts and behaviours (DSM-5).

There is increasing research aimed at addressing whether patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) may exhibit variations in symptomatology and functioning according to their chronological age. The current study consisted of 169 outpatients diagnosed with BPD, who were divided into four age groups as follows: 16–25 years (n = 41), 26–35 years (n = 43), 36–45 years (n = 45), and 46 and more years (n = 40). Age groups were compared for symptomatology, normal personality traits, psychiatric comorbidities, functioning, and treatment-related features. The younger group had significantly higher levels of physical/verbal aggression and suicide attempts relative to the older group. Conversely, the older group had significantly greater severity of somatization, depression, and anxiety symptoms. In addition, the older group showed significantly greater functional impairment overall and across physical/psychological domains, specifically when compared to the younger group. Overall, these findings may suggest that age-related symptoms should be considered when diagnosing BPD. Also, functional impairments should be the target interventions for older BPD patients.

### Personality disorder coverage, prevalence, and convergence: do the's two models of personality disorder identify the same patients? [^114NEFKa]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Preliminary analyses

Before comparing the two models, we examined AMPD Criterion A ratings v. scores, interrater reliability, comorbidity in the models separately, and coverage by specific PDs v. AMPD Criterion A. Criterion A base rate was 48.3% when rated overall, 38.1% when scored using its subdomains, and 48.9% considering either. Only five participants who met the scored threshold were not rated as impaired. Accordingly, we allowed Criterion A to be met by either method for all AMPD diagnoses reported herein.

Interrater reliability

We calculated interrater reliabilities for both the categorical and alternative PD models for both their constituent components (Table 3) and diagnoses (Table 4). General PD Section-II Criterion A ('An enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual's culture' [APA, p. 645]) was scored based on ratings of its four constituent areas: cognition, affectivity, interpersonal functioning, and impulse control. Kappas for whether participants met Section-II Criterion A and all General PD criteria, respectively, were 0.72 and 0.73 (Very Good; all interpretations of kappa values reflect the ranges used in the DSM-5 field trials [Regier et al.]).

Table 4.
Interrater reliability – section II personality disorder diagnoses and AMPD diagnoses

Reliability of AMPD Criterion A (personality impairment) when rated overall by interviewers was slightly higher than when scored from the four subdomains' ratings (κ = 0.63 v. 0.59), but both were near the standard cut point of 0.60 between Good and Very Good. Criterion B was rated overall and scored somewhat less reliably (κ s = 0.50 and 0.39, Good and Fair, respectively). However, the reliabilities (ICCs) of overall trait severity ratings and number of pathological traits were 0.83 and.73 – Very Good and Good, respectively. This pattern may be attributable to Criterion B's definition, which requires only 'one or more pathological personality traits' of five domains and 25 facets. Thus, ratings below threshold for all traits v. all but one trait is a 'miss' when calculating κ, but very close when calculating ICCs.

### Unblending borderline personality and bipolar disorders [^11262TiZ]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2017). Low credibility.

Borderline Personality (BPD) and Bipolar (BP) disorders stimulate an academic debate between their distinction and the inclusion of Borderline in the Bipolar spectrum. Opponents to this inclusion attribute the important differences and possible diagnostic incomprehension to overlapping symptoms. We tested 248 Borderline and 113 Bipolar patients, consecutively admitted to the Psychiatric Unit, through DSM-IV Axis I and II Disorders (SCID-I/II), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index-IV (BPDSI-IV). All the tests statistically discriminated the disorders (p < 0.0001). Overlapping symptoms resulted significantly different (impulsivity = 5.32 in BPD vs 1.55 in BP, p < 0.0001; emotional instability = 7.11 in BPD vs 0.55 in BP, p < 0.0001) and the range of their scores gives the opportunity for an even more precise discrimination. Distinctive traits (e.g. irritability or sexual arousal) are also discussed in order to try to qualify the core of these disorders to a higher degree. Comorbidity proves to be extremely small (3.6%). However, Borderline patients with manic features offer a privileged point of view for a deeper analysis. This allows for the possibility of a more precise examination of the nature and load of each symptom. Borderline Personality and Bipolar Disorders can be distinguished with high precision using common and time-sparing tests. The importance of discriminating these clinical features may benefit from this evidence.

### ICD-11 personality disorder features in the Danish general population: cut-offs and prevalence rates for severity levels [^11583CXF]. Psychiatry Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prevalence rates and correlates of personality disorders (PD) are relevant to health care policy and planning.

Objectives

To present normative data for self-reported ICD-11 personality disorder (PD) features including tentative cut-off scores and prevalence rates for severity levels along with psychosocial correlates.

Methods

The Personality Disorder Severity ICD-11 (PDS-ICD-11) scale and criterion measures of impairment were administered to a social-demographically stratified sample of Danish citizens (N = 8,941) of which 3,044 delivered complete data. Item-Response Theory (IRT) was employed to indicate cut-offs based on standard deviations from the latent mean.

Results

The unidimensionality of the PDS-ICD-11 score was supported and IRT analysis suggested norm-based thresholds at latent severity levels. Expected associations with criterion measures were found.

Conclusion

The normative data portray ICD-11 PD features in the general population and allow for interpretation of PDS-ICD-11 scores (e.g., scores of 12, 16, and 19 may indicate mild, moderate, and severe dysfunction), which may inform health care policy and planning. A total weighted prevalence of 6.9% of the Danish general population is estimated to have clinically significant personality dysfunction, proportionally composed of Mild (4.8%), Moderate (1.2%), and Severe (0.9%) levels. Future research should corroborate these findings using relevant clinical samples and methods.

### Concordance between personality disorder assessment methods [^111jPmLs]. Psychological Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Studies have criticized the low level of agreement between the various methods of personality disorder (PD) assessment. This is an important issue for research and clinical purposes.

Method

Seven hundred and forty-two participants in the Hopkins Epidemiology of Personality Disorders Study (HEPS) were assessed on two occasions using the Personality Disorder Schedule (PDS) and the International Personality Disorder Examination (IPDE). The concordance between the two diagnostic methods for all DSM-IV PDs was assessed using standard methods and also two item response analytic approaches designed to take account of measurement error: a latent trait-based approach and a generalized estimating equations (GEE)-based approach, with post-hoc adjustment.

Results

Raw criteria counts, using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), κ and odds ratio (OR), showed poor concordance. The more refined statistical methods showed a moderate to moderately high level of concordance between the methods for most PDs studied. Overall, the PDS produced lower prevalences of traits but higher precision of measurement than the IPDE. Specific criteria within each PD showed varying endorsement thresholds and precision for ascertaining the disorder.

Conclusions

Concordance in the raw measurement of the individual PD criteria between the two clinical methods is lacking. However, based on two statistical methods that adjust for differential endorsement thresholds and measurement error in the assessments, we deduce that the PD constructs themselves can be measured with a moderate degree of confidence regardless of the clinical approach used. This may suggest that the individual criteria for each PD are, in and of themselves, less specific for diagnosis, but as a group the criteria for each PD usefully identify specific PD constructs.

### Exploring the clinical validity of borderline personality disorder components [^111Cp26L]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is recognized as a complex syndrome, resulting in a heterogeneous diagnostic category. Besides the characteristics of the disorder itself, comorbid disorders play an important role in this complexity. The aim of the study is to analyze the clinical validity of 3 components for BPD Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria — called affective dysregulation, behavioral dysregulation, and disturbed relatedness — investigating differences in patterns of comorbidity. For this purpose, 365 patients with suspected BPD were included in the study. To test our hypothesis, patients were classified into 5 clusters using a K-cluster analysis to study the clinical validity of the 3 components based on the 3-factor model of BPD. Differences in comorbidity, previous suicide attempts, and self-harm behaviors among the defined clusters were analyzed. Between-cluster differences were observed for Axis I and Axis II disorders as well as in the frequency of suicide attempts and in self-harm behaviors. The study of BPD based on the 3 components seems to be more useful than the study of BPD as a unitary construct to help further our understanding of this complex disorder. In the present study, the 3 BPD components have allowed us to analyze the complex comorbidity of BPD patients. This solution could be considered an interesting way to clarify BPD etiology, diagnosis, and treatment efficacy.

### Borderline symptoms at age 12 signal risk for poor outcomes during the transition to adulthood: findings from a genetically sensitive longitudinal cohort study [^113FB3RU]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Borderline personality disorder is characterized by pervasive instability in a person's mood, sense of self, impulse control, and interpersonal relationships. In adults, borderline personality disorder is considered a valid diagnosis by most clinicians. In adolescents, the diagnosis is more controversial. Although diagnostic classification systems allow for a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder in adolescence, clinicians are reluctant to assess and treat borderline symptoms prior to adulthood. Among the reasons cited for this reluctance are concerns that adolescents' borderline symptoms may be transient; that a diagnosis could be stigmatizing; that personality development is still in flux; and that some borderline symptoms, such as impulsivity and difficulty in establishing a sense of identity, are inseparable from what is thought to be a normative degree of storm and stress during adolescence. In this study, we addressed concerns about the validity of adolescent borderline pathology by testing the prognostic significance of borderline symptoms in 12-year-old adolescents for psychosocial adjustment during the transition to adulthood, at age 18 years.

### Complex post-traumatic stress disorder [^1151ZMqJ]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Complex post-traumatic stress disorder (complex PTSD) is a severe mental disorder that emerges in response to traumatic life events. Complex PTSD is characterised by three core post-traumatic symptom clusters, along with chronic and pervasive disturbances in emotion regulation, identity, and relationships. Complex PTSD has been adopted as a new diagnosis in the ICD-11. Individuals with complex PTSD typically have sustained or multiple exposures to trauma, such as childhood abuse and domestic or community violence. The disorder has a 1–8% population prevalence and up to 50% prevalence in mental health facilities. Progress in diagnostics, assessment, and differentiation from post-traumatic stress disorder and borderline personality disorder is reported, along with assessment and treatment of children and adolescents. Studies recommend multicomponent therapies starting with a focus on safety, psychoeducation, and patient-provider collaboration, and treatment components that include self-regulatory strategies and trauma-focused interventions.

### Personality disorder coverage, prevalence, and convergence: do the's two models of personality disorder identify the same patients? [^112D86VU]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Application

These results have implications for clinical practice. First, our data indicate – through high coverage and convergence of prevalence across the two DSM-5 PD models when all PD is included – that they identify largely the same set of PD patients. Second, the AMPD addresses two shortcomings of the Section-II diagnostic system. Specifically, it provides a way to understand comorbidity, in that individuals with multiple PDs may be expected to have more elevated and complex trait profiles. Conversely, it addresses within-diagnosis heterogeneity by focusing on individuals' trait profiles rather than specific criteria. That is, in the Section-II PD model, due to its polythetic diagnostic system, having diverse combinations of specific criteria (i.e. heterogeneity) is inherent in the model, yet problematic because consideration of differences among criterion combinations is not part of the model. In contrast, in the AMPD, within-PD heterogeneity results from the small number (2 to 7) of traits used to diagnose any particular PD relative to all 25. Patients could share the traits of a specific PD but differ on the other 18 to 23. However, it is more likely that they will have additional trait elevations beyond those of a specific PD because 'comorbidity' is roughly equally common in both models. However, this is not so problematic for the AMPD because all individuals have their own trait profile that comprehensively describes the nature of their PD characteristics. Specifically, the AMPD provides PD-TS to diagnose all PD (i.e. as well as those with one or more specific PDs) by describing all trait expressions of personality pathology using Criterion B trait. In contrast, the Section-II PD model has no systematic way of characterizing the almost 40% of individuals who meet its General PD Criterion, but who can only be diagnosed with PD-NEC/PD-NOS.

### The course of borderline personality disorder from adolescence to early adulthood: a 5-year follow-up study [^112U4AVL]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Studies of the medium- to long-term clinical and functional course for treatment-seeking adolescents with borderline personality disorder (BPD) are lacking. This study aims to outline the psychopathological and functional status of participants, five years after being diagnosed with BPD during adolescence.

Methods

Participants were originally enrolled in a randomized clinical trial that compared mentalization-based group treatment with treatment as usual for adolescents with BPD. Semi-structured interview assessments at five-year follow-up included the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Personality Disorders. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), alcohol, substance and tobacco use, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), complex PTSD, and general functioning were assessed using self-report instruments.

Results

97 of the original sample of 111 participants (87%) participated. They were aged 19–23 years. The most prevalent disorders were ADHD (59%), any personality disorder (47%) of which half continued to meet criteria for BPD (24%), anxiety disorders (37%), depressive disorders (32%), PTSD or complex PTSD (20%), schizophrenia (16%), and eating disorders (13%). Only 16% did not meet criteria for any mental disorder. Approximately half of the sample were in psychological and/or psychopharmacological treatment at the time of follow-up. Their general functioning remained impaired, with 36% not engaged in education, employment or training (NEET), which is nearly four times the rate of NEET in the same age group in the general population.

Conclusions

Although stability of the categorical BPD diagnosis is modest, adolescents meeting diagnostic criteria for BPD show a broad range of poor outcomes at five-year follow-up. BPD appears to be a marker of general maladjustment during adolescence and a harbinger of severe problems during the transition to young adulthood. Early intervention programs for adolescents diagnosed with BPD should focus upon a broad range of functional and psychopathological outcomes, especially social and vocational support, rather than the narrow BPD diagnosis.

### Prevalence of eating disorders in people with borderline personality disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115U69YT]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

The inclusion of adolescents in the selected studies did not influence the rates of any type of ED. This may be related to the small number of studies and participants included in the analyses, but also to the fact that the issue of BPD diagnosis in adolescent populations is still a source of debate (Griffiths; Laurenssen et al.).

4.2 Strength and Limitations of the Review

Although this is one of the first meta‐analytic reviews to assess the prevalence of ED in people with BPD, our findings should be interpreted with caution, taking into account a number of limitations. More specifically, we have limitations related to the external validity of individual studies and limitations affecting the internal validity of selected research papers. With regard to external validity, most of the included samples concerned inpatient populations and people with outpatient care, which limits the generalisability of our findings. Other limitations include discrepancies in the proportion of females, the low representativeness of some regions of the world, such as African regions, and the low number of adolescents in the different studies. The latter is even more important considering the possibility of early diagnosis of BPD in adolescent populations (Guilé et al; Videler et al.). As other limitations, we have the significant heterogeneities related to our recapitulative results, as well as the multiplicity of screening/diagnostic tools/criteria for ED and BPD. In fact, this variability could have influenced the pooled prevalence and, at least partially, the level of certainty of our evidence, which was low. Notably, there was no publication bias and the risk of bias was moderate. It should be noted that there were no specific data on several types of EDs, such as ARFID, OSFED, pica, rumination disorder and UFED.

4.3 Implications of the Results for Practice, Policy and Future Research

This systematic review draws the attention of health professionals working with people with BPD to the identification of EDs, especially as EDs may negatively influence the treatment and course of BPD. Our review could also be used to design other observational studies on the burden of EDs in people with BPD, with optimisation of methodological aspects to improve generalisability (e.g. by including more adolescent populations) and to reduce heterogeneity of results (by harmonising the tools used to identify the conditions concerned). This could also increase the certainty of evidence from further potential meta‐analyses. Observational and meta‐analytic studies on potential correlates of EDs in BPD could also be of interest to identify determinants that could be therapeutic targets.

### Association of borderline personality disorder criteria with suicide attempts: findings from the collaborative longitudinal study of personality disorders over 10 years of follow-up [^116YwsEL]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) has been identified as a strong risk factor for suicidal behavior, including suicide attempts. Delineating specific features that increase risk could inform interventions.

Objective

To examine factors associated with prospectively observed suicide attempts among participants in the Collaborative Longitudinal Study of Personality Disorders (CLPS), over 10 years of follow-up, with a focus on BPD and BPD criteria.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The CLPS is a multisite, naturalistic, prospective study of adult participants with 4 personality disorders (PDs) and a comparison group of adults with major depressive disorder and minimal PD features. Participants were all treatment-seeking and recruited from inpatient, partial, and outpatient treatment settings across New York, New York, Boston, Massachusetts, New Haven, Connecticut, and Providence, Rhode Island. A total of 733 participants were recruited at baseline, with 701 completing at least 1 follow-up assessment. The cohorts were recruited from September 1996 through April 1998 and September 2001 through August 2002. Data for this study using this follow-up sample (N = 701) were analyzed between March 2019 and August 2020.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Participants were assessed annually using semistructured diagnostic interviews and a variety of self-report measures for up to 10 years. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to examine baseline demographic and clinical risk factors, including BPD and individual BPD criteria, of suicide attempt assessed over 10 years of prospective follow-up.

Results

Of the 701 participants, 447 (64%) identified as female, 488 (70%) as White, 527 (75%) as single, 433 (62%) were unemployed, and 512 (73%) reported at least some college education. Of all disorders, BPD emerged as the most robust factor associated with prospectively observed suicide attempt(s) (odds ratio [OR], 4.18; 95% CI, 2.68–6.52), even after controlling for significant demographic (sex, employment, and education) and clinical (childhood sexual abuse, alcohol use disorder, substance use disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder) factors. Among BPD criteria, identity disturbance (OR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.37–3.56), chronic feelings of emptiness (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.03–2.57), and frantic efforts to avoid abandonment (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.17–3.16) emerged as significant independent factors associated with suicide attempt(s) over follow-up, when covarying for other significant factors and BPD criteria.

Conclusions and Relevance

In the multisite, longitudinal study of adults with personality disorders, identity disturbance, chronic feelings of emptiness, and frantic efforts to avoid abandonment were significantly associated with suicide attempts. Identity disturbance, chronic feelings of emptiness, and frantic efforts to avoid abandonment may be clinically overlooked features of BPD in context of suicide risk assessment. In light of the high rates of BPD diagnostic remission, our findings suggest that these criteria should be independently assessed and targeted for further study as suicide risk factors.

### Gender differences in borderline personality disorder: findings from the collaborative longitudinal personality disorders study [^11385bab]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

A majority of the literature on borderline personality disorder (BPD) focuses on its occurrence in women or does not specifically assess for gender differences in clinical presentations. Some studies report that men with BPD may be more likely to be diagnosed with substance use disorders, as well as paranoid, passive-aggressive, narcissistic, sadistic, and antisocial personality disorders (PDs). Additionally, women with BPD appear to be more likely to report histories of adult physical and sexual abuse and to meet diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and eating disorders. The purpose of the present study was to further examine gender differences in BPD. Using baseline data from the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study (CLPS), men and women who met criteria for BPD were compared on current axis I and II disorders, BPD diagnostic criteria, childhood trauma histories, psychosocial functioning, temperament, and personality traits. Men with BPD were more likely to present with substance use disorders, and with schizotypal, narcissistic, and antisocial PDs, while women with BPD were more likely to present with PTSD, eating disorders, and the BPD criterion of identity disturbance. Generally speaking, women and men with BPD displayed more similarities than differences in clinical presentations. The differences that did emerge are consistent with those found in epidemiological studies of psychopathology and therefore do not appear unique to BPD. Additionally, many gender differences traditionally found in epidemiological samples did not emerge in BPD subjects. For example, no difference was found in rates of major depressive disorder, a condition that is more prevalent in females. Thus, BPD pathology may be a prevailing characterization that can attenuate usual gender-based distinctions.

### Psychiatric comorbidity: a concept in need of a theory [^1177cMtq]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure. 1.
Illustration of state and trait conditions. (a) A state condition with a single episode of a disorder, e.g. major depression. (b) A state condition with recurring episodes, e.g. bipolar disorder. (c) A trait condition, e.g. schizophrenia. (d) A trait condition with a comorbid state condition, e.g. personality disorder with a single episode of major depression.

Applying the distinction between trait and state conditions to inform assessment of psychiatric comorbidity cannot, however, stand alone. Such an assessment ultimately rests on a comprehensive understanding of the psychopathology of mental disorders. Such an understanding, which necessarily goes beyond the limited range of symptoms and signs included in the major diagnostic manuals, forms an indispensable part of the 'clinical judgment' upon which diagnoses must be made (American Psychiatric Association). Such an understanding can only be achieved through varied clinical experience, reading psychopathological literature, and ongoing discussions about psychopathological phenomena with experts.

Assessment of comorbidity can be substantially improved at the diagnostic level by making suitable changes at the nosological level. Here, a classical principle for differential diagnosis can further help us restrict the use of psychiatric comorbidity. Traditionally, psychiatry has operated with a hierarchical classification of mental disorders (American Psychiatric Association,), based on the clinical method (Owen,), which, in a descending order, roughly can be summarized as follows: organic disorders, schizophrenia, affective disorders, anxiety disorders, and personality disorders (Jaspers, pp. 605–606, 611–612; Klerman; Owen, p. 1704). For disorders at the top of the diagnostic hierarchy (e.g. organic disorders or schizophrenia), most, if not all, symptoms may occur. By contrast, the range of symptoms is much more limited in disorders placed lower in the diagnostic hierarchy (e.g. anxiety or personality disorders) (American Psychiatric Association). Thus, if a patient fulfils diagnostic criteria for more than one disorder, the highest placed disorder generally outranks lower placed disorders, implying that comorbid diagnoses should not be made if the symptomatology can be accommodated by the index disorder – a point vividly illustrated in the decision trees for differential diagnoses in previous editions of DSM (American Psychiatric Association, pp. 339–349, pp. 744–757) and still operative in ICD-10.

### Editorial: what's in a name? The importance of adolescent personality pathology for adaptive psychosocial function [^111mimbe]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

An impressive surge in research supporting a shift to a dimensional organization of psychopathology has occurred over the last two decades. This has culminated in recent calls for the abolishment of the categorical diagnostic system in favor of a quantitative classification system for psychopathology. 1 The use of diagnostic constructs such as borderline personality disorder (BPD), and perhaps even the concept of personality pathology itself, may disappear from such nosological systems and be redefined in terms of internalizing-externalizing-psychoticism spectra. Indeed, the original International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11) proposal eliminated the traditional 10 personality disorders and introduced a definition of personality disorder based on severity rather than type. 2 It may therefore be argued that the study conducted by Wertz et al., 3 which focuses on borderline personality disorder, is out of step with current trends in psychiatric nosology. Moreover, Wertz and colleagues focus on adolescents-a developmental period often characterized as inappropriate for the diagnosis and treatment of personality disorder. On the contrary, this editorial will argue that Wertz et al. 3 make a timely and important contribution by highlighting the importance of adolescent personality pathology for prospective psychosocial function.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)is a prevalent mental disorder which profoundly impacts well-being and functioningand is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disordersand suicide. The lifetime prevalence of PTSD is estimated at 4%, and roughly 12.5% of patients in primary care settings meet the criteria for PTSD.PTSD is associated with high rates of psychiatric comorbidity, with up to 78% of patients meeting the criteria for a comorbid mental disorder — for example, 30–50% meet the criteria for comorbid major depressive disorderand 6–24% meet the criteria for borderline personality disorder (BPD). The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5/DSM-5-TR) also recognises a dissociative subtype of PTSD (PTSD with dissociative symptoms), which affects 14–45% of those diagnosed with PTSD. Additionally, the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) implemented Complex PTSD (C-PTSD) as a new diagnosis. C-PTSD is characterised by symptoms of PTSD and 'Disturbances in Self-Organisation'and affects 1–8% of the general population. Taken together, PTSD with comorbidity and C-PTSD (hereafter referred to under the umbrella term 'complex presentations of PTSD')are highly prevalent in the mental health servicesand are associated with increased distress and impairment.

### Personality disorders in older adults: a review of epidemiology, assessment, and treatment [^116Ev2kU]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

As these 5 studies used a variety of research methods and PD measures, direct comparison between prevalence rates is complex. Most of these instruments, although validated in various settings, have not yet been corroborated in older adults. Furthermore, these are based on the DSM criteria which contain measurement bias in older adults. Different sample types (community-dwelling, non-community-dwelling) with varying comorbidity and differences in age distribution across samples as well as diverse cultures (USA, Europe, Africa) may affect prevalence rates as well.

Clinical Implications

These studies prove that PDs are quite prevalent in later life, and as they are known to have a serious impact on one's life, such as high levels of suffering and decreased functioning, straining the clinician-patient relationship by (interpersonal) difficulties, treatment rejection, and non-compliance, it is important for clinicians to be alert to PDs in older adults.

Moreover, the presences of a PD may complicate the recognition of/and adversely affect treatment of comorbid disorders. In the case of PDs, treatment outcomes are poor(er), whereas the rates of relapse and readmission increases. This, in addition to the already complex clinical picture of older adults who often have multiple medical conditions, whether or not combined with psychiatric comorbidity and polypharmacy, seems to make it all the more important to have valid and reliable instruments to facilitate "early" detection of PDs in older adults. Being more attentive to PDs in late life may enable the clinician to take personality functioning into account when considering his approach and communication to optimize older adults' treatment compliance and to tailor interventions to accommodate the specific needs of individual patients which may enhance the odds of a positive response to treatment and circumvent treatment dropout. Furthermore, it may allow the clinician (such as general practitioners, geriatricians) to screen for PDs and to make faster and more specific referrals to mental health settings where further diagnostic assessments and treatment options are available.

### Axis I comorbidity in patients with borderline personality disorder: 6-year follow-up and prediction of time to remission [^114n3k9W]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of axis I disorders among patients with borderline personality disorder over 6 years of prospective follow-up.

Method

A semistructured interview of demonstrated reliability was used to assess presence or absence of comorbid axis I disorders in 290 patients who met Revised Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines criteria and DSM-III-R criteria for borderline personality disorder and 72 patients who did not meet these criteria but did meet DSM-III-R criteria for another axis II disorder. Over 94% of surviving patients were reinterviewed about their axis I disorders at 2-year, 4-year, and 6-year follow-up periods.

Results

Although the patients with borderline personality disorder experienced declining rates of many axis I disorders over time, the rates of these disorders remained high, particularly the rates of mood and anxiety disorders. Patients whose borderline personality disorder remitted over time experienced substantial decline in all comorbid disorders assessed, but those whose borderline personality disorder did not remit over time reported stable rates of comorbid disorders. When the absence of comorbid axis I disorders was used to predict time to remission, the absence of substance use disorders was a far stronger predictor of remission from borderline personality disorder than was the absence of posttraumatic stress disorder, mood disorders, other anxiety disorders, or eating disorders, respectively.

Conclusions

The results of this study suggest that axis I disorders are less common over time in patients with initially severe borderline personality disorder, particularly for patients whose borderline personality disorder remits over time. The findings also suggest that substance use disorders are most closely associated with the failure to achieve remission from borderline personality disorder.

### Can clinicians recognize DSM-IV personality disorders from five-factor model descriptions of patient cases? [^116fB9bn]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

This article examined, using theories from cognitive science, the clinical utility of the Five-Factor Model (FFM) of Personality, an assessment and classification system under consideration for integration into the forthcoming fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders. Specifically, the authors sought to test whether FFM descriptors are specific enough to allow practicing clinicians to capture core features of personality disorders.

Method

In two studies, a large nationwide sample of clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, and clinical social workers (N = 187 and N = 191) were presented case profiles based on symptom formats from either the DSM-IV and/or FFM. Ratings for six aspects of clinical utility for DSM-IV and FFM profiles were obtained and participants provided DSM-IV diagnoses. Prototypic cases (only one personality disorder) and comorbid cases were tested in separate studies.

Results

Participants rated the DSM-IV as more clinically useful than the FFM on five out of six clinical utility questions. Despite demonstrating considerable background knowledge of DSM-IV diagnoses, participants had difficulty identifying correct diagnoses from FFM profiles.

Conclusion

The FFM descriptors may be more ambiguous than the criteria of the DSM-IV and the FFM may therefore be less able to convey important clinical details than the DSM-IV. The findings flag challenges to clinical utility for dimensional-trait systems such as the FFM.

### Wherefrom and whither PD? Recent developments and future possibilities in DSM-5 and ICD-11 personality disorder diagnosis [^1156kjCr]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Both the DSM-5 and ICD-11 include, for the first time a dimensional diagnostic models for personality disorder (PD). In the former, the model is included in Section III (Emerging Models and Methods) as an alternative (typically abbreviated AMPD) to the traditional categorical model, whereas in ICD-11, it replaces the previous categorical model. The AMPD has now accumulated a decade's worth of research that has generally supported its theoretical basis, empirical validity, and clinical utility, so is poised to replace the traditional model in the main DSM-5 Section II. In contrast, the ICD-11 PD model is quite new, but its research and clinical base will no doubt grow over the coming years, as the ICD-11 is used globally. In this article, I provide an overview of each model and discuss their similarities and differences. I also describe existing measures developed to assess them, the next step in developing the ICD-11 model, and the ongoing process by which a version of the AMPD may replace the current model in DSM-5 Section II.

Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5 th Edition (DSM-5)

The DSM-5 includes two distinct diagnostic models for personality disorder (PD). The DSM-5 's main body (Section II) retains a traditional, categorical model of 10 putatively distinct PDs, whereas its Section III (Emerging Models and Methods) introduces an alternative, dimensional model for PD (AMPD), consisting of two main criteria — personality functioning and personality traits — both of which range from the adaptive to the maladaptive range. A PD diagnosis is made only if there is moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning and one or more personality traits in the pathological range. Five additional criteria (C through G) further define the two main criteria (e.g. "the impairments in personality functioning and the individual's personality trait expression are relatively inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations", [1, p. 761]).

### The course of eating disorders in patients with borderline personality disorder: a 10-year follow-up study [^1134PhYR]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to describe the longitudinal course of eating disorders in patients with borderline personality disorder.

Method

The SCID I was administered to 290 borderline inpatients and 72 participants with other axis II disorders during their index admission and at five contiguous 2-year follow-up periods.

Results

The prevalence of anorexia, bulimia, and eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS) declined significantly over time for those in both study groups but the prevalence of EDNOS remained significantly higher among borderline patients. While over 90% of borderline patients meeting criteria for anorexia, bulimia, or EDNOS at baseline experienced a stable remission by the time of the 10-year follow-up, diagnostic migration was common, particularly for those with anorexia or bulimia. In addition, both recurrences (52%) and new onsets (43%) of EDNOS were more common among borderline patients than recurrences and new onsets of anorexia (28% and 4%) and bulimia (29% and 11%).

Discussion

The results of this study suggest that the prognosis for both anorexia and bulimia in borderline patients is complicated, with remissions being stable but migrations to other eating disorders being common. The results also suggest that EDNOS may be the most prevalent and enduring of the eating disorders in these patients.

### Why patients with severe personality disorders are overmedicated [^112ykHMo]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD), more widely known as borderline personality disorder (BPD), has long been considered a clinical challenge. Patients meeting criteria for these diagnoses are emotionally dysregulated, impulsive, and involved in troubled relationships; in clinical settings, they may threaten suicide or attempt it and are frequently seen in emergency departments. Patients with BPD can be treatment resistant, even when clinically depressed, to both pharmacotherapy and standard types of psychotherapy.

### Heritability of borderline personality disorder features is similar across three countries [^114k46KG]. Psychological Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Most of our knowledge about borderline personality disorder features has been obtained through the study of clinical samples. Although these studies are important in their own right, they are limited in their ability to address certain important epidemiological and aetiological questions such as the degree to which there is a genetic influence on the manifestation of borderline personality disorder features. Though family history studies of borderline personality disorder indicate genetic influences, there have been very few twin studies and the degree of genetic influence on borderline personality disorder remains unclear.

Method

Data were drawn from twin samples from The Netherlands (n = 3918), Belgium (n = 904) and Australia (n = 674). In total, data were available on 5496 twins between the ages of 18 and 86 years from 3644 families who participated in the study by completion of a mailed self-report questionnaire on borderline personality disorder features.

Results

In all countries, females scored higher than males and there was a general tendency for younger adults to endorse more borderline personality disorder features than older adults. Model-fitting results showed that additive genetic influences explain 42% of the variation in borderline personality disorder features in both men and women and that this heritability estimate is similar across The Netherlands, Belgium and Australia. Unique environmental influences explain the remaining 58% of the variance.

Conclusion

Genetic factors play a role in individual differences in borderline personality disorder features in Western society.

### Screening for bipolar disorder and finding borderline personality disorder [^1141TwtJ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder share some clinical features and have similar correlates. It is, therefore, not surprising that differential diagnosis is sometimes difficult. The Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) is the most widely used screening scale for bipolar disorder. Prior studies found a high false-positive rate on the MDQ in a heterogeneous sample of psychiatric patients and primary care patients with a history of trauma. In the present report from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services project, we examined whether psychiatric outpatients without bipolar disorder who screened positive on the MDQ would be significantly more often diagnosed with borderline personality disorder than patients who did not screen positive.

Method

The study was conducted from September 2005 to November 2008. Five hundred thirty-four psychiatric outpatients were interviewed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and Structured Interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorders and asked to complete the MDQ. Missing data on the MDQ reduced the sample size to 480. Approximately 10% of the study sample were diagnosed with a lifetime history of bipolar disorder (n = 52) and excluded from the initial analyses.

Results

Borderline personality disorder was 4 times more frequently diagnosed in the MDQ positive group than the MDQ negative group (21.5% vs 4.1%, P < .001). The results were essentially the same when the analysis was restricted to patients with a current diagnosis of major depressive disorder (27.6% vs 6.9%, P = 0.001). Of the 98 patients who screened positive on the MDQ in the entire sample of patients, including those diagnosed with bipolar disorder, 23.5% (n = 23) were diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and 27.6% (n = 27) were diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.

Conclusions

Positive results on the MDQ were as likely to indicate that a patient has borderline personality disorder as bipolar disorder. The clinical utility of the MDQ in routine clinical practice is uncertain.

### Estimating the prevalence of borderline personality disorder in psychiatric outpatients using a two-phase procedure [^115UX2tR]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

The prevalence of borderline personality disorder (BPD) in outpatient clinics varies greatly (7%-27%) depending on the setting and methodology. We examined the cross-sectional rate of BPD in a general adult outpatient university clinic using a 2-phase procedure: (1) we screened all registered patients with the self-report SCID-II-PQ and (2) we administered the Revised Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines (DIB-R). Sixty-six percent (239/360) of the clinic patients completed the screening: About 72.4% (173/239) (95% confidence interval [CI] = 66.7%, 78.1%) were positive for BPD on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorders-Patient Questionnaire (SCID-II-PQ), and 22.6% (54/239) (95% CI = 17.3%, 27.9%) were positive for BPD on the DIB-R. Our BPD rate was somewhat higher than recent semistructured interview studies (9%-18%). We believe this is due, in part, to our cross-sectional design and our decision not to exclude acute Axis I disorders. Mostly, however, we believe that our 22.6% incidence of BPD arises from the high morbidity of our sample. Demographic data from 130 of 131 DIB-R completers reveal the following: mean age was 40.2 years, 75.4% were female, most patients were unable to work, and they averaged 3.8 lifetime hospitalizations.

### Do borderline personality disorder and attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder co-aggregate in families? A population-based study of 2 million swedes [^115Uixmn]. Molecular Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder, with a general population prevalence of 5–10% in childhood and about 2–5% in adulthood. Comorbid disorders associated with ADHD include neurodevelopmental (e.g. autism spectrum disorders), externalizing (e.g. substance use disorders), and internalizing disorders (e.g. depression and anxiety disorders). Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a common personality disorder, with onset in adolescence, and prevalence in the adult general population of about 1–4%. BPD is characterized by emotional dysregulation leading to severely impaired interpersonal functioning, extensive use of health care, and a high risk of suicide. Although it is increasingly recognized that emotional dysregulation is important also in ADHD, population-based data on the co-occurrence of ADHD and BPD within individuals and co-aggregation in families are still lacking. A better understanding of this comorbidity is important. First, it may contribute to the understanding of shared mechanisms underlying both ADHD and BPD. Second, if these disorders share underlying mechanisms, it would suggest that treatment strategies for one disorder may be effective for the other.

The association between ADHD and BPD has been addressed in epidemiological studies, suggesting that the disorders often co-occur in the same individuals, an association first highlighted in a study of self-reported childhood ADHD symptoms in BPD cases, compared to controls, by Fossati et al. in 2002. More recently, a Swedish study found that the prevalence of BPD in individuals with ADHD was 37.0%, and in a German sample of adult women with BPD, 41.5% were screen-positive for childhood history of ADHD of which 16.1% had ADHD symptoms that persisted into adulthood. A study based on self-reports from approximately 34,000 US individuals found that 33.7% with ADHD also self-reported BPD as compared to 5.2% in the general population. However, as these prior results were mainly based on either small clinical samples or self-reported data, it remains unclear if the co-occurrence of clinically diagnosed ADHD and BPD is present at the population level.

### Familial risk and heritability of diagnosed borderline personality disorder: a register study of the Swedish population [^1131G1s3]. Molecular Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Our results need to be interpreted in light of some limitations. First, we most likely underestimate the true proportion of individuals with symptom levels and impairments corresponding to BPD-diagnosis (i.e. more cases would be identified if everyone in the cohort was assessed for BPD). Second, it is possible that we are missing male individuals with BPD in our population sample as the female to male ratio in our study is 5.5:1, whereas a more even sex ratio has been reported in a US community sample assessed by interview. Results remained stable in women, but we did not have sufficient power to perform the quantitative genetic analysis in men; thus, generalization of our findings to men with BPD should be made with caution. Third, the BPD-diagnosis is based on fulfilling at least five out of nine symptom criteria leading to clinically significant distress or functional impairment in important life areas, and thus a substantial heterogeneity of symptom profiles exists. Although heterogeneity may hamper specificity of the diagnosis, our previous medical chart validation study demonstrated the correspondence of the register-based diagnoses with the DSM-IV criteria. Further, identified individuals with a diagnosis of BPD in our population comprise those in contact with the health care system, thus representing the "real world" cases, and are most likely a representative sample of individuals suffering from functional impairment related to BPD-symptoms. Fourth, our methods will not detect individuals diagnosed in outpatient care prior to 2001. Importantly, however, under-detection of BPD is likely to bias the estimates towards the null. Fifth, relatives to individuals with a BPD-diagnosis may be in closer contact with health care and consequently be more likely to receive a diagnosis, thus inflating the estimates due to detection bias. Sixth, BPD is reported to be most prevalent in adolescence, and its prevalence decreases significantly towards the age of 24. We detected different incidence rates of BPD across different calendar periods with an increased propensity of assigning BPD-diagnosis at earlier ages, a phenomenon that may indicate changes in diagnostic practice. The extended twin/family design makes it less sensitive to trends in diagnostic practice; if time or local trends are present they are likely to apply to the population in a similar way. Lastly, our follow-up periods started later in older cohorts. The results might be affected by left truncation, missing earlier onset BPD. However, BPD is often described as a disorder of "stable instability", resulting in repeated interactions with health care, increasing the likelihood of being identified as carrying a diagnosis in the current study.

### Manifestation of borderline personality symptomatology in chronic pain patients under stress: an understated and exacerbated consequence of the COVID-19 crisis [^113fd4KW]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Borderline Personality Disorder and Chronic Pain

Of great concern to pain clinicians is the dramatic over-representation of patients with a comorbid Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) (or even severe borderline personality features without meeting the full diagnostic criteria for a BPD diagnosis) in the chronic pain population. An excellent summary of the DSM-5 criteria for BPD can be found at: While data suggest a point prevalence of BPD in the general population of only 1.6%, figures as high as 62.5% among chronic pain patients have been identified in the empirical literature. Little work has been published on the prevalence of BPD in specific pain syndromes, although a 2012 study indicated that BPD patients are significantly over-represented in the fibromyalgia population. It has been noted that the percentage of patients with BPD in medical settings may be underestimated, as they are often simply identified as "difficult patients" rather than being diagnosed with BPD. Further, it has been determined that patients with BPD's pain complaints are more difficult to medically substantiate than those without the characterological disturbance.

### What should be done with antisocial personality disorder in the new edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-V)? [^115xKvzo]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

Overall, mental illness should primarily be diagnosed so that patients can obtain optimal treatment. A secondary aim should be to safeguard society against dangerous individuals. For a disorder such as antisocial personality disorder, both aims are highly relevant. If patients diagnosed as having an antisocial personality disorder do not receive treatment, it may simply be because there is no way to help such patients, or because such patients are all 'treatment rejecting'.

Do we know for a fact that people with antisocial personality disorder cannot be treated? Experience with other types of psychiatric illness suggests that there are barriers to treatment, not all of which are intrinsic to the disorder itself. For example, the stigma attached to mental illness, the belief that available treatments will not be helpful, and the basic level of public awareness of the nature of mental illness, may all have an impact on the behaviour of both the patients and their family members, and also the behaviour of service providers (see, for example).

Few treatments have been tested for antisocial or psychopathic personality disorder. A review of psychosocial treatments for antisocial personality disorder found 11 studies in total. However, only two of these studies can be considered to tailor specifically for antisocial personality disorder. Nevertheless, findings reviewed across a range of areas revealed that patients with antisocial personality disorder are able to respond to treatment options designed to target a number of the symptoms associated with this condition. These symptoms include substance abuse, driving under the influence, as well as anger and violence. Simultaneously developers of mentalisation-based treatment for borderline personality disorder are working to develop their treatment to be appropriate for patients with comorbid borderline and antisocial personality disorder.

Similarly, psychoeducational, group-based prison programmes have helped patients change their criminal ways of thinking, reducing the risk of recidivism in turn and in general, correctional rehabilitation is showing effects of practical significance for criminal recidivism and offender functioning. Therefore, while it is true that the antisocial personality disorder diagnosis can sometimes be used to refuse treatment to patients, clinical research is becoming progressively more interested in viewing this diagnosis as a target for treatment.

### Diagnostic accuracy of DSM-5 borderline personality disorder criteria: toward an optimized criteria set [^115zEiRK]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The polythetic system used by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-5) for diagnosing borderline personality disorders (BPD) is far from optimal; however, accumulated research and clinical data are strong enough to warrant ongoing utilization. This study examined diagnostic efficiency of the nine DSM-IV BPD criteria, then explored the feasibility of an optimized criteria set in classifying BPD.

Methods

Adults (N = 1,623) completed the Structured Clinical Interviews for DSM-IV Axis II Disorders resulting in a BPD group (n = 352) and an inpatient psychiatric control group (PC) with no personality disorders (n = 1,271). Receiver operator characteristics and diagnostic efficiency statistics were calculated to ascertain the relative diagnostic efficiency of each DSM-5 BPD criterion in classifying BPD cases.

Results

Affective instability (Criterion 6) evidenced the strongest capacity to differentiate the groups (AUC = .84, SE = .01, p < .0001). Abandonment fears (Criterion 1), unstable relationships (Criterion 2), identity disturbance (Criterion 3), impulsivity (Criterion 4), and chronic emptiness (Criterion 7) yielded good-to-moderate discrimination (AUC range = .75-.79). A composite index of these six criteria yielded excellent accuracy (AUC = .98, SE = .002, p < .0001), sensitivity (SN = .99), and specificity (SP = 0.90).

Conclusions

The current findings add to evidence that affective instability is a useful gate criterion for screening, and the optimized criteria set evidences equivalent accuracy to the original 9 criteria, with a substantial reduction in estimated heterogeneity (from 256 combinations with the original set to 42 combinations with the optimized set).

### Prevalence of eating disorders in people with borderline personality disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1144wHGo]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Studies that included only women showed a significantly higher frequency of AN, and this finding seems in accordance with literature reports. Previous research (original articles and synthesis project) found significantly higher proportions of AN in women when compared to men (Galmiche et al; van Eeden et al.). As reported by other meta‐analytic reviews on EDs prevalence in the general population, the respective frequencies of EDs (without specification), AN and BN varied significantly according to the diagnostic/screening tools, considering that the DSM‐IV was the most commonly reported diagnostic approach (Galmiche et al; Qian et al.). Indeed, the prevalence variability of EDs can be explained by the changeability of diagnostic criteria, but also the interview method, especially when comparing self‐report with face‐to‐face interview (Galmiche et al; Qian et al.). For example, according to the DSM criteria before 2013, BED was classified as an EDNOS and not as an individual diagnosis. This may explain the similar frequencies found in this study regarding these two types of ED (Call et al.). Regarding the influence of the study location, our results concerning BN are consistent with most of the literature (Makino et al; Qian et al.). For instance, a meta‐analytic review showed that the lifetime and 12‐month prevalence rates of BN were 7.3‐fold and 1.2‐fold higher, respectively, in Western countries than in Asian countries (Qian et al.). In contrast, our results showing a higher frequency of AN in Asia are discrepant to some reports in the literature. Indeed, Qian and colleagues found that the lifetime and 12‐month prevalence of AN in Western countries were 21 times and 2 times higher, respectively, than in Asian countries (Qian et al.). This could be explained by differences in sample size, with 172 participants included for Asia (3 studies), 1390 for the Americas (8 studies) and 1428 for Europe (seven studies). However, there appears to be an upward trend in the burden of EDs in Asian countries (Pike and Dunne; Thomas et al.), as shown in the systematic review by Galmiche et al. with point prevalence weighted means of 4.6% in America, 3.5% in Asia and 2.2% in Europe (Galmiche et al.).

### Bipolar disorder and comorbid personality psychopathology: a review of the literature [^111xT11y]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the prevalence of personality disorder comorbidity in bipolar disorder and examine the effects of this comorbidity on bipolar disorder patients.

Data Sources

All the studies reviewed were found through an online literature search through the Web site PubMed. The studies were published between 1980 and 2006. The following keywords were used to search articles: bipolar, mania, mood, personality, Axis II, borderline, and lithium. Only articles in English were included in this literature review.

Study Selection

A total of 32 studies that reported data on the prevalence and effect of comorbid personality disorders or abnormal personality traits in bipolar disorder patients were reviewed.

Data Extraction

The data abstracted from the prevalence studies included sample size, mood state of the study population, research instruments used to determine personality psychopathology, prevalence rates of personality disorders, and abnormalities. Other data collected included response to medications and course of illness.

Data Synthesis

The prevalence studies were categorized into outpatient and inpatient studies to facilitate data analysis. The prevalence studies were also analyzed according to the research instrument used to measure personality pathology. Studies that used non-DSM personality measures were analyzed separately.

Conclusions

Bipolar disorder patients have significantly higher prevalence of personality disorder than the general population. Several studies reviewed indicate a higher prevalence of Axis II disorders in bipolar patients with unstable mood. However, this finding was not confirmed in comparison of inpatient and outpatient comorbidity rates. Bipolar patients with personality psychopathology have poorer response to medications and a more virulent course of illness.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^1117Xpri]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Personality disorders

A meta‐analysis indicates that 42% of patients with BD also have a comorbid personality disorder, and this feature can be both a diagnostic confound and predictor of poorer treatment response. The most prevalent was obsessive compulsive personality disorder (18%), followed by borderline (16%), avoidant (12%) paranoid (11%), and histrionic (10%) personality disorders. 757 Despite the high prevalence of these comorbidities, research assessing the effectiveness of treatments is sparse. The CANMAT Task Force recommendations describe key issues in the management of personality disorders, including the relationship between personality and mood disorders, accurate diagnosis, and the effect on treatment response and clinical course. 758

The 2012 CANMAT Task Force recommendations for comorbid personality disorder concluded that divalproex (level 3) 466 and lamotrigine (level 4) 759 may provide some symptomatic relief for comorbid borderline personality disorder. Psychoeducation might be of value, as one small RCT that included patients with any comorbid personality disorder (level 3) 760 demonstrated. That study, along with another small trial that combined psychoeducation and skills training for patients with a mood disorder plus a personality disorder and suicidal ideation (level 3), 761 showed a modest long‐term benefit. Larger, more specific studies are needed. There are also data to support the utility of DBT for the treatment of BD, which has robust data for efficacy in the treatment of borderline personality disorder. 75, 762, 763

Since those CANMAT recommendations were published in 2012, few new studies have significantly contributed to our understanding of the appropriate treatment of these highly comorbid disorders. Alesiani and colleagues assessed the value of the Systems Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem Solving (STEPPS) program for 32 subjects with personality disorder and mood disorder (half MDD and half BD, mostly BDII), and a history of suicide attempts or self‐harm and emotional and behavioural dysregulation. Although results are preliminary due to small sample size and high drop‐out rate, findings suggest that such group treatment may improve symptoms, as well as reduce suicide attempts and hospitalizations. 761

### A psychometric evaluation of the DSM-IV borderline personality disorder criteria: age and sex moderation of criterion functioning [^115XHxwi]. Psychological Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Despite its importance as a paradigmatic personality disorder, little is known about the measurement invariance of the DSM-IV borderline personality disorder (BPD) criteria; that is, whether the criteria assess the disorder equivalently across different groups.

Method

BPD criteria were evaluated at interview in 2794 young adult Norwegian twins. Analyses, based on item-response modeling, were conducted to test for differential age and sex moderation of the individual BPD criteria characteristics given factor-level covariate effects.

Results

Confirmatory factor analytic results supported a unidimensional structure for the nine BPD criteria. Compared to males, females had a higher BPD factor mean, larger factor variance and there was a significant age by sex interaction on the factor mean. Strong differential sex and age by sex interaction effects were found for the 'impulsivity' criterion factor loading and threshold. Impulsivity related to the BPD factor poorly in young females but improved significantly in older females. Males reported more impulsivity compared to females and this difference increased with age. The 'affective instability' threshold was also moderated, with males reporting less than expected.

Conclusions

The results suggest the DSM-IV BPD 'impulsivity' and 'affective instability' criteria function differentially with respect to age and sex, with impulsivity being especially problematic. If verified, these findings have important implications for the interpretation of prior research with these criteria. These non-invariant age and sex effects may be identifying criteria-level expression features relevant to BPD nosology and etiology. Criterion functioning assessed using modern psychometric methods should be considered in the development of DSM-V.

Importance

National epidemiologic information from recently collected data on the new DSM-5 classification of alcohol use disorder (AUD) using a reliable, valid, and uniform data source is needed.

Objective

To present nationally representative findings on the prevalence, correlates, psychiatric comorbidity, associated disability, and treatment of DSM-5 AUD diagnoses overall and according to severity level (mild, moderate, or severe).

Design, Setting, and Participants

We conducted face-to-face interviews with a representative US noninstitutionalized civilian adult (≥ 18 years) sample (N = 36 309) as the 2012–2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions III (NESARC-III). Data were collected from April 2012 through June 2013 and analyzed in October 2014.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Twelve-month and lifetime prevalences of AUD.

Results

Twelve-month and lifetime prevalences of AUD were 13.9% and 29.1%, respectively. Prevalence was generally highest for men (17.6% and 36.0%, respectively), white (14.0% and 32.6%, respectively) and Native American (19.2% and 43.4%, respectively), respondents, and younger (26.7% and 37.0%, respectively) and previously married (11.4% and 27.1%, respectively) or never married (25.0% and 35.5%, respectively) adults. Prevalence of 12-month and lifetime severe AUD was greatest among respondents with the lowest income level (1.8% and 1.5%, respectively). Significant disability was associated with 12-month and lifetime AUD and increased with the severity of AUD. Only 19.8% of respondents with lifetime AUD were ever treated. Significant associations were found between 12-month and lifetime AUD and other substance use disorders, major depressive and bipolar I disorders, and antisocial and borderline personality disorders across all levels of AUD severity, with odds ratios ranging from 1.2 (95% CI, 1.08–1.36) to 6.4 (95% CI, 5.76–7.22). Associations between AUD and panic disorder, specific phobia, and generalized anxiety disorder were modest (odds ratios ranged from 1.2 (95% CI, 1.01–1.43) to 1.4 (95% CI, 1.13–1.67) across most levels of AUD severity.

Conclusions and Relevance

Alcohol use disorder defined by DSM-5 criteria is a highly prevalent, highly comorbid, disabling disorder that often goes untreated in the United States. The NESARC-III data indicate an urgent need to educate the public and policy makers about AUD and its treatment alternatives, to destigmatize the disorder, and to encourage those who cannot reduce their alcohol consumption on their own, despite substantial harm to themselves and others, to seek treatment.

### Is the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fourth edition, histrionic personality disorder category a valid construct? [^111Q3JYr]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

The study investigated crucial aspects of the construct validity of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) histrionic personality disorder (HPD) category.

Material and Methods

The study included 2289 patients from the Norwegian Network of Psychotherapeutic Day Hospitals. Construct validity was assessed by means of prevalence, comorbidity with other personality disorders, internal consistency among HPD criteria, severity indices, as well as factor analyses.

Results

The prevalence of HPD was very low (0.4%). The comorbidity was high, especially with borderline, narcissistic, and dependent personality disorders. The internal consistency was low. The criteria seemed to form 2 separate clusters: the first contained exhibitionistic and attention-seeking traits and the other contained impressionistic traits.

Conclusion

The results indicated poor construct validity of the HPD category. Different options for the future of the category are discussed. The authors suggest the HPD category to be deleted from the DSM system. However, the clinical phenomena of exhibitionism and attention-seeking, which are the dominant personality features of HPD, should be preserved in an exhibitionistic subtype of narcissism.

### Abstract… [^116tFhMU]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

4 In one study, it was found to be present in 6. 4% of adult primary care visits, about fourfold higher than what has been noted in general community studies. 4–6 Psychiatric diagnostic comorbidities are common. According to one epidemiologic survey, 85% of patients with borderline personality disorder had at least one comorbid psychiatric disorder. 7 There is an established correlation between increased suicide risk and a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder.
8. Etiology and Pathogenesis Borderline personality disorder is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic, neurobiologic, and psychosocial factors, with moderate evidence for genetic transmission and heritability, combined with environmental factors such as trauma. 1 Trauma and neglect may exacerbate biologic predisposition and behavioral tendencies already present in those with borderline personality disorder.

9 Nearly one-third of patients with borderline personality disorder have been raped or sexually assaulted during adulthood.
8. In a study of Hispanic patients in primary care, childhood and adulthood interpersonally traumatic events were strongly associated with borderline personality disorder. 10 Increased awareness of the prevalence of the disorder among underrepresented ethnic minorities receiving primary care, in addition to the high rates of trauma exposure in this population, may enhance physicians' ability to detect borderline personality disorder in these patients and provide appropriate referrals.
10. Clinical Presentation HALLMARK SYMPTOMS The core features of borderline personality disorder are instability of interpersonal relationships, negative self-image, and marked impulsivity, especially in expressing emotions, controlling moods, and exhibiting chronic suicidal tendencies.

DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA Table 2 lists the diagnostic criteria for borderline personality disorder as outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed. 14 The clinical diagnosis is based on a comprehensive psychiatric assessment that gathers information from multiple sources, including a self-reported clinical history, clinician observations, review of the patient's medical record, and information from the patient's friends and family. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS The differential diagnosis of borderline personality disorder involves distinguishing it from other psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and other personality disorders. Other comorbidities include persistent depressive disorder, panic disorder with agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, alcohol use disorder, and nicotine use disorder.

PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPIES First-line treatment for borderline personality disorder is psychotherapy.

2023. 1012 Borderline personality disorder is a mental health disorder that affects up to 3% of adults. Individuals with BPD have difficulty regulating their emotions, which may result in: Extreme mood swings Extreme views of others, either all good or all bad Unstable relationships with others Unstable sense of identity Feelings of emptiness and lack of self-worth Impulsive behavior, such as spending large amounts of money, binge eating, using drugs or excessive alcohol, reckless driving Suicidal thoughts and attempts. Difficulty keeping a job Frequent use of medical services for mental or physical health symptoms Other mental health disorders are common in people with BPD, including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, substance use disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and other personality disorders.

The risk of BPD may be increased by genetic factors as well a history of childhood abuse or neglect. The diagnosis of BPD is made a clinician, typically by interviews and questionnaires. Examples of some questions that may be used to diagnose BPD are: Do you often wonder who you really are. Do you sometimes feel that another person appears in you that does not fit you. Do your feelings toward other people quickly change into opposite extremes. Do you often feel angry. Do you often feel empty. Have you been extremely moody. Have you ever deliberately hurt yourself. The mainstay of treatment for BPD is psychotherapy, which refers to various forms of talk therapy. Psychotherapy is particularly useful when symptoms of BPD are severe.

Educating patients about their illness and involving them in the care plan can also be helpful. While medications can be helpful for treating other mental health conditions that exist along with BPD, no class of medications has been shown to be consistently effective for improving symptoms of BPD in randomized clinical trials.

### Ten-year course of borderline personality disorder… [^111E6tbp]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Figure 2. Prevalence of borderline personality disorder criteria. Positive indicates the cases with a score of 2 for each of the 9 borderline personality disorder criteria on the Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorders, assessed for the 2 years prior to the follow-up point. All BPD criteria declined at similar rates. Social function scores showed severe impairment with only modest albeit statistically significant improvement; patients with BPD remained persistently more dysfunctional than the other 2 groups. Reductions in criteria predicted subsequent improvements in DSM-IV Axis V Global Assessment of Functioning scores. Thus, the study's 3 study groups were patients with BPD, patients with cluster C OPD, and patients with MDD. 3 Our MDD study group was notable for having been selected to exclude any comorbid personality disorder.

The 3 diagnostic study groups shared similar age and socioeconomic status; there were, however, more women in the BPD group than in the OPD or MDD cells.
3. The CLPS used repeated comprehensive assessments of the course of personality disorders, of Axis I disorders, and of functional impairment. Personality disorder criteria were assessed with the Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorders12 at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 years. Point prevalence analyses were used to assess changes in mean scores for number of BPD criteria and for each individual BPD criterion, for GAF and GSA scores, and for scores on 6 LIFE subscales. This examination offers an alternative way to document change that is perhaps more clinically recognizable than survival analyses. The mean number of criteria met for BPD decreased from 6. 7 to
4. 3 in the first year and thereafter steadily decreased at a rate of 0.

29 criteria per year to a low of

1. 7 at 10 years. Only 9% of the patients with BPD remained stably disordered at 10 years. As Figure 2 illustrates, the rates of decline for each of the 9 DSM-IV BPD criteria were similar, with those that were most prevalent at baseline remaining most prevalent after 10 years.
