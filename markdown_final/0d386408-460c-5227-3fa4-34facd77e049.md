## Question

A 72-year-old woman with a history of stroke and chronic urinary retention is admitted to the hospital for rehabilitation. She has had an indwelling urinary catheter in place for the past 10 days. She now develops fever (38.5°C), suprapubic discomfort, and cloudy urine. Urinalysis shows pyuria and bacteriuria. The medical team suspects a catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) and is preparing to start empiric antibiotic therapy.

According to current guidelines, what should be done regarding the urinary catheter before initiating antimicrobial therapy in this patient?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to do with the indwelling urinary catheter in a 72-year-old woman with suspected catheter-associated urinary tract infection before starting antibiotics. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing CAUTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria. Then, I should verify the role of biofilm and why catheter management matters. Next, I will review guideline recommendations for catheter removal versus exchange. After that, I need to check timing relative to obtaining cultures. Finally, I will consider exceptions, alternatives if the catheter cannot be removed, and how this integrates with empiric therapy and stewardship principles.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic frame. CAUTI requires compatible symptoms or signs — here fever, suprapubic discomfort, and cloudy urine — plus pyuria and bacteriuria, while excluding other sources of fever; pyuria alone is not sufficient to diagnose infection in a catheterized patient, so I need to ensure we are not conflating colonization with infection before committing to antibiotics [^111fBDCC] [^1112yxbn] [^111ATHLW].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology that drives the recommendation. Indwelling catheters rapidly develop biofilm colonization, making eradication with antibiotics alone difficult; biofilm-associated organisms persist and can seed recurrence, so source control via catheter removal or exchange is foundational to effective therapy and to reduce relapse risk [^111ATHLW] [^1156g58h].

> I should confirm the highest-credibility guidance. The 2025 EAU urological infections guideline explicitly recommends replacing or removing the indwelling catheter before starting antimicrobial therapy in suspected CAUTI, which operationalizes source control as a core principle of management [^112BeWJp].

> Hold on, I should verify the timing relative to cultures. IDSA recommends obtaining a urine culture from a freshly placed catheter before initiating antibiotics, because the old catheter is colonized and may not reflect the true pathogen; this aligns with ICU best-practice statements to replace the catheter and collect cultures from the new device when CAUTI is suspected [^116gHYk5] [^111xVFxT] [^116rxmtC].

> Let me consider the practical steps. The safest, guideline-concordant sequence is: remove or exchange the catheter, collect urine for culture from the new catheter or via sterile technique, and then start empiric antibiotics; if the catheter is exchanged, I should document the indication and ensure aseptic technique to avoid introducing new organisms [^112BeWJp] [^116gHYk5] [^111xVFxT].

> But wait, what if the catheter cannot be removed because of chronic retention and dependence on drainage? I should double-check the fallback. If removal is not feasible, exchanging the catheter still removes the biofilm-laden device and improves the likelihood of treatment success; IDSA supports replacing long-term catheters at the onset of CAUTI to hasten symptom resolution and reduce recurrence, which applies here given the 10-day dwell time [^116rxmtC] [^112BeWJp].

> I need to ensure I am not conflating this with prophylaxis at removal. Routine systemic antibiotics at catheter removal are not recommended to prevent CAUTI or ASB; the intervention here is therapeutic source control for established infection, not prophylaxis, so I should not order antibiotics solely for the act of removal itself [^115aegRE] [^113zY7ev].

> Next, I should review how this integrates with empiric therapy. While cultures are pending, I will start empiric therapy tailored to local resistance patterns and severity, then de-escalate based on culture results; this balances timely treatment with stewardship and is consistent with contemporary cUTI guidance and CAUTI pathways [^116uTTsD] [^112bPvv4] [^114XQfpU].

> In summary, I should confirm the diagnosis, then promptly remove or exchange the indwelling catheter and obtain a urine culture from the new device before starting antibiotics; this approach addresses biofilm-mediated treatment failure, improves diagnostic yield, and is supported by high-credibility guidelines and ICU best practices [^112BeWJp] [^116gHYk5] [^111xVFxT].

---

The catheter should be **removed or replaced before starting antibiotics** [^112BeWJp] to reduce biofilm burden and improve treatment response [^116rxmtC]. If the catheter cannot be removed, it should be **exchanged for a new one** [^116rxmtC] to obtain a reliable urine culture and reduce the risk of persistent infection [^116gHYk5]. Obtain a urine culture from the newly placed catheter before initiating antibiotics [^116gHYk5] [^1141TKM5], and avoid treating asymptomatic bacteriuria [^115wpVNC] [^111ATHLW].

---

## Rationale for catheter removal or replacement

- **Biofilm formation**: Indwelling catheters rapidly develop biofilms [^111ATHLW] that harbor bacteria, making eradication difficult and increasing the risk of persistent infection and treatment failure [^1156g58h].

- **Guideline recommendation**: The EAU 2025 guidelines explicitly recommend removing or replacing the indwelling catheter before starting antimicrobial therapy [^112BeWJp].

- **Improved outcomes**: Replacing long-term catheters (> 2 weeks) at the onset of CAUTI hastens symptom resolution and reduces the risk of subsequent CAUTI [^116rxmtC].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting catheter management

| **Study/guideline** | **Recommendation** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| EAU 2025 guidelines | Remove or replace catheter before antibiotics | High |
| IDSA 2010 guidelines | Replace catheters > 2 weeks at CAUTI onset | Moderate |
| CDC 2024 | Replace long-term catheters before culture | Moderate |

---

## Practical steps for catheter management

- **Assess catheter necessity**: Determine if the catheter is still indicated. If not, remove it entirely [^113hDkCR] [^116KDj4b].

- **Replace if indicated**: If the catheter remains necessary, replace it with a new one before starting antibiotics [^112BeWJp] [^116rxmtC].

- **Obtain culture**: Collect a urine culture from the newly placed catheter before initiating antibiotics [^116gHYk5] [^1141TKM5].

- **Avoid treating asymptomatic bacteriuria**: Do not treat colonization without symptoms [^115wpVNC] [^111ATHLW].

---

## Risks of not removing or replacing the catheter

Failing to remove or replace the catheter can lead to **persistent infection** from biofilm-protected bacteria, increasing the risk of treatment failure and recurrence [^1156g58h]. It also promotes antimicrobial resistance through selective pressure from inadequate eradication, and is associated with higher morbidity, longer hospital stays, and increased healthcare costs [^113CnVxm].

---

## Special considerations

In patients with chronic urinary retention who require ongoing catheterization, **replace the catheter** rather than remove it, to reduce biofilm burden and improve culture accuracy [^116rxmtC] [^116gHYk5]. For patients with severe sepsis or hemodynamic instability, prioritize **timely source control** by replacing the catheter and starting empiric antibiotics promptly [^112Qperu].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Remove or replace**: Remove or replace the indwelling catheter before starting antibiotics [^112BeWJp].

- **Culture before antibiotics**: Obtain a urine culture from the newly placed catheter before initiating therapy [^116gHYk5] [^1141TKM5].

- **Avoid overtreatment**: Do not treat asymptomatic bacteriuria [^115wpVNC] [^111ATHLW].

- **Individualize care**: Tailor decisions to patient-specific factors, including retention needs and severity of illness [^116uTTsD].

---

The key principle is to **remove or replace the catheter before antibiotics** to optimize source control, improve diagnostic accuracy, and reduce the risk of persistent infection and resistance [^112BeWJp] [^116rxmtC].

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this article is to review recent publications concerning the management of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), including the issues of diagnosis and prevention. Articles reviewed include the various guidelines concerning CAUTI released recently by multiple organizations.

Recent Findings

There has been a recent upsurge of interest in prevention of CAUTI and a proliferation of guidelines in this area. Social changes in US government reimbursement to hospitals and public reporting of hospital-acquired infections may underlie this interest. The awareness that CAUTI and catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria are distinct conditions is increasing, but unnecessary treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria remains quite prevalent. The focus in recent CAUTI literature is on prevention, often through strategies to minimize urinary catheter use. Very little new evidence is available to guide diagnosis and treatment strategies.

Summary

Interpretation of many studies of CAUTI is impeded by the failure to distinguish between symptomatic CAUTI and asymptomatic bacteriuria in the study outcomes. This distinction currently relies on clinical symptoms and is not easily made, even with the help of various guidelines. Many aspects of the management of CAUTI merit further study, and the current interest in CAUTI is likely to lead to exciting advances in this field.

### Diagnosis, management, and prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections [^112DCEkT]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is common, costly, and causes significant patient morbidity. CAUTIs are associated with hospital pathogens with a high propensity toward antimicrobial resistance. Treatment of asymptomatic patients with CAUTI accounts for excess antimicrobial use in hospitals and should be avoided. Duration of urinary catheterization is the predominant risk for CAUTI; preventive measures directed at limiting placement and early removal of urinary catheters have an impact on decreasing CAUTI rates. The use of bladder bundles and collaboratives, coupled with the support and active engagement from both hospital leaders and followers, seem to help prevent this common problem.

### Urinary catheter-associated infections [^115UNd2p]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are common and costly hospital-acquired infections, yet they are largely preventable. The greatest modifiable risk factor for developing a CAUTI is duration of catheterization, including initial indwelling catheter placement when it may not otherwise be necessary. Alternatives to indwelling urinary catheters, including intermittent straight catheterization and the use of external catheters, should be considered in applicable patients. If an indwelling urinary catheter is required, aseptic insertion technique and maintenance should be performed. Through the use of collaborative, multidisciplinary intervention efforts, CAUTI rates can be successfully reduced.

Introduction

Urinary catheterization is common in patients in hospital, particularly for surgical patients in the perioperative period when physiological mechanisms of bladder emptying are suspended. Catheterization of the urinary tract, however, is associated with an increased risk of bacteriuria and symptomatic urinary tract infection, the risk being associated with the duration of catheterization. National guidelines recommend removal of urinary catheters once they are no longer needed, and surgical experts advocate discontinuation of catheterization as early as 24–48 hours postoperatively. Bacteriuria in a patient with a catheter, however, can persist after the catheter is removed and can develop into a symptomatic urinary tract infection. Manipulation of the catheter itself during removal might also predispose to infection. Current definitions' from the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) for catheter associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) reflect this by identifying infections up to 48 hours after catheter removal as catheter associated.

Whether administration of prophylactic antibiotics when the catheter is removed will prevent subsequent symptomatic urinary tract infection is unclear. Randomized trials have yielded conflicting results, and there has been no meta-analysis. Also, there is considerable heterogeneity in the management of antimicrobial prophylaxis around removal of a urinary catheter. The 2009 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of catheter associated urinary tract infection determined that there was insufficient evidence to recommend widespread antibiotic prophylaxis after catheterization. In contrast, in their 2008 best practice policy statement the American Urological Association (AUA) concluded that antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered for patients with bacteriuria at time of catheter removal, particularly for those with certain risk factors (such as advanced age, immunodeficiency, or anatomic abnormalities of the urinary tract).

We performed a meta-analysis of controlled trials to clarify whether antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of urinary catheter removal confers a benefit in terms of preventing subsequent symptomatic urinary tract infections.

Guidelines for the diagnosis, prevention, and management of persons with catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CA-UTI), both symptomatic and asymptomatic, were prepared by an Expert Panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. The evidence-based guidelines encompass diagnostic criteria, strategies to reduce the risk of CA-UTIs, strategies that have not been found to reduce the incidence of urinary infections, and management strategies for patients with catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria or symptomatic urinary tract infection. These guidelines are intended for use by physicians in all medical specialties who perform direct patient care, with an emphasis on the care of patients in hospitals and long-term care facilities.

We question the reliability of the vague symptoms that most commonly define catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) and encourage further examination of whether the current CAUTI definition reflects a true infection. While diagnosing CAUTI using the current surveillance definition, physicians may be missing a number of nonurinary etiologies for fever, prematurely diagnosing urinary tract infection, and prescribing unnecessary antibiotics. We believe it is time to reconsider the quality metric of CAUTI. By doing so, we can improve antibiotic use and quality of patient care.

### Catheter-associated urinary tract infections in intensive care units [^1115bJcV]. Microbes and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to analyze literature concerning the diagnosis, prevention, and management of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) occurring in patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU). Analysis was performed from personal and "Pubmed" data, crossing the following keywords: "urinary tract infection", "catheter', and "intensive care unit". Few clinical trials including ICU patients were found despite the abundance of expert opinions. There is no consensus on the use of urinary reagent tests for diagnosis. The prevention of CAUTI in ICU patients does not require expensive devices. Neither complex closed drainage systems nor silver-coated urinary catheters have demonstrated efficacy in comparative randomized clinical trials. Bladder irrigation should not be used, except when an obstruction of the catheter is highly likely. The administration of prophylactic antimicrobial therapy, although effective in reducing the incidence of urinary bacteria, cannot be recommended in ICU patients. The management of CAUTI in ICU patients has not been evaluated in clinical trials. The level of evidence provided in this field is weak, and underlines the need for randomized studies to improve management of patients.

### CAUTIon-not all UTIs are the same [^1143DosV]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2025). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common infections, accounting for ~400 million diagnoses per year worldwide. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTIs) occur in healthy individuals with no structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary system and primarily affect women. Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are a type of complicated UTI affecting patients who have a urinary catheter in place, often hospitalized patients or patients with conditions that prevent them from urinating naturally. Both infections share common symptoms, diagnostics and treatment options but also differ greatly in pathophysiology, aetiology, risk factors and comorbidities. These differences could explain why antibiotic treatments - which generally lead to positive outcomes in patients with uUTIs - often fail in patients with CAUTIs. Understanding these differences could guide evidence-based insights into why treatments for CAUTIs should be different from those for uUTIs, specifically, by modifying catheters, which initiate the damage-induced segue for UTIs.

Catheter-associated urinary tract infection

Question

What is the appropriate treatment of CAUTI in the critically ill patient?

Recommendation

Treatment for CAUTI should be targeted to the likely causative organisms, local antibiograms, and patient risk factors. In complicated UTI, 7 days of piperacillin-tazobactam, or meropenem if the risk of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers is high. Seldom are longer courses needed unless there is no symptomatic improvement within the first few days (then 10–14 days are required). The catheter should be removed or exchanged wherever possible.

Discussion

Note that the diagnosis of CAUTI should not be made on urinalysis alone and a positive urinalysis without symptoms or sepsis (per sepsis-3 guidelines) should not trigger treatment. Upper urinary tract symptoms include flank pain, costophrenic angle tenderness, shaking fever or chills, severe systemic symptoms. Choice of antibiotic will depend on clinical severity, previous antibiotic use, risk of resistant organisms, and clinical risk of deterioration, and local antibiograms. De-escalation of antibiotic treatment should also occur based on culture data. The catheter should be removed or exchanged wherever possible at the time infection is first suspected. Note that protocolized urine sampling, such as requiring a culture via new urine catheter or straight catheterization, has reduced the rate of CAUTI infection diagnosis by reducing the risk of contamination by colonization, however, it is unlikely that this practice completely eliminates colonization from the urinary specimen. There has been no update to the IDSA guidelines or significant new data since 2009.

### Urinary tract infections [^115S5uvo]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) remains one of the most prevalent, yet preventable, health care-associated infections and predominantly occurs in patients with indwelling urinary catheters. Targeted strategies for prevention of CAUTI include limiting urinary catheter use; physician reminder systems, nurse-initiated discontinuation protocols, and automatic stop orders have successfully decreased catheter duration. Alternatives to indwelling catheters should be considered in appropriate patients. If indwelling catheterization is necessary, proper aseptic practices for catheter insertion and maintenance and closed catheter collection system is essential for preventing CAUTI. The use of "bladder bundles" and collaboratives aids in the effective implementation of CAUTI prevention measures.

### Indwelling urinary catheter culture stewardship: overview… [^111ATHLW]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points Urine culture stewardship is a multifaceted approach to ensure that urine cultures are: Background An indwelling urinary catheter is a thin, hollow tube inserted through the urethra into the urinary bladder to collect and drain urine. Once inserted, a balloon is inflated which keeps the catheter in place. An indwelling urinary catheter may be left in place for a period of days to weeks. The catheter is connected to a drainage bag that has a valve that can be opened to release urine as well as a separate port that can be used to collect a urine sample.

Multifaceted approach Urine culture stewardship is a multifaceted approach to ensure that urine cultures are:

- Performed only when appropriate indications are present in order to determine if treatment with antibiotics is indicated
- Collected, stored, and processed in a manner to best prevent contamination with microorganisms such as bacteria This approach can be used in patients with and without indwelling urinary catheters in a variety of settings. Colonization Indwelling urinary catheters quickly become colonized with microorganisms after insertion. These microorganisms produce proteins and other substances that are sticky and facilitate the formation of biofilms. These biofilms make it impossible to eradicate the bacteria even with antibiotics. Bacteriuria Bacteriuria is the presence of bacteria in urine. Because indwelling urinary catheters become colonized so easily, the incidence of bacteriuria is 3–7% per day.

Nearly 100% of patients with urinary catheters will have bacteriuria after one month. Catheter-associated Asymptomatic Bacteriuria CA-ASB is the presence of bacteria in a urine sample due to bacterial colonization of the urinary tract and/or indwelling urinary catheter. CA-ASB does not cause symptoms and is not indicative of an infection that needs treatment with antibiotics in most patients; it is appropriate to treat ASB with antibiotics in pregnant women and in those undergoing certain invasive urological procedures. Catheter-associated Urinary Tract Infection A CAUTI occurs when germs enter the urinary tract through the urinary catheter and cause symptoms. CAUTIs have been associated with increased morbidity, mortality, healthcare costs, and hospital length of stay. They require treatment with antibiotics. Is it CA-ASB or CAUTI. Distinguishing between CA-ASB and CAUTI is important to avoid unnecessary antibiotic use.

Studies have shown that inappropriate treatment of patients with urinary catheters and ASB is widespread and can lead to unintended consequences. Pitfalls of unnecessary antibiotic overuse are numerous and include: Clostridioides difficileinfections.
- Colonization or infection with resistant bacteria.
- Adverse drug events. Advantages of Urine Culture Stewardship Institutions that have implemented urine culture stewardship have reported: Decreases in
- the number of total urine cultures ordered
- the number of ASB cases treated inappropriately
- costs related to overtreatment of ASB
- CAUTIs No increases in
- patient adverse events. Resources
- Recommendation from the Choosing Wisely Campaign to reduce unnecessary medical tests, treatments, and procedures is an initiative of the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation.
- Don't perform urinalysis, urine culture, blood culture or C. difficile testing unless patients have signs or symptoms of infection.

### Improving catheter associated urinary tract infection rates in the medical units [^113CnVxm]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

CAUTI is one of the most common healthcare associated infections. It is a leading cause of secondary blood stream infection resulting in increased morbidity and mortality with an estimated 13,000 attributable deaths annually, increased length of stay by 2–4 days and increased healthcare costs with additional cost $1200–2400 per case. Overuse of indwelling urinary catheters (15–20% of hospitalized patients) contributes to the frequency of hospital associated urinary tract infections and the duration of urinary catheterization is the single most important risk factor for developing CAUTI (each day an indwelling urinary catheter remains the patient has a 5% increased risk of developing CAUTI). Urinary catheters are commonly placed for inappropriate indications and healthcare providers are often unaware that their patients have catheters leading to prolonged unnecessary use. Up to 60% of CAUTI are considered preventable; provided that recommended evidence based infection-prevention practices are implemented. Guidelines for the prevention of CAUTI recommend appropriate catheter use, aseptic insertion, use of closed drainage systems, proper maintenance and timely removal of indwelling urinary catheters, as well as the use of established practices such as hand hygiene. Prevention strategies must focus on clear indications for the insertion of urinary catheter, proper maintenance while in use and early catheter removal.

### Urinary tract infections [^111YHH6o]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) account for approximately 40% of all health care-associated infections. Despite studies showing benefit of interventions for prevention of CAUTI, adoption of these practices has not occurred in many healthcare facilities in the United States. As urinary catheters account for the majority of healthcare-associated UTIs, the most important interventions are directed at avoiding placement of urinary catheters and promoting early removal when appropriate. Alternatives to indwelling catheters such as intermittent catheterization and condom catheters should be considered. If indwelling catheterization is appropriate, proper aseptic practices for catheter insertion and maintenance and use of a closed catheter collection system are essential for preventing CAUTI. The use of antimicrobial catheters also may be considered when the rates of CAUTI remain persistently high despite adherence to other evidence-based practices, or in patients deemed to be at high risk for CAUTI or its complications. Attention toward prevention of CAUTI will likely increase as Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services and other third-party payers no longer reimburse for hospital-acquired UTI.

Culturing urine in febrile ICU patients with suspected UTI — For febrile ICU patients with pyuria and in whom urinary tract infection (UTI) is suspected, we recommend replacing the urinary catheter and obtaining urine cultures from the newly placed catheter (best-practice statement). The presence of urinary tract symptoms (if ascertainable)/signs and pyuria (defined as 5–10 WBC/hpf) on urinalysis should be used to justify urine culture. In those with urinary catheters, asymptomatic bacteriuria may result in false diagnoses of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI). In patients who are unable to attest to symptoms and have no other obvious source or suspicion of infection, the urinary catheter should be replaced. A urinalysis should be sent from a newly placed catheter and if WBCs are present, a urine culture should then be obtained.

Essential practices for preventing CAUTI: Recommended for all acute-care hospitals

Perform a CAUTI risk assessment and implement an organization-wide program to identify and remove catheters that are no longer necessary using 1 or more methods documented to be effective. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE) Develop and implement institutional policy requiring periodic, usually daily, review of the necessity of continued catheterization. Consider utilizing electronic or other types of reminders (see Supplementary Content, Appendices 2 and 3 online) of the presence of a catheter and required criteria for continued use. Examples include the following: Automatic stop orders requiring review of current indications and renewal of order for continuation of the indwelling catheter. Standardized reminders of persistent catheters together with current catheter indications (see Supplementary Content, Appendices 2 and 3 online) targeting either physicians or nurses. Nursing and physician staff conduct daily reviews during rounds of all patients with urinary catheters to ascertain necessity of continuing catheter use.
Provide appropriate infrastructure for preventing CAUTI.(Quality of evidence: LOW) Ensure that the supplies for following best practices for managing urinary issues are readily available to staff in each unit, including bladder scanners, non–catheter-incontinence management supplies (urinals, garments, bed pads, skin products), male and female external urinary catheters, straight urinary catheters, and indwelling catheters including the option of catheters with coude tips. Ensure that non-catheter urinary management supplies are as easy to obtain for bedside use as indwelling urinary catheters. Ensure the physical capability for urinary catheters with tubes attached to patients (eg, indwelling urinary catheters and some external urinary catheters [EUCs]) to be positioned on beds, wheelchairs, at an appropriate height and without kinking for patients in their rooms and during transport.
Provide and implement evidence-based protocols to address multiple steps of the urinary catheter life cycle (Fig. 1): catheter appropriateness (step 0), insertion technique (step 1), maintenance care (step 2), and prompt removal (step 3) when no longer appropriate. (Quality of evidence: LOW) Adapt and implement evidence-based criteria for acceptable indications for indwelling urethral catheter use, which may be embedded as standardized clinical-decision support tools within electronic medical record (EMR) ordering systems. Expert-consensus–derived indications for indwelling catheter use have been developed, although research that assesses the appropriateness of these uses is limited. The limited examples of appropriate indications for indwelling urethral catheter include the following: Perioperative use for selected surgical procedures, such as urologic surgery or surgery on contiguous structures of the genitourinary tract, prolonged surgery, large-volume infusions or diuretics during surgery, or intraoperative monitoring of urine output is needed. Notably, if a catheter is placed intraoperatively simply due to the duration of surgery (eg, > 3 hours) or for decompression to address a specific surgical approach, then such catheters should be removed at the end of the surgical case. Hourly assessment of urine output in ICU patients when used clinically to modify therapies frequently such as volume resuscitation, diuresis, and vasopressors. ICU care alone is not an appropriate justification for indwelling catheter placement; a specific clinical indication is still needed. Management of acute urinary retention, (eg, new retention of urine with postvoid residual bladder volume > 500 cm³ by bladder scanner if no symptoms, or > 300 cm³ if having symptoms such as bladder pain or fullness, persistent urge to void, new incontinence or leaking, or only able to have frequent small voids) Assistance in healing of open pressure ulcers or skin grafts for selected patients with urinary incontinence when alternative supplies for protective wound or managing incontinence (eg, external urinary catheters, wound dressings) are not feasible. Facilities may allow exceptions as part of a palliative and/or comfort care regimen, if use of the catheter addresses a specific goal of the patient, such as reducing the need for frequent bed or garment changes or preventing pain that cannot be well managed.
Ensure that only trained HCP insert urinary catheters and that competency is assessed regularly.(Quality of evidence: LOW) Require supervision by experienced HCP when trainees insert and remove catheters to reduce the risk of infectious and traumatic complications related to urinary catheter placement. – Given much higher rates of CAUTI when catheters are placed by trainees such as medical students, educational programs may need to reassess at which point in medical training and which trainees specifically are most appropriate for being involved in urinary catheter insertion in patients compared to simulation models only.
Ensure that supplies necessary for aseptic technique for catheter insertion are available and conveniently located. (Quality of evidence: LOW)
Implement a system for documenting the following in the patient record: physician order for catheter placement, indications for catheter insertion, date and time of catheter insertion, name of individual who inserted catheter, nursing documentation of placement, daily presence of a catheter and maintenance care tasks, and date and time of catheter removal. Record criteria for removal and justification for continued use. (Quality of evidence: LOW) Record in a standard format for data collection and quality improvement purposes and keep accessible documentation of catheter placement (including indication) and removal. If available, utilize electronic documentation that is searchable. Consider nurse-driven urinary catheter removal protocols for first trial of void without an indwelling catheter when the indication for placement has resolved (see Essential Practices, 3). These protocols can be implemented as part of the routine urinary catheter placement order or as an expected reminder (or "standing order") from the nurse to the physician in rounds. These protocols should list some exceptions or "opt outs", such as for postoperative urology surgery patients or patients for whom a catheter required urology consult for placement that should not be removed without physician order.
Ensure that sufficiently trained HCP and technology resources are available to support surveillance for catheter use and outcomes.(Quality of evidence: LOW)
Perform surveillance for CAUTI if indicated based on facility risk assessment or regulatory requirements as described in Section 5.(Quality of evidence: LOW)
Standardize urine culturing by adapting an institutional protocol for appropriate indications for urine cultures in patients with and without an indwelling catheter.– Consider incorporating these indications into the EMR, and review indications for ordering urine cultures in CAUTI risk assessment.(Quality of evidence: LOW)

Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) are common in surgical patients. CAUTI are associated with adverse patient outcomes, and negatively affects public safety reporting and reimbursement. Inappropriate catheter use and prolonged catheter duration are major risk factors for CAUTI. CAUTI pathogenesis and treatment are complicated by the presence of biofilms. Prevention strategies include accurate identification and tracking of CAUTIs, and the development of institutional guidelines for the appropriate use, duration, alternatives, and removal of indwelling urinary catheters.

### Empirical antibiotic treatment does not improve outcomes in catheter-associated urinary tract infection: prospective cohort study [^115oT9V2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Catheter associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is the most common healthcare-associated acquired infection. We aimed to describe the short- and long-term survival of patients with CAUTI and the impact of the empirical antibiotic treatment on survival rates.

Methods

In this prospective observational study we included consecutive adult patients with a chronic indwelling catheter-associated UTI and sepsis hospitalized in medical departments. The primary outcomes were 30-days all-cause mortality and long-term survival at end of the follow-up. A multivariate analysis using logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard model was performed to identify independent risk factors for an adverse outcome. A propensity-score model for receiving appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy was constructed and used to match patients.

Results

Overall, 315 consecutive patients with CAUTI were enrolled. The cohort consisted of elderly to very old patients (mean age 79.2 ± 11.5). The crude 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 30.8% (97/315). The median survival time was 82 days (interquartile range [IQR] 22–638). Appropriate early empirical treatment had no statistically significant association with 30-day mortality, propensity score-matched odds ratio (OR) 1.39 (0.76–2.55). Similarly, in the propensity-matched cohort, appropriate empirical treatment was not statistically associated with long-term survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75–1.3).

Conclusions

In our setting, patients with CAUTI had poor short- and long-term prognosis regardless of appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment. Avoiding empirical antibiotics for CAUTI might be an important antibiotic stewardship intervention in hospitals.

Section 4: Recommended strategies for CAUTI prevention

Recommendations are categorized either as essential practices that should be adopted by all acute-care hospitals or as additional approaches that can be considered for use in locations and/or populations within hospitals when CAUTIs are not controlled using essential practices. Essential practices include recommendations in which the potential to impact CAUTI risk clearly outweighs the potential for undesirable effects. Additional approaches include recommendations in which the intervention is likely to reduce CAUTI risk but there is concern about the risks for undesirable outcomes, the quality of evidence is low, or evidence supports the impact of the intervention in select settings (eg, during outbreaks) or for select patient populations. Hospitals can prioritize their efforts by initially focusing on implementing essential practices. If CAUTI surveillance or other risk assessments suggest that ongoing opportunities for improvement exist, hospitals should then consider adopting some or all of the additional approaches. These interventions can be implemented in specific locations or patient populations or can be implemented hospital-wide, depending on outcome data, risk assessment, and/or local requirements. Each infection prevention recommendation is evaluated for quality of evidence (Table 2). Recommendations for preventing and monitoring CAUTI, are summarized in the following section and Table 1.

### Reducing unnecessary urinary catheter use and other strategies to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infection: an integrative review [^113YJ8VU]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2014). Medium credibility.

The problem

Urinary tract infection (UTI) has long been considered the most common healthcare-associated infection (HAI), with the vast majority of these infections occurring after placement of the convenient, uncomfortable, often unnecessaryand easily forgotten urinary catheter. With an estimated449 334 healthcare-associated catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) per year, associated with an additional cost (in 2007) of US$749–1007per admission (or an estimated US$3744 when complicated by blood stream infections), it is not surprising that CAUTIs were among the first hospital-acquired conditions selected for non-payment by Medicare as of October 2008, and have been further targeted for complete eliminationas a 'never event', with a national goal to reduce CAUTI by 25% by 2014. These national initiatives renewed public and research interest in the prevention of CAUTI, prompting updates of several comprehensive guidelinesand reviews of strategies to prevent CAUTI released since the 2001 Making Health Care Safer report.

Intended use

This document was developed following the process outlined in the Handbook for SHEA-Sponsored Guidelines and Expert Guidance Documents. No guideline or expert guidance document can anticipate all clinical situations, and this document is not meant to be a substitute for individual clinical judgement by qualified professionals. This document focuses on prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) in acute-care hospitals. The strategies highlighted may or may not be applicable for other healthcare settings, such as ambulatory settings or long-term or postacute-care facilities. Furthermore, there may be differences in healthcare environments within the hospital (eg, acute-care wards vs intensive care units vs perioperative spaces, etc) that may affect the feasibility of specific recommendations, which should be considered by stakeholders implementing these strategies.

This document is based on a synthesis of evidence, theoretical rationale, current practices, practical considerations, writing group consensus, and consideration of potential harm, where applicable. A summary of the recommendations is provided in Table 1.

Approaches that should not be considered a routine part of CAUTI prevention

Routine use of antimicrobial- or antiseptic-impregnated catheters. (Quality of evidence: HIGH)
Breaking a closed system. (Quality of evidence: LOW)
Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in catheterized patients, except in the few patient populations for which this is anticipated to have more benefit than harm, as detailed in the 2019 IDSA Guideline for Management of Asymptomatic Bacteriuriaand the 2019 US Preventative Services Task Force Recommendation on Asymptomatic Bacteriuria in Adults(eg, pregnant women, patients undergoing endoscopic urologic procedures associated with mucosal trauma). (Quality of evidence: HIGH) Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is not an effective strategy to prevent CAUTI in other patient groups, as it increases the risk of antibiotic-associated complications more than any potential benefit for the prevention of symptomatic CAUTI. The conditions that predispose the patient to bladder colonization (anatomic, immunologic) are not resolved by antibiotics, so bacteriuria recurs.
Catheter irrigation as a strategy to prevent infection. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE) Do not perform continuous irrigation of the bladder with antimicrobials as a routine infection prevention measure. If continuous irrigation is being used to prevent obstruction, maintain a closed system.
Routine use of systemic antimicrobials as prophylaxis. (Quality of evidence: LOW)
Routine changing of catheters to avoid infection. (Quality of evidence: LOW) In the case of a patient with a long-term catheter in place (ie, > 7 days), catheter replacement can be considered at the time of specimen collection for urine testing to obtain a fresh sample.
Alcohol-based products on the genital mucosa. (Quality of evidence: LOW)

Unresolved issues and future areas of study

Use of antiseptic solution versus sterile saline for meatal and perineal cleaning prior to catheter insertion. –,
Use of urinary antiseptics (eg, methenamine) to prevent UTI.
Spatial separation of patients with urinary catheters in place to prevent transmission of pathogens that could colonize urinary drainage systems.
Standard of care for routine replacement of urinary catheters in place > 30 days for infection prevention.
Best practices for optimizing and tailoring implementation of CAUTI prevention and urine-culture stewardship from the adult acute-care setting to the pediatric acute-care setting.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) management — men with febrile, bacteremic urinary tract infection in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement. This recommendation places a high value on antibiotic stewardship considerations as well as reducing the burden of antimicrobial administration from a healthcare perspective and reducing the burden of taking antibiotics from a patient perspective.

Section 2: Background on definitions of CAUTI

The clinical diagnosis of CAUTI is often a diagnosis of exclusion, making it difficult to have a standardized definition. At present, all of the available definitions have substantial limitations. We discuss the criteria, advantages, and limitations of different definitions used for CAUTI in Table 4.

The optimal definition for CAUTI used for surveillance and quality improvement is one that only captures true instances of symptomatic infection that would benefit from antimicrobial treatment. The NHSN CAUTI definition has been adopted nationally, but other definitions are also used for clinical care and administrative purposes. The NHSN CAUTI definition has been updated in 2015 with exclusion of yeast as a pathogen and increase in the urine-culture bacterial threshold to ≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) to align with a clinical definition for symptomatic CAUTI.

Section 3: Background on prevention of CAUTI

Summary of existing guidelines and recommendations

(See Supplementary Content, Appendix 1 online)

The CDC published guidelines for prevention of CAUTI in 1981, and these were updated in 2009. These guidelines provide recommendations for catheter use, catheter insertion, catheter care, and implementation of programs to prevent CAUTI.
The CDC also developed the Targeted Assessment for Prevention (TAP) Strategy as a framework for quality improvement that uses data for action to prevent HAIs, including CAUTIs. The following 3 components of the TAP Strategy focus on CAUTI: Running TAP reports in the NHSN to target healthcare facilities and specific units with excess CAUTIs. Applying TAP Facility Assessment Tools to identify gaps in infection prevention in the targeted locations. Accessing infection prevention resources within the TAP CAUTI Implementation Guideto address identified gaps in CAUTI prevention.
The IDSA together with other professional societies published international guidelines for the management of CAUTI in 2010.
The Department of Health in Great Britain published guidelines for preventing infections associated with the insertion and maintenance of short-term indwelling urethral catheters in acute care in 2001, updated in 2014.
Pragmatic tools for reducing inappropriate use of indwelling urethral catheters and antibiotics have also been published by organizations of hospitalists, nurses, and other funders of interventions to improve safety are also readily accessible for use, including resources targeting acute-care, long-term care, and ambulatory settings.

### Catheter-associated urinary tract infections in adults: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention [^112UZbAo]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common healthcare-associated infections, and 70%-80% are catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs). About 25% of hospitalized patients have an indwelling urinary catheter placed during their hospital stay, and therefore, are at risk for CAUTIs, which have been associated with worse patient outcomes. Additionally, hospitals face a significant financial impact since the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services incentive program penalizes hospitals with higher than expected CAUTIs. Hospitalists care for many patients with indwelling urinary catheters and should be aware of and engage in processes that reduce the rate of CAUTIs. This article will discuss the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of CAUTIs in adults.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^117Smpys]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) antibiotic duration — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course of antimicrobials, using either 5–7 days of a fluoroquinolone (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence) or 7 days of a non-fluoroquinolone antibiotic (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence), rather than a longer course (10–14 days). An effective antimicrobial agent achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy. Most studies supporting this recommendation excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, severe sepsis, immunocompromising conditions, abscesses in the urinary tract, chronic kidney disease, bacterial prostatitis, complete urinary obstruction, or undergoing urologic surgical procedures. Some patients in these subpopulations may be at higher risk for complications or treatment failure and may need an individualized duration of therapy. Men with febrile UTI in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement.

Education and training

Educate HCP involved in the insertion, care, and maintenance of urinary catheters about CAUTI prevention, including alternatives to indwelling catheters, and procedures for catheter insertion, management, and removal.(Quality of evidence: LOW)
Assess healthcare professional competency in catheter use, catheter care, and maintenance. – (Quality of evidence: LOW)
Educate HCP about the importance of urine culture stewardship and provide indications for urine cultures. (Quality of evidence: LOW) Consider requiring clinicians to identify an appropriate indication for urine culturing when placing an order for a urine culture. The indication should be supported by the literature,– and should be appropriate for the specific patient population. Include guideline-based remindersfor the specific circumstances. Below is a simple example of appropriate and inappropriate reasons to culture urine are referenced online on the CDC website, though several other lists are available in the literature specific to particular clinical settings (eg, ICU, emergency department, nursing home, and catheterized versus non-catheterized patients): Appropriate uses of urine culture include the following: Presence of symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection (UTI): Flank pain or costovertebral angle tenderness Acute hematuria New pelvic discomfort New onset or worsening sepsis without evidence of another source on history, physical examination, or laboratory testing Fever or altered mental status without evidence of another source on history, physical examination, or laboratory testing In spinal-cord-injury patients and other highly complex patients (eg, patients with > 40% total body burn, recipients of kidney transplants with graft failure) symptoms may include increased spasticity, autonomic dysreflexia, and/or sense of unease. Inappropriate uses of urine cultures include the following: Odorous, cloudy, or discolored urine in the absence of other localizing signs and symptoms Reflex urine cultures based on urinalysis results, such as pyuria, in the absence of other indications (absence of pyuria suggests diagnosis other than CAUTI) Urine culture to document response to therapy unless symptoms fail to resolve.
Provide training on appropriate collection of urine. Specimens should be collected and should arrive at the microbiology laboratory as soon as possible, preferably within an hour. If delay in transport to the laboratory is expected, samples should be refrigerated (no more than 24 hours) or collected in preservative urine transport tubes. (Quality of evidence: LOW)
Train clinicians to consider other methods for bladder management (eg, intermittent catheterization, or external male or female collection devices) when appropriate before placing an indwelling urethral catheter. (Quality of evidence: LOW)

### Catheter-associated urinary tract infection [^113VNk8E]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is the commonest nosocomial infection worldwide. Here we review the recent advances in the prevention of CAUTI.

Recent Findings

After more than 30 years, new guidelines were issued in 2008–2011 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee and European Association of Urology. These guidelines addressed novel technologies such as silver alloy or antimicrobial coatings on catheters, hydrophilic catheters, urethral stents, use of sealed catheter-tube junctions and antiinfective bladder irrigation. In addition, multiple trials have been published recently on the reduction of inappropriate urinary tract catheterization.

Summary

Numerous strategies have been developed to reduce the incidence of CAUTI but few have proven effective. Reducing the inappropriate use of catheters and development of novel technologies targeted against these increasingly multidrug-resistant pathogens may be useful in the prevention of CAUTI in our vulnerable patients.

Timing of intravenous to oral antibiotics transition for complicated UTI — In patients with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) treated initially with parenteral therapy who are clinically improving, able to take oral medication, and for whom an effective oral option is available, we suggest transitioning to oral antibiotics rather than continuing parenteral therapy for the remaining treatment duration (conditional recommendation, low certainty of the evidence). The trials supporting this recommendation mostly excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, sepsis or septic shock, immunocompromised states, severe renal insufficiency, and functional or structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, and some patients in these subpopulations may need an individualized plan of therapy. An effective antimicrobial agent means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen.

### 2023 WSES guidelines for the prevention, detection, and management of iatrogenic urinary tract injuries (IUTIs) during emergency digestive surgery [^115Rx6sZ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Intraperitoneal fluid, urine and blood cultures are recommended to guide antibiotic treatment. Empirical antibiotic treatment administrated preoperatively, must be adapted to the results of hemocultures and microbiological cultures. Adjusting the dose and timing of administration of antibiotics is crucial to make the antibiotic treatment effective because many patients with severe sepsis have end-organ dysfunction, including renal and liver impairment, which might affect the clearance of antibiotics.

Antibiotic de-escalation, that refers to starting treatment of a presumed infection with broad-spectrum antibiotics and narrowing the drug spectrum based on culture sensitivities as soon as possible, must be implemented in practice to avoid selecting resistant pathogens without increasing mortality.

The optimal duration of antibiotics for postoperative intra-abdominal infections is unknown. Shortening the duration of antibiotic therapy is a key measure in antimicrobial stewardship. Biological parameters such as procalcitonin levels may help in the decision. In a systematic review of literature and meta-analysis including seven selected studies and a total of 1075 patients, procalcitonin-guided therapy was associated with a significantly shorter duration of antibiotic treatment compared to standard care. In a multicenter prospective randomized trial conducted in a French intensive care unit, the safety and efficacy of 8-day (126 patients) versus 15-day (123 patients) antibiotic therapy were evaluated in critically ill patients with postoperative intra-abdominal infection after adequate source control. The study showed that short-course antibiotic therapy in critically ill ICU patients reduced antibiotic exposure. Moreover, the trial concluded that continuation of treatment until day 15 is not associated with any additional clinical benefit.

Following an IUTI, the duration of indwelling urinary catheter usage typically ranges from several days to weeks, depending on the type of injury and management. If a patient presents with clinical signs suggestive of a urinary tract infection, it is recommended to perform a urine culture and then initiate or extend empirical treatment, if already initiated at the index surgery until the results are received and modified accordingly.

### An update on prevention and treatment of catheter-associated urinary tract infections [^1156Qyet]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Catheter-related urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most important nosocomial infections. This review summarizes the latest advances in the field of catheter care and the management of catheter-associated UTIs.

Recent Findings

The most efficient methods to prevent catheter-associated UTIs are to avoid unnecessary catheterizations and to remove catheters as soon as possible. The use of different reminder systems and implementation of infection control programs can effectively decrease catheter-associated UTIs, although their introduction can be challenging. There is still no evidence to support the routine use of antimicrobial-impregnated catheters, but the use of hydrophilic-coated catheters for clean intermittent catheterization can effectively reduce infections. Preliminary results with chlorhexidine-coated catheters are promising. In cases of serious catheter-associated UTI in patients with a history of previous antibiotic therapy or healthcare-associated bacteraemia, empirical antibiotic treatment should be initiated with activity against multiresistant uropathogens. Suprapubic catheterization is not superior to urethral catheters in terms of reducing the rate of catheter-related bacteriuria.

Summary

A technology to prevent catheter-associated UTIs is still not available; however, there are promising results with new approaches such as the use of reminder systems and infection control programs, which can effectively decrease the rate of catheter-associated UTIs. There is evidence supporting the use of hydrophilic coated catheters for clean intermittent catheterization, but an optimal catheter material or coating still has to be developed. Evidence-based catheter management is crucial for every patient in need of a catheter.

### Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) and non-CAUTI hospital-onset urinary tract infections: relative burden, cost, outcomes and related hospital-onset bacteremia and fungemia infections [^11644fSs]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

This study had several limitations. The analyzed hospitals were limited to those where total cost of care per admission and NHSN HAI reporting were both readily available. The urine culture stewardship practices of the individual hospitals were unknown, for example, it is possible that cultures may have been ordered less frequently for patients with an indwelling catheter. The association between potential secondary HOB and HOUTI may have been underestimated due to the following: (1) application of a stringent definition of HOB which required it to occur on day 4 or later and within 48 hours of the first positive urine culture collection date, and (2) patients with admissions for infection were excluded potentially eliminating the highest acuity patients with HOUTI. The location of the urine specimen collection may not have been the true location of infection onset depending on patient movement between infection onset and when the specimen was obtained. In addition, with no access to notes in the medical record, the mechanism for collecting the urine specimen and/or the mechanism of urine management, including the use of indwelling urinary catheters, could not be ascertained (note that uropathogen growth ≥ 10,000 CFU/mL is considered significant in specimens obtained with an in-and-out catheter per ASM recommendations in the Clinical Microbiology Procedures Handbook), additional LOS could not be ascribed to the HOUTI with absolute certainty. Accounting for potential confounding was done at the design and analysis phase of the study. However, residual confounding may still be possible as with all observational studies. Finally, as the CDC definition of HOB is still evolving, the definition employed in this analysis is a signal of HOB burden and not the exact definition that may ultimately be used by the CDC and NHSN.

Despite these limitations, the study had several strengths. A stringent definition for non-CAUTI HOUTI required cases to have both: (1) an algorithmically derived indication of a likely hospital-onset UTI based on the positive urine culture, and (2) an order for complementary antimicrobials within 48 hours of that first positive culture (resulting in exclusion of 32.8% of HOUTIs to arrive at our cohort of 3,177 cases of non-CAUTI HOUTI). It is thus highly unlikely that asymptomatic bacteriuria was captured in any of the analyses. In addition, a large sample of US hospitals was utilized including sites with and without academic affiliations. Lastly, the database included both laboratory results and pharmacy orders providing a novel opportunity to evaluate non-CAUTI HOUTI and its association with HOB.

Selection of definitive antibiotic therapy for complicated UTI — In patients with confirmed complicated UTI, we suggest selecting a definitive effective antibiotic with a targeted spectrum based on the results of urine culture (identification and susceptibility) as soon as these are available, rather than continuing empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics for the complete duration of treatment (conditional recommendation, low certainty of the evidence). The comment states that this recommendation places a high value on de-escalating antibiotic therapy based on culture results and notes that de-escalation may be less practical in cases of cUTI managed in the outpatient setting.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) without sepsis — antibiogram use: For patients with suspected complicated UTI without sepsis (including acute pyelonephritis), we make no specific recommendation about using an antibiogram to further tailor empiric antibiotic choice (no recommendation, knowledge gap). Patients who are not septic have a lower risk of mortality from cUTI (less than or equal to 5%) and initial inappropriate empiric antibiotic choice has little impact on mortality, and routine use of broader-spectrum agents in suspected complicated UTI without sepsis may drive antimicrobial resistance without substantial patient benefit.

Methods

SHEA recruited 3 subject-matter experts in CAUTI prevention to lead the panel of members representing the Compendium partnering organizations: SHEA, IDSA, APIC, AHA, and The Joint Commission, as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

SHEA utilized a consultant medical librarian who worked with the panel to develop a comprehensive search strategy for PubMed and Embase (January 2012–July 2019; updated to August 2021). Article abstracts were reviewed by panel members in a double-blind fashion using Covidence abstract management software (Covidence, Melbourne, Australia). The articles were subsequently reviewed as full text. The Compendium Lead Authors group voted to update the literature findings, and the librarian reran the search to update it to August 2021. Panel members reviewed the abstracts of these articles via Covidence and incorporated relevant references.

Recommendations resulting from this literature review process were classified based on the quality of evidence and the balance between desirable and potential undesirable effects of various interventions (Table 2). Panel members met via video conference to discuss literature findings, recommendations, quality of evidence for these recommendations, and classification as essential practices, additional approaches, or unresolved issues. Panel members reviewed and approved the document and its recommendations.

The Compendium Expert Panel, made up of members with broad healthcare epidemiology and infection prevention expertise, reviewed the draft manuscript after consensus had been reached by writing panel members.

Following review and approval by the expert panel, the 5 Compendium Partners, stakeholder organizations, and CDC reviewed the document. Prior to dissemination, the guidance document was reviewed and approved by the SHEA Guidelines Committee, the IDSA Standards and Practice Guidelines Committee, AHA, and The Joint Commission, and the Boards of SHEA, IDSA, and APIC. All members complied with SHEA and IDSA policies on conflict-of-interest disclosure.

Additional approaches for preventing CAUTI

These additional approaches are recommended for use in locations and/or populations within the hospital with unacceptably high CAUTI rates or standardized infection ratios (SIRs) despite implementation of the essential CAUTI prevention strategies listed previously.

Develop a protocol for standardizing diagnosis and management of postoperative urinary retention, including nurse-directed use of intermittent catheterization and use of bladder scanners, when appropriate as alternatives to indwelling urethral catheterization. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE) If bladder scanners are used, clearly state indications, train nursing staff in their use, and disinfect between patients according to manufacturer's instructions.
Establish a system for analyzing and reporting data on catheter use and adverse events from catheter use. (Quality of evidence: LOW) Use cumulative attributable difference to identify high-risk units or hospitals (as described in Section 5). Measure process and outcomes measures (eg, standardized utilization ratio and standardized infection ratio) as described in Section 5. Define and monitor catheter harm (see Fig. 2) in addition to CAUTI, including catheter obstruction, unintended removal, catheter trauma, or reinsertion within 24 hours of removal. National focus has been on CAUTI prevention, but current metrics do not adequately capture overall catheter harm. Catheter harm includes infectious complications in addition to CAUTI (eg, secondary bacteremia, asymptomatic bacteriuria consequences) and noninfectious catheter complications (Fig. 2). Patients with an indwelling urethral catheter are 5 times more likely to experience noninfectious complications (eg, urethral injury, pain, or inadvertent catheter removal) than infectious complications. Current metrics used to monitor progress in the prevention of CAUTIs may underestimate both infectious and noninfectious catheter harm.
Establish a system for defining, analyzing, and reporting data on non–catheter-associated UTIs, particularly UTIs associated with devices used as alternatives to indwelling urethral catheters. (Quality of evidence: LOW) Non–catheter-associated UTIs are defined as UTIs that occur in hospitalized patients without an indwelling urethral catheter. These include but are not limited to patients who have had no urinary device at all, as well as those with external urinary catheters (EUCs), urinary stents, or urostomies, or who undergo intermittent catheterization, and thus are not captured by the NHSN CAUTI definition. As the incidence of CAUTI continues to decline, the proportion of non–catheter-associated UTIs is increasing in some hospitals. However, the national incidence of non–catheter-associated UTIs is not known because surveillance and reporting of these UTIs are not required by US Federal agencies. Non–catheter-associated UTIs are a common indication for antibiotics in hospitalized patients, and this metric could provide important information as healthcare facilities consider the risks and benefits of newer alternatives to urinary catheters with currently limited published data on adverse events (eg, EUCs for women) to help inform when the benefit outweighs the potential risk for specific patient populations.

Indwelling urinary catheter — management of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in long-term care: Benefit of antimicrobial therapy for ASB while a catheter remains in situ is stated as uncertain and there is high-quality evidence of harm with increased antimicrobial resistance, so screening with urine cultures in catheterized patients or obtaining urine cultures for nonspecific symptoms should be discouraged. A prospective cohort study of prophylaxis to prevent ASB and urinary tract infection (UTI) in patients with long-term indwelling catheters reported no benefits, and a randomized bundle intervention was associated with a substantial decrease in screening and treatment for ASB in long-term care patients without an increase in symptomatic UTI.

Sepsis is defined per the Sepsis-3 Task Force as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection; patients can be identified by SOFA score increase of 2 points or more, reflecting an in-hospital mortality greater than 10%, or presumptively identified with screening tools such as qSOFA or SIRS.

### Reducing catheter-associated urinary tract infection rates in surgical critical care units via an informal catheter exchange protocol [^116uMtFS]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) represent > 8% of hospital acquired infections (HAI)in the United States and contribute to increased morbidity and estimated costs of $340–450 million per year.CAUTI's are reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), and are used as markers of hospital quality. Since 2014, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and others have collaborated on CAUTI prevention strategies, including recommending urine culture (UCx) stewardship to reduce detection of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU). Underlying this is the fact that over-detection of ABU leads to increase in CAUTI diagnosis and unwarranted antibiotic use.

Recently, there have been emerging recommendations supporting the practice of replacing urinary catheters (IUCs) prior to UCx to reduce ABU and CAUTI, however, there is little data surrounding this practice. Here we present the results of a novel initiative to reduce CAUTI and ABU in two surgical ICUs using IUC replacement.

### Inappropriate treatment of catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria in a tertiary care hospital [^111xqmsL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence-based guidelines state that asymptomatic bacteriuria is not a clinically significant condition in men and nonpregnant women and that treatment is unlikely to confer clinical benefit. We hypothesized that, among patients with indwelling catheters or condom collection systems, many who receive a diagnosis of and are treated for catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) actually have asymptomatic bacteriuria and, therefore, that antibiotic therapy is inappropriate.

Methods

We reviewed all urine culture results at a veterans affairs medical center during a 3-month period. Cultures yielding 10⁴ colony-forming units/mL were included if the urine had been collected from a hospitalized patient with an indwelling (Foley) catheter or a condom collection system. We applied standardized definitions to determine whether the episode represented catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria (CAABU) or CAUTI. Antibiotic therapy was considered appropriate for patients who met criteria for symptomatic UTI.

Results

Overall, 280 episodes met criteria for inclusion: 164 CAABU and 116 CAUTI. Of the 164 episodes of CAABU, 111 (68%) were managed appropriately (no treatment), whereas 53 (32%) were treated with antibiotics (inappropriate treatment). In multivariate analysis, older patient age, having predominantly gram-negative bacteriuria, and higher urine white blood cell count were significantly associated with inappropriate treatment of CAABU (P < .05, by logistic regression).

Conclusions

Better recognition of CAABU and the distinction between this condition and CAUTI, consistent with evidence-based guidelines, may play a key role in reducing unneeded antibiotic usage in hospitalized patients.

### Risk factors for treatment failure and mortality among hospitalized patients with complicated urinary tract infection: a multicenter retrospective cohort study (RESCUING study group) [^1131xcKA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) are responsible for a major share of all antibiotic consumption in hospitals. We aim to describe risk factors for treatment failure and mortality among patients with cUTIs.

Methods

A multinational, multicentre retrospective cohort study, conducted in 20 countries in Europe and the Middle East. Data were collected from patients' files on hospitalised patients with a diagnosis of cUTI during 2013–2014. Primary outcome was treatment failure, secondary outcomes included 30 days all-cause mortality, among other outcomes. Multivariable analysis using a logistic model and the hospital as a random variable was performed to identify independent predictors for these outcomes.

Results

A total of 981 patients with cUTI were included. Treatment failure was observed in 26.6% (261/981), all cause 30-day mortality rate was 8.7% (85/976), most of these in patients with catheter related UTI (CaUTI). Risk factors for treatment failure in multivariable analysis were ICU admission (OR 5.07, 95% CI 3.18–8.07), septic shock (OR 1.92, 95% CI 0.93–3.98), corticosteroid treatment (OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.12–3.54), bedridden (OR 2.11, 95%CI 1.4–3.18), older age (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.0071.03-), metastatic cancer (OR 2.89, 95% CI 1.46–5.73) and CaUTI (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.04–2.11). Management variables, such as inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment or days to starting antibiotics were not associated with treatment failure or 30-day mortality. More patients with pyelonephritis were given appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy than other CaUTI [110/171; 64.3% vs. 116/270; 43%, p < 0.005], nevertheless, this afforded no advantage in treatment failure rates nor mortality in these patients.

Conclusions

In patients with cUTI we found no benefit of early appropriate empirical treatment on survival rates or other outcomes. Physicians might consider supportive treatment and watchful waiting in stable patients until the causative pathogen is defined.

### Recognition and prevention of healthcare-associated urinary tract infections in the intensive care unit [^112V97AV]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection is the most common healthcare-associated infection in the intensive care unit and predominantly occurs in patients with indwelling urinary catheters. The predominant microorganisms causing catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) in the intensive care unit are enteric Gram-negative bacilli, enterococci, Candida species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Multidrug resistance is a significant problem in urinary pathogens. Duration of catheterization is the most important risk factor for development of CAUTI. Diagnosis, particularly in the intensive care unit setting, is very difficult, as asymptomatic bacteriuria may be difficult to differentiate from symptomatic CAUTI. In general, asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated, and treatment of CAUTI often requires removal of the catheter along with systemic antimicrobial therapy. General strategies for prevention of CAUTI apply to all healthcare-associated infections and include measures such as adherence to hand hygiene. Targeted strategies for prevention of CAUTI include limiting the use and duration of urinary catheterization, using aseptic technique for catheter insertion, and adhering to proper catheter care.

Complicated UTI with Gram-negative bacteremia — In patients presenting with complicated UTI with associated Gram-negative bacteremia and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course (7 days) of antimicrobial therapy rather than a longer course (14 days) (conditional recommendation, low certainty in the evidence). An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy.

### The evolution of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI): is it time for more inclusive metrics? [^117YFJxe]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) has long been considered a preventable healthcare-associated infection. Many federal agencies, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and public and private healthcare organizations have implemented strategies aimed at preventing CAUTIs. To monitor progress in CAUTI prevention, the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) CAUTI metric has been adopted nationally as the primary outcome measure and has been refined over the past decades. However, this surveillance metric may underestimate infectious and noninfectious catheter harm. We suggest evolving to more inclusive performance metrics to better reflect quality improvement efforts underway in hospitals. The standardized device utilization ratio (SUR) provides a good surrogate for preventable catheter harm. On the other hand, a population-based metric that combines both standardized infection ratio (SIR) and SUR would address both infectious and noninfectious harm, while adjusting for population risk. Finally, electronically captured catheter-associated bacteriuria may contribute essential information on local testing stewardship.

Summary of major changes

This section lists major changes provided in the Strategies to Prevent Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infections in Acute-Care Hospitals: 2022 Update, including recommendations that have been added, removed, or altered. Recommendations in this document are categorized as "essential practices" that are foundational to all HAI programs in acute-care hospitals (in 2014, these were termed "basic practices") or "additional approaches" to be considered for use in locations and/or populations within hospitals during outbreaks in addition to full implementation of essential practices (in 2014 these were termed "special approaches"). See Table 1 for a complete summary of the recommendations contained in this document.

Essential practices

Updates to the implementation of evidence-based appropriateness criteria for indwelling urethral catheter use
Discussion of strategies for urine-culture stewardship and their impact on CAUTI rates
Updated performance measures to highlight the effects on catheter harm in addition to CAUTI
Discussion of limitations of external urinary catheters

Additional approaches

Considerations for injury from urinary catheter use (ie, catheter harm) as well as non–catheter-associated urinary tract infections (eg, UTIs associated with use of alternative urinary collection devices such as external urinary catheters).
An updated visual framework for "Disrupting the Life Cycle of Indwelling Urethral Catheter" has been provided to help identify where patient safety interventions can help reduce catheter-associated infection and trauma.

Unresolved issues

### Using clinical decision support to improve urine testing and antibiotic utilization [^11178e1G]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Urine cultures obtained in the absence of clinical signs or symptoms do not provide actionable information in most patient populations because they identify a high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria. Positive urine cultures in catheterized patients are difficult to interpret due to high rates of colonization and contamination during specimen collection, and they have a low predictive value for true infection. Indwelling urinary catheters are colonized at a rate of 3%–7% per day. Nonspecific clinical signs and symptoms, such as fever, often trigger urine-culture orders in hospitalized patients with indwelling urinary catheters. In addition, subjective findings, such as color or odor of urine or sediment in tube, influence nurses and providers to overorder urine cultures in catheterized patients. In many instances, clinicians may not even be aware that the patient has a urinary catheter in place when ordering a urine culture.

Overuse and misuse of urine cultures in catheterized patients leads to inappropriate antibiotic use and artificially inflates the diagnosis of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs). Hence, Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) guidelines recommend replacing long-term urinary catheters before urine specimen collection. However, guidance on optimal timing of catheter exchange at the time of urine collection is unclear. Prior studies have examined periods ranging from 24 hours to 14 days for catheter replacement at the time of urine collection. These interventions, however, have primarily focused on the outcomes of surveillance CAUTI, without measuring the impact on antibiotic use or unintended consequences like catheter trauma.–

Clinical decision support (CDS) tools can assist with appropriate urine testing and collection techniques, can reduce diagnostic error, and can improve antibiotic use. We evaluated the effect of a CDS tool on health system–level urine-culture volume, antibiotic utilization for urinary tract infection (UTIs), and catheter use, and we examined safety signals related to catheter trauma among patients who required a catheter exchange.

### New strategies to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infections [^1156g58h]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is the most common health-care-associated infection worldwide. Although not all cases of bacteriuria result in clinical infection, several hundred thousand episodes of CAUTI occur each year in the USA alone. The milieu in which the catheter is placed is highly conducive to bacterial colonization, biofilm formation on the catheter surface, and inevitable catheter-associated bacteriuria. A multitude of novel methods of CAUTI prevention have been described, including established approaches that are routinely recommended, such as the use of a secured, closed, silicone urinary catheter drainage system that mimics normal voiding, and newer strategies focusing on biocompatible catheter materials that cause minimal host inflammatory response and retard biofilm formation. Much recent research has focused on modification of the catheter surface by either coating or impregnation with antimicrobials or antiseptics. However, clinical trials that analyse cost-effectiveness and rates of antimicrobial resistance are awaited. More recently, innovative use of iontophoresis, vibroacoustic stimulation, bacterial interference and bacteriophage cocktails has been reported.

### Decreasing catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) at a community academic medical center using a multidisciplinary team employing a multi-pronged approach during the COVID-19 pandemic [^116YxhBC]. American Journal of Infection Control (2023). Medium credibility.

In the midst of the COVID - 19 pandemic, a multidisciplinary team implemented evidence-based strategies to eliminate catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), as defined by the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) surveillance definition for those units included in the NHSN standardized infection ratio. The team evaluated indwelling urinary catheters daily for indication, implemented a urinary catheter order set, established a urinary catheter insertion checklist, and promoted use of external urinary diversion devices. The facility NHSN standardized infection ratio for CAUTI was 0.37 in 2019, 0.23 in 2020, and 0.00 in 2021. A collaborative approach decreasing hospital acquired infections may be effective even in a climate of increased acuity, increased length of stay, and staffing challenges.

### Reducing unnecessary urinary catheter use and other strategies to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infection: an integrative review [^1164PxoN]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2014). Medium credibility.

Interest and resources for preventing CAUTI is likely to grow due to expanding national initiatives focused on reducing hospital-acquired infections, including CAUTI, being implemented with a combination of mandated public reporting and reduced pay to hospitals. Current prevention efforts include a 50-state initiative — 'On the CUSP: Stop CAUTI' — that is funded by the AHRQ and led by the Health Research and Educational Trust (HRET) of the American Hospital Association. AHRQ has made available a toolkit for CAUTI prevention. This initiative is providing resources and implementation expertise to hospitals and state organisations that are beginning CAUTI prevention programmes, with a goal of reducing CAUTI rates by 25% by focusing on high-yield interventions such as those reducing urinary catheter use.

Key summary points

Multiple before-and-after studies have found that interventions to decrease inappropriate catheter placement (such as catheter placement restrictions or urinary retention protocols) have resulted in decreased catheter use, fewer catheters in place without physician orders, and fewer catheters in place without an appropriate indication.
An updated systematic review and meta-analysis found that catheter reminders or stop orders decreased catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) by 53%. An updated literature review identified many recent interventions with reminders or stop orders reducing CAUTI rates and/or urinary catheter use.
Bundles of interventions focusing on strategies to reduce unnecessary catheter use (by avoiding unnecessary placement and prompting removal) and decrease CAUTI rates by general infection control principles (hand hygiene, surveillance/feedback, aseptic insertion, etc) have been successful, particularly when coupled with implementation strategies to address common barriers encountered when trying to change well-established habits of physicians and nurses.
The role of antimicrobial catheters in preventing CAUTI has been addressed by a recent large randomised controlled trial showing no significant additional benefit in reducing symptomatic CAUTIs.
CAUTI prevention costs vary by programme, but such programmes have been demonstrated to be cost saving.

Regarding preventative measures for catheter-associated urinary tract infection, more specifically with respect to antibiotic prophylaxis with catheter placement/removal, IDSA 2010 guidelines recommend to do not administer prophylactic antimicrobials routinely, given systemically or by bladder irrigation, in patients at the time of catheter placement to reduce CA-UTI
or at the time of catheter removal
or replacement to reduce CA-ASB.
