B12 2000
Ferritin 337

Help interpret these studies

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to interpret an iron study panel showing serum iron 51 µg/dL, TIBC 222 µg/dL, transferrin 175 mg/dL, ferritin 337 µg/L, and vitamin B12 2000 pg/mL. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about calculating transferrin saturation and confirming the arithmetic. Then, I should verify ferritin interpretation in the context of inflammation and chronic disease. Next, I will assess the B12 elevation and its implications. After that, I need to synthesize a differential diagnosis and decide on immediate next steps, including when to order HFE testing and liver imaging. Finally, I will outline management considerations and monitoring, making sure each step aligns with guideline thresholds and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the key calculation: transferrin saturation equals serum iron divided by TIBC, multiplied by 100, so 51 divided by 222 is about 0.23, which equals 23 percent; wait, let me verify that math — yes, 51/222 ≈ 0.2297, so TSAT is approximately 23 percent, which sits just above the commonly used 20 percent threshold for functional iron deficiency and below the 45 percent threshold used to screen for hereditary hemochromatosis, so I should not jump to conclusions about iron overload or functional deficiency based on TSAT alone without context [^114L59rA] [^111iUVEE].

> Next, I should review ferritin carefully; ferritin at 337 µg/L is clearly elevated above the usual adult reference range, but ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and can be high in inflammation, liver disease, malignancy, or alcohol use, so I need to check for concurrent inflammatory conditions and liver disease before attributing this to iron overload; hold on, I should verify guideline cautions — AGA notes ferritin can appear normal or high in iron deficiency when inflammation is present, and ECCO highlights that ferritin between 30 and 100 µg/L often reflects mixed iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disease, so a ferritin of 337 µg/L strongly suggests an inflammatory or hepatic driver unless proven otherwise [^116PBzzy] [^115wbRKn] [^116p9ufJ].

> I will now examine the B12 value; cobalamin at 2000 pg/mL is markedly elevated, and I should confirm whether this could be assay interference or true elevation; high B12 is commonly seen with liver disease, renal dysfunction, myeloproliferative neoplasms, and high-dose supplementation, and although I initially thought "assay interference is rare", wait, let me reconsider — some immunoassays can be affected by heterophilic antibodies or high-dose biotin, so I should verify supplement use, consider repeating B12, and add methylmalonic acid and homocysteine if deficiency is suspected despite high B12; I also need to check liver enzymes, a complete blood count, and a peripheral smear to look for clues to liver disease or myeloproliferation [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize the iron panel pattern; TSAT around 23 percent with ferritin 337 µg/L and normal-to-low TIBC/transferrin argues against absolute iron deficiency and against classic hereditary hemochromatosis, but it does not exclude secondary iron overload or dysmetabolic hyperferritinemia; I should double-check guideline thresholds — AASLD uses TS ≥ 45 percent and/or elevated ferritin to trigger HFE testing, and EASL emphasizes paired TS and ferritin as first-line screens, so with TSAT 23 percent I am below the usual hemochromatosis screening threshold, yet ferritin is unequivocally high, warranting evaluation for secondary causes and, if those are excluded, consideration of HFE testing in the right clinical context [^1122ADcL] [^114Mor4a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check for secondary causes of hyperferritinemia now: obtain CRP and ESR to assess inflammation, liver enzymes including ALT, AST, and GGT to evaluate hepatic injury or steatohepatitis, consider alcohol use and metabolic syndrome, and review medications and supplements; if secondary causes are not convincing and there is a suggestive family history or persistent hyperferritinemia, then HFE genotyping is reasonable, and if ferritin exceeds roughly 1000 µg/L or liver enzymes are abnormal, I should consider hepatic iron quantification by MRI rather than relying on ferritin alone to stage iron burden [^1163FzER] [^113UwyPT].

> But wait, what if the patient is anemic or has cytopenias; I should confirm the hemoglobin, MCV, reticulocyte count, and platelets, and review a peripheral smear because ferritin can be misleading in anemia of chronic disease; if anemia is present with discordant ferritin and TSAT, I need to integrate soluble transferrin receptor, CRP, and clinical context, and if myelodysplasia is suspected, I should follow MDS workup pathways including marrow evaluation and cytogenetics rather than assuming iron deficiency or overload from ferritin alone [^116p9ufJ].

> I need to ensure the B12 elevation is contextualized; if there is no supplementation history and the patient has cytopenias or splenomegaly, I should consider JAK2-negative myeloproliferative disease and obtain a CBC with differential and smear, and if liver disease is suspected, I should correlate with liver function tests; repeating B12 and checking methylmalonic acid and homocysteine helps distinguish true excess from assay artifact or transport protein issues, and I should verify whether high-dose biotin or recent B12 injections could confound results [^notfound].

> Let me think about management while I await clarification; I should avoid empiric iron therapy because ferritin is high and TSAT is not low, and iron is contraindicated in hemochromatosis and related iron overload states; if secondary iron overload is confirmed, phlebotomy is the cornerstone for hereditary hemochromatosis, with typical targets to reduce ferritin into the 50–100 µg/L range, whereas if dysmetabolic hyperferritinemia is the diagnosis, management focuses on treating the metabolic driver and reserving phlebotomy for select cases; I should confirm that any iron supplementation is withheld until the etiology is defined to avoid exacerbating iron overload [^115umD7P] [^113UwyPT] [^116fpehJ].

> Next, I should review immediate tests to order; I will request CBC with differential and reticulocytes, a peripheral smear, CRP and/or ESR, a comprehensive metabolic panel including liver enzymes, and consider HFE genotyping if secondary causes are excluded or if there is a suggestive phenotype or family history; if ferritin remains high with abnormal liver enzymes or if ferritin approaches or exceeds 1000 µg/L, I should arrange hepatic iron quantification by MRI to assess liver iron concentration and guide therapy, and I will avoid fasting iron studies because contemporary data suggest fasting does not meaningfully improve sensitivity or specificity for HFE detection [^1122ADcL] [^1163FzER] [^113UwyPT] [^111iUVEE].

> In summary, I should confirm that the pattern of TSAT about 23 percent with ferritin 337 µg/L most likely reflects inflammation, liver disease, or metabolic dysregulation rather than absolute iron deficiency or classic hereditary hemochromatosis, while the markedly elevated B12 points toward liver disease, supplementation, or myeloproliferative processes; I will now examine inflammatory markers, liver enzymes, CBC and smear, and, if indicated, HFE testing and hepatic MRI to reach a definitive diagnosis and tailor management accordingly [^116PBzzy] [^113UwyPT].

The pattern of **high ferritin with low transferrin saturation** indicates **iron overload with low circulating iron**, most consistent with anemia of chronic disease (ACD) or inflammation-related iron sequestration [^1162718v]. The **very high B12** most often reflects **supplementation, liver disease, or assay interference** rather than true excess. This is not iron deficiency anemia, and hereditary hemochromatosis is unlikely given the low TSAT [^111iUVEE]. Evaluate for inflammatory or chronic diseases, liver dysfunction, and recent B12 intake; consider soluble transferrin receptor or hepcidin if the cause remains unclear [^116PBzzy].

## Interpretation of iron studies

| **Parameter** | **Patient value** | **Reference range** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Serum iron | 51 µg/dL | 60–170 µg/dL | Low-normal |
| TIBC | 222 µg/dL | 240–370 µg/dL | Low |
| Transferrin | 175 mg/dL | 200–360 mg/dL | Low-normal |
| Ferritin | 337 ng/mL | 15–150 ng/mL | High |
| Transferrin saturation (TSAT) | 23% | 20–50% | Low-normal |

---

- **Ferritin**: Elevated ferritin reflects increased iron stores and is an acute-phase reactant; levels rise with inflammation, liver disease, malignancy, or hyperferritinemia syndromes [^113UwyPT].
- **Transferrin and TIBC**: Low TIBC/transferrin indicate reduced iron transport capacity, typical of inflammation or liver disease.
- **Transferrin saturation**: TSAT is low-normal (23%), arguing against hereditary hemochromatosis, which typically shows TSAT > 45% [^111iUVEE].

---

## Interpretation of vitamin B12 level

Vitamin B12 is markedly elevated at 2000 pg/mL (reference 200–900 pg/mL). Common causes include **supplementation, liver disease, renal dysfunction, myeloproliferative disorders, or assay interference**. Clinical correlation and repeat testing are advised to distinguish true excess from artifact.

---

## Differential diagnosis

Given high ferritin with low TSAT, the **most likely explanations** are:

- **Anemia of chronic disease (ACD)**: Iron sequestration due to inflammation lowers circulating iron despite adequate or increased stores; ferritin is elevated as an acute-phase reactant [^1162718v].
- **Liver disease**: Hepatic dysfunction increases ferritin and alters iron handling.
- **Inflammatory conditions**: Rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or chronic infections can raise ferritin and lower TSAT [^114L59rA].
- **Hyperferritinemia syndromes**: Metabolic or genetic hyperferritinemia can present with elevated ferritin and normal or low TSAT [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Further evaluation**: Assess for inflammatory or chronic diseases (e.g. rheumatologic, infectious, malignant), liver disease (LFTs, hepatitis serologies), and renal function.
- **B12 evaluation**: Confirm supplementation, review medications, and consider repeat testing or assay interference assessment.
- **Iron therapy**: Avoid iron supplementation unless true iron deficiency is confirmed; iron overload syndromes are contraindications to iron therapy [^116fpehJ].
- **Specialist referral**: Consider hematology or hepatology if hemochromatosis, hyperferritinemia, or liver disease is suspected.

---

## Summary and recommendations

The pattern of high ferritin with low TSAT indicates **iron overload with low circulating iron**, most consistent with anemia of chronic disease or inflammation-related sequestration. The very high B12 likely reflects supplementation, liver disease, or assay interference. Evaluate for inflammatory and chronic diseases, liver dysfunction, and recent B12 intake; consider soluble transferrin receptor or hepcidin if the cause remains unclear [^116PBzzy].

### Sex, lies, and iron deficiency: a call to change ferritin reference ranges [^115PFf6Y]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is a very common and treatable disorder. Of all the tests available to diagnose iron deficiency, the serum ferritin is the most able to discriminate iron deficiency from other disorders. However, the reference range for ferritin in many laboratories will lead to underdiagnosis of iron deficiency in women. Studies have shown that 30%-50% of healthy women will have no marrow iron stores, so basing ferritin cutoffs on the lowest 2.5% of sampled ferritins is not appropriate. In addition, several lines of evidence suggest the body physiologic ferritin "cutoff" is 50ng/mL. Work is needed to establish more realistic ferritin ranges to avoid underdiagnosing a readily treatable disorder.

Key Points

Question

How is the choice of guideline-recommended cutoffs for ferritin associated with the incidence of iron deficiency diagnoses in primary care?

Findings

In this cohort study of 255 351 adult primary care patients, ferritin cutoffs of 15, 30, and 45 ng/mL were associated with incidences of iron deficiency diagnoses of 10.9, 29.9, and 48.3 cases per 1000 patient-years, respectively.

Meaning

The results of this study provide useful components for the evaluation of ferritin testing in high-resource primary care settings and call for harmonization of guidelines for iron deficiency.

Results

The study cohort consisted of 255 351 patients (median [IQR] age, 52 [36–66] years; 52.1% female and 47.9% male). Figure 1 summarizes the cohort selection process, and Table 1 summarizes the patient characteristics. The cohort patients were seen by 262 general practitioners with a median (IQR) age of 48 (40–57) years and a median (IQR) workload of 139 (86–230) consultations per working week in 80 practices. During the study period, 72 817 patients (28.5%) received ferritin testing. Of the first ferritin tests during the study period, 7036 (9.7%) were accompanied by iron studies, most commonly serum iron in 6095 (8.4%), transferrin in 5820 (8.0%), and transferrin saturation in 3856 (5.3%). Accompanying hemoglobin and CRP tests were present in 52 499 (72.1%) and 36 136 (49.6%) cases, respectively.

Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Definitions

We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^114P2My1]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease in diabetes mellitus — laboratory assessment and mineral-bone management are specified as follows: persons with CKD in DM should undergo annual or more frequent assessment of electrolytes, blood counts, and calcium, phosphorus, 25(OH) vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) measurements to assess mineral metabolism. For those with serum bicarbonate level < 22 mEq/L, the addition of oral sodium bicarbonate is recommended to correct the serum bicarbonate level. Anemia, defined as hemoglobin < 13 g/dL in men and < 12 g/dL in women, should be further investigated with iron, transferrin saturation, ferritin, vitamin B12, and folate levels, and deficiencies should be replaced with a transferrin saturation target of ≥ 30% achieved. AACE recommends adequate calcium intake and achievement of 25(OH) vitamin D levels of > 30 ng/dL; supplementing vitamin D2 or D3 may reduce PTH in persons with CKD and secondary hyperparathyroidism, and active vitamin D preparations are usually necessary to keep the PTH level from increasing as eGFR declines. Hyperphosphatemia should be corrected into the normal range with dietary modification and use of phosphate binders.

### Physiologically based serum ferritin thresholds for iron deficiency in women of reproductive age who are blood donors [^117JTUSe]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Key Points

World Health Organization serum ferritin guideline of a < 15 µg/L threshold for iron deficiency in healthy women is based on expert opinion.
Physiologically based analysis of female blood donors, 20 to 49 years of age, shows a higher ferritin threshold for iron deficiency of < 25 µg/L.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^116PBzzy]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia — ferritin thresholds and adjunctive testing: Based on a systematic review of 55 studies, a ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL has a sensitivity for iron deficiency of 85% (95% confidence interval, 82%–87%) with a specificity of 92% (95% CI, 91%–94%), whereas a ferritin value of < 15 ng/mL has a sensitivity of 59% (95% CI, 55%–62%) and specificity of 99% (95% CI, 98%–99%). A ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL was believed to maximize sensitivity for the diagnosis of IDA with an acceptable number of false-positive diagnoses, and the tradeoff between higher sensitivity and lower specificity using a threshold of 45 ng/mL instead of 15 ng/mL was believed to provide an acceptable balance of benefits of fewer missed diagnoses compared with potential harms of additional diagnostic evaluations. In some patients, such as those with chronic inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, ferritin levels may not accurately reflect body iron stores and other clinical tests, such as the serum iron, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, or C-reactive protein, may be useful adjunctive tests to assist in the diagnosis of iron deficiency.

### Reflective testing: how useful is the practice of adding on tests by laboratory clinicians? [^1176UUnP]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

Aims

To investigate the clinical value and practice of reflective testing, a new term to describe the practice of adding on tests when reporting or clinically authorising results.

Methods

A consultant medical biochemist collected over a calendar year (2001) copies of clinical biochemistry reports on samples to which he had added on either iron studies (iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and percentage saturation), or vitamin D. Iron studies and vitamin D were added on when biochemical results, available clinical information, demographic data, and clinical experience-or combinations thereof-suggested the possibility of haemochromatosis or vitamin D deficiency, respectively. The number of reports that the consultant authorised was estimated for the same calendar year. The number and percentage of raised TIBC percentage saturation and low vitamin D results from the tests that were added on were collated.

Results

Raised TIBC saturation values were found in 28 patients (18.7% of the iron studies added on), of whom 16 were subsequently genotyped, eight having a genotype consistent with haemochromatosis. Thirty one patients with vitamin D deficiency (23.1% of the vitamin D tests added on) were identified.

Conclusions

The addition of iron studies and vitamin D tests by a laboratory clinician, when reporting, resulted in the identification of patients with haemochromatosis and vitamin D deficiency. The practice of adding on tests should be called reflective testing, because it is discretionary and is based on the clinical judgement of a laboratory clinician in the interpretation of results.

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^1154eFBy]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Transferrin, transferrin saturation (TSAT), and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) — key diagnostic parameters: transferrin normal values can vary between 200 and 400 mg/dL, and TSAT reflects iron availability with normal transferrin saturation ranging from 16% to 45%; a saturation below 16% indicates suboptimal iron for erythropoiesis and levels above 50% suggest iron overload. TSAT performance for iron deficiency shows sensitivity of 50% to 88% and specificity of 63% to 78%. TIBC is the amount of iron needed to saturate plasma transferrin and, while high in functional or true iron deficiency, has reported diagnostic sensitivity of 34% and specificity of 97%.

### Screening, diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency in chronic heart failure: putting the 2016 European Society of Cardiology heart failure guidelines into clinical practice [^114L59rA]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Practical recommendations on the screening and diagnosis of iron deficiency in patients with heart failure

The current 2016 ESC HF guidelines 1 recommend that evaluation of iron status should be considered in the diagnostic work‐up of all newly diagnosed HF patients (class of recommendation I, level of evidence C). A practical recommendation of the working group is that iron status should also be evaluated in patients with existing CHF, particularly if they are symptomatic despite receiving optimal background HF medications. In addition, as part of routine follow‐up, consideration should be given to the re‐evaluation of iron status 1–2 times per year, as well as after hospitalization for HF.

Ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) are widely available blood markers for evaluating iron status. Their use for the diagnosis of iron deficiency is recommended by the 2016 ESC HF guidelines. 1 Ferritin is an intracellular iron‐storage protein secreted by iron‐storing tissues (e.g. liver and reticuloendothelial system). Serum ferritin concentrations are a surrogate marker of stored iron quantity. 9 TSAT (defined as % of transferrin that has iron bound to it) is used as a marker of the availability of circulating iron to supply metabolizing cells. 9 TSAT value is calculated by dividing the serum iron concentration by the total iron‐binding capacity (TIBC):

The 2016 ESC HF guidelines recommend treating iron deficiency based on a serum ferritin level < 100 µg/L, or 100–299 µg/L when TSAT < 20%. Two different cut‐offs are used because ferritin levels may become elevated in the presence of inflammation and may, therefore, appear to be within the normal range (100–300 µg/L). As ferritin, an acute‐phase protein, is elevated as a result of inflammation, TSAT levels < 20% indicate that insufficient circulating iron is available to supply metabolizing cells (functional iron deficiency). 9 Therefore, in accordance with the 2016 ESC HF guidelines, it is important to ensure that both ferritin and TSAT testing is performed simultaneously and evaluated together when assessing iron status (Figure 1). Lower ferritin cut‐offs (e.g. < 30 µg/L) may be used to confirm the presence of iron deficiency in other disease settings and are often displayed on laboratory test results as the lower limit of normal. However, the thresholds defined above are recommended to diagnose iron deficiency in patients with CHF.

Figure 5.
The effect of iron chelation therapy (ever vs. never). Iron chelating therapy has an attenuating effect on the adverse prognostic impact of a higher transferrin saturation (TSAT) in both intermediate (TSAT 50–80%) and high (TSAT > 80%) groups, although sample sizes were limited in the tails of the Kaplan Meier survival curves.

Figure 6.
Cardiac death-free survival. Among patients who were transfusion-dependent at enrollment, higher mean transferrin saturation (TSAT) was associated with inferior cardiac death-free survival (A), but higher mean ferritin was not (B). Total numbers of patients at time zero in the black, red and blue groups were 75, 107 and 36 for the analysis by TSAT, and 48, 31 and 139 for the ferritin analysis, respectively.

While a minority of patients in our cohort received ICT, TSAT should be interpreted with caution in chelated patients. The presence of free chelate in plasma may artificially increase the measured total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and thus reduce the calculated TSAT. Conversely, chelate-iron complexes may be measured as serum iron, thereby increasing the TSAT. True measurement of TSAT during ICT requires alternative laboratory techniques (i.e. urea gel method) or a chelator washout. Furthermore, in a large prospective study of transfusion-dependent anemias, TSAT was not significantly reduced after one year of deferasirox. Survival analyses demonstrating an attenuating effect of ICT on the impact of TSAT are limited by sample sizes.

Conclusions

Our study demonstrates a substantial increase in the rate of iron deficiency diagnoses when ferritin cutoffs of 30 and 45 ng/mL, respectively, are chosen over 15 ng/mL. Our results provide an information base for health system–level evaluations of ferritin testing in primary care. In addition, they highlight the need for harmonization of guidelines for the diagnosis of iron deficiency in primary care.

We also assessed requests for additional iron studies accompanying ferritin testing (within ± 1 week), considering iron studies often mentioned in international and local clinical guidelines for iron deficiency,: serum iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation, and soluble transferrin receptor. To further examine concomitant testing, we considered all patients of the study cohort who received ferritin testing during the study period and considered the presence of hemoglobin and CRP accompanying the first ferritin test recorded during the study period as 2 distinct binary outcomes. We fitted mixed-effects logistic regression models using the R package lme4to assess the associations of each outcome with the same determinants and random effects as for ferritin. Associations are expressed as adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with corresponding 95% CIs.

### Serum ferritin as an indicator of iron status: what do we need to know? [^111C8V5M]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Determination of iron status in pregnancy and in young children is essential for both clinical and public health practice. Clinical diagnosis of iron deficiency (ID) through sampling of bone marrow to identify the absence of body iron stores is impractical in most cases. Serum ferritin (SF) concentrations are the most commonly deployed indicator for determining ID, and low SF concentrations reflect a state of iron depletion. However, there is considerable variation in SF cutoffs recommended by different expert groups to diagnose ID. Moreover, the cutoffs used in different clinical laboratories are heterogeneous. There are few studies of diagnostic test accuracy to establish the sensitivity and specificity of SF compared with key gold standards (such as absent bone marrow iron stores, increased intestinal iron absorption, and hemoglobin response to SF) among noninflamed, outpatient populations. The limited data available suggest the commonly recommended SF cutoff of < 15 μg/L is a specific but not sensitive cutoff, although evidence is limited. Data from women during pregnancy or from young children are especially uncommon. Most data are from studies conducted > 30 y ago, do not reflect ethnic or geographic diversity, and were performed in an era for which laboratory methods no longer reflect present practice. Future studies to define the appropriate SF cutoffs are urgently needed and would also provide an opportunity to compare this indicator with other established and emerging iron indexes. In addition, future work would benefit from a focus on elucidating cutoffs and indexes relevant to iron adequacy.

Laboratory measurements

Blood was collected into EDTA Vacutainer Tubes (Becton Dickinson) and hematological parameters (Hemoglobin level (Hb), MCV (mean corpuscular volume), white blood cells (WBS) and platelets,) were analyzed with an automated hematology analyzer (ADVIA 120, Bayer Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY, USA).

Serum was obtained by collecting blood into Vacutainer Tubes with no additive (Becton Dickinson). Serum levels of creatinine (CV 1.8%), C-reactive protein (CRP) (CV 3.3%) and soluble transferrin receptor (TfR) (CV 3.5%) were analyzed with Modular P, levels of cobalamin (vitamin B12) (CV 4.4%), folate (CV 7.5%) and NT-proBNP (N-Terminal pro brain-type natriuretic peptide) (CV 4.8%) with Modular E and serum ferritin (CV 4.5%) by Modular PP (F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland).

The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation; GFR (glomerular filtration rate) (mL/min/1.73 m²) = 175 × (S_cr)⁻¹.¹⁵⁴ × (Age)⁻⁰.²⁰³ × (0.742 if female), was used for estimating GFR. The equation does not require weight or height variables because the results are reported normalized to 1.73 m² body surface area, which is an accepted average adult surface area. The equation has been validated in Caucasian populations between the ages of 18 and 70 with impaired kidney function (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) and has shown good performance for patients with all common causes of kidney disease.

Iron deficiency was assessed by measuring Ferritin and TfR, since other studies have demonstrated that these measurements give a more sensitive measure of iron-deficiency than the more commonly used Transferrin saturation (Serum-iron/Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC)). Transferrin receptor rise, independent of inflammation, when the iron level available for erythropoiesis decrease.

N-Terminal pro brain-type natriuretic hormone (pro-BnP) (level > 225 pg/L) has been demonstrated to be a sensitive marker clinical cardiovascular disease and renal dysfunction, and was included as a measure of these comorbidities.

### Is it time to offer routine screening for iron deficiency in healthy adolescent females? [^112qoY8k]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

HOWEVER, DOES THIS APPROACH TRULY WORK?

In a study involving 493 adolescents and young adults, ID (ferritin < 15 μg/L or transferrin saturation < 15%) and iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) (ID with haemoglobin ≤ 11 g/dL) were evaluated. Among females (n = 350), 34.6% had ID and 6.3% had IDA, with nearly one‐third of those with ID lacking identifiable risk factors. Among males, 12.6% had ID, although none were diagnosed with IDA (most likely due to the restrictive definition), and over one‐third of those with ID had no identifiable risk factors. This suggests that the current screening methods would have missed over 50% of ID cases in females and over 95% in males. In another study, the use of ID risk assessment questionnaires in 96 female individuals 12–21 years old failed to predict objective measures of iron status, highlighting the need for improved screening strategies. In a study of 1756 adolescent females, the sensitivity and specificity of haemoglobin testing for predicting ID were 15.6% (95% CI: 9.4%–21.8%) and 99.2% (95% CI: 98.7%–99.8%), respectively. In a community‐based screening of reproductive‐aged women using fingertip haemoglobin testing, those with ID had similar haemoglobin concentrations to those without (11.89 ± 1.11 g/dL vs. 12.15 ± 0.71 g/dL, p = 0.364) and were no more likely to be anaemic (40% vs. 35%, p = 1.000), highlighting the limitation of haemoglobin alone in identifying ID.

### The origin of ferritin reference intervals: a systematic review [^116CTNtA]. The Lancet: Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Iron deficiency is a highly prevalent condition, which contributes to unnecessary morbidity, mortality, and health inequity. A serum ferritin concentration of less than 30 μg/L has a high specificity and sensitivity for diagnosing iron deficiency in adults, but the laboratory reported lower limit of normal (LLN) is typically lower. These LLNs might not be rooted in rigorous scientific evidence and might be contributing to structural underdiagnosis of iron deficiency. A systematic review was done per systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines with the use of medical literature databases from inception of each database to Nov 30, 2021, to identify studies that determined ferritin reference intervals in healthy adults and grey literature search for the five most common ferritin assays (registration number CRD42022268844). The objectives were to systematically summarise the ferritin reference intervals and to do a methodological quality assessment of the included studies. 2306 studies were screened and 61 full texts were included. 37 studies were eligible for analysis of the ferritin LLN in the general population. The population the sample was comprised of was a total of 21 882 females and 23 650 males participants. The ferritin LLN was a median of 8 μg/L (IQR 5–15) and mean of 9 μg/L (SD 11) in females and a median of 25 μg/L (IQR 16–44) and mean of 25 μg/L (SD 29) in males. 30 (49%) of 61 studies did not explicitly screen for patients at risk of iron deficiency, and 32 (52%) did not refer to a reference interval establishment guideline (eg, guideline recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute). The five most used commercial ferritin laboratory assays reported reference intervals with a median LLN of 11 (IQR 9–12) and mean of 9 μg/L (SD 4) for females and median of 22 (IQR 22–24) and mean of 23 μg/L (SD 4) for males. In the literature, serum ferritin reference intervals in healthy adults consistently report a LLN of less than 30 μg/L. Data driving these ferritin reference intervals are at high risk of bias, given no exclusion of individuals at risk for iron deficiency in the presumed normal population sample and no adherence to reference interval establishment standards. We suggest the use of evidence-based laboratory clinical decision limits to diagnose iron deficiency.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^111iUVEE]. Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Hemochromatosis — initial diagnostic markers and transferrin saturation (TS) thresholds are outlined: the initial approach to diagnosis is by indirect markers of iron stores, namely TS or unsaturated iron-binding capacity and serum ferritin, and a recent study using fasting samples showed no improvement in sensitivity or specificity in the detection of C282Y homozygotes; accordingly, this prior recommendation is no longer absolutely necessary, although it is advisable to confirm an elevated TS with a second determination and it is not unreasonable in our opinion to do this on a fasting specimen. Although a cutoff TS value of 45% is often chosen for its high sensitivity for detecting C282Y homozygotes, it has a lower specificity and positive predictive value compared to higher cutoff values, and using a cutoff TS of 45% will also identify persons with minor secondary iron overload as well as some C282Y/wild-type heterozygotes, requiring further evaluation.

Modelling

We used logistic regression modelling to test if these data could identify women who were more likely to respond to oral iron treatment, but all models displayed limitations. Model 1 using the haemoglobin at diagnosis and the variables, ethnicity, trimester at recruitment, marital status and parity had a predictive accuracy of 75%. The specificity was high at 89.8% but the sensitivity low at 42.9%. We then tested to see how much baseline laboratory data improved the predictability of the model. Using principal component analysis (PCA), two models were constructed, PC1, which included alkaline phosphatase, Albumin, Transferrin, calculated total iron binding capacity (TIBC), iron saturation and iron, and PC2, which included mean cell volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC). The laboratory models showed a marginal gain in the specificity to 92.3% but a reduction in the sensitivities to 30.8% and 34.6% (Table 4).

Summary of (crude) predictive ability: Model 1 Baseline = haemoglobin at diagnosis, ethnicity, trimester at recruitment, support status, and parity. PC1 = alkaline phosphatase, albumin, transferrin, total iron binding capacity iron saturation and iron. PC2 = mean cell volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin, and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration

a In Model 2, Hb at recruitment was dropped because Hb is already in PC2

b Not corrected for chance

We also examined the impact of socio-economic deprivation on the predictive ability of the models. Using the index of multiple deprivation (IMD), as a single measure and then each of its component parts were included in the models. There were no material changes to the results (Supplementary Table 8).

Interpretation of Laboratory Studies

To assess PCPs' choices for additional laboratory tests to be performed for evaluation of IDA, respondents were presented with a hypothetical scenario of a 65-year-old man reporting generalized fatigue who had a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0) and mean corpuscular volume of 72.3 fL (to convert to μm³, divide by 1.0). Measurement of ferritin level, the most specific marker of iron deficiency, was the most common laboratory test recommended by respondents (302 of 325 [92.9%]), followed by total iron-binding capacity and transferrin saturation (278 of 325 [85.5%]).

To assess PCPs' interpretation of iron laboratory studies, respondents were presented with a series of laboratory values and asked to determine whether the anemia resulted from iron deficiency or an alternate cause. For scenarios in which ferritin level and transferrin saturation were concordantly low or normal, respondents correctly identified the cause with more than 93% accuracy: 321 of 325 respondents (98.8%) correctly attributed anemia to iron deficiency in the presence of a low transferrin saturation (6%) and a low ferritin level (11 ng/mL), and 303 of 325 (93.2%) correctly attributed anemia to an alternate cause in the presence of a normal transferrin saturation (30%) and a normal ferritin level (150 ng/mL) (Figure 2). However, in scenarios of discordant ferritin and transferrin saturation values, diagnostic accuracy decreased. For example, in a scenario with a normal transferrin saturation (25%) but low ferritin level (6 ng/mL), 44 of 325 respondents (13.5%) misidentified the cause as something other than iron deficiency even though the likelihood ratio for iron deficiency with a ferritin level less than 15 ng/mL is 51.9. In a scenario with a low transferrin saturation (2%) but borderline low ferritin level (40 ng/mL), 86 of 325 respondents (26.5%) did not consider IDA as the cause even though the likelihood ratio for iron deficiency with a transferrin saturation less than 5% is 10.5. In that scenario, 239 of 325 respondents (73.5%) correctly identified the scenario as IDA. There were no statistically significant differences in correct interpretation of these scenarios by academic affiliation status, gender, stage in clinical practice, or practice of ordering ferritin level measurement for anemia evaluation.

### Iron deficiency anemia: evaluation and management [^114ZYX35]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disorder worldwide and accounts for approximately one-half of anemia cases. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is confirmed by the findings of low iron stores and a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal. Women should be screened during pregnancy, and children screened at one year of age. Supplemental iron may be given initially, followed by further workup if the patient is not responsive to therapy. Men and postmenopausal women should not be screened, but should be evaluated with gastrointestinal endoscopy if diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. The underlying cause should be treated, and oral iron therapy can be initiated to replenish iron stores. Parenteral therapy may be used in patients who cannot tolerate or absorb oral preparations.

Iron deficiency

Automated cell counters provide measurements of the changes in red cells that accompany iron deficiency including reduced mean cell Hb (MCH) — hypochromia; and reduced mean cell volume (MCV) — microcytosis.MCH is probably a more reliable marker of iron deficiency as it is less dependent on storage and the counting machine used, and a reduction is seen in both absolute and functional iron deficiency (FID). MCH may also be more sensitive for iron deficiency than MCV. Both microcytosis and hypochromia lose sensitivity for iron deficiency in the presence of chronic disease, thalassaemia or vitamin B12/folate deficiency.

The specificity of MCV and MCH for iron deficiency is limited, as microcytosis and hypochromia also occur in many haemoglobinopathies (such as thalassaemia, when the MCV is typically reduced out of proportion to the level of anaemia), in sideroblastic anaemia and in some cases of anaemia of chronic disease. To prevent unnecessary GI investigation, Hb electrophoresis is recommended in those with microcytosis and normal iron studies, particularly if there is an appropriate ethnic background.

The serum markers of iron deficiency include low ferritin, low transferrin saturation, low iron, raised total iron-binding capacity, raised red cell zinc protoporphyrin, increased serum transferrin receptor (sTfR), low reticulocyte Hb (Retic-Hb) and raised percentage hypochromic red cells. Serum ferritin (SF) is the most specific test for iron deficiency in the absence of inflammation. An SF level of < 15 µg/L is indicative of absent iron stores, while SF levels of less than 30 µg/L are generally indicative of low body iron stores. The lower limit of normal for most laboratories, therefore, lies in the range 15–30 µg/L.

As SF is an acute phase protein, however, apparently normal levels may occur with iron deficiency in the context of an inflammatory disease process. An SF cut-off of 45 µg/L has been suggested as providing the optimal trade-off between sensitivity and specificity for iron deficiency in practice. An SF value above 150 µg/L is unlikely to occur with absolute iron deficiency, even in the presence of inflammation.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^1149wkcb]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Definitions

3. We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

4. We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

5. We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

Anaemia

The WHO defines anaemia as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below 130 g/L in men over 15 years of age, below 120 g/L in non-pregnant women over 15 years of age and below 110 g/L in pregnant women in the second and third trimester. The diagnostic criteria for anaemia in IDA vary between published studies. The normal range for Hb also varies between different populations in the UK. It is reasonable to use the lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test to define anaemia, but these should be aligned with the WHO defined lower limits.

There is little consensus as to the level of anaemia that requires investigation. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) referral guidelines in the UK for suspected lower GI cancer suggest that IDA with an Hb concentration < 110 g/L in men or < 100 g/L in non-menstruating women warrants fast-track referral. These cut-off values will however miss some cases of colorectal cancer, especially in men. It is therefore advised that investigation should be considered at any level of anaemia in the presence of iron deficiency, though the case is stronger in those with more severe degrees of anaemia, as they are more likely to have serious underlying GI pathology.

1.8 Diagnosis of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions

Our review of international guidelines available for CHF, CKD and IBD reveals no consensus practical guidance for diagnosing iron deficiency independent of anemia (Table 1). However, only some guidelines recognize iron deficiency as a standalone condition — whether this is through lack of awareness of iron deficiency or an intentional omission is difficult to establish (Table 1). Iron deficiency can be simply diagnosed with routinely available blood tests measuring serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT). 86 yet guidelines often lack agreement on test cut‐off values for these parameters. 4 Serum ferritin levels are sensitive to inflammation and some guidelines recommend assessment of chronic inflammation (according to inflammatory markers such as C‐reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate); however, there is little consensus for many conditions on when this should be measured, should it be standard practice for all patients or measured only when serum ferritin is > 30 µg L −1 or if patients are symptomatic 68, 87? Moreover, no standard CRP cut‐off values are provided; although a CRP level of 5 mg L −1 is the most common threshold, 64 this is not recognized in most guidelines 68

### Best but not perfect: indirect measure of low iron stores [^115WFgXM]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Although making the correct diagnosis of iron deficiency is critical for patient care, the use of indirect markers obtained through routine phlebotomy presents a challenge. Low serum iron, transferrin saturation, hemoglobin, and MCV are characteristic of iron deficiency but can also result from inflammation. In addition, hemoglobin and MCV may be low due to genetic causes and, in the case of hemoglobin, to diurnal variation rather than iron deficiency. Transferrin concentrations tend to increase with iron deficiency and decrease with inflammation, whereas transferrin receptor levels rise with both iron deficiency and inflammation. Serum ferritin is an attractive marker because a very low level (< 10 μg/L) is diagnostic of iron deficiency as documented by absent stainable iron in a bone marrow aspirate. However, serum ferritin can be normal or even elevated when iron deficiency is documented by absent bone marrow stainable iron. A recent Cochrane review of 512 adults presenting for medical care at various institutions found that a serum ferritin < 30 μg/L had 98% specificity and 79% sensitivity for diagnosing iron deficiency as documented by absent bone marrow iron.

Lahtiharju et al make a remarkable contribution by evaluating the relationship of indirect measures of iron status to bone marrow iron stain in 6610 patients and providing evidence that ferritin is the most reliable single biomarker for predicting reduced iron stores. This finding is consistent with studies dated decades ago that established ferritin as a key standalone indicator of iron status. This study also underscores the limitations of ferritin, particularly its low sensitivity. Using a ferritin cutoff of 30 μg/L, the specificity rates were impressively high at 97% for females and 99% for males, but the sensitivity rates were only 54% and 35%, respectively. This indicates that while a ferritin of 30 μg/L or lower is highly specific for low or absent bone marrow iron, it is not sensitive enough to detect all cases of low iron stores, especially in patients with comorbid conditions that can increase ferritin levels. It is important to recognize that in this study, there were females with serum ferritin > 1750 μg/L and males with serum ferritin > 4967 μg/L who had low or absent bone marrow iron stores.

### Primary care requests for anaemia chemistry tests in Spain: potential iron, transferrin and folate over-requesting [^115c8YMi]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

Aim

To study the regional variability of requests for anaemia chemistry tests in primary care in Spain and the associated economic costs of potential over-requesting.

Methods

Requests for anaemia tests were examined in a cross-sectional study. Clinical laboratories from different autonomous communities (AACCs) were invited to report on primary care anaemia chemistry tests requested during 2014. Demand for iron, ferritin, vitamin B12 and folate tests per 1000 inhabitants and the ratios of the folate/vitamin B12 and transferrin/ferritin requests were compared between AACCs. We also calculated reagent costs and the number of iron, transferrin and folate tests and the economic saving if every AACC had obtained the results achieved by the AACC with best practice.

Results

110 laboratories participated (59.8% of the Spanish population). More than 12 million tests were requested, resulting in reagent costs exceeding €16.5 million. The serum iron test was the most often requested, and the ferritin test was the most costly (over €7 million). Close to €4.5 million could potentially have been saved if iron, transferrin and folate had been appropriately requested (€6 million when extrapolated to the whole Spanish population).

Conclusions

The demand for and expenditure on anaemia chemistry tests in primary care in Spain is high, with significant regional differences between different AACCs.

### Consensus statement on the definition and classification of metabolic hyperferritinaemia [^113UwyPT]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for dysmetabolic hyperferritinemia, more specifically with respect to MRI, MHF-CG 2023 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining a noninvasive estimation of iron concentration in the liver by MRI in the context of a clinical trial, given the initial evidence that serum levels of ferritin might be associated with iron accumulation in tissue in patients with stable metabolic hyperferritinemia. Consider obtaining it in patients with high serum levels of ferritin (grade 2, but in particular, grade 3) and/or additional clinical risk factors for iron overload. Prefer iron concentration in tissues over serum ferritin levels, when available, for grading metabolic hyperferritinemia.

### Haemoglobin thresholds to define anaemia from age 6 months to 65 years: estimates from international data sources [^117QGSNP]. The Lancet: Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Our study has several limitations. First, we defined statistical thresholds on the basis of the fifth centile of the distribution of haemoglobin values in a healthy reference population, rather than functional thresholds that indicate the risk of symptoms or disease; future studies could endeavour to develop functional thresholds. Studies that measured other iron indices, such as transferrin saturation, reticulocyte haemoglobin, soluble transferrin receptor, and hepcidin in clinically healthy populations, might have provided a more holistic picture of iron status. Scarce data were available on heavy menstrual bleeding, although this common syndrome would be likely to influence haemoglobin through its effects on ferritin concentration, which we measured in every case. Vitamin B12 and folate measurements were not consistently measured in these datasets. Because we sought to use datasets in which clinical data were available and applied conservative exclusion criteria, this approach precluded the use of cross-sectional datasets from many low-income settings where clinical information was scarce and undetected subclinical or recurrent clinical illnesses causing inflammation could have suppressed haemoglobin concentrations, which could lead to under-estimation of thresholds. We were able to use datasets from North and South America, Europe, Australia, south and east Asia, but not sub-Saharan Africa. Most participants were excluded from the healthy reference population because of clinical or biological factors that could affect their haemoglobin concentrations. Importantly, the reference samples generally comprised multi-ethnic populations (including African ancestries). Likewise, as is a common constraint with genetic analyses, the largest datasets were representative of European ancestry populations, although we specifically included studies recruiting substantial numbers of individuals of south and east Asian and African ancestries. A further limitation of the genetic summaries we have used is that they do not capture the full extent of genetic variation, such as variants on non-autosomal chromosomes. Ideally, a prospective multicentre study could clinically exclude individuals at risk of reduced haemoglobin concentration to define the reference group.

Hemochromatosis (HH) — genetic prevalence and clinical penetrance are characterized by C282Y homozygosity seen in approximately one in 250 Caucasians, with fully expressed disease with end-organ manifestations in fewer than 10% of these individuals, and full clinical manifestations seen approximately one in 2500. The heterozygote genotype (C282Y/wild type) is found in approximately one in 10 individuals and may be associated with elevated serum iron markers, but without associated tissue iron overload or damage. Approximately 75% did not have symptoms and did not exhibit any of the end-stage manifestations of the disease when identified in this way, and in large population screening studies only approximately 70% of C282Y homozygotes are found to have an elevated ferritin level; more men than women have increased ferritin levels.

### Evaluation of cardiac strain parameters in pregnant women with and without iron deficiency anemia: a prospective case control study [^116CoRZf]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Study design and population

This prospective, single-center observational study was conducted between January and June 2024 in the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Cardiology of our institution. A total of 80 pregnant women aged between 18 and 40 years with singleton pregnancies in their second or third trimesters were included. The participants were divided into two groups: 40 women diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia (IDA group) and 40 without anemia (control group).

Iron deficiency anemia was defined in accordance with the World Health Organization criteria for hemoglobin concentrations — < 11.0 g/dL in the first and third trimesters or < 10.5 g/dL in the second trimester — in conjunction with the ferritin threshold of < 30 ng/mL as recommended by recent guidelines.

Exclusion criteria included the presence of moderate to severe valvular heart disease, structural congenital heart anomalies, chronic renal or hepatic disease, multiple pregnancy, preeclampsia, preexisting diabetes mellitus or hypertension, any known hematologic or systemic inflammatory condition, and other causes of anemia such as vitamin B12 deficiency, folate deficiency, thalassemia, or anemia of chronic disease.

Ethical approval

The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Ankara Bilkent City Hospital (Approval No: [E1–20–1143], Date: [28.10.2020]). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to enrollment. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Laboratory parameters

Venous blood samples were collected from all participants for evaluation of the following laboratory parameters: hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum ferritin, serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), transferrin, white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, red cell distribution width (RDW), platelet count, mean platelet volume (MPV), glucose, urea, creatinine, albumin, total protein, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), sodium, potassium, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).

### Iron deficiency anemia [^1156qyBS]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is 2 percent in adult men, 9 to 12 percent in non-Hispanic white women, and nearly 20 percent in black and Mexican-American women. Nine percent of patients older than 65 years with iron deficiency anemia have a gastrointestinal cancer when evaluated. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women but not in other groups. Routine iron supplementation is recommended for high-risk infants six to 12 months of age. Iron deficiency anemia is classically described as a microcytic anemia. The differential diagnosis includes thalassemia, sideroblastic anemias, some types of anemia of chronic disease, and lead poisoning. Serum ferritin is the preferred initial diagnostic test. Total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and serum transferrin receptor levels may be helpful if the ferritin level is between 46 and 99 ng per mL (46 and 99 mcg per L); bone marrow biopsy may be necessary in these patients for a definitive diagnosis. In children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age, a trial of iron is a reasonable approach if the review of symptoms, history, and physical examination are negative; however, the hemoglobin should be checked at one month. If there is not a 1 to 2 g per dL (10 to 20 g per L) increase in the hemoglobin level in that time, possibilities include malabsorption of oral iron, continued bleeding, or unknown lesion. For other patients, an endoscopic evaluation is recommended beginning with colonoscopy if the patient is older than 50.

Diagnosis of cardiac iron overload is possible with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in which a decreased T2 signal correlates with myocardial iron infiltration and depressed left ventricular function. The established treatment for HH is phlebotomy, and in secondary iron overload, there is a role for chelation therapy.

Hereditary hemochromatosis phlebotomy regimen — initial depletion and maintenance guidance are as follows: One phlebotomy (removal of 500 mL blood) is performed "weekly or biweekly", and each unit removed contains "approximately 200–250 mg iron". Monitoring includes checking serum ferritin "after every 10–12 phlebotomies (approximately 3 months)" early in treatment, with excess iron mobilization indicated when ferritin "drops to between 50 and 100 μg/L". As the "target range of 50–100 μg/L" is approached, testing may be increased; frequent phlebotomy is stopped when ferritin "reaches 50–100 μg/L", and then continued to keep ferritin "between 50 and 100 μg/L". Safety measures include allowing hematocrit/hemoglobin to fall by "no more than 20% of prior level". Treatment burden can be substantial in heavily iron-loaded patients — those with total body iron stores " > 30 g" may require "up to 2–3 years" of therapy — and maintenance needs vary, with some patients requiring phlebotomy "monthly", while others may need "only 1–2 units of blood removed per year".

### Iron deficiency screening is a key issue in chronic inflammatory diseases: a call to action [^11189XPC]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is frequent in chronic conditions

Until very recently, iron deficiency (ID) was considered only in the context of iron‐deficiency anemia. It is only in the last 10–15 years that ID has been considered as an autonomous pathological entity in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs. Therefore, early ID detection and treatment became important goals, as iron is essential for the functioning of all organs. The fact that the biological definition of ID is debated and inconsistently defined by authors in different studies has probably contributed to preventing the recognition of ID as an independent condition. An international multidisciplinary group of experts recently proposed a more comprehensive definition of ID: "Iron deficiency is a health‐related condition in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs and which can be present with or without anemia". This definition is important because it indicates that ID may have specific symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment, even in the absence of anemia. Furthermore, as detailed in the next section, ID is associated with poor prognosis in many diseases, thus highlighting the importance of its diagnosis.

Depending on the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, two types of ID can be distinguished, with identical clinical symptoms: absolute ID, which is the consequence of a quantitative decrease in iron stores, and functional ID, which is due to the sequestration of iron in otherwise quantitatively normal or abundant stores. These two types of ID are not mutually exclusive and are often associated. Understanding their underlying mechanisms is essential for the development of rational diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic approaches.

In daily practice, the most effective biomarkers of iron status are serum ferritin, which reflects stored iron, and transferrin saturation (TSAT), which is indicative of transported iron. TSAT is always present; thus, the decrease of TSAT is an essential diagnostic criterion of absolute or functional ID. Since the reliability of serum ferritin measurement may be compromised in patients with chronic diseases or any inflammatory condition, there is a large consensus in guidelines to determine both serum ferritin and TSAT in the first line. There is still no consensus on the thresholds, but recent recommendations of international guidelines have shown agreement for defining ID by serum ferritin < 100 µg/L and/or TSAT < 20%.

### Screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children: USPSTF recommendation statement [^114aKFku]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening tests for iron deficiency anemia in infants and young children — test performance and limitations indicate that serum hemoglobin or hematocrit is the primary screening test for iron deficiency anemia, but hemoglobin is not sensitive for detecting iron deficiency and is also nonspecific, as ~60% of cases of anemia result from causes other than iron deficiency. The positive predictive value of low hemoglobin for iron deficiency in children age 12 months ranges from 10% to 40%, and in infants, particularly before age 12 months, spontaneous resolution of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia reduces the positive predictive value of any screening test. Other single tests as primary screening tools have not been well studied, and serum ferritin acts as an acute-phase reactant and should ideally be measured in the absence of infection or inflammation.

### Evaluation and management of iron deficiency in children undergoing intestinal rehabilitation – A position paper from the NASPGHAN intestinal rehabilitation special interest group [^114ZRpr7]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). High credibility.

NASPGHAN intestinal rehabilitation recommendations — screening and practical management in children: In children with suspected altered gastrointestinal motility (gastroparesis, pediatric intestinal pseudo-obstruction [PIPO]) or a history of gastrojejunal bypass or persistently draining gastrostomy tube (G tube), we recommend clamping the G tube for 30 minutes after enteral iron administration into the gastric port for improved absorption. Screening for iron deficiency (ID)/iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in children undergoing IR should not be based on a hemoglobin (Hb) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) alone; we recommend screening for IDA based on complete blood count (CBC), serum ferritin (SF), transferrin saturation (TSAT), serum iron concentration, and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and a C-reactive protein (CRP) should be obtained while screening for ID as SF is an acute phase reactant. Children undergoing IR should be screened for ID/IDA and we recommend screening every 3–6 months. Vitamin B12, zinc, and copper deficiency should be evaluated based on anatomic risk and in children not responding to conventional treatment. While assessing iron status in children undergoing IR, we recommend categorizing children into 3 categories: children without ID; children with ID without anemia; and children with IDA to enable informed decision making.

Materials and methods

Between 1988 and 1994, a survey was conducted to examine the health and nutrition of a randomly selected sample of the non-institutionalized US population. Full details of the survey design and examination procedure have been previously published. This study examines adults aged 17 and older, which yields a study sample population of 20,050. However, exclusions from the study sample including missing data on lung function, missing data on most of the exposure variables, or on any confounding variables in the final model, resulted in a final sample size of 14,120.

Data collection

Trained interviewers collected detailed information on socioeconomic and medical history questionnaires on each participant, including questions on social class, smoking history, medical diagnosis, and current medication. Further measurements were conducted at mobile examination centers, including anthropometric measurements, which were used to calculate body mass index (BMI (weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared)) and waist to hip ratio (WHR). Complete medical examinations were conducted and blood samples were collected for a variety of biochemical assays, including vitamins (vitamin A, alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lutein/zeaxanthin, lycopene, retinyl esters, vitamin B12, red blood cell folate, vitamin C, and vitamin E), minerals (selenium, normalised calcium, chloride, iron, total iron binding capacity(TIBC), ferritin, transferrin saturation, potassium, and sodium), total cholesterol, triglycerides and total protein. As part of the medical examination, spirometry measurements including FEV 1 and forced vital capacity (FVC) were conducted according to the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society and the highest value from the acceptable manoeuvres was recorded. The present study has used the one-second forced expiratory volume (FEV 1) as its primary lung function outcome variable.

### Ferritin cutoffs and diagnosis of iron deficiency in primary care [^115EYuQe]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

We report variable summaries as numbers (percentages) or medians (IQRs) as appropriate. Missing data were handled using a complete-case approach in regression analyses. We conducted all analyses from October 2, 2023, to May 29, 2024, using the statistical software R, version 4.3.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).

We assessed the association of ferritin cutoff choice with the incidence of iron deficiency diagnoses using the following 3 cutoffs recommended by guidelines and expert panels for the adult general population,: 15, 30, and 45 ng/mL. For each cutoff and patient, we defined an iron deficiency event as the first measurement of ferritin concentrations below that cutoff during the study period and calculated patient-time as the number of days from (and including) inclusion to (and including) the earliest of either an iron deficiency event, if any, or the end of the study period. For each ferritin cutoff, we excluded patients with iron deficiency as at least 1 ferritin concentration below that cutoff during the year before inclusion from the respective population at risk. We calculated the total incidence of iron deficiency diagnoses as the number of iron deficiency events per 1000 patient-years. We classified iron deficiency events as indicating nonanemic and anemic iron deficiency when accompanied by hemoglobin concentrations within ± 4 weeks excluding and indicating anemia, respectively, and calculated their specific incidences. We report all incidence estimates with exact Poisson mean 95% CIs.

Laboratory studies revealed a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL (reference range, 12.0–15.5 g/dL), mean cell volume of 77 fL (reference range, 81.6–98.3 fL), ferritin of 8 μg/L (reference range, 10–200 μg/L), iron of 43 μg/dL (reference range, 30–160 μg/dL), total iron binding capacity of 450 μg/dL (reference range, 230–404 μg/dL), and transferrin saturation of 10% (reference range, 13%-45%). The patient reported heavy menstrual bleeding, fatigue, and pagophagia. Upper and lower endoscopies did not reveal a source of blood loss. She had avoided iron supplements because she was told they might exacerbate her photosensitivity.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^116VTxiw]. Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Diagnosis

The clinical diagnosis of hemochromatosis is based on documentation of increased iron stores, demonstrated by elevated serum ferritin levels, which reflects an increase in hepatic iron content. HH can be further defined genotypically by the familial occurrence of iron overload associated with C282Y homozygosity or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygosity. Serologic iron markers (TS, ferritin) are widely available, and the majority of patients with HH are now identified while still asymptomatic and without evidence of hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. There are certain high-risk groups that should be targeted for evaluation, such as those with a family history of HH, those with suspected organ involvement, and those with chance detection of biochemical and/or radiological abnormalities suggestive of the possibility of iron overload. It is generally recommended that all patients with abnormal liver function have iron studies done at some point in their evaluation. The algorithm outlined in Fig. 3 can provide some further direction regarding testing and is modified from the version used in the previous AASLD guidelines.

Fig. 3
An algorithm can provide some further direction regarding testing and treatment for HH. The algorithm is modified from the version used in the previous AASLD guidelines.

The initial approach to diagnosis is by indirect markers of iron stores, namely TS or unsaturated iron-binding capacity and serum ferritin (Table 7). TS is calculated from the ratio of serum iron to total iron-binding capacity. In some laboratories, the total iron-binding capacity is calculated from the sum of the serum iron and the unsaturated iron-binding capacity, whereas in others, it is calculated indirectly from the transferrin concentration in the serum. A recent study, using fasting samples, has shown no improvement in sensitivity or specificity in the detection of C282Y homozygotes. Accordingly, this prior recommendation is no longer absolutely necessary, although it is advisable to confirm an elevated TS with a second determination and it is not unreasonable in our opinion to do this on a fasting specimen. Over the years, different studies have used a variety of cutoff values for TS to identify patients eligible for further testing. Although a cutoff TS value of 45% is often chosen for its high sensitivity for detecting C282Y homozygotes, it has a lower specificity and positive predictive value compared to higher cutoff values. Thus, using a cutoff TS of 45% will also identify persons with minor secondary iron overload as well as some C282Y/wild-type heterozygotes, and these cases will require further evaluation.

### Physiologically based serum ferritin thresholds for iron deficiency among women and children from Africa, Asia, Europe, and central America: a multinational comparative study [^111tZ19f]. The Lancet: Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Background

Diagnosis of iron deficiency commonly relies on measurement of serum ferritin concentrations. WHO guidelines identify serum ferritin thresholds for iron deficiency among healthy individuals of less than 15 μg/L for women and less than 12 μg/L for children under 5 years, based on expert opinion. We report thresholds for iron deficiency for apparently healthy non-pregnant women and young children based on physiological indicators.

We performed secondary analyses of cross-sectional data from women (aged 15–49 years) and children (aged 6–59 months) from 12 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and central America from available surveys (2007–19). Using haemoglobin and soluble transferrin receptor concentrations as individual-level indicators of iron deficiency, we identified country-specific serum ferritin thresholds. We conducted multivariate meta-analysis using individual participant data to assess multinational heterogeneity and intercountry consistency.

Findings

Data were collected from July, 2007 to March, 2019. 18251 individuals (13864 women and 4387 children) were included in the final analysis. The thresholds of pooled serum ferritin levels corresponding to the starting point of decline in circulating haemoglobin concentrations were 24.8 μg/L (95% CI 24.4–25.2) for women and 22.1 μg/L (20.8–23.4) for children based on the national survey data from 12 countries. The thresholds were consistent among countries (p heterogeneity: women = 0.73, children = 0.43) but median serum ferritin concentrations and lower 5% reference ranges differed. In all countries, the prevalence of iron deficiency was higher using physiologically based thresholds than that using WHO current guidelines for women (36.0% [95% CI 25.3–46.8] vs 20.1% [11.5–28.7], p < 0.0001) and for children (34.2% [24.3–44.1] vs 16.6% [11.2–22.0], p < 0.0001).

Interpretation

These results provide evidence that the prevalence of iron deficiency as indicated by physiological measures is substantially higher than those based on current WHO guidelines. The consistency of physiologically based serum ferritin thresholds in apparently healthy women and young children offers a potential means to achieve evidence-informed coordination in thresholds for iron deficiency across populations. The use of physiologically based serum ferritin thresholds could help in detecting the clinical and functional outcomes of iron deficiency.

### Using machine learning to predict laboratory test results [^116p3kPU]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

While clinical laboratories report most test results as individual numbers, findings, or observations, clinical diagnosis usually relies on the results of multiple tests. Clinical decision support that integrates multiple elements of laboratory data could be highly useful in enhancing laboratory diagnosis.

Methods

Using the analyte ferritin in a proof of concept, we extracted clinical laboratory data from patient testing and applied a variety of machine-learning algorithms to predict ferritin test results using the results from other tests. We compared predicted with measured results and reviewed selected cases to assess the clinical value of predicted ferritin.

Results

We show that patient demographics and results of other laboratory tests can discriminate normal from abnormal ferritin results with a high degree of accuracy (area under the curve as high as 0.97, held-out test data). Case review indicated that predicted ferritin results may sometimes better reflect underlying iron status than measured ferritin.

Conclusions

These findings highlight the substantial informational redundancy present in patient test results and offer a potential foundation for a novel type of clinical decision support aimed at integrating, interpreting, and enhancing the diagnostic value of multianalyte sets of clinical laboratory test results.

### Iron overload may be critical for liver dysfunction in anorexia nervosa, and the role of haematocrit-adjusted albumin in assessing nutritional status: a case report [^113Chf7V]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 15-year-old girl was hospitalized with severe weight loss and difficulty standing due to restricting-type AN. She weighed 51.2 kg (body mass index [BMI] 20.5 kg/m 2) a year before admission but was jealous of her thin friend and tried to lose weight through intensive exercise and calorie restriction. Owing to her continuous weight loss, she was referred to the psychiatric department of our hospital, weighing 28.7 kg (11.42 kg/m 2) on admission; she was further referred to our department for medical stabilization. Her medical history was unremarkable, and she had been taking vitamin B complex, including benfotiamine 75 mg/day, pyridoxine 75 mg/day, and cyanocobalamin 0.75 mg/day to prevent vitamin B1, B6, and B12 deficiencies, which had been prescribed by her previous doctor, for three months before admission.

On day 3, her test results showed hypoglycaemia and elevated liver enzymes, TSAT, ferritin, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine (Cre) ratio. However, her serum iron and electrolytes were within normal limits (Table 1 A). Her endocrine tests showed typical findings of AN, including stress-induced hypercortisolaemia, low triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels with normal thyroid-stimulating hormone indicating euthyroid sick syndrome, high growth hormone levels accompanying low insulin-like growth factor-1, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (Table 1 B).

### Effect of a red blood cell transfusion on biological markers used to determine the cause of anemia: a prospective study [^1145nzNS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Blood test results required for the evaluation of anemia are considered difficult to interpret after red blood cell transfusion. However, this hypothesis is neither supported by a strong physiological rationale nor is it evidence based.

Methods

We conducted a prospective multicenter study to compare the values of key assays prior to and after a course of red blood cell transfusion in the emergency or internal medicine units in 4 university hospitals. The following parameters were measured prior to and within 48 to 72 hours after transfusion: complete blood count with reticulocyte count, direct Coombs' test, ferritin, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, serum and erythrocyte folate, cobalamin, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, haptoglobin, and C-reactive protein. We investigated the impact of transfusion on these parameters and assessed whether abnormal values prior to the transfusion became normal after transfusion (or conversely).

Results

There were 77 patients included in the study. Changes in mean values of mean corpuscular volume, soluble transferrin receptor, erythrocyte folate, cobalamin, haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, and direct Coombs' test were not statistically significant. Changes in reticulocyte count, ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum folate, and total bilirubin concentrations were statistically significant, but they remained in the same diagnostic category (normal or abnormal) in 79% to 98% of the cases; 97% of patients with iron deficiency still had low ferritin or transferrin saturation after a transfusion.

Conclusion

Blood tests performed after a one-time red blood cell transfusion can be used to establish the cause of anemia when they have not been performed before.

### Diagnostic testing and evaluation of iron deficiency anemia by US PCPs… [^116EDPiZ]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

For interpretation of iron laboratory studies, a series of 4 combinations of ferritin level and transferrin saturation were presented: low transferrin saturation and a low ferritin level, normal transferrin saturation and normal ferritin level, normal transferrin saturation and low ferritin level, and low transferrin saturation and normal to low ferritin level. For scenarios in which ferritin level and transferrin saturation were concordantly low or normal, respondents correctly identified the cause with more than 93% accuracy: 321 of 325 respondents correctly attributed anemia to iron deficiency in the presence of a low transferrin saturation and a low ferritin level, and 303 of 325 correctly attributed anemia to an alternate cause in the presence of a normal transferrin saturation and a normal ferritin level.

However, in scenarios of discordant ferritin and transferrin saturation values, diagnostic accuracy decreased. For example, in a scenario with a normal transferrin saturation but low ferritin level, 44 of 325 respondents misidentified the cause as something other than iron deficiency even though the likelihood ratio for iron deficiency with a ferritin level less than 15. ng/mL is 51.
9. 18 In a scenario with a low transferrin saturation but borderline low ferritin level, 86 of 325 respondents did not consider IDA as the cause even though the likelihood ratio for iron deficiency with a transferrin saturation less than 5% is 10.
5. 18 In that scenario, 239 of 325 respondents correctly identified the scenario as IDA. Specifically, 26. 5% of respondents misdiagnosed a scenario of IDA as anemia with an alternate cause despite a low transferrin saturation and a borderline low ferritin level.

However, our survey allowed us to indirectly assess physician knowledge and behavior with uniform, ideal clinical scenarios, which is not possible when secondary data are used.
