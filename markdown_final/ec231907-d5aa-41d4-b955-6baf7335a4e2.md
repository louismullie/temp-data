## Question

Wide gap between diastolic and systolic blood pressure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the wide gap between diastolic and systolic blood pressure (wide pulse pressure), including its definition, mechanisms, prognostic significance, measurement nuances, and management implications across ages and phenotypes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "wide pulse pressure" and how it relates to isolated systolic hypertension. Then, I should verify the hemodynamic mechanisms that widen pulse pressure with age and disease. Next, I will review the prognostic data for cardiovascular outcomes, including the diastolic J-curve. After that, I need to check measurement pitfalls and the role of central versus peripheral pressures. Finally, I will synthesize management principles, including thresholds, drug class selection, and special populations, and close with practical takeaways and uncertainties that warrant caution in interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the definition and clinical construct. Wide pulse pressure is simply the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and in clinical practice a difference of roughly 60 mmHg or more is commonly considered "wide", though this is a pragmatic threshold rather than a universally codified cut point; importantly, wide pulse pressure is the hallmark of isolated systolic hypertension, which becomes increasingly prevalent with age as diastolic pressure plateaus or falls while systolic pressure rises [^114tUjG8] [^112gRqjk] [^115xga8Q] [^111UDjUs].

> I will now examine the hemodynamic mechanisms. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — pulse pressure reflects both a pulsatile component tied to large artery stiffness and wave reflection, and a steady component tied to mean arterial pressure; with aging, large arteries stiffen, pulse wave velocity increases, and wave reflections augment systolic pressure while diastolic pressure falls, thereby widening pulse pressure; in younger adults, elevated stroke volume can also raise pulse pressure even before overt stiffness emerges, which explains why isolated systolic hypertension in the young may reflect hyperdynamic rather than purely stiffness-driven physiology [^111hxBAp] [^112hVGKa] [^116CzTpL] [^111B94t5].

> Next, I should review the prognostic significance. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of risk signals: meta-analytic data show that each 10 mmHg increase in pulse pressure is associated with about a 6–7% increase in total and cardiovascular mortality, independent of mean pressure; in older adults with isolated systolic hypertension, higher on-treatment pulse pressure tracks more heart failure and stroke; in patients with prior cardiovascular disease and low diastolic pressure, wide pulse pressure compounds risk; and in peri-procedural cohorts, a high systolic with low diastolic pattern predicts higher long-term mortality after PCI, reinforcing the pathophysiologic vulnerability of low diastolic perfusion pressure coupled with high systolic load [^112g4NNb] [^117YNANo] [^113X4tvg] [^116FTDFA].

> But wait, what about the diastolic J-curve — does lowering diastolic pressure too much worsen outcomes? I should double-check the consistency here: multiple analyses show that when systolic pressure is controlled to less than 130 mmHg, diastolic pressure below about 60 mmHg is associated with higher risks of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke; this J-shaped relationship persists after adjustment in some datasets, though mediation analyses suggest confounding may partly explain the association with intensive therapy, so causality remains debated; nonetheless, clinically I should avoid pushing diastolic pressure into the 50s when feasible [^11521VcP] [^111yY47c] [^117Lg8Ku] [^111qRWU6].

> I need to ensure measurement accuracy because misclassification can distort pulse pressure. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude of cuff error: compared with intra-arterial brachial pressure, cuff systolic pressure can be underestimated by a few mmHg while diastolic is overestimated by roughly 8 mmHg on average, leading to an average underestimation of pulse pressure by about 11 mmHg with substantial scatter; this means a seemingly "moderate" brachial pulse pressure may mask a truly wide central pulse pressure, and it underscores the value of standardized technique and, when available, out-of-office or central assessments to refine risk attribution [^115ophqR] [^1118MqK8] [^115xuWBr].

> Let me consider central versus peripheral pressure concepts. Hmm, wait a minute — pressure amplification from aorta to brachial artery varies by age and vascular tone, so brachial pulse pressure does not perfectly track central pulse pressure; in younger individuals, greater amplification can make peripheral pulse pressure appear less concerning even when central pulsatility is elevated, whereas in older adults amplification wanes and peripheral pulse pressure more closely approximates central risk; where feasible, central pressure indices or pulse wave analysis can refine risk stratification, though routine clinical adoption remains limited pending stronger outcome data [^114s43Am] [^116NqdwP] [^113QJVdr].

> Next, I should review management principles. I should confirm that guidelines prioritize systolic control while acknowledging diastolic trade-offs: contemporary guidance supports targeting office systolic pressure generally below 130 mmHg if tolerated, with attention to diastolic pressure not drifting below about 60–70 mmHg in older or high-risk patients; when pulse pressure is very wide, agents that reduce wave reflection or have favorable effects on arterial stiffness may be preferred, such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs, calcium channel blockers, and thiazide-like diuretics, whereas beta-blockers may be less effective for systolic and pulse pressure lowering and can widen pulse pressure via heart rate effects; in frail older adults, aiming for systolic 120 mmHg may be unsafe if it drives diastolic below 60 mmHg, so individualized targets are essential [^1142u5ao] [^116NqdwP] [^111z7rsp] [^116wtt7v].

> I should double-check special populations. In diabetes, aggressive systolic lowering frequently pulls diastolic into the 60s or lower, raising concerns about coronary perfusion; observational and clinical data suggest a nontrivial fraction of patients end up with diastolic pressure ≤ 70 mmHg when targeting systolic < 130 mmHg, so I need to balance myocardial oxygen supply against event reduction benefits; in chronic kidney disease, higher systolic pressure and wider pulse pressure track faster kidney function decline, reinforcing the importance of addressing pulsatile load; in pregnancy with acute severe hypertension and wide pulse pressure, adjunctive loop diuretics can modestly reduce pulse pressure at 2 hours, though first-line therapy remains standard antihypertensives [^114bByr2] [^113NvNpY] [^111oNSfU].

> Let me reconsider young adults with isolated systolic hypertension. I should confirm that not all ISH in youth reflects benign amplification; some have true early vascular aging or elevated stroke volume with increased risk over time, so I should exclude white-coat hypertension with out-of-office monitoring, consider central pressure assessment when available, and intensify lifestyle modification, reserving pharmacotherapy for those with sustained elevations, high central pressures, or additional risk factors rather than treating a single elevated office reading reflexively [^11428BA9] [^116CzTpL] [^116NqdwP].

> I will now examine the elderly more closely. Hold on, I should verify the treatment paradox: while lowering systolic pressure reduces events, excessive diastolic drops can be harmful; in SHEP and related analyses, on-treatment diastolic pressure below about 70 mmHg was associated with higher cardiovascular events, and in SPRINT-era analyses, intensive therapy increased serious adverse events in those with wider pulse pressure, suggesting additive risk when both wide pulse pressure and aggressive titration coexist; therefore, I should titrate cautiously, reassess symptoms of low diastolic perfusion, and consider relaxing targets if diastolic falls below 60 mmHg in frail patients [^117Lg8Ku] [^116kVdS1] [^116wtt7v].

> Next, I should review how to monitor and phenotype over time. Let me verify that ambulatory or home blood pressure improves diagnostic accuracy and reveals white-coat or masked patterns; serial assessments help distinguish persistent wide pulse pressure from variability, and tracking pulse wave velocity or other stiffness indices, where available, can contextualize risk; given sex- and age-specific trajectories, with women experiencing steeper midlife rises in pulse pressure, longitudinal profiling is prudent to anticipate phenotype transitions and tailor therapy [^115xuWBr] [^111UDjUs] [^111vHD4j].

> Finally, I need to synthesize practical takeaways. Wide pulse pressure signals arterial stiffness and pulsatile load and independently predicts cardiovascular events, particularly heart failure and stroke; in treated patients with systolic pressure under 130 mmHg, diastolic pressure should generally be kept above 60 mmHg and ideally around 70–80 mmHg when feasible; management should prioritize systolic control while selecting agents that mitigate wave reflection and stiffness, and in older or frail patients I should avoid overly aggressive titration that risks diastolic hypotension; accurate measurement, out-of-office confirmation, and attention to central hemodynamics refine risk assessment and guide safer, more effective treatment plans [^112g4NNb] [^11521VcP] [^1142u5ao] [^1118MqK8].

A wide gap between systolic and diastolic blood pressure — pulse pressure ≥ 60 mmHg — reflects **increased arterial stiffness** [^112hVGKa] and is a strong, independent predictor of cardiovascular risk, especially in older adults [^112g4NNb] [^117YNANo]. It is most often due to **age-related vascular stiffening** [^111hxBAp], but can also result from atherosclerosis, aortic regurgitation, hyperthyroidism, anemia, or high-output states [^notfound]. Wide pulse pressure is associated with higher risks of heart failure, stroke, coronary events, and mortality [^112g4NNb] [^117YNANo], and is especially concerning when diastolic pressure falls below 70 mmHg [^113X4tvg] [^11521VcP]. Management focuses on **tight systolic control** [^113Bc5Dp], careful avoidance of excessive diastolic lowering [^11521VcP], and addressing underlying causes; **out-of-office BP monitoring** [^1141vvfK] and, when available, **central BP assessment** [^116NqdwP] can refine risk stratification and guide therapy.

---

## Definition and clinical significance

Pulse pressure (PP) is the difference between systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) [^114tUjG8]; a PP ≥ 60 mmHg is generally considered "wide" and clinically significant [^112gRqjk]. Wide PP reflects **increased arterial stiffness** [^115YhabH] and pulsatile hemodynamic load, and is a strong, independent predictor of cardiovascular events and mortality [^112g4NNb] [^117YNANo].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several mechanisms underlie a **wide PP**:

- **Arterial stiffness**: Age-related stiffening of large arteries (aorta, carotid) increases SBP and decreases DBP, widening PP [^112hVGKa] [^111hxBAp].

- **Atherosclerosis**: Plaque buildup reduces arterial compliance, increasing SBP and PP [^111hxBAp].

- **Aortic regurgitation**: Diastolic reflux widens PP by raising SBP and lowering DBP [^111vNhR7].

- **Hyperthyroidism and anemia**: Increased cardiac output and stroke volume widen PP via higher SBP and lower DBP [^116CzTpL].

- **High-output states**: Fever, sepsis, and pregnancy can increase stroke volume and widen PP [^116CzTpL].

---

## Clinical implications and risks

Wide PP is associated with **increased risks** of:

- **Cardiovascular events**: Higher risk of heart failure, stroke, and coronary events [^112g4NNb] [^117YNANo].

- **Mortality**: Increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality [^112g4NNb] [^114B1Vmv].

- **Cognitive decline**: Linked to white matter injury and cognitive impairment [^112WaWno] [^113EFLiB].

- **Renal dysfunction**: Associated with proteinuria and CKD progression [^114GJMCP].

Low diastolic pressure (< 70 mmHg) with wide PP further increases risk, particularly in older adults [^113X4tvg] [^11521VcP].

---

## Clinical guidelines and management strategies

Current guidelines emphasize **systolic control** [^1142u5ao] while avoiding excessive diastolic lowering [^11521VcP]:

- **Systolic target**: Aim for < 130 mmHg if tolerated, balancing risks in older or frail patients [^1142u5ao] [^115GPRbD].

- **Diastolic threshold**: Avoid diastolic < 60 mmHg due to increased adverse events [^11521VcP] [^111yY47c].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight loss, sodium restriction, exercise, and alcohol moderation reduce PP [^notfound].

- **Pharmacological therapy**: ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics are preferred; beta-blockers may be less effective for PP reduction [^111z7rsp].

- **Monitoring**: Use ambulatory or home BP monitoring to guide therapy and avoid overtreatment [^1141vvfK] [^115xuWBr].

---

## Special considerations

- **Elderly patients**: Wide PP is common; tailor targets to avoid hypotension and falls [^117YNANo] [^116kVdS1].

- **Diabetes and CKD**: Wide PP increases renal risk; monitor closely and adjust therapy [^114GJMCP].

- **Younger patients**: Wide PP may reflect hyperdynamic circulation; evaluate for secondary causes [^111B94t5] [^115GPRbD].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

When wide PP is detected, **evaluate for**:

- **Secondary causes**: Aortic regurgitation, hyperthyroidism, anemia, high-output states [^111vNhR7].

- **Target organ damage**: LVH, renal impairment, cognitive effects [^112cLTmo] [^112WaWno].

- **Central blood pressure**: Consider when available to refine risk and guide therapy [^116NqdwP] [^113QJVdr].

---

A wide SBP-DBP gap (pulse pressure ≥ 60 mmHg) signals **increased arterial stiffness** [^115YhabH] and higher cardiovascular risk, especially in older adults. Management should **focus on systolic control** [^115YhabH], avoid excessive diastolic lowering [^11521VcP], and address underlying causes, with **out-of-office monitoring** [^1141vvfK] and, when available, **central BP assessment** [^116NqdwP] to optimize care.

### What is the most important component of blood pressure: systolic, diastolic or pulse pressure? [^115YhabH]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diastolic blood pressure has traditionally been considered the most important component of blood pressure and the primary target of antihypertensive therapy. However, over 30 years ago important epidemiological studies pointed out the importance of systolic blood pressure, and research during the 1990s has strengthened this view. Unlike diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure increases progressively with age, and in the ageing societies elevated systolic pressure is the most common form of hypertension. The characteristic changes of systolic and diastolic blood pressure with age lead to increases in pulse pressure (systolic minus diastolic), which has emerged as a new, potentially independent risk factor. In this review we compare the relative importance of various blood pressure components.

Recent Findings

Generally, in studies in which readings of systolic and diastolic blood pressure have been compared, systolic blood pressure has been a better predictor of risk. Moreover, isolated systolic hypertension predicts risk better than isolated diastolic hypertension, and the treatment of both isolated systolic hypertension and combined hypertension has reduced cardiovascular events. There are no treatment studies of isolated diastolic hypertension. Pulse pressure reflects stiffening of large arteries and is associated with several cardiovascular risk factors. Pulse pressure also predicts events in epidemiologic studies, but elucidation of an independent role is hampered by the close correlation between pulse pressure and systolic blood pressure.

Summary

Epidemiological and treatment studies suggest that systolic blood pressure should be the primary target of antihypertensive therapy, although consideration of systolic and diastolic pressure together improves risk prediction. The greatest practical concern at the moment is the undertreatment of hypertension, especially systolic, and total cardiovascular risk.

### The epidemiology of blood pressure and its worldwide management [^112dJhpn]. Circulation Research (2015). Low credibility.

Despite the vast amount of evidence on the benefits of blood pressure lowering accumulated to date, elevated blood pressure is still the leading risk factor for disease and disability worldwide. The purpose of this review is to summarize the epidemiological evidence underpinning the association between blood pressure and a range of conditions. This review focuses on the association between systolic and diastolic blood pressures and the risk of cardiovascular and renal disease. Evidence for and against the existence of a J-shaped curve association between blood pressure and cardiovascular risk, and differences in the predictive power of systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure, are described. In addition, global and regional trends in blood pressure levels and management of hypertension are reviewed.

### Epidemiological, pathophysiological and clinical significance of systolic, diastolic and pulse pressure [^114tJ9nw]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Long-term population surveys and studies of untreated hypertensive patients both strongly suggest that over the age of about 45, the height of the systolic blood pressure is a better predictor of cardiovascular outcome than the diastolic pressure. Research into echocardiographic left ventricular size, endothelial function and thromborheology also back up this supposition. In clinical practice, the treatment of isolated systolic hypertension has been shown to be very worthwhile. There remains some uncertainty as to the relative significance of diastolic blood pressure when it is frankly high, as in severe systo-diastolic hypertension. However some clinicians and epidemiologists have questioned whether diastolic pressure is still worth measuring, given the overwhelming importance of the height of the systolic blood pressure at predicting outcome.

### Systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure and arterial stiffness as cardiovascular risk factors [^116bRK4b]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

For many years systolic and diastolic blood pressure were the exclusive mechanical factors predicting cardiovascular risk in populations of normotensive and hypertensive individuals. However, if hypertension acts as a mechanical factor with deleterious consequences on the arterial wall, the totality of the blood pressure curve should be considered to evaluate the risk. The purpose of this review is to show that, in addition to systolic and diastolic blood pressure, other haemodynamic indexes with particular relevance for cardiac complications and that originate from pulsatile pressure should be taken into account, namely brachial pulse pressure and aortic pulse wave velocity. The main recent findings in normotensive and hypertensive populations are: (i) increased pulse pressure is an independent predictor of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure and cardiovascular death, even in hypertensive patients undergoing successful antihypertensive drug therapy; (ii) increased aortic pulse wave velocity and increased carotid incremental elastic modulus are also both independent predictors of cardiovascular mortality, mainly in patients with end-stage renal disease and, to a lesser extent, in individuals with essential hypertension. Currently, increased pulse pressure and increased pulse wave velocity may be considered either as simple markers of an underlying vascular disease or as strong cardiovascular risk factors. The solution of this important question requires the development of specific intervention trials.

### Does low diastolic blood pressure contribute to the risk of recurrent hypertensive cardiovascular disease events? The framingham heart study [^113X4tvg]. Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Whether low diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is a risk factor for recurrent cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in persons with isolated systolic hypertension is controversial. We studied 791 individuals (mean age 75 years, 47% female, mean follow-up time: 8 ± 6 years) with DBP < 70 (n = 225) versus 70 to 89 mm Hg (n = 566) after initial CVD events in the original and offspring cohorts of the Framingham Heart Study. Recurrent CVD events occurred in 153 (68%) participants with lower DBP and 271 (48%) with higher DBP (P < 0.0001). Risk of recurrent CVD events in risk factor-adjusted Cox regression was higher in those with DBP < 70 mm Hg versus DBP 70 to 89 mm Hg in both treated (hazard ratio, 5.1 [95% confidence interval: 3.8–6.9] P < 0.0001) and untreated individuals (hazard ratio, 11.7 [95% confidence interval: 6.5–21.1] P < 0.0001; treatment interaction: P = 0.71). Individually, coronary heart disease, heart failure, and stroke recurrent events were more likely with DBP < 70 mm Hg versus 70 to 89 mm Hg (P < 0.0001). To examine for an effect of wide pulse pressure on excess risk associated with low DBP, we defined 4 binary groupings of pulse pressure (≥ 68 versus < 68 mm Hg) and DBP (< 70 versus 70–89 mm Hg). CVD incidence rates were higher only in the group with pulse pressure ≥ 68 and DBP < 70 mm Hg (76% versus 46%-54%; P < 0.001). Persons with isolated systolic hypertension and prior CVD events have increased risk for recurrent CVD events in the presence of DBP < 70 mm Hg versus DBP 70 to 89 mm Hg, whether treated or untreated, supporting wide pulse pressure as an important risk modifier for the adverse effect of low DBP.

### Pulsatile blood pressure component as predictor of mortality in hypertension: a meta-analysis of clinical trial control groups [^112g4NNb]. Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Although current guidelines rest exclusively on the measurement of systolic and diastolic blood pressures, the arterial pressure wave is more precisely described as consisting of a pulsatile (pulse pressure) and a steady (mean pressure) component. This study explored the independent roles of pulse pressure and mean pressure as predictors of mortality in a wide range of patients with hypertension.

Design and Methods

This meta-analysis, based on individual patient data, has combined results from the control groups of seven randomized clinical trials conducted in patients with systolo-diastolic or isolated systolic hypertension. The relative hazard rates associated with pulse pressure and mean pressure were calculated using Cox's proportional hazard regression models with stratification for the seven trials and with adjustment for sex, age, smoking and the other pressure.

Results

A 10 mmHg wider pulse pressure at baseline, which corresponds to approximately one-half of its standard deviation, was independently associated with an increase in risk by 6% for total mortality (P = 0.001), 7% for cardiovascular mortality (P = 0.01), and 7% for fatal coronary accidents (P = 0.03). The corresponding increase in risk of fatal stroke was similar (+6%, P = 0.27) but there were too few strokes to reach statistical significance. In similar analyses, mean pressure was not identified as an independent predictor of these outcomes. Significant interactions of pulse pressure or mean pressure with age suggested that the prognostic power of pulse pressure for fatal stroke was more important at higher age (P = 0.04), whereas the prognostic power of mean pressure for coronary mortality was greatest in the young (P = 0.01).

Conclusions

In hypertensive patients pulse pressure, not mean pressure, is associated with an increased risk of fatal events. This appears to be true in a broad range of patients with hypertension.

### Risk from low blood pressure in frail older adults: diastolic pressure and pulse pressure are important [^116wtt7v]. Age and Ageing (2021). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure measurement with a cuff in patients with stiff arteries can be misleading, with false elevation of the diastolic pressure. Coronary flow, and most of the cerebral blood flow occur during diastole. There is a marked diastolic J curve in patients with diastolic pressure < 60 mmHg and pulse pressure > 60 mmHg. Aiming for a systolic target of 120 mmHg is not safe in some frail older patients.

### Role of vascular adaptation in determining systolic blood pressure in young adults [^116CzTpL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

The most common form of hypertension in young adults is isolated systolic hypertension (ISH). 1, 2, 3 Although often considered an innocuous condition, 4 recent evidence demonstrates that ISH in young to middle‐aged adults is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in later life. 5 Moreover, data from the FHS (Framingham Heart Study) show that elevated pulse pressure (PP), which characterizes ISH, tracks from young adulthood throughout life, and is associated with increased mortality in older adults. 6

The key hemodynamic determinants of PP are stroke volume and aortic stiffness, although in young adults, it is stroke volume rather than aortic stiffness that is predominantly associated with increased PP, particularly in men. 3 However, 2 individuals can have similarly wide PP, but different levels of systolic blood pressure (SBP), suggesting differences in the adaptive or maladaptive responses to high stroke volume. This is important clinically, because it may result in one individual being classified as normotensive and another hypertensive, with the potential for life‐long differences between them in terms of follow‐up BP monitoring and assessment of long‐term risk.

Systolic and diastolic BP values oscillate around mean arterial pressure (MAP), which is determined, physiologically, by cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance (PVR). Therefore, we hypothesized that for a given level of PP, variations in SBP between individuals are related to PVR, and the aim of this study was to test this hypothesis in a large cohort of healthy young adults. In addition, we measured minimum forearm vascular resistance (MFVR) in a random subset of subjects to determine whether structural differences in the resistance vasculature were associated with variations in PVR.

### Longitudinal hemodynamic correlates of and sex differences in the evolution of blood pressure across the adult lifespan: the framingham heart study [^111UDjUs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Systolic blood pressure increases rapidly after midlife in Westernized societies and is associated with increased risk for various adverse health outcomes. Although pulse pressure, the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure, is often ignored in hypertension evaluation and treatment guidelines, marked increases in systolic and pulse pressure after midlife, particularly in women, have created an epidemic of often suboptimally controlled predominant or isolated systolic hypertension, which can be succinctly characterized as wide pulse pressure hypertension. Failure to control wide pulse pressure hypertension may result from failure to recognize the underlying pathophysiology. Many hypertension drugs target peripheral resistance and mean pressure and may be less effective for reducing wide pulse pressure and treating wide pulse pressure hypertension. Therefore, a quantitative understanding of the pathogenesis of the rise in systolic blood pressure starting in midlife is essential.

In addition, recent reports have shown that projected values for change in blood pressure and various related hemodynamic measures based on cross‐sectional associations can differ from longitudinal assessments of change. Discrepancies arise in part from marked nonlinearity of age relations of stiffness measures, which necessitates multiple sequential assessments in order to accurately characterize change. Finally, several studies have shown that systolic and pulse pressure increase more rapidly with age in women after midlife, possibly because of sex differences in modulation of aortic diameter with advancing age. However, many of the foregoing observations on sex‐related differences in age relations of systolic and pulse pressure were based on cross‐sectional studies or limited numbers of longitudinal observations, which may not adequately characterize the complex, nonlinear patterns of change in blood pressure and related hemodynamic measures over time.

We hypothesized that sex differences in diameter‐dependent measures of aortic stiffness, such as characteristic impedance of the aorta (Z c), contribute to the sex differences in age relations and change over time in systolic and pulse pressure. To assess this hypothesis, we perform detailed hemodynamic assessments at 3 points in time over a 14‐year interval in order to assess nonlinearity of and sex differences in change in systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure and aortic stiffness measures in the deeply phenotyped Framingham Heart Study Generation 3, Omni‐2, and New Offspring Spouse cohorts.

### Automated' oscillometric' blood pressure measuring devices: how they work and what they measure [^115ophqR]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Summary of the principles of operation for non-invasive estimation of blood pressure (BP) using a manual auscultatory sphygmomanometer compared with automated BP measurement devices (BPMDs).

a Descriptions provided are generally applicable to automated BPMDs but differences exist between manufacturers and devices.

The clinical value of peripheral BP measurement by sphygmomanometer with respect to hypertension is that it gives an estimation of the pressure load experienced by the central organs that are most susceptible to damage from high BP, especially the heart, brain and kidneys. Importantly, the systolic BP at the central aorta level can be significantly amplified as the pressure pulse is transmitted to the brachial artery with each cardiac contraction. The degree of systolic BP amplification varies markedly between individuals, with examples of this variation using invasively measured human data showing little difference (< 5 mmHg) between the aorta and brachial artery in some people, but large difference (> 30 mmHg) in others. On average, brachial artery systolic BP is 8.0 mmHg (95% confidence interval: 5.9 to 10.1 mmHg) higher than that in the proximal aorta, whereas the diastolic BP varies minimally and is only slightly lower at the brachial artery (−1.0 mmHg; 95% confidence interval: −2.0 to −0.1 mmHg). The wide variability in systolic BP between central and peripheral large arteries naturally raises the question as to what is being measured by a sphygmomanometer at the brachial artery.

As early as in 1951, a committee of the Council for High BP Research of the American Heart Association reported that the sphygmomanometer auscultation method underestimates intra-arterial brachial systolic BP by an average of 3–4 mmHg, but overestimates diastolic BP by an average 8 mmHg. The committee also emphasised the sizable level of scatter, whereby the mean error of the cuff method averaged 8 mmHg from intra-arterial brachial BP for both systolic and diastolic BP. These observations were similar to those of an individual patient level meta-analysis among more than 300 people published in 2017. The consequent results for pulse pressure measured by sphygmomanometer were underestimation by an average of 11 mmHg, and with a mean absolute difference of 11.8 mmHg (95% confidence interval 9.1 to 14.7) indicating wide scatter from intra-arterial measures. These findings were also replicated in a recent pooled meta-analysis.

### Diastolic pressure in type 2 diabetes: can target systolic pressure be reached without "diastolic hypotension"? [^114bByr2]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

The practicality of vigorous lowering of systolic pressure in diabetes to < 130 mmHg remains uncertain. Baseline blood pressure data from several recent trials indicate that, in diabetic subjects, there is nearly a fourfold excess in systolic pressure (the difference between baseline pressure and target pressure) over diastolic pressure with respect to the recommended systolic/diastolic target pressure of < 130/80 mmHg. Additionally, systolic pressure was 2–3 mmHg higher and diastolic pressure was 1–3 mmHg lower in diabetic hypertensive than in nondiabetic hypertensive individuals, which adds approximately 4 mmHg to pulse pressure and also to the difference between the excess systolic and excess diastolic pressure. We attempted to force (titrate both systolic and excess diastolic pressure) systolic and diastolic blood pressure to < 130/85 mmHg based on Joint National Committee VI guidelines in the setting of a clinical practice in 257 diabetic patients. Although target systolic pressure was attained in a third of this cohort, in 57% of the patients, the attained diastolic pressure was ≤ 70 mmHg. Patients with final diastolic pressure < 70 mmHg were older, had a higher prevalence of coronary artery disease, and had higher initial systolic and pulse pressures. Review of achieved blood pressure in studies such as the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) indicates that a significant fraction of the diabetic subjects' diastolic pressure was also driven down to < 70 mmHg or even < 60 mmHg. Thus, attempted lowering of blood pressure to target systolic pressure is associated with inordinate lowering of diastolic pressure in a significant number of patients. Whether the benefits of tight systolic control to < 130 mmHg outweigh the risks of excessive diastolic reduction, especially in older diabetic subjects or diabetic patients with coronary artery disease, remains unresolved.

### Association between pulse pressure and structural brain changes in aging: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies [^112WaWno]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cognitive decline are 2 of the most prevalent chronic conditions and account for a large proportion of morbidity and mortality. Cognitive decline is more prevalent in individuals with CVD and those with risk factors for CVD, and the likelihood of a causal link between CVD and some types of brain aging has long been recognized. Potential mechanisms linking CVD to brain aging and cognitive decline remain poorly understood. Hypertension is a well‐recognized risk factor for both CVD and dementia. Age‐related changes in blood pressure are well characterized with steady components of blood pressure changing minimally in comparison to pulsatile pressure. Pulse pressure (PP), defined as the difference between systolic and diastolic pressure, is closely associated with stiffening of large elastic arteries. Higher pulse pressure leads to increased transmission of pulsatile hemodynamic forces to the microvasculature, which is thought to contribute to structural brain aging and subsequent cognitive decline. As such, PP may be a particularly interesting component of BP to relate to brain structural changes. To gain a better understanding of how PP is associated with different structural changes in the brain, we performed a systematic review of publications investigating the association between PP and structural brain changes that associate with aging from cross‐sectional and longitudinal studies (summarized in Table 1).

### An outcome-driven threshold for pulse pressure amplification [^1152NU3b]. Hypertension Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Over and beyond common risk factors, low PPA defined as a brachial-to-central PP ratio of < 1.3 is a forerunner of cardiovascular and coronary complications and is an underestimated risk factor in women aged from 30 to 60 years. Our study therefore adds to the growing evidence supporting pulse wave analysis for risk stratification in clinical centers where the technology is readily available. If the technology is unavailable, such as for instance in low- and middle-income countries, isolated systolic hypertension can be used as a proxy for PPA, in particular in middle-aged and older individuals. However, an important caveat pertains to adolescents and young adults with isolated systolic hypertension. The risk of a cardiovascular events in such patients is similar to that of age-matched individuals without isolated systolic hypertension and lower than those with combined systolic-diastolic hypertension or isolated diastolic hypertension. Indeed, young adults with isolated systolic hypertension appear to comprise a heterogeneous patients group, including those with increased stroke volume, normal central blood pressure but exaggerated blood pressure amplification from the central to the peripheral arteries, and those with accelerated vascular aging and premature arterial stiffness. In these young patients, assessing arterial stiffness is even more indicated as well as out-of-office blood pressure monitoring to exclude white-coat hypertension.

### Genetically predicted blood pressure across the lifespan: differential effects of mean and pulse pressure on stroke risk [^115qcTvT]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Stroke ranks as the second most common cause of death and the commonest cause of disability worldwide. Hypertension is the leading risk factor for both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke (intracerebral hemorrhage [ICH]), and accounts for half of the population attributable risk worldwide. Blood pressure lowering lies at the core of primary and secondary stroke prevention strategies. We recently showed that high genetically predicted systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) are associated with all major ischemic stroke subtypes (large artery, cardioembolic, small vessel stroke), as well as with deep, but not lobar ICH. While these results support a causal association of elevated blood pressure with the main stroke subtypes, it remains unclear how these associations vary across the lifespan, given the hemodynamic changes that take place as a result of aging.

With older age the large arteries become stiffer, thus leading to an increase in blood pressure pulsatility (pulse pressure [PP]), defined as the difference between SBP and DBP. This is associated with a greater transmission of pulsatile flow into the distal circulation and can lead to damage of end-organ vascular beds including the cerebral circulation. Indeed, in observational studies, higher PP has been associated with risk of cardiovascular disease, including stroke, beyond mean arterial pressure (MAP). – However, observational studies assess only a limited period of the natural history of cardiovascular disease, thus making it difficult to disentangle the dynamic interactions between MAP and PP and their associations with cardiovascular disease. For example, while increasing PP might accelerate vascular pathologies, the reverse might also be true, as, for example, atherosclerotic plaques lead to local arterial stiffening and higher PP. Furthermore, there are no studies that sytematically explored the effects of MAP and PP across different age strata on stroke risk and how effects vary between etiologically defined stroke subtypes. Given the differential efficacy of different antihypertensive drug classes for lowering MAP and PP, it is important to determine these associations to optimize blood pressure lowering approaches for stroke prevention.

### Individual and joint effects of pulse pressure and blood pressure treatment intensity on serious adverse events in the SPRINT trial [^116kVdS1]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The objective of this study was to determine individual and joint effects of pulse pressure and blood pressure treatment intensity on serious adverse events in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial.

Methods

Pulse pressure was calculated by subtracting diastolic blood pressure from systolic blood pressure. Blood pressure treatment intensity goal was ≤ 140mm Hg in the control arm and ≤ 120mm Hg in the intensive arm. The primary outcome was a 5-point composite of hypotension, syncope, electrolyte abnormalities, acute renal insufficiency, or injurious falls.

Results

In 9361 trial participants, the incident rate for the primary outcome per 1000 person-years increased with higher pulse pressure category: ≤ 49 mmHg: 20.4 (17.2–24.1), 50–59 mmHg: 24.5 (21.3–28.2), 60–69 mmHg: 31.7 (27.7–36.2), ≥ 70 mmHg: 44.6 (39.8–49.9; P trend < .0001; hazard ratio [HR] of pulse pressure [every 10mm Hg] 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.18–1.28). The intensive treatment arm had a higher incidence rate of serious adverse events than the control arm (34.2, 95% CI, 31.2–37.3, vs 26.0, 95% CI, 23.4–28.8, P = 0.0001; HR 1.32; 95% CI, 1.15–1.51). The combined effect was not significant in the relative risk scale (HR 0.97, P interaction = .48) but was significant in the risk difference scale (P = 0.027), contributing 2.5 additional serious adverse events per 1000 person-years for every 10mm Hg increase in pulse pressure in excess of the individual effects of pulse pressure and treatment intensity.

Conclusions

Wider pulse pressure and intensive blood pressure treatment were individually associated with the composite adverse event outcome. A modest effect modification of pulse pressure and treatment intensity led to additional adverse events when both were present. Clinicians should use caution when treating older patients with elevated pulse pressure to an intensive blood pressure treatment target.

### The shape of the blood pressure curve and genetic hypertension [^117CVu4H]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Peak systolic pressure and end-diastolic pressure are two specific points of the blood pressure curve that are widely used and generally accepted to define hypertensive vascular disease. If the goal of research in hypertension, however, is to define high blood pressure as a mechanical signal related to cardiovascular risk through alterations of the arterial wall, then the totality of the blood pressure curve should be analyzed in detail. Fourier analysis indicates that the blood pressure curve may be divided into two components, a steady component, mean arterial pressure, and a pulsatile component, pulse pressure. For a given cardiac performance, the former is related to the caliber of small arteries and the latter to the mechanical properties of the large arteries. Whereas mean arterial pressure is practically unmodified along the arterial tree, pulse pressure increases markedly, owing to the progressive increase in pulse wave velocity and to the summation of forward and backward waves. This hemodynamic pattern is substantially modified with age, leading to various shapes and phenotypes of the blood pressure curve at any given value of mean arterial pressure. Such findings provide evidence that (a) the totality of the aortic blood pressure curve should be recorded in detail for genetic studies in experimental and human hypertension, and (b) the various phenotypic aspects of the blood pressure curve might influence the choice of the genetic markers that are used to study hypertensive vascular disease.

### Hemodynamic characterization of primary hypertension in children and adolescents [^111B94t5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is one of the most important global public health problems, but its etiology, particularly in children, is still poorly understood. In children and young adults, hypertension often takes the form of isolated systolic hypertension with a wide pulse pressure. 1 High pulse pressure is also observed in old age, where it has been attributed to stiffening of large elastic arteries limiting the cushioning of blood ejected by the left ventricle by the arterial tree and possibly other hemodynamic effects. 2 Arterial stiffening is well recognized as part of an age‐related degenerative process. 3 In children, a degenerative process seems unlikely, but other mechanisms of arterial stiffening could occur and there may be other causes of increased pulse pressure, such as an increase in ventricular ejection or increased pressure wave reflection.

The aim of the present study was to characterize central arterial hemodynamics and investigate the mechanisms of primary hypertension in children and adolescents, specifically to examine the contributions of cardiac (left ventricular [LV] ejection velocities and volumes) and vascular (systemic vascular resistance, arterial stiffness, and pressure wave reflection) properties to hypertension.

### Evaluation of optimal diastolic blood pressure range among adults with treated systolic blood pressure less than 130 mm Hg [^11521VcP]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the safe and optimal diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ranges among adults with treated systolic blood pressure (SBP) of less than 130 mm Hg?

Findings

In this cohort study of 7515 patients from 2 randomized clinical trials who had treated SBP of less than 130 mm Hg, a DBP of less than 60 mm Hg was associated with increased cardiovascular risk and a DBP between 70 and 80 mm Hg was associated with lower cardiovascular risk.

Meaning

The findings suggest that a DBP of less than 60 mm Hg may be harmful and a DBP between 70 and 80 mm Hg is an optimal target for patients with treated SBP of less than 130 mm Hg; this topic merits further study.

### Association between neighbourhood deprivation and hypertension in a US-wide cohort [^111gySsJ]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is the most common risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, including ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke and heart disease, and is a leading risk factor for disability. It is predicted that there will be 1.56 billion adults with hypertension in 2025. Hypertension is defined as high systolic blood pressure (SBP) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Blood pressure includes a pulsatile component, pulse pressure and a steady component, mean arterial pressure. Widening pulse pressure and elevated mean arterial pressure are also predictors of cardiovascular disease.

Individual socioeconomic status (SES), commonly estimated by factors such as income level and educational attainment, may influence hypertension risk. Lower levels of educational attainment and household income have been shown to be related to higher prevalence of hypertension and higher mean blood pressure. The prevalence of hypertension varies greatly across racial/ethnic groups, with a higher prevalence among persons characterised as non-Hispanic Black (40.3%) than among those characterised as non-Hispanic White (27.8%) or Hispanic/Latino (27.8%), which may be due in large part to differential frequencies of known environmental and social risk factors.

Neighbourhood environment could also contribute to health disparities by SES and race/ethnicity due to a legacy of residential segregation due to historical and structural racism in the United States. Recently, the US Department of Health and Human Services released a report suggesting that neighbourhood-level strategies are needed to help prevent and control hypertension. Some epidemiological studies show that people living in neighbourhoods with low SES have a higher risk of hypertension and higher blood pressure, but more research is needed, including investigations of how the impact of neighbourhood conditions on health can be modified by individual SES or race/ethnicity.

In this study, we evaluated two main hypotheses. The first was that women living in more deprived neighbourhoods would have a higher risk of hypertension. The second was that the relationship between neighbourhood deprivation and hypertension would differ according to individual factors such as race/ethnicity and SES.

### Isolated diastolic hypertension and risk of cardiovascular disease: controversies in hypertension-pro side of the argument [^112nQ9cC]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH), defined as diastolic blood pressure in the hypertensive range but systolic blood pressure not in the hypertensive range, is not uncommon (< 20%) among adults with hypertension. IDH often manifests in concurrence with other cardiovascular risk factors. Individuals with IDH tend to have lower awareness of their hypertension compared with those with both systolic and diastolic hypertension. IDH appears to be a largely underrated risk factor for cardiovascular disease events, which may be explained by inconsistent association of IDH with cardiovascular disease events. The inconsistency suggests that IDH is heterogeneous. One size does not seem to fit all in the clinical management of individuals with IDH. Rather than treating IDH as a monolithic low-risk condition, detailed phenotyping in the context of individual comprehensive cardiovascular risk would seem to be most useful to assess an individual's expected net benefit from therapy. In this review, we highlight that the clinical relevance of IDH differs by individual clinical characteristics, and elucidate groups of individuals with IDH that should be wary of cardiovascular disease risks.

### Effects of olmesartan medoxomil on systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure in the management of hypertension [^111z7rsp]. American Journal of Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Background

In this analysis, we evaluated the efficacy of the angiotensin II receptor blocker olmesartan medoxomil in reducing systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure (PP) in hypertensive patients.

Methods

Data from seven randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, 6- to 12-week efficacy trials of olmesartan 20 mg and 40 mg/day were analyzed to determine changes in trough seated SBP and PP within three cohorts: 1) total cohort (n = 1777); 2) subjects with a wide PP: that is, those with a baseline PP > 55 mm Hg (n = 917); and 3) a subpopulation of patients with a wide PP and age ≥ 65 years (n = 296). Statistical comparisons used least squares mean values.

Results

In the total cohort, olmesartan 20 and 40 mg/day resulted in mean reductions in SBP of 15.1 and 17.6 mm Hg, respectively (P < .001 v placebo). In the wide PP cohort, olmesartan resulted in mean reductions in SBP of 17.7 and 22.0 mm Hg and mean reductions in PP of 7.4 Hg and 8.8 mm Hg for the groups receiving 20 and 40 mg/day, respectively (P < .001 v placebo). In the cohort with wide PP and age ≥ 65 years, olmesartan 20 and 40 mg/day produced mean reductions in SBP of 21.8 and 22.5 mm Hg, and PP of 6.7 and 7.6 mm Hg, respectively (P < .05 v placebo).

Conclusions

Olmesartan significantly reduces SBP and PP, and these reductions are more pronounced in patients with a wide baseline PP. In patients with a wide baseline PP and age ≥ 65 years, the population at greatest risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, olmesartan reduces PP to an extent similar to that in patients < 65 years of age.

### The highs and lows of blood pressure: toward meaningful clinical targets in patients with shock [^113DicpQ]. Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" for COVID-19 infection, preeclampsia, perioperative bleeding, perioperative cardiac risk management for noncardiac surgery, thoracic aortic dissection, brain death, cardiac arrest, cervical spine injury, traumatic brain injury, traumatic hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, acute ischemic stroke, hepatorenal syndrome, liver cirrhosis, acute liver failure, acute kidney injury, cardiogenic shock and sepsis and septic shock.

MAP calculates average arterial pressure during a cardiac cycle using systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

In the context of assessing circulatory health, the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) calculator is a tool that processes two main inputs: systolic and diastolic blood pressures. These inputs are measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), adhering to certain acceptable ranges for accuracy and safety — systolic values between 60 and 300 mmHg and diastolic values from 20 to 180 mmHg.

The calculation of MAP provides a crucial insight into the perfusion pressure experienced by vital organs, relying on a straightforward formula:

MAP = diastolic blood pressure + one-third of the pulse pressure (where pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic pressures).

This equation highlights that diastolic pressure, representing the longer-lasting phase of the cardiac cycle, exerts more influence in the calculation than systolic pressure. The resultant MAP, expressed in mmHg and ranging logically from 0 to 200 mmHg, signifies the average driving force of blood through the systemic circulation in a single cardiac cycle.

Understanding MAP values is essential in clinical environments:

- A MAP between 70 and 100 mmHg is typically ideal, suggesting optimal organ perfusion.
- MAP values falling below 60 mmHg may indicate potential risk for organ under-perfusion, a critical concern in intensive care settings.
- MAP exceeding 100 mmHg often points toward possible hypertension or other cardiovascular anomalies, necessitating further evaluation.

This calculated MAP value provides invaluable information used widely in clinical practice for observing and managing patients' blood pressure, aiding in the maintenance of proper organ function and overall cardiovascular health.

### Blood pressure measurement and assessment of arterial structure and function: an expert group position paper [^116NqdwP]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Reduction strategies of BP, as a modifiable cardiovascular risk, are currently based on office assessment of brachial artery BP. However, antihypertensive treatment based on brachial BP values reduces cardiovascular risk but does not completely reverse the hypertension-induced risk of morbidity events. The potential effects beyond peripheral BP control may be due to specific protective properties of different antihypertensive drugs to affect central aortic pressure and arterial stiffness. Indeed, much work has focused on central pressure as a better predictor of hypertension-related end-organ damage, CV events, and CV mortality. Currently, with the simple assessment of brachial BP and without considering the effects that central pressure has on CV events, we may be treating or over-treating subjects who may not require treatment and not treating subjects who should be treated. Moreover, these findings highlight the need for the identification of specific populations that might benefit more from the central BP assessment and provide the basis for further investigations. Clinical trials with hard endpoints and designed based on central and peripheral BP assessment are now required to confirm current data and to provide evidence that treatment guidance based on measurements of central BP result in better outcomes. Consequently, this might pave the way for the consideration to enter central BP assessment in the clinical management of hypertension. Nevertheless, such clinical trials are still lacking also because they are very difficult to set up. Furthermore, intercolinearity between the different BP parameters will make their interpretation weak and subject to caution (will the clinical benefit be related to the decrease of such or such BP parameter?). Therefore, more evidence is needed before stating that basing antihypertensive treatment guidance on central pressures rather than on peripheral BP could be one of the factors to be considered for future antihypertensive strategies (Table 5).

TABLE 5
Advantages, limitations, and thresholds values of central blood pressure

Because of the inconsistency of some diagnostic and prognostic data and the absence of clear cut-off values to differentiate normal from high CBP in the wider population, the widespread use of central BP measurement in the clinical management of hypertension cannot be recommended. An interesting field of application in clinic may be isolated systolic hypertension in the young in which peripheral BP may be disproportionately elevated compared with normal central BP (Table 5).

On the other hand, in research, the use of central pressure and other parameters such as augmentation index, and wave reflections indices, derived from pulse wave analysis helps to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of many diseases, as well as some of their treatments. Therefore, for the present time, measurement of CBP is essentially reserved for clinical research and specialized centers.

### Noninvasive assessment of arterial stiffness should discriminate between systolic and diastolic pressure ranges [^112eJutj]. Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Arterial stiffening plays an important role in the development of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. The intrinsically nonlinear (ie, pressure-dependent) elastic behavior of arteries may have serious consequences for the accuracy and interpretation of arterial stiffness measurements and, ultimately, for individual patient management. We determined aortic pressure and common carotid artery diameter waveforms in 21 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. The individual pressure-area curves were described using a dual exponential analytic model facilitating noise-free calculation of incremental pulse wave velocity. In addition, compliance coefficients were calculated separately in the diastolic and systolic pressure ranges, only using diastolic, dicrotic notch, and systolic data points, which can be determined noninvasively. Pulse wave velocity at systolic pressure exhibited a much stronger positive correlation with pulse pressure (P < 0.001) and age (P = 0.012) than pulse wave velocity at diastolic pressure. Patients with an elevated systolic blood pressure (> 140 mm Hg) had a 2.5-times lower compliance coefficient in the systolic pressure range than patients with systolic blood pressures < 140 mm Hg (P = 0.002). Most importantly, some individuals, with comparable age or pulse pressure, had similar diastolic but discriminately different systolic pulse wave velocities and compliance coefficients. We conclude that noninvasive assessment of arterial stiffness could and should discriminate between systolic and diastolic pressure ranges to more precisely characterize arterial function in individual patients.

### Facts and fallacies of blood pressure control in recent trials: implications in the management of patients with hypertension [^111VYeZ5]. Journal of Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

A large body of clinical trial data indicates that a given difference in blood pressure (BP), as measured in the clinic, results in a given difference in outcome. This correlation underpins current US and European guidelines for the management of hypertension. However, findings from recent comparative trials may appear inconsistent with a fixed relationship between BP lowering and outcome benefit, at least at all BP ranges, at all levels of total cardiovascular risk and with all drug combinations. We review the findings of six of these recent trials and conclude that their complex design precludes a simple interpretation, that several important questions remain unanswered and that direct evidence - particularly in support of lowering systolic BP below 140 or 130 mmHg - is urgently needed.

### Hyperdynamic circulation distinguishes predominantly diastolic hypertension from predominantly systolic hypertension [^1139yAqv]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is the most common cardiovascular disorder worldwide, while cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. The pathophysiology of primary hypertension is multifactorial, involving genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Together, these factors influence cardiovascular regulatory systems, leading to chronically elevated blood pressure (BP) and an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity.

The primary hemodynamic determinants of BP are cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance. Additionally, large arterial stiffness plays a key role in determining systolic BP and pulse pressure. Traditionally, hypertension is classified into systolic-diastolic hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension, and isolated diastolic hypertension. The hemodynamic profiles underlying these phenotypes are often simplified as follows: isolated systolic hypertension is associated with increased large arterial stiffness and elevated cardiac output, whereas isolated diastolic hypertension is linked to high systemic vascular resistance. However, recent findings from a large cohort study of 33,414 participants suggest that these phenotypes exhibit heterogeneous hemodynamic profiles. Overall, various combinations of cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance can contribute to elevated BP across all hypertensive categories.

We have previously used the orthostatic challenge to assess the functional hemodynamics of hypertension. Postural changes alter autonomic nervous tone, systemic vascular resistance, and overall hemodynamics. Although BP is conventionally measured in the seated or supine position, daily human activities primarily occur in the upright position. Additionally, BP hyperreactivity to standing has been reported to be an independent predictor of adverse cardiovascular events.

Assessing the hemodynamic patterns underlying hypertension phenotypes may have future clinical implications, such as aiding in the personalization of treatment strategies. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the hemodynamic patterns of predominantly systolic hypertension (PSH) and predominantly diastolic hypertension (PDH) by evaluating hemodynamic variables during passive head-up tilt (HUT).

### Impact of pre-procedural blood pressure on long-term outcomes following percutaneous coronary intervention [^116FTDFA]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

High systolic blood pressure (SBP) increases cardiac afterload, whereas low diastolic blood pressure (DBP) may lead to impaired coronary perfusion. Thus, wide pulse pressure (high systolic, low diastolic [HSLD]) may contribute to myocardial ischemia and also be a predictor of adverse cardiovascular events.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between pre-procedural blood pressure and long-term outcome following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Methods

The study included 10,876 consecutive patients between August 2009 and December 2016 from the Melbourne Interventional Group registry undergoing PCI with pre-procedural blood pressure recorded. Patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were excluded. Patients were divided into 4 groups according to SBP (high ≥ 120 mm Hg, low < 120 mm Hg) and DBP (high > 70 mm Hg, low ≤ 70 mm Hg).

Results

Mean pulse pressure was 60 ± 21 mm Hg. Patients with HSLD were older and more frequently women, with higher rates of hypercholesterolemia, renal impairment, diabetes, and multivessel and left main disease (all p ≤ 0.0001). There was no difference in 30-day major adverse cardiac events, but at 12 months the HSLD group had a greater incidence of myocardial infarction (p = 0.018) and stroke (p = 0.013). Long-term mortality was highest for HSLD (7.9%) and lowest for low systolic, high diastolic (narrow pulse pressure) at 2.1% (p = 0.0002). Cox regression analysis demonstrated significantly lower long-term mortality in the low systolic, high diastolic cohort (hazard ratio: 0.50; 99% confidence interval: 0.25 to 0.98; p = 0.04).

Conclusions

Pulse pressure at the time of index PCI is associated with long-term outcomes following PCI. A wide pulse pressure may serve as a surrogate marker for risk following PCI and represents a potential target for future therapies.

### Debate on the 2025 guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults: emphasis on defense against the BP threshold and why we may not get there easily [^114J7Li3]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated blood pressure (BP) is the most important noncommunicable disorder worldwide. Finding and effectively managing elevated BP is the single greatest public health benefit we can accomplish, as it will reduce premature death and enable patients to live longer free of the disabilities that target organ damage inflicts on the brain, heart, kidneys, and legs. Hypertension guidelines are an invaluable source of information on how to detect elevated BP, how to evaluate people for situations where hypertension is a symptom of other disorders, and how to apply the various treatments that lower BP effectively in patients. Determining the point at which treating high BP is more likely to result in benefit than harm is a marriage of science and art. There is no right answer to what clearly constitutes hypertension when using a systolic or diastolic BP to define it. The science shows the mathematics behind the reduction of BP and the number of lives saved and target organs preserved. The art comes into play when a decision is made that, when a systolic or diastolic BP exceeds a certain level, it becomes reasonable to intervene at that point with treatment. Caregivers play an important role in monitoring and educating patients with hypertension-especially in the detection of unintended effects of treatment, such as excessive BP lowering, symptomatic hypotension, and impacts on laboratory tests and well-being. Nonadherence to prescribed therapies is a barrier to effectively managing chronic disorders like hypertension. Having a solid foundation in the science behind the guidelines and recognizing that the application of guidelines requires some clinical judgment gleaned from balancing the risks and benefits of treatment in each individual patient, is the basis for healthy exchanges of ideas, like this pro and con series which discusses the science and furthers the art. This review has taken the con side of several issues in the latest American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2025 Hypertension Guidelines.

### Pulse pressure and risk of cardiovascular events in the systolic hypertension in the elderly program [^117YNANo]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Pulse pressure has been related to higher risk of cardiovascular events in older persons. Isolated systolic hypertension is common among the elderly and is accompanied by elevated pulse pressure. Treatment of isolated systolic hypertension may further increase pulse pressure if diastolic pressure is lowered to a greater extent than systolic pressure. Little is known regarding pulse pressure as a predictor of cardiovascular outcomes in elderly persons with isolated systolic hypertension, and the influence of treatment on the pulse pressure effect. We assessed the relation between pulse pressure, measured throughout the follow-up period, and the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure (HF), and stroke in 4,632 participants in the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program, a 5-year randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of treatment of isolated systolic hypertension in older adults. In the treatment group, a 10-mm Hg increase in pulse pressure was associated with a statistically significant 32% increase in risk of HF and a 24% increase in risk of stroke after controlling for systolic blood pressure and other known risk factors, as well as with a 23% increase in risk of HF and a 19% increase in risk of stroke after controlling for diastolic blood pressure and other risk factors. Pulse pressure was not significantly associated with HF or stroke in the placebo group, nor with incidence of CHD in either the placebo or treatment group. These results suggest that pulse pressure is a useful marker of risk for HF and stroke among older adults being treated for isolated systolic hypertension.

### Under pressure: the search for the essential mechanisms of hypertension [^1141NRnX]. Nature Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a very common disorder with a substantial impact on public health because of its associated complications. Despite the high prevalence of essential hypertension and years of research, the basic causes remain obscure. Here I review recent advances in understanding the pathophysiology of hypertension. I present a general overview of the field and, by necessity, use broad strokes to portray recent progress and place it in context. For this purpose, I use illustrative examples from the large number of important developments in hypertension research over the last five years. The intent of this review is to provide a sense of where the field is progressing, with an emphasis on work that sheds light on pathogenic mechanisms and that is therefore likely to inform new translational advances.

### May measurement month 2022: results from the global blood pressure screening campaign [^114yr59n]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Associations

Small differences in BP were observed between those with a history of certain cardiovascular or metabolic conditions and those without (figure 2). Participants with a diagnosed history of irregular heartbeat had significantly lower systolic but not diastolic BP, those with diabetes had significantly higher systolic but significantly lower diastolic BP, those with a history of stroke had significantly higher systolic and diastolic BP and those with a history of myocardial infarction had lower diastolic BP. No significant difference in BP between those with and without a diagnosis of heart failure was observed.

Estimates are derived from linear mixed models adjusted for age, sex and antihypertensive medication use. Error bars represent 95% CIs. Corresponding estimates can be found in online supplemental appendix table S13.

Of 257 521 participants with hypertension, one-third (33.8%) had either diabetes or were in the top weight quartile (≥ 78 kg) (online supplemental appendix figure S2). Half of participants (50.8%) in the top quartile of weight were hypertensive. Over half (65.9%) of the 47 914 participants with diabetes were hypertensive, 31.1% of whom were also in the top quartile of weight.

Average diastolic BP showed a continuous graded increase with increasing pulse rate values (figure 3). In contrast, systolic BP decreased as average pulse rate rose from < 60 to 70 beats per minute (BPM) but thereafter only increased with pulse rates > 90 BPM (figure 3). This relationship was not affected by stratification by antihypertensive medication use (online supplemental appendix figure S3).

Associations between other participant characteristics and average systolic or diastolic BP were in line with previously reported findings from other MMM campaigns (online supplemental appendix tables S12–19).

### Is high pulse pressure a marker of preclinical cardiovascular disease? [^113NUe2g]. Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

This study tests the hypothesis that high brachial pulse pressure might constitute preclinical cardiovascular disease, rather than a risk factor. We studied 1250 subjects (472 nonobese normotensive [< 135/80 mm Hg] and 778 untreated hypertensive). Central pulse pressure was estimated from brachial pulse pressure and age and divided by stroke volume (PP/SV). Brachial pulse pressure was considered high when > 63 mm Hg, and peripheral resistance high when > 90th percentile of normal distribution. Among hypertensive subjects, 34% had high resistance; among them, 33% had high brachial pulse pressure, as opposed to 147 of 516 patients (28.5%) with normal resistance (P = not significant). After adjusting for age, sex, race, body mass index, heart rate, and center, left ventricular (LV) internal dimension and mass were lower with high resistance, and higher when brachial pulse pressure was high. PP/SV was 36% higher with high resistance than with normal resistance, and higher when brachial pulse pressure was high (all P < 0.0001). Factorial analysis demonstrated that associations of high brachial pulse pressure with both higher PP/SV and LV mass were independent of other pressure components. Thus, because of these associations, our hypothesis is that in hypertension, pulse pressure may be considered as a marker of preclinical cardiovascular disease, similar to LV mass and PP/SV, rather than a cardiovascular risk factor.

### How low can you go? Achieved blood pressure and cardiovascular outcomes [^112GyNqV]. Kidney International (2017). Low credibility.

The benefits of controlling blood pressure to levels < 140/90 mm Hg are well established, but the risks and benefits of further reductions in blood pressure are less clear. A recent observational study using pooled data from 2 large randomized trials of renin-angiotensin system blockers suggested no added benefit and some increased risk of cardiovascular events with achieved blood pressures < 120 mm Hg systolic or 70 mm Hg diastolic. Caveats of observational studies notwithstanding, these results add to the ongoing controversy over the optimal blood pressure target for high-risk individuals.

### Indomethacin-induced early patent ductus arteriosus closure cannot be predicted by a decrease in pulse pressure [^1126S9os]. American Journal of Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

Wide pulse pressure is considered to be a sign of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). We tested the hypothesis that, following indomethacin therapy, PDA closure is associated with a significant decrease in pulse pressure. Thirty-two ventilated preterm infants were echocardiographically diagnosed within the first 24 hours of life with PDA. Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressures were measured prior to indomethacin treatment and after echocardiographically confirmed PDA closure. Following PDA closure, systolic and diastolic blood pressures and mean arterial pressure increased significantly without a significant change of pulse pressure (17 ± 7 to 20 ± 12 torr). We conclude that in preterm infants with PDA, systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressures increase significantly within first few days of life. Pulse pressure does not appear to be affected by early PDA closure. We speculate that high pulmonary resistance in the first days of life prevents significant diastolic aortic runoff and leaves pulse pressure unaffected by PDA, as well as by its closure.

### Blood pressure gradients in cerebral arteries: a clue to pathogenesis of cerebral small vessel disease [^115H1kmL]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Wardlaw's groupreported that lacunar infarctions in the vascular centrencephalon were more likely to be symptomatic than small subcortical WMI over the convexity; it is possible that in SPRINT, lower blood diastolic pressures may have prevented hypertensive strokes, while an increase in subcortical WMI may have gone undetected.

However, if WMI over the convexity and periventricular WMI are due to other forms of small vessel disease, then different approaches will be needed to prevent them.

Wardlaw's groupfound that a wide pulse pressure (which lowers diastolic pressure, for a given MAP) was particularly a risk factor for small subcortical WMI over the convexity. Webb et al reportedthat arterial stiffness and increased pulsatility in the middle cerebral artery were associated with leucoaraiosis. In the setting of arterial stiffness with a wide pulse pressure, treatment to lower the blood pressure may reduce the diastolic blood pressure excessively, particularly when drugs that slow the heart rate (thus widening pulse pressure) are used. False elevation of the cuff blood pressure by stiff arteriesmay account for the observed J curve with low blood pressure in the elderly.

Factors such as amyloid angiopathy in small cortical arterioles, or other pathophysiological mechanisms, by impairing cerebral vascular reactivity and thus cerebral blood flow autoregulation, might aggravate ischaemia due to low diastolic pressure in small convexity arterioles. An example of this is the 'earthen pipe' phenomenon in CADASIL.

### Prevalence, predictors, progression, and prognosis of hypertension subtypes in the framingham heart study [^115xga8Q]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is prevalent in nearly half of US adults and contributes to ≈96 000 deaths annually. Despite the established benefits of blood pressure (BP) lowering on the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), rates of hypertension control have been declining recently, underscoring the importance of better management of hypertension to mitigate associated vascular risk.

A recent commentaryemphasized that subphenotyping hypertension may delineate pathophysiological subsets that could be targeted with greater precision, presumably resulting in better BP control. Yet, current guidelines, approach "essential" hypertension as a uniform condition rather than as a constellation of potentially heterogeneous subphenotypes that may vary in their prevalence, temporal course, and prognosis. A potential framework for subphenotyping hypertension leverages the differential elevations of systolic BP (SBP) versus diastolic BP (DBP). SBP rises and DBP falls with aging beyond the sixth decade of life, resulting in isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) when select thresholds of SBP are exceeded but DBP remains in the normal range. The ISH phenotype has been attributed to arterial stiffening and is associated with most hypertension treatment failures in the elderly. Additional hypertension subtypes are characterized by sole elevation of DBP (isolated diastolic hypertension [IDH]) or conjoint elevations of SBP and DBP (systolic‐diastolic hypertension [SDH]).

Information regarding the epidemiology of hypertension subtypes in the current era is limited, with previous reports using BP data gathered several decades ago. Such contemporary data might be important given the rising burden of obesity and diabetes over the past 3 decades, increased awareness of and screening for high BP, and the changes over time in the BP thresholds defining hypertension among serial national guidelines. Accordingly, we characterized the prevalence, predictors, progression, and prognosis of hypertension subtypes in a large, ambulatory, community‐based sample spanning a wide age range, which was followed up over the past 3 decades.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^1141vvfK]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — blood pressure measurement and pulse assessment recommendations state that out-of-office blood pressure by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) or home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) is specifically recommended for a number of clinical indications, it is recommended that all hypertensive patients undergo pulse palpation at rest to determine heart rate and search for arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation (AF), and other blood pressure measures and indices (pulse pressure, BP variability, exercise BP, and central BP) may be considered but are not often used for routine clinical use at present.

### Phenotypes of hypertension: impact of age and sex on hemodynamic mechanisms [^117PrqjH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Essential hypertension is often treated as a uniform condition. However, it encompasses distinct patterns of blood pressure elevation such as isolated systolic, systolic diastolic, and isolated diastolic hypertension, which vary in prevalence according to age and sex. We hypothesized that different hemodynamic mechanisms account for the age- and sex-related differences in these hypertensive phenotypes.

Methods

In this cross-sectional analysis of the ACCT (Anglo-Cardiff Collaborative Trial), 5371 individuals (2402 male), aged 18 to 92years, free of cardiovascular disease and medication were included. Blood pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume, peripheral vascular resistance (PVR), and aortic pulse wave velocity were measured. Within each sex, subjects were stratified according to age (< 30, 30–60, and > 60years), and blood pressure phenotype based on clinic (seated) blood pressure.

Results

Isolated systolic hypertension was the most common hypertensive phenotype in young men and characterized by an elevated cardiac output and stroke volume. In contrast, systolic diastolic hypertension and isolated diastolic hypertension were more common in younger females, with systolic diastolic hypertension associated with elevated PVR and aortic pulse wave velocity, and isolated diastolic hypertension with increased PVR. Systolic diastolic hypertension was the most common phenotype in middle age and accompanied by increased PVR in both sexes. Isolated systolic hypertension was again the most common phenotype in older individuals. However, in contrast to younger adults, isolated systolic hypertension affected both men and women equally (~1:1) and was characterized by elevated aortic pulse wave velocity and PVR.

Conclusions

Different hypertensive phenotypes are characterized by distinct hemodynamic mechanisms in an age- and sex-dependent manner. Targeting therapy toward primary hemodynamic abnormalities could lead to more effective interventions in essential hypertension.

### Furosemide to lower antenatal severe hypertension: a randomized placebo-controlled trial [^111oNSfU]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a leading cause of perinatal morbidity, and timely treatment of severely elevated blood pressure is recommended to prevent serious sequelae. In acute hypertension marked by increased blood volume, it is unknown whether diuretics used as an adjunct to antihypertensive medications lead to more effective blood pressure control.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate whether the addition of intravenous furosemide to first-line antihypertensive agents reduces systolic blood pressure in acute-onset, severe antenatal hypertension with wide (≥ 60 mm Hg) pulse pressure.

Study Design

In this double-blinded randomized trial, participants received 40 mg of intravenous furosemide or placebo in addition to a first-line antihypertensive agent. The primary outcome was mean systolic blood pressure during the first hour after intervention. Secondary outcomes included corresponding diastolic blood pressure; systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse pressure at 2 hours after intervention; total reduction from qualifying blood pressure; duration of blood pressure control; need for additional antihypertensive doses within 1 hour; and electrolytes and urine output. A sample size of 35 participants per group was planned to detect a 15-mm Hg difference in blood pressure.

Results

Between January 2021 and March 2022, 65 individuals were randomized: 33 to furosemide and 32 to placebo. Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups. There was no difference in the primary outcome of mean 1-hour systolic blood pressure (147 [14.8] vs 152 [13.8] mm Hg; p = 0.200). We found a reduction in 2-hour systolic blood pressure (139 [18.5] vs 154 [18.4] mm Hg; p = 0.007) and a decrease in 2-hour pulse pressure (55 [12.5] vs 67 [15.1]; p = 0.003) in the furosemide group. Subgroup analysis according to hypertension type showed a significant reduction in 2-hour systolic blood pressure and 2-hour pulse pressure among patients with new-onset hypertension, but not among those with preexisting hypertension. Urine output was greater in the furosemide group, with no difference in electrolytes and creatinine before and after intervention.

Conclusion

Intravenous furosemide in conjunction with a first-line antihypertensive agent did not significantly reduce systolic blood pressure in the first hour after administration. However, both systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure at 2 hours were decreased in the furosemide group. These findings suggest that a 1-time dose of intravenous furosemide is a reasonable adjunct to achieve blood pressure control, particularly in patients in whom increased volume is suspected.

The Effect of systolic and diastolic blood pressure on cardiovascular outcomes

High SBP and DBP associate with increased CV events. However, it remained unclear whether either SBP or DBP carries more prognostic information. This question was addressed in a study, which evaluated data from an integrated health care delivery system in the US. Between 2007 and 2016, more than 36 million office BP measurements were analyzed from around 1.3 million people. The study confirmed that both SBP and DBP increased the risk of CV events such as myocardial infarction and stroke. A continuous burden of SBP (≥ 140 mmHg; hazard ratio (HR) per unit increase in z score, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.17 to 1.18) and DBP (≥ 90 mmHg; HR per unit increase in z score, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.07) independently predicted the composite outcome. A J-curve relationship between DBP and the composite outcome was detected. Elevated SBP had a greater prognostic effect on stroke and myocardial infarction (Fig. 1). However, DBP influenced the prognosis independently of SBP.

Fig. 1
The effect of systolic and diastolic blood pressure on cardiovascular outcomes.

The relationship between systolic blood pressure (solid line) and diastolic blood pressure (dashed line) z scores and the risk of the composite outcome among participants with systolic blood pressure > 133 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure > 78 mmHg are shown.

The 2017 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association Guidelines on the management of hypertension revised the definition of hypertension, which has been defined as > 130/ > 80 mmHg. Contrary, in the 2018 European Guidelines, the definition remained unchanged (> 140/ > 90 mmHg). Against this background, the prevalence of hypertension according to the different definition criteria were analyzed. The prevalence of hypertension increased from 18.9% with a threshold of > 140/90 mmHg to 43.5% with > 130/80 mmHg. An SBP of > 130 mmHg was present in almost 50% of the participants over the age of 60 years (Fig. 2).

### Targets for body fat, blood pressure, lipids, and glucose-lowering interventions in healthy older people [^114PJ9MS]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Blood pressure control in healthy older subjects

Meta-analyses of data collected over the past 20 years from several randomized clinical trials have conclusively shown that antihypertensive drugs are effective in reducing fatal and nonfatal CV events in hypertensive patients of all ages including the elderly. The beneficial effects of treatment, particularly on CV morbidity, have recently been documented also in patients ≥ 80 years of age recruited for the HYpertension in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET) and in the1-year open-label treatment extension substudy of the same trial. The benefits of treatment were detectable with the different drug classes recommended by the latest guidelines for the management of hypertension in the general population and in the elderly as well. These benefits were detectable in both systodiastolic and isolated systolic hypertensive states, i.e. in a high cardiovascular risk condition typical of elderly people characterized by an elevated pulse pressure value. We can conclude that the BP-lowering effects of antihypertensive treatment are associated with a reduction in CV events in aged hypertensive patients as well. These beneficial effects can be detected independently for both of the classes of drug(s) used to reduce BP, and they are recommended for the systolic or systodiastolic type of elevated BP.

Despite the evidence collected over the years on the beneficial effects of high BP treatment in the old population, two major issues related to the BP-lowering intervention in the old and very old hypertensive patients are still unresolved. The first issue is the lower limit for initiating antihypertensive therapy and the second issue is defining the BP goal to be achieved during treatment. These two issues will be separately addressed in the following paragraphs.

### Interethnic analyses of blood pressure loci in populations of east Asian and European descent [^116yKzFu]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

High blood pressure is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disorders such as coronary heart disease and stroke. Approximately 10 million deaths each year can be attributed to high blood pressure globally. An individual's risk for high blood pressure is determined by genetic, environmental and demographic factors and their interaction. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and/or large-scale analyses by gene-centric (or exome) variation arrays have identified over 200 genetic loci influencing blood pressure in predominantly European-descent populations (henceforth referred to as Europeans) –. The prevalence of high blood pressure is increased in people of East Asian ancestry, contributing to their increased risk of stroke. The reasons for such ethnic differences remain to be clarified from the viewpoint of genetic susceptibility as well as lifestyle. Although the recent progression of GWAS in East Asians allows us to make a preliminary comparison of association signals between the populations, the sample sizes of GWAS in East Asians have been generally much smaller than those in Europeans and under-powered for the comprehensive interethnic comparison at a genome-wide scale. Therefore, large-scale genome-wide association data in both ethnic groups are required for systematic, genome-wide interethnic comparison.

Here, we perform a multi-stage GWAS with a discovery sample of 130,777 East Asian individuals and follow-up meta-analyses involving East Asians and Europeans (max N = 289,038), to seek both transethnic and ancestry-specific genetic effects for five blood pressure phenotypes: systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse pressure (PP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and hypertension. We then seek interethnic genetic heterogeneity of GWAS results between East Asians and Europeans, followed by examination of natural selection as a potential mechanism underlying the ethnic differences in genetic susceptibility for blood pressure as well as other complex traits. We report ancestry-specific blood pressure variants and selection signals in this study.

### Pulse blood pressure and cardiovascular mortality in a population-based cohort of elderly Costa Ricans [^115RKFJU]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

We studied the relationships between blood pressure (BP), pulse pressure (PP) and cardiovascular (CV) death in older adults using data from 2346 participants enrolled in the Costa Rican CRELES study, mean age 76 years (s.d. 10.2), 31% qualified as wide PP. All covariates included and analyzed were collected prospectively as part of a 4-year home-based follow-up; mortality was tracked for an additional 3 years, identifying 266 CV deaths. Longitudinal data revealed little change over time in systolic BP (SBP), a decline in diastolic BP, and widening of PP. Wide PP was associated with higher risk of CV death but only among individuals receiving antihypertensive drug therapy. Individuals with both wide PP and receiving therapy had 2.6 hazard rate of CV death relative to people with normal-PP plus not taking treatment (TRT), even adjusting for SBP. Increasing PP between visits was significantly associated to higher CV death independently of TRT status. SBP and DBP were not significantly associated to CV death when the effect of PP was controlled for.

Conclusion

elderly hypertensive patients with wide or increasing PP, especially if receiving TRT, are the highest CV risk group, thus must be carefully assessed, monitored and treated with caution.

### Pressure amplification explains why pulse pressure is unrelated to risk in young subjects [^114s43Am]. Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Pulse pressure rather than diastolic pressure is the best predictor of coronary heart disease risk in older subjects, but the converse is true in younger subjects. We hypothesized that this disparity results from an age-related difference in pressure amplification from the aorta to brachial artery. Data from 212 subjects age < 50 years and 230 subjects age ≥ 50 years were abstracted from a community database. All subjects were free from cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and medication. Peripheral blood pressure was assessed by sphygmomanometry. Radial artery waveforms recorded noninvasively by applanation tonometry were used to derive central blood pressure. Pressure amplification (peripheral/central pulse pressure ratio) was linearly related to age (r = 0.7; P < 0.001). There was an inverse, linear relationship between amplification and diastolic pressure in the younger group (r = 0.3; P < 0.001) but not in older subjects (r = 0.1; P = 0.2). There was no relationship in either group when the amplification ratio was calculated with nonaugmented central pressure. Amplification is reduced in older subjects because of enhanced wave reflection. In younger, but not older, subjects, amplification declines as diastolic pressure rises. Therefore, peripheral pulse pressure underestimates the effect that diastolic pressure has on central pulse pressure in younger subjects. This may explain why diastolic pressure is a better predictor of risk in this age group and suggests that assessment of central pressure may improve risk stratification further.

### Sex differences in blood pressure phenotypes over time-the HELIUS study [^114bcK3u]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

In clinical practice, hypertension can be subdivided into different phenotypes according to the elevation of systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). This differentiation is relevant because isolated systolic hypertension (ISH), isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH) and combined systolic and diastolic hypertension (SDH) carry a different risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) with important sex differences, especially in younger adults. A previous study has shown that young and middle-aged men with ISH have a comparable CVD risk compared to men with high-normal BP, while the risk of CVD in young and middle-aged women with ISH is higher compared to women with high-normal BP. In contrast to the elderly, ISH in young adults is not only associated with increased arterial stiffness, but also with increased stroke volume and higher pulse pressure, which may differentially impact cardiovascular risk. There is ongoing debate whether ISH in younger adults is either an innocuous phenomenon or necessitates BP-lowering treatment. In clinical practice, it is important to base treatment and follow-up decisions not only on long-term CVD risk but also on the risk for development of sustained hypertension over time. In middle-aged adults, both IDH and ISH are associated with the development of sustained hypertension later in life, with the strongest association for IDH. However, for younger adults there is a paucity of data on the natural course of different blood pressure phenotypes over time, which complicates the decision of whether close follow-up and treatment is indicated. Moreover, given the considerable variability in blood pressure levels, the prognostic significance of single blood pressure measurements in young individuals remains to be fully elucidated. In this study, we therefore examined sex differences in the risk of hypertension at follow-up for different BP phenotypes in young adult men and women aged < 45 years who participated in a large multiethnic population-based study.

### Association of central and peripheral blood pressures with intermediate cardiovascular phenotypes [^114sJk4H]. Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

In conclusion, numerous studies have documented a superior relation of central over brachial BP to intermediate cardiovascular phenotypes or cardiovascular target organ damage. In general, PP has been more strongly related to vascular disease, whereas systolic pressure seems to be a more important determinant of LVH. The similarity of findings in a wide variety of patient-based and population-based studies as well as a broad range of ethnicities supports the robust nature of this phenomenon. Although data regarding the superiority of central over brachial PP with regard to LV diastolic dysfunction are preliminary, the importance of LVH, female sex, and aging as underlying risk factors for HFPEF suggests that more extensive evaluation is likely to reveal a stronger relation of central than peripheral BP with this additional measure of target organ involvement. Finally, limited data suggesting a more important impact of reversing hypertensive cardiovascular hypertrophy by lowering central pressure for a given brachial pressure require confirmation in larger, longitudinal intervention studies.

### Cardiovascular risk as defined in the 2003 European blood pressure classification: the assessment of an additional predictive value of pulse pressure on mortality [^112gRqjk]. Journal of Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study determines the predictive value of brachial pulse pressure for cardiovascular stroke and coronary mortality in a large population categorized by blood pressure level.

Methods

The population was composed of 69,989 subjects aged more than 50 years and divided into 'optimal', 'normal' and 'normal high' normotensive subjects, and grades 1, 2, 3 hypertensive subjects as defined in the 2003 European Guidelines for Management of Hypertension. Hazard ratios for mortality were evaluated using Cox regression models before and after adjustment for pulse pressure. To further assess the role of pulse pressure in mortality, subjects were also classified as 'normotensive' and 'hypertensive' whether they were with or without elevated pulse pressure (≥ 60 mmHg).

Results

By comparison with 'optimal' values, before adjustment for pulse pressure, the hazard ratio for cardiovascular, coronary and stroke mortality increased markedly for blood pressure groups as defined by the European blood pressure classification. For cardiovascular and coronary mortality, the hazard ratio was significant both in the 'high normal' and hypertensive ranges. For stroke mortality, hazard ratio was significant only in the hypertensive ranges. After adjustment to pulse pressure, hazard ratio remained unmodified for stroke mortality. For coronary mortality, the risk was attenuated in 'high normal' and all hypertensive groups. A study of the pulse pressure classification in subjects dichotomized as normotensive and hypertensive subjects indicated that pulse pressure was an independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality.

Conclusion

Increased pulse pressure predicts cardiovascular mortality, acting more on coronary than cerebral vessels. This finding involves all blood pressure ranges, including subjects with low diastolic but normal systolic blood pressure.

### Evaluation of optimal diastolic blood pressure range among adults with treated systolic blood pressure less than 130 mm Hg [^111yY47c]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Extremely low diastolic blood pressure has been reported to be associated with increased adverse cardiovascular events (ie, the diastolic J-shape phenomenon); however, current US guidelines recommend an intensive blood pressure target of less than 130/80 mm Hg without mentioning the lower limits of diastolic blood pressure.

Objectives

To evaluate whether there is a diastolic J-shape phenomenon for patients with an treated systolic blood pressure of less than 130 mm Hg and to explore the safe and optimal diastolic blood pressure ranges for this patient population.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study analyzed outcome data of patients at high cardiovascular risk who were randomized to intensive or standard blood pressure control and achieved treated systolic blood pressure of less than 130 mm Hg in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) and Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes-Blood Pressure (ACCORD-BP) trial. Data were collected from October 2010 to August 2015 (SPRINT) and from September 1999 to June 2009 (ACCORD-BP). Data were analyzed from January to May 2020.

Exposure

Treated diastolic blood pressure, divided in intervals of less than 60, 60 to less than 70, 70 to less than 80, and 80 mm Hg and greater.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. A composite cardiovascular outcome, including cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke, was among the key secondary outcomes.

Results

A total of 7515 patients (mean [SD] age, 65.6 [8.7] years; 4553 [60.6%] men) were included in this analysis. The nominally lowest risk was observed at a diastolic blood pressure between 70 and 80 mm Hg for the primary outcome, the composite cardiovascular outcome, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death. A mean diastolic blood pressure of less than 60 mm Hg was associated with significantly increased risk of the primary outcome (hazard ratio [HR], 1.46; 95% CI, 1.13–1.90; p = 0.004), the composite cardiovascular outcome (HR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.26–2.41; p = 0.001), nonfatal myocardial infarction (HR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.15–2.59; p = 0.008), and nonfatal stroke (HR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.26–5.63; p = 0.01).

Conclusions and Relevance

This cohort study found that lowering diastolic blood pressure to less than 60 mm Hg was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with high cardiovascular risk and an treated systolic blood pressure less than 130 mm Hg. The finding that a diastolic blood pressure value between 70 and 80 mm Hg was an optimum target for this patient population merits further study.

### Isolated systolic hypertension in the young: a position paper endorsed by the European Society of Hypertension [^11428BA9]. Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Whether isolated systolic hypertension in the young (ISHY) implies a worse outcome and needs antihypertensive treatment is still a matter for dispute. ISHY is thought to have different mechanisms than systolic hypertension in the elderly. However, findings from previous studies have provided inconsistent results. From the analysis of the literature, two main lines of research and conceptualization have emerged. Simultaneous assessment of peripheral and central blood pressure led to the identification of a condition called pseudo or spurious hypertension, which was considered an innocent condition. However, an increase in pulse wave velocity has been found by some authors in about 20% of the individuals with ISHY. In addition, obesity and metabolic disturbances have often been documented to be associated with ISHY both in children and young adults. The first aspect to consider whenever evaluating a person with ISHY is the possible presence of white-coat hypertension, which has been frequently found in this condition. In addition, assessment of central blood pressure is useful for identifying ISHY patients whose central blood pressure is normal. ISHY is infrequently mentioned in the guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. According to the 2013 European Guidelines on the management of hypertension, people with ISHY should be followed carefully, modifying risk factors by lifestyle changes and avoiding antihypertensive drugs. Only future clinical trials will elucidate if a benefit can be achieved with pharmacological treatment in some subgroups of ISHY patients with associated risk factors and/or high central blood pressure.

### Progression of arterial stiffness is associated with midlife diastolic blood pressure and transition to late-life hypertensive phenotypes [^116r8aie]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systolic blood pressure (SBP) is the principal focus of modern control of hypertension because of the strong short‐ and mid‐term associations with acute vascular events, 1 the proven efficacy of hypertensive treatment for isolated systolic hypertension 2, 3, 4 and the greater population attributable burden of SBP‐associated cardiovascular events, reflecting the high incidence of both cardiovascular events and isolated systolic hypertension in the elderly. 5 Specifically, SBP tends to increase and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) tends to decrease in late life. 6 Therefore, short‐term associations with SBP in late life may not reflect the long‐term attributable risk of cardiovascular events caused by midlife diastolic hypertension, particularly if the risk associated with midlife DBP is mediated by late‐life SBP.

Arterial stiffness is associated with recurrent cardiovascular events and all‐cause mortality, independent of age, blood pressure (BP), and cardiovascular risk factors. 7, 8 It is strongly associated with age and a history of hypertension, 9 is often described as a measure of "vascular age", and features in clinical guidelines as a marker of hypertensive end‐organ damage. 10, 11 Studies that have assessed the longitudinal relationships between age, arterial stiffness, and BP have largely reported an association between increased SBP and progression of arterial stiffness, 9, 12, 13 although some have reported no evidence of a direct relationship, 6 or sex‐specific differences in longitudinal progression of arterial stiffness. 14 However, studies have not reported the bidirectional interactions between increased SBP or DBP and progression of arterial stiffness and the modification of longitudinal changes in BP by increasing arterial stiffness in midlife.

In addition to being a marker of hypertensive end‐organ damage, 6 arterial stiffness may directly induce end‐organ injury through reduced damping of the systolic pressure wave, increased pulse wave reflection from the periphery, and impaired Windkessel function of the aorta, 15 resulting in increased systolic pressures, increased pulsatility of aortic BP, and greater transmission of pulsatile flow to the distal circulation. 16 The low‐resistance arterial beds in the kidney and brain are particularly susceptible to the increased pulsatility of aortic blood flow, resulting in a strong association between aortic stiffness and cerebral arterial pulsatility with acute lacunar stroke, 17 white matter injury, 18 and the associated sequelae of decline in mobility, late‐onset refractory depression, and dementia. 19 To develop strategies to prevent end‐organ injury, it is critical to understand the magnitude and direction of the relationship between BP and arterial stiffness, and the optimal period for intervention to prevent increased arterial stiffness.

### Twenty-four-hour central pulse pressure for cardiovascular events prediction in a low-cardiovascular-risk population: results from the bordeaux cohort [^113QJVdr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

High blood pressure (BP) is the principal modifiable cardiovascular risk, and its prevalence increases with age. 1 Because a large proportion of the general population is affected by high BP, a desirable goal is to focus on prevention strategies in subjects most at risk of cardiovascular events. To this end, improvement of BP measurement has been identified as a priority. 2 Although office BP measurements are still useful, the superiority of ambulatory BP measurements over office measurements in cardiovascular prognosis has been shown, 3 and today ambulatory BP measurements serve as the reference for diagnosis of hypertension and assessment of BP phenotypes. 4, 5, 6 Central aortic BP is yet another interesting hemodynamic parameter, as it incorporates several components such as arterial stiffness (a determinant of aorta‐to‐peripheral pulse pressure amplification), location of reflecting sites, and the level of peripheral vascular resistance.

In essence, central BP measurements could be the ideal tool to assess cardiovascular risk. 7 A certain number of studies investigating subjects at high cardiovascular risk substantiate this argument 8, 9, 10; however, data on subjects with low cardiovascular risk are less documented. Because BP amplification reduces with age and vascular aging, 11 the prognostic value of central BP is likely to be greater in young subjects with low cardiovascular risk, who are found to have the largest difference between central and peripheral pressure measurements. Our study therefore aimed to investigate if 24‐hour monitoring of central BP in a young hypertensive population with a low cardiovascular risk (SCORE [Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation] ≤ 5%) provides a more accurate assessment of cardiovascular risk than 24‐hour monitoring of peripheral BP.

### Genome-wide multipoint parametric linkage analysis of pulse pressure in large, extended Utah pedigrees [^111wq9af]. Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

High pulse pressure, a measure of arterial aging, is an important predictor of cardiovascular and general mortality. It has been suggested that the genetic etiology of pulse pressure is the same as systolic blood pressure. We performed a genome-wide, multipoint, parametric linkage analysis in 26 large, extended Utah pedigrees to locate genes affecting pulse pressure. Four parametric models were considered, including dominant and recessive modes of inheritance involving genes for high and low pulse pressure. Linkage analysis revealed 11 regions with a logarithm of the odds (LOD) > 1.5, including 2 regions attaining genome-wide suggestive evidence for linkage after accounting for multiple tests. Inspecting pedigree-specific multipoint linkage evidence suggested that these 2 regions localized to 15.7 cM on chromosome 8p (LOD = 2.89), between markers D8S136 and D8S1477, and 20.0 cM on chromosome 12q (LOD = 2.59), between D12S1300 and D12S2070. Both regions were identified better by pulse pressure compared with equivalent analyses with systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Results for pulse pressure overlapped favorably with those of others for related blood pressure phenotypes and support the hypothesis that genes with pleiotropic effects on blood pressure phenotypes do exist, but that the genetic etiologies are not identical. In conclusion, our results suggest that pulse pressure might be of use for identifying genes involved in blood pressure phenotypes and arterial aging.

### Cardiovascular phenotype of elevated blood pressure differs markedly between young males and females: the enigma study [^112t7H1r]. Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Hypertension represents one of the most important causes of premature death and disability worldwide, although much is still unknown about the underlying cause. Interestingly, data from the Framingham Heart Studydemonstrate that the increased risk associated with high blood pressure (BP) is not simply confined to those individuals with hypertension but applies to those with high-normal BP as well. Indeed, in a large meta-analysis of ≈1 million adults aged 40 to 89 years, there is no evidence of a threshold, down to at least 115/75 mm Hg, for cardiovascular risk related to BP.

The recent reclassification of BP as part of the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology 2017 guidelines defines hypertension as systolic BP (SBP) ≥ 130 mm Hg and diastolic BP (DBP) ≥ 80 mm Hg. The guidelines also introduce a new arbitrary BP category called elevated BP (EBP), defined as SBP 120 to 129 mm Hg and DBP ≤ 80 mm Hg. However, the cardiovascular risk associated with EBP, as defined by the guidelines, is still largely unknown in younger subjects. BP tracks strongly throughout life, and small interindividual differences in BP at an early stage become increasingly magnified over time. Moreover, exposure to mild BP elevation during youth increases cardiovascular risk later in life, independently of BP. Although a number of studies have examined mechanisms and consequences of BP elevation in older adults, the seeds of future cardiovascular risk are likely to be set in youth, making it important to understand the mechanisms underlying early elevations in BP.

The aim of this study, therefore, was to examine metabolic, hemodynamic, and autonomic characteristics across a range of BP categories in a large cohort of healthy young adults, with limited exposure to cardiovascular risk factors. We hypothesized that the mechanisms associated with hypertension in young people are already evident at the elevated stage of BP, and we wished to determine whether these differed between males and females.

### Peripheral arterial blood pressure monitoring adequately tracks central arterial blood pressure in critically ill patients: an observational study [^111QyrQr]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Discussion

The main finding of this study is that central and peripheral mean arterial blood pressures appear to be interchangeable. The 95% limits of agreement of 16 mmHg is not a clinically relevant difference in mean arterial pressure and the two measurements agree regardless of whether patients were receiving vasoactive drugs.

O'Rouke and colleagues have shown that there are no differences in mean arterial blood pressure simultaneously measured in the aorta and radial arteries in healthy volunteers. However, systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressures are higher and lower, respectively, in radial arteries than in the aorta. This phenomenon is known as distal pulse amplification and is due to the characteristics of the vascular tree. Briefly, a pulse waveform entering the aorta is exposed to a sudden impedance change at the capillary level, resulting in a large increment in resistance and producing reflected pulse waveforms. Those waves are added to the following ones, producing higher peaks than the original aortic systolic peak at different distances from the aortic origin. This distal pulse amplification is always present when peripheral vascular resistance is high. In our study we found no evidence of this phenomenon. In fact, systolic, mean, and diastolic pressures were higher in the femoral artery than in the radial artery. Lack of physiological distal pulse wave formation could be due to a vasoactive effect in shock patients. Thus, although vasoactive drugs act mainly on resistance vessels, they also affect conductance vessels, which could alter peripheral arterial blood pressure measurements.

### Reducing the blood pressure-related burden of cardiovascular disease: impact of achievable improvements in blood pressure prevention and control [^117D7oEm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Decades of research have characterized the associations between elevated blood pressure and a spectrum of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) including cerebral vascular disease, heart failure (HF), and coronary heart disease (CHD). 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Among blood pressure–related deaths, published estimates suggest that approximately one third of excess CHD and all‐cause mortality can be attributed to elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) at levels designated as nonhypertensive, 6, 7 indicating that benefits achieved from decreases in blood pressure are not limited to populations with hypertension. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 Experimental and observational studies have also demonstrated the efficacy of lifestyle‐based blood pressure interventions, such as increased physical activity and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, for CVD prevention. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 This body of evidence supports the development of population‐wide interventions to reduce blood pressure alongside interventions targeted to populations with blood pressure above goal for CVD reduction. 18

Several authors have estimated the theoretical effects of shifting the distribution of blood pressure, either by lowering the mean population blood pressure or by decreasing the proportion of the population classified as hypertensive. 8, 11, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 Framingham Heart Study investigators reported that a 2‐mm Hg population‐wide diastolic blood pressure (DBP) reduction was associated with an estimated 17% decrease in the prevalence of hypertension, and a 6% reduction in the risk of CHD. 19 Other published studies examined CHD and stroke events, but were conducted in predominantly white or European populations and considered blood pressure treatment guidelines no longer in use. 8, 19, 20, 23 The degree to which modest population‐wide blood pressure shifts may affect the incidence of HF also remains unknown, as do the effects of blood pressure shifts in African American populations, 19 who shoulder higher burdens of elevated blood pressure as well as CVD than do white populations. 1 Further, the majority of published studies estimated cardiovascular benefits from interventions that completely eliminated hypertension or uncontrolled hypertension from the population, despite the implausibility of such goals. 24, 25, 26 Therefore, in a biracial, population‐based setting, we assessed the impact of 2 types of pragmatic, hypothetical interventions on reducing the incidence of CHD, stroke, and HF after full implementation: a population‐wide intervention that reduced SBP by 1 or 2 mm Hg and targeted interventions that achieved a 10% reduction in the proportion of the population with unaware, untreated, or uncontrolled blood pressure above goal.

### Associations of intraoperative radial arterial systolic, diastolic, mean, and pulse pressures with myocardial and acute kidney injury after noncardiac surgery: a retrospective cohort analysis [^111s1ZJk]. Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Arterial pressure is a complex signal that can be characterized by systolic, mean, and diastolic components, along with pulse pressure (difference between systolic and diastolic pressures). The authors separately evaluated the strength of associations among intraoperative pressure components with myocardial and kidney injury after noncardiac surgery.

Methods

The authors included 23,140 noncardiac surgery patients at Cleveland Clinic who had blood pressure recorded at 1-min intervals from radial arterial catheters. The authors used univariable smoothing and multivariable logistic regression to estimate probabilities of each outcome as function of patients' lowest pressure for a cumulative 5 min for each component, comparing discriminative ability using C-statistics. The authors further assessed the association between outcomes and both area and minutes under derived thresholds corresponding to the beginning of increased risk for the average patient.

Results

Out of 23,140 patients analyzed, myocardial injury occurred in 6.1% and acute kidney injury in 8.2%. Based on the lowest patient blood pressure experienced for greater than or equal to 5 min, estimated thresholds below which the odds of myocardial or kidney injury progressively increased (slope P < 0.001) were 90 mmHg for systolic, 65 mmHg for mean, 50 mmHg for diastolic, and 35 mmHg for pulse pressure. Weak discriminative ability was noted between the pressure components, with univariable C-statistics ranging from 0.55 to 0.59. Area under the curve in the highest (deepest) quartile of exposure below the respective thresholds had significantly higher odds of myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery and acute kidney injury compared to no exposure for systolic, mean, and pulse pressure (all P < 0.001), but not diastolic, after adjusting for confounding.

Conclusions

Systolic, mean, and pulse pressure hypotension were comparable in their strength of association with myocardial and renal injury. In contrast, the relationship with diastolic pressure was poor. Baseline factors were much more strongly associated with myocardial and renal injury than intraoperative blood pressure, but pressure differs in being modifiable.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^114eZ6aq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension affects ≈29% of the US adult population, an estimated 72 million people, with a prevalence of > 65% in persons older than 60 years. 1, 2 It is an important risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), accounting for ≈41% of all CVD deaths. 3, 4 Indeed, there is a known graded relationship between increasing blood pressure (BP) and the risk of CVD, starting at 115/75 mm Hg. 5 Based on observational data, an increase in BP of 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic is associated with a doubling of the risk of CVD death, regardless of age. 5 Further, hypertension in middle age is known to increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dementia in later life, an important issue given the aging demographic in Western societies. 6 Finally, despite the fact that BP recognition and control are improving, it is concerning that nearly half of the hypertensive population remains suboptimally controlled. 2

With the 2003 Joint National Committee's seventh report (JNC 7) becoming increasingly outdated and the 2011 Institute of Medicine report calling for high‐quality evidence‐based guidelines, 7, 8 the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) was initially appointed to create an updated treatment guideline for hypertension under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Although the NIH ultimately withdrew from the guideline development process at a late stage in the development of JNC 8, the panel decided, nonetheless, to publish their recommendations independently.

The panel aimed to answer 3 questions: Does initiating antihypertensive treatment at specific BP thresholds improve health outcomes? Does treatment with antihypertensive therapy to a specific BP goal improve health outcomes? Are there differences in benefit/harm between antihypertensive drugs or drug classes on specific health outcomes? The committee focused exclusively on large, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as supporting evidence, although 5 of the 9 recommendations in the final report were ultimately based on expert opinion. Partly in response to JNC 8, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) are now in the process of developing official hypertension guidelines. In this review, we discuss the basis of each recommendation from the JNC 8 panel, provide additional insights, and compare these recommendations with guidelines from other professional societies to generate suggestions for the new AHA/ACC hypertension guideline committee.

### High pulse pressure and metabolic syndrome are associated with proteinuria in young adult women [^114GJMCP]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Another important finding of our study is that subjects with persistent proteinuria had a higher systolic BP and wider pulse pressure than those without persistent proteinuria. In particular, the pulse pressure was closely associated with proteinuria, and its effect was independent to other clinical factors. Generally in postmenopausal females, the loss of estrogenic action on the arterial wall appears to play a specific deleterious role by increasing arterial stiffness and pulse pressure. Therefore, cardiovascular complications are more common in males and postmenopausal females than in premenopausal females. However, in this study, we found a harmful effect of an increased pulse pressure in young healthy women aged 20 to 39 years; therefore, our findings could emphasize the importance of pulse pressure on proteinuria independent to other risk factors such as aging process or hormonal changes. Our results are consistent with previous longitudinal data suggesting that pulse pressure is a risk factor for increased albuminuria in general or hypertensive atherosclerotic populations. The close association between an increased pulse pressure and proteinuria could be explained by the fact that a wide pulse pressure induces endothelial dysfunction and barotrauma of the renal arteries. However, due to the limitation of the present cross-sectional design, the causal relationship between proteinuria and wide pulse pressure among this young population without vascular risk factors could not be exactly identified. Moreover, a recent large-scale Japanese study reported that close associations between high pulse pressures and proteinuria could be established only in diabetic patients, not among subjects with prediabetes or normal glucose tolerance. Therefore, a further well-designed study is needed to elucidate the pathophysiological link between pulse pressure and proteinuria in the young adult population.

Table 2.
Rates of primary and secondary endpoints by pulse pressure quartiles in older adults

Figure 1.
Cumulative incidence of the primary endpoints by pulse pressure quartiles in older adults. The incidence of total mortality (a, b) and the composite cardiovascular endpoint (c, b) was first adjusted for cohort and sex (a, c) and next additionally for age (b, d). Considering age significantly attenuated the gradient from the low to the high pulse pressure quartile (P < 0.0001). Tabulated data are the number of participants at risk and those experiencing an endpoint at 2-year intervals.

In older participants (Table 3), all primary and secondary endpoints were significantly (P < 0.0001) associated with PP with hazard ratios ranging from 1.09 for total mortality to 1.54 for cardiovascular death. However, across the 3 age classes (50–59, 60–69, and ≥ 70 years), the hazard ratios, expressing relative risk, weakened with older age; the decrease in relative risk expressed as e powered to the difference of the hazard ratio on the natural logarithmic scale in participants aged ≥ 70 years minus the corresponding hazard ratio in adults aged 50–59 years (i.e. the ratio of the hazard ratios) ranged from 0.70 to 0.83, reaching significance (P ≤ 0.034) for total mortality, the composite cardiovascular endpoint, and stroke (Table 3). Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoints, only including untreated participants without history of cardiovascular disease at baseline or only 24-hour ambulatory recordings with at least 10 daytime and 5 nighttime readings, produced confirmatory results as shown for the composite cardiovascular endpoint (Supplementary Table S7 online). Similarly, replacing 24-mean arterial pressure by 24-hour diastolic BP in the multivariable-adjusted Cox models did not materially change the results.

### Pulse pressure, prehypertension, and mortality: the San Antonio heart study [^115Tn6Kh]. American Journal of Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Prehypertension increases mortality risk. Pulse pressure is also associated with increased mortality. Nevertheless, the impact of pulse pressure on the relationship between prehypertension and mortality is not known in individuals who are free of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

Methods

Cox regression analysis was used to examine mortality risk among 3,632 (97.0%) participants in the San Antonio Heart Study (age range, 25–64 years; mean follow-up, 15.2 years). Results were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, education, body mass index (BMI), smoking, and total cholesterol concentration. The Seventh Report of the Joint Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) categories were used for blood pressure staging: normal, < 120/80 mm Hg; prehypertension, 120–139/80–89 mm Hg.

Results

Prehypertension prevalence was 31.6% at baseline. There were 218 deaths during the follow-up period. Prehypertension-predicted mortality (all-cause, hazard ratio (HR) 1.49 (1.12–1.99); cardiovascular, HR 1.79 (1.07–3.02)). Relative to normal blood pressure plus pulse pressure in the lower tertile, prehypertension plus pulse pressure in the upper tertile was associated with increased mortality (all-cause, HR 2.14 (1.38–3.32); cardiovascular, HR 2.47 (1.13–5.39)); however, prehypertension plus pulse pressure in the lower tertile was not significantly associated with mortality (all-cause, HR 1.19 (0.52–2.67); cardiovascular, HR 0.43 (0.05–3.40)).

Conclusions

Prehypertension increases mortality risk (all-cause and cardiovascular) in individuals who are free of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Nevertheless, this relationship is not evident in individuals with narrow pulse pressure. Therefore, pulse pressure may be a relevant measure of blood pressure for the definition of normal blood pressure.

### Sex differences in blood pressure and potential implications for cardiovascular risk management [^111vHD4j]. Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Accurate blood pressure (BP) measurement is critical for optimal cardiovascular risk management. Age-related trajectories for cuff-measured BP accelerate faster in women compared with men, but whether cuff BP represents the intraarterial (invasive) aortic BP is unknown. This study aimed to determine the sex differences between cuff BP, invasive aortic BP, and the difference between the 2 measurements.

Methods

Upper-arm cuff BP and invasive aortic BP were measured during coronary angiography in 1615 subjects from the Invasive Blood Pressure Consortium Database. This analysis comprised 22 different cuff BP devices from 28 studies.

Results

Subjects were 64 ± 11 years (range 40–89) and 32% women. For the same cuff systolic BP (SBP), invasive aortic SBP was 4.4 mm Hg higher in women compared with men. Cuff and invasive aortic SBP were higher in women compared with men, but the sex difference was more pronounced from invasive aortic SBP, was the lowest in younger ages, and the highest in older ages. Cuff diastolic blood pressure overestimated invasive diastolic blood pressure in both sexes. For cuff and invasive diastolic blood pressure separately, there were sex*age interactions in which diastolic blood pressure was higher in younger men and lower in older men, compared with women. Cuff pulse pressure underestimated invasive aortic pulse pressure in excess of 10 mm Hg for both sexes in older age.

Conclusions

For the same cuff SBP, invasive aortic SBP was higher in women compared with men. How this translates to cardiovascular risk prediction needs to be determined, but women may be at higher BP-related risk than estimated by cuff measurements.

### Treatment blood pressure targets for hypertension [^115tJF58]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors need to know what blood pressure (BP) target they should try to achieve. The standard of clinical practice for some time has been ≤ 140–160/ 90–100 mmHg. New guidelines are recommending BP targets lower than this standard. It is not known whether attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard reduces mortality and morbidity.

Objectives

To determine if lower BP targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard BP targets (≤ 140–160/ 90–100 mmHg).

Search Strategy

Electronic search of MEDLINE (1966–2008), EMBASE (1980–2008), and CENTRAL (up to June 2008); references from review articles, clinical guidelines, and clinical trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing patients randomized to lower or to standard BP targets and providing data on any of the primary outcomes below.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers (JAA, MIP) independently assessed the included trials and data entry. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; total cardiovascular events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure and end stage renal disease. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean systolic and diastolic BP and withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Main Results

No trials comparing different systolic BP targets were found. Seven trials (22,089 subjects) comparing different diastolic BP targets were included. Despite a -4/-3 mmHg greater achieved reduction in systolic/diastolic BP, p < 0.001, attempting to achieve "lower targets" instead of "standard targets" did not change total mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86–1.15), myocardial infarction (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74–1.09), stroke (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79–1.25), congestive heart failure (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59–1.32), major cardiovascular events (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83–1.07), or end-stage renal disease (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.81–1.27). The net health effect of lower targets cannot be fully assessed due to lack of information regarding all total serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse effects in 6 of 7 trials. A sensitivity analysis in diabetic patients and in patients with chronic renal disease also did not show a reduction in any of the mortality and morbidity outcomes with lower targets as compared to standard targets.

Authors' Conclusions

Treating patients to lower than standard BP targets, ≤ 140–160/90–100 mmHg, does not reduce mortality or morbidity. Because guidelines are recommending even lower targets for diabetes mellitus and chronic renal disease, we are currently conducting systematic reviews in those groups of patients.

### Blood pressure variability in clinical practice: past, present and the future [^115xuWBr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Based on these considerations, ABPM is now the recommended reference standard for the diagnosis and management of patients with hypertension. The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association hypertension guidelines also recommend out‐of‐office BP measurements (HBP monitoring is considered an acceptable alternative to ABPM) to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension and for titration of antihypertensive medications.

The opportunity to easily make continuous noninvasive BP measurements migrates traditional BP recordings from intermittent, hourly, daily, or annual measures to continuous beat‐to‐beat changes and will challenge the clinical system to rapidly standardize techniques, reporting, interpretation, and gather meaningful epidemiologic data to guide clinical decision making.

Cuff‐Based Devices

Cuff‐based devices measure BP by using 1 of 2 main techniques, the auscultatory method, and the oscillometry method. In the auscultatory method, the clinician listens to Korotkoff sounds over the brachial artery using a stethoscope to estimate SBP and DBP. The auscultatory gap (silent gap) is characterized by diminished/absence of Korotkoff sounds during auscultation. It is caused by reduced peripheral blood flow due to changes in the pulse wave. Incorrect interpretation of the auscultatory gap can lead to inaccurate BP measurement. The potential problem of an auscultatory gap can be avoided by initial estimation of the SBP by palpation to feel for the presence of a pulse. The volume clamp method is based on the Penaz method, which involves an inflatable cuff combined with a photodiode. The photodiode measures the diameter of the artery in the finger as the pressure of the cuff changes to keep the diameter of the artery constant. These pressure changes in the cuff are then used to calculate arterial BP. In the oscillometric‐based method, an electronic pressure sensor records the pressure oscillations produced through the arterial wall. The device constructs an oscillogram from upper and lower values of these oscillations as cuff pressure varies from above SBP to below DBP. Then proprietary algorithms are used to calculate the mean, systolic, and diastolic pressures from the oscillogram(Figure 3).

### Is pulse pressure a predictor of new-onset diabetes in high-risk hypertensive patients? a subanalysis of the candesartan antihypertensive survival evaluation in Japan (CASE-J) trial [^116oL9s4]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In this study, we demonstrated that pulse pressure was a predictor of new-onset diabetes in high-risk hypertensive patients, independent of the effects of antihypertensive treatment and other possible risk factors for new-onset diabetes. Further, a higher pulse pressure arising mainly due to a lower DBP, indicating that the increased pulse pressure resulted largely from increased arterial stiffness, was associated with a higher risk of new-onset diabetes. This finding suggests that increased arterial stiffness, reflected in an increased pulse pressure, may be related to the process of new-onset diabetes in high-risk hypertensive patients, albeit that the mechanism of this association remains to be elucidated.

Two potential interpretations may explain these results. First, increased pulse pressure may be a surrogate marker for the risk of new-onset diabetes. Supporting this suggestion, a higher pulse pressure, reflecting increased arterial stiffness, was observed in hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome than in those without. Further, accumulating evidence supports the concept of increased arterial stiffness in patients with a metabolic disturbance, which is considered a potential mechanism linking metabolic disturbance to increased CVD risk. Arterial properties are affected both functionally and structurally by many factors, including aging, blood pressure, sympathetic nervous system function, endothelial function, inflammation, bioactive peptides, and other cardiovascular risk factors. Impaired glucose metabolism, including metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance, usually precedes the development of overt type 2 diabetes. Prolonged exposure to hyperglycemic conditions can lead to increased arterial stiffness via collagen cross-linking due to nonenzymatic glycation, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and local activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in pre-diabetic as well as diabetic individuals. Indeed, PP f, represented as a parameter of the pulsatile component of blood pressure, was superior to pulse pressure in terms of the risk stratification of new-onset diabetes.

### High pulse pressure and metabolic syndrome are associated with proteinuria in young adult women [^114jtc72]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Of the young women aged 20 to 39 years in this study, 1.0% exhibited persistent proteinuria. Metabolic syndrome and its components of hypertension, hyperglycemia, central obesity, low HDL levels, and high TG levels were closely related to the presence of proteinuria. In addition, an increased pulse pressure may be an important independent risk factor for proteinuria; indeed, it exhibited an additive effect with metabolic syndrome for prediction of proteinuria. Specific attention to proteinuria may be necessary in asymptomatic young women aged 20 to 39 years if they have metabolic syndrome or a wide pulse pressure.

### 2025 AHA / ACC / AANP / AAPA / ABC / ACCP / ACPM / AGS / AMA / ASPC / NMA / PCNA / SGIM guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation and management of high blood pressure in adults: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111vNhR7]. Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Valvular heart disease and hypertension — synopsis indicates limited directive evidence and key associations. There are no recommendations based on sufficiently strong evidence for the management of adults with hypertension and valvular heart disease other than for aortic stenosis or chronic aortic regurgitation. Among adults with severe aortic stenosis who have undergone transcatheter aortic valve implantation, the use of ACEi or ARB to achieve BP control is associated with reduced mortality, and in chronic moderate to severe aortic regurgitation with hypertension, the use of ACEi and ARB is associated with reductions in cardiovascular events and lower all-cause mortality. Chronic aortic regurgitation is often accompanied by a wide pulse pressure, and medications that lower heart rate may paradoxically increase SBP.

### Hypertension and survival in chronic hemodialysis patients – past lessons and future opportunities [^113tw1EW]. Kidney International (2005). Low credibility.

There is substantial controversy surrounding the benefits of control of hypertension in hemodialysis patients. Unlike the general population, some studies suggest that higher blood pressure in hemodialysis patients offers a survival advantage, what is termed as "reverse epidemiology". To critically analyze the relationship between total and cardiovascular mortality and blood pressure, peer-reviewed, published studies in hemodialysis patients were analyzed. Consideration of the world-wide experience suggests that analysis of incident cohorts reveal a clear link between elevated blood pressure and mortality. Increased pulse pressure, which is primarily due to increased systolic pressure, is also associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The counterintuitive relationship between blood pressure and mortality appears, in part, to be due to methods of data analysis. When data are analyzed with systolic or diastolic blood pressure as separate models, not conjointly, inverse relationship between blood pressure and total and cardiovascular mortality is generally seen. When both systolic and diastolic blood pressure are considered together, systolic blood pressure or increased pulse pressure assumes a major importance in predicting cardiovascular events whereas diastolic blood pressure retains the inverse relationship. Control of hypertension in hypertensive dialysis patients is associated with improved survival. Furthermore, the use of antihypertensive drug treatment is associated with improved survival regardless of blood pressure control. Low predialysis blood pressure is associated with increased cardiovascular deaths and deaths within 2 years from malignancy or withdrawal from dialysis. These data suggest that hypertension needs to be better controlled in hypertensive hemodialysis patients. Better methods of assessment of blood pressure control, consideration of cardiac structure and function, and performance of randomized controlled trials of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies are needed to establish benefits and determining goal blood pressure in hemodialysis patients.

### Reducing the blood pressure-related burden of cardiovascular disease: impact of achievable improvements in blood pressure prevention and control [^117XnbgU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

In conclusion, population‐wide reductions in SBP of modest magnitude are predicted to have a substantial impact on CVD prevention and should be developed in parallel with interventions targeted to populations with blood pressure above goal. As advocated by many primary prevention statements, 33, 53, 54 the management of blood pressure in adults should not be limited to those classified as hypertensive, but rather extend to the majority of the populations below hypertension treatment thresholds. Omitting such individuals leaves a large segment of the population at increased risk of cardiovascular events and constrains the ability of clinicians and public health practitioners to reduce the societal burden of blood pressure–related CHD, stroke, and HF.

### Pulse blood pressure and cardiovascular mortality in a population-based cohort of elderly Costa Ricans [^115XU4sT]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

With the 5 mm Hg of annual change as the cut-off to identify meaningful increases or decreases in BP, we found that the same proportion (30%) decreased or increased their SBP between waves (lowest panel in Table 1). In contrast, the predominant change in DBP was decline: 30% compared with 13% with increased DBP. Correspondently with DBP changes, the predominant PP change was increase – 33% compared with 18% with decreasing PP. Although 10% of participants initiated therapy between visits, 4% stopped it. BP changes differed significantly by initial PP status: wide-PP individuals were more likely to reduce their PP and their SBP and to rise their DBP in what looks like a regression to mean change

Figure 2 shows the sample's distribution (smoothed out with a kernel algorithm implemented in STATA) by the readings in SBP, DBP and PP in each wave of visits. Only individuals with measures in the three waves were represented in the figure; that the three curves are for exactly the same group of individuals and the wave's changes are exclusively due to the passage of time or the ageing of the group (cohort and survival-selection effects are thus controlled). The CRELES' data follows the expected normal-shape distribution in the BP measures. The panel's distribution by SBP did not change across waves. In contrast the DBP distribution shifted to the left with passage of time and the PP distribution shifted to the right. These data thus suggest that aging in this group of elderly Costa Ricans altered little their SBP as a population, whereas it reduced DBP and widened PP.

BP levels and CV mortality

The crude CV mortality rate in this population was 13 annual deaths per 1000 individuals (Table 2). Among those in TRT or in stage-2 high SBP or with low DBP or with wide-PP the death rate was clearly higher: about 20 per 1000. In the other marginal groups in Table 2 the rate ranges between 7 and 12 per 1000. The lowest rate (seven per 1000) was for individuals who were not in TRT. Stratification by being in TRT revealed that large differences in mortality occured only among people in TRT, in contrast with almost no mortality differences among people not in TRT. For example, crude CV mortality among people in TRT was 32 for those with DBP < 70 mm Hg compared with 15 per 1000 among those with high DBP, while the corresponding rates for those not in TRT were 8 and 6, respectively.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^113Bc5Dp]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Treatment of hypertension — Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials indicate that a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) or a 5 mmHg reduction in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is associated with reductions in all major cardiovascular (CV) events by ~20%, all-cause mortality by ~10–15%, stroke by ~35%, coronary events by ~20%, and heart failure by ~40%, and these relative risk reductions are consistent irrespective of baseline BP within the hypertensive range, the level of CV risk, comorbidities, age, sex, and ethnicity.

### Pulse pressure impairs cognition via white matter disruption [^113EFLiB]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

To try to address the possibility of reverse causation, we compared model fit with alternative orders of variables. The expected order — namely, pulse pressure to PSMD to processing speed — fit the data best. However, this comparison is not conclusive about the true causal direction, and future work should extend this with longitudinal and interventional study designs. It is also possible that age drives changes in pulse pressure, which in turn drive changes in white matter and cognition. In this case, age could be modeled on the left of the vascular-brain-cognition triangle. Investigating this in future work will require longitudinal cohorts.

The latent vascular factor which we refer to as pulse pressure here was created using factor analysis, as in our previous study, where it was primarily driven by the observed measures of pulse pressure, with a smaller, negative contribution from resting heart rate. Importantly, the sensitivity analysis revealed that the results remained consistent when observed measures of pulse pressure were used instead of the latent vascular measures, further supporting this terminology. While pulse pressure may only be a proxy for arterial stiffness, our approach of using a latent factor of pulse pressure may provide a more accurate representation of arterial stiffness. This is relevant given evidence that blood pressure estimates from the brachial artery — as in this study — can differ significantly from central aortic pressure. There is evidence that more direct measures, such as pulse wave velocity, explain greater variance in white matter hyperintensities. Latent variable modeling is widely used in medical, and psychological, research to improve construct validity when direct measurement is difficult. Currently, the Heart and Brain study is collecting multiple measures of pulse pressure, alongside ultrasound metrics of vessel stiffness, white matter lesions and cognitive abilities. The latent representation of these detailed multimodal measures of vascular pathology may contribute to better understanding the observed effects on brain and cognitive aging. However, interpreting these associations requires consideration of downstream mechanisms that may influence the brain's vulnerability to pulsatile signals, independent of arterial stiffness itself. This includes myogenic contraction, endothelial dysfunction, and structural differences in intracranial arteries — such as reduced media thickness and absence of the external elastic lamina — which may make the brain's microcirculation particularly vulnerable to damage from high pulse pressure. Thus, future work should establish whether measuring only systolic and diastolic pressures is sufficient, or if a more comprehensive consideration of multiple vascular factors and modeling of their multifactorial nature, as proposed here, is required. This includes accounting for additional comorbidities such as hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. This will be an important step in translating the findings into clinical practice, where systolic and diastolic pressures (and heart rate) are more routinely measured.

### High dose interleukin-2 (aldesleukin)-expert consensus on best management practices-2014 [^115XMdre]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Hypotension

This is the most common and important toxicity of HD IL-2 treatment (70% of patients in early studies), reflecting capillary leak, decreased peripheral vascular resistance with high cardiac output, characteristic of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). A variety of causes of gap junctional instability in endothelial cells have been postulated as the underlying mechanism for the leak. The relationship of capillary leak to the hypotension is uncertain as changes in peripheral vascular resistance may produce decreases in blood pressure even in the absence of capillary leak. Hypotension is largely unavoidable and may be viewed as a clinic-dynamic parameter for drug administration. Standing orders should specify a new baseline tolerable systolic blood pressure of at least 20 points lower than baseline was prior to initiating IL-2. In addition, a wide pulse pressure should be expected from a decrease in diastolic pressure. The baseline values should be customized for each patient taking into account the individual's cardiac status and prior exposure to tyrosine kinase inhibitors directed at the vascular endothelial growth factor pathway. During treatment this level of hypotension becomes the new baseline that is the goal for the entire dosing period. Typically, the acceptable target systolic pressure is about 80–90 mmHg for patients without cardiac risk factors, but may be adjusted upward in patients who are at higher risk of coronary or cerebral artery disease. Management of blood pressure also requires maintaining an acceptable heart rate which will be discussed later.

### Large-artery stiffness, hypertension and cardiovascular risk in older patients [^111hxBAp]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2005). Medium credibility.

Research studies on hypertension have, so far, generally focused on vascular resistance and small arteries. The high prevalence of systolic hypertension in patients older than 50 years and the development of noninvasive Doppler and echotracking techniques have made it possible to determine large-artery stiffness with a high degree of reproducibility. Increased arterial stiffness and disturbed wave reflections are the basis for understanding reduced aortic elasticity and systolic hypertension, particularly in older people. This hemodynamic pattern results from mechanical factors and other pressure-independent risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure, obesity and severe atherosclerosis. Distinct phenotypes of arterial stiffness and pulse pressure result from specific gene polymorphisms, such as those related to the renin-angiotensin system. The roles of arterial stiffness and wave reflections in hypertension have been elucidated by modern interpretations of the blood-pressure curve in relation to its propagation, mechanisms of systolic-blood-pressure amplification, and the pulse-pressure amplitude. New predictors of cardiovascular risk have been identified, such as increased pulse pressure and pulse-wave velocity, and disturbed wave reflections, all of which are independent predictors of cardiovascular risk that are more powerful than either systolic or diastolic blood pressure alone. Therapeutic trials are investigating ways to reduce stiffness, and thereby allow the selective reduction of systolic and pulse pressure in hypertensive patients with or without advanced renal failure. Modern pharmacologic agents need to be identified, which could reduce systolic hypertension in patients older than 50 years. Here we discuss the structural and functional factors that influence arterial stiffness, wave reflections and pulse pressure in hypertension, as well as their related roles in cardiovascular risk.

### Diastolic hypotension due to intensive blood pressure therapy: is it harmful? [^111qRWU6]. Atherosclerosis (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Reducing the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) below a certain threshold may lead to inadequate organ perfusion. This raises some concerns, because pharmacotherapy reduces both systolic and diastolic pressure. We aimed to investigate whether a pathway from intensive systolic blood pressure (SBP) treatment influences cardiovascular outcomes by inducing too low DBP.

Methods

We had access to data from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) including 9361 patients with a SBP of 130 mmHg or higher and an increased cardiovascular risk. In a formal mediation analysis, we investigated whether the effect of intense (target SBP: 120 mm Hg) vs. standard (target SBP: 140 mmHg) intervention on a composite endpoint would be mediated through an indirect, potentially harmful, effect through low DBP (< 60 mmHg).

Results

Adjusting for treatment, we find that low DBP per se is associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes (HR 1.90 (95% CI [1.46, 2.47]). However, in a formal mediation analyses, we observed that the unadjusted indirect effect of intensive blood pressure treatment going through low DBP of HR 1.12 (95% CI [1.06, 1.18]) attenuates to a statistically non-significant effect of HR 1.04 (95% CI [0.98, 1.10]) after adjustment for important covariates, suggesting that the mere association is considerably confounded.

Conclusions

The increased risk in subjects with diastolic pressure below 60 cannot fully be explained by the intensive treatment itself, but may be due to other measured factors. More generally, this analysis shows that adjusting for mediator-outcome confounding is essential, even in RCTs.

### Association of C-reactive protein with blood pressure and hypertension: life course confounding and mendelian randomization tests of causality [^113uNbuf]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

C-reactive protein (CRP) has repeatedly been associated with blood pressure and prevalent and incident hypertension, but whether a causal link exists is uncertain.

Methods and Results

We assessed the cross-sectional relations of CRP to systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, and prevalent hypertension in a representative sample of > 3500 British women aged 60 to 79 years. For both outcomes, substantial associations were observed. However, these associations were greatly attenuated by adjustment for a wide range of confounding factors acting over the life course. We further investigated causality using a Mendelian randomization approach by examining the association of the 1059G/C polymorphism in the human CRP gene with CRP and with blood pressure, pulse pressure, and hypertension. The polymorphism was associated with a robust difference in CRP, and the expectation would be for higher blood pressure and pulse pressure and greater prevalence of hypertension among those carrying the genetic variant associated with higher CRP levels. This was not observed, and the predicted causal effects of CRP on blood pressure, pulse pressure, and hypertension using instrumental variables methods were close to 0, although with wide CIs.

Conclusions

CRP levels are associated with blood pressure, pulse pressure, and hypertension, but adjustment for life course confounding and a Mendelian randomization approach suggest the elevated CRP levels do not lead to elevated blood pressure.

### Age-dependent association of alcohol drinking with pulse pressure [^114Z7Jzt]. Journal of Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Wide pulse pressure is a potent risk factor for atherosclerotic disease, and hypertension is induced by habitual alcohol drinking. This concise study investigated whether age affects the relationship between alcohol drinking and pulse pressure.

Methods

The participants were 99 661 male workers (20–69 years old) who had received periodic health check-ups. The mean levels of pulse pressure and blood pressure were compared among three different groups divided by the average amount of daily alcohol intake (nondrinkers; light drinkers, < 30 g ethanol/day; heavy drinkers, ≥ 30 g ethanol/day) in each age group.

Results

The mean pulse pressure was decreased in the thirties and forties age groups compared with that in the twenties age group, and then was increased with advance of age in the fifties and sixties age groups. Pulse pressure was significantly wider in heavy drinkers than in nondrinkers and light drinkers in all age groups, and the difference between pulse pressure of nondrinkers and that of heavy drinkers was greater in the fifties and sixties age groups than in the younger groups. Pulse pressure in light drinkers was significantly wider than that in nondrinkers in the fifties and sixties age groups but was not different from that in nondrinkers in the twenties to forties age groups.

Conclusions

Association of alcohol intake with pulse pressure is dependent on the amount of alcohol and is stronger in the elderly. Age as well as amount of alcohol intake should therefore be taken into account when the influence of alcohol drinking on pulse pressure is considered.

RESULTS

Population characteristics

Of all participants, 14.3% were categorized as wide PP. Body composition, including BMI, BF%, waist circumference, WHR, FMI and FFMI were significantly higher in those with wide PP. Participants with wide PP were also older and physically inactive than their counterparties (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Characteristics of the participants

Distribution of pulse pressure by age

Overall, women had a lower mean PP than men until around the mean menopausal age of 52 years, after which PP in women was greater and increased faster with age (Fig. 1). A similar pattern was observed in urban and rural areas, although the age point when women and men had the same mean PP was much lower in rural areas than in urban areas (about 48 vs. 60 years).

### A study of inter-arm blood pressure differences in primary care [^112wAthD]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate whether there are inter-arm blood pressure differences that are of clinical importance to general practice.

Design and Setting

Pragmatic study with randomised order of use of left or right arm carried out in routine surgeries in an inner city and suburban general practice.

Subjects

There were 237 patients presenting opportunistically for blood pressure measurement to a nurse or general practitioner.

Main Outcome Measures

95% limits of agreement between measurements on the left and right arm and bias between arms.

Results

Large inter-arm blood pressure differences exist reflected in wide 95% limits of agreement; -16 mm Hg to 24 mm Hg for the right minus the left arm diastolic blood pressure. There is a small but statistically significant bias to the right arm blood pressure measuring higher than the left (3.7 mm Hg diastolic, 2.4 to 5 mm Hg 95% confidence intervals). An interarm difference of 10 mm Hg or greater for diastolic blood pressure occurred in 40% of subjects and a difference of 20 mm Hg or more for systolic blood pressure occurred in 23% of subjects.

Conclusions

In a primary care setting blood pressure should be measured routinely in both arms. If one arm is to be preferred for pragmatic clinical purposes, then this should be the right arm.

### Optimizing observer performance of clinic blood pressure measurement: a position statement from the Lancet commission on hypertension group [^1118MqK8]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

High blood pressure (BP) is the leading modifiable risk factor for death and disability in the world, affecting an estimated 1.4 billion adults globally, and leading to over 10 million deaths per year. It is a leading cause of heart disease, stroke, and chronic kidney disease and a major contributor to escalating healthcare costs. With an overall global adult prevalence of 31%, high BP is highly prevalent in all major regions of the world. However, in absolute numbers, it is low-to-middle income countries (LMICs) that bear the highest burden of illness, having over one billion individuals affected, and possessing awareness, treatment and control proportions that lag high-income countries to a considerable degree. Accordingly, ongoing efforts to improve the diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and control of hypertension globally must include tailored interventions that prioritize reductions in regional disparities.

Accurate and reliable BP measurement is essential for the proper diagnosis and management of hypertension. On a population-wide level, a 5-mmHg difference in SBP corresponds to an estimated 6% absolute and 30% relative change in hypertension prevalence. Accordingly, the effect of a 5-mmHg error in BP measurement, assuming a global prevalence of 1.4 billion, could lead to the incorrect classification of hypertension status in 84 million individuals worldwide. Therefore, the ramifications of inaccurate measurement on a global level are profound.

Blood pressure is a physiological parameter that changes constantly in response to endogenous factors and exogenous stimuli. This variability makes assessment of 'usual' BP, which is defined as an individual's true or genuine BP, challenging. BP measurement is perhaps the most commonly performed procedure in clinical medicine and, although, at first glance, it seems simple, in reality, many steps must be performed sequentially and optimally in order to produce a reproducible result reflective of usual BP. Accordingly, the individual responsible for measuring BP, herein referred to as the 'observer', must be meticulous in terms of following recommended techniques. The challenges posed by the variable nature of BP were recognized over a century ago by Riva-Rocci et al. who noted that taking multiple measurements and standardizing the measurement conditions could optimize use of the technique in clinical practice. He concludes, in his seminal paper written in 1896, that '… if the procedures are neglected, and the doctor is satisfied with a crude reading, the method will become useless and will be quickly abandoned as a scientists' indulgence'.

### Relative and absolute risk to guide the management of pulse pressure, an age-related cardiovascular risk factor [^112xCyvh]. American Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Using 24-hour ambulatory monitoring, the state-of-the-art method in BP assessment, we demonstrated that below 50 years of age, higher PP associated with lower risk. In older adults, the incidence of death, the composite cardiovascular endpoint, and the 3 secondary endpoints showed a direct and graded positive association with PP. From 50 years onwards, absolute risk as captured by the incidence of endpoints steadily increased. Age was the predominant driver of mortality and cardiovascular complications in the older adults. Nonetheless, adjustment for age on top of cohort and sex attenuated, but did not remove, the graded rise in the rates of the primary and secondary endpoints across increasing PP quartiles. In heatmaps showing the fully adjusted risk associated with PP and age, both analyzed as continuously distributed variables, the relative risk of death, a cardiovascular endpoint or stroke in relation to PP decreased > 3-fold, whereas absolute risk rose by a factor 3.

### Prevalent influence of systolic over pulse pressure on left ventricular mass in essential hypertension [^112cLTmo]. European Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated pulse pressure, an index of increased large artery stiffness, has been associated with increased left ventricular mass. It is unknown whether this relation is independent or mediated by other blood pressure components.

Methods and Results

We examined data in 2545 untreated hypertensive subjects (45% women) who underwent echocardiography and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Left ventricular mass increased with all blood pressure components and all associations were closer with ambulatory than with office blood pressure. In a multiple regression analysis, after adjustment for the significant association with age, gender, body weight and duration of hypertension, the proportion of variability of left ventricular mass explained by systolic blood pressure was greater than that explained by other blood pressure components. When different blood pressure components were forced into the same model, the same degree of left ventricular mass variability was accounted for by models including 24-h systolic blood pressure alone, or 24-h mean blood pressure plus 24-h pulse pressure, or 24-h diastolic blood pressure plus 24-h pulse pressure. When 24-h systolic blood pressure and 24-h pulse pressure were forced into the same model, 24-h pulse pressure lost statistical significance.

Conclusions

The association between pulse pressure and left ventricular mass is explained by systolic blood pressure, which is the main pressure determinant of left ventricular mass in essential hypertension.

### Underdiagnosis of isolated systolic and isolated diastolic hypertension [^111oXnv6]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Systolic and diastolic hypertension independently predict the risk of adverse cardiovascular events. It remains unclear how systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, and other patient characteristics influence the initial diagnosis of hypertension. Here, we use a cohort of 146,816 adults in a large healthcare system to examine how elevated systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure measurements influence initial diagnosis of hypertension and how other patient characteristics influence the diagnosis. Thirty-four percent of the cohort were diagnosed with hypertension within 1 year. In multivariable logistic regression of the diagnosis of hypertension, controlling for covariates, isolated systolic hypertensive measures (odds ratio [OR] 0.42 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.41 to 0.43]) and isolated diastolic hypertensive measures (OR 0.32 [95% CI 0.31 to 0.33]) were less likely to lead to hypertension diagnosis when compared with combined hypertensive measures. Higher levels of systolic blood pressure had a greater impact on hypertension diagnosis (OR 1.77 [95% CI 1.75 to 1.79] per Z-score) than did higher levels of diastolic blood pressure (OR 1.34 [95% CI 1.32 to 1.36] per Z-score). Older age, non-white race/ethnicity, and medical comorbidities all predicted the establishment of a diagnosis of hypertension. Isolated systolic and isolated diastolic hypertension are underdiagnosed in clinical practice, and several patient-centered factors also strongly influence whether a diagnosis is made. In conclusion, our findings uncover a care gap that can be closed with increased attention to the independent influence of systolic and diastolic hypertension and the various patient-centered factors that may impact hypertension diagnosis.

### Blood pressure and the new ACC / AHA hypertension guidelines [^115GPRbD]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines cover virtually all aspects of the diagnosis, evaluation, monitoring, secondary causes as well as drug and non-drug treatment of hypertension. Substantial and appropriate emphasis has been given to the strategies necessary for accurate measurement of blood pressure in any setting where valid blood pressure measurements are desired. Most "errors" made during blood pressure measurement bias readings upwards resulting in over-diagnosis of hypertension and, amongst those already on drug therapy, underestimating the true magnitude of blood pressure lowering resulting in over-treatment. Hypertension is diagnosed when blood pressure is consistently ≥ 130 and/or ≥ 80 mm Hg. However, the majority of patients with hypertension between 130–139/80–89 mm Hg (stage 1 hypertension) do not qualify for immediate drug therapy. The guideline breaks new ground with some of its recommendations. Absolute cardiovascular risk is utilized, for the first time, to determine high-risk status when BP 130–139/80–89 mm Hg (Stage 1 hypertension) and high-risk patient characteristics/co-morbidities are absent including age 65 and older, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, known cardiovascular disease; high-risk individuals initiate drug therapy when BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg. The exception amongst high-risk individuals is for secondary stroke prevention in drug naïve individuals as drug therapy is initiated when blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. Non-high risk individuals will initiate drug therapy when BP is ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. Irrespective of blood pressure threshold for initiation of drug therapy, the target BP is minimally < 130/80 mm Hg in most. However, target BP is < 130 systolic amongst those 65 and older as the committee made no recommendation for a DBP target. Treatment should be initiated with two drugs having complementary mechanisms of action when blood pressure is > 20/10 mm Hg above goal.

### Systolic blood pressure and longitudinal progression of arterial stiffness: a Quantitative meta-analysis [^1135d8Uh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Arterial stiffness predicts the risk of cardiovascular events and all‐cause mortality and is associated with age and hypertension. However, the magnitude of the relationship between blood pressure (BP) and progression of arterial stiffness is unclear, limiting our understanding of how arterial stiffness mediates clinical effects of hypertension and planning of clinical trials.

Methods and Results

Medline and EMBASE were searched for prospective studies reporting linear models between baseline BP and progression of arterial stiffness, with and without adjustment for demographic characteristics and baseline stiffness. Standardized and unstandardized β coefficients for pulse wave velocity were combined by fixed and random effects meta‐analysis, weighted by the inverse variance. Of 566 fully reviewed articles from 30, 524 titles, 22 populations from 21 reports were included. In 9 cohorts, there were consistent, adjusted associations between baseline systolic BP and progression of arterial stiffness (11 781 patients; standardized β = 0.041; 95% CI, 0.026–0.055; P < 0.001; P value for heterogeneity = 0.70), equivalent to a 1.14‐m/s increase in standard carotid‐femoral pulse wave velocity per decade per 20–mm Hg systolic BP, independent of age. Unstandardized, adjusted associations were similar (1762 patients; β = 0.0047; 95% CI, 0.004–0.006; P < 0.001; P value for heterogeneity = 0.64), equivalent to a 0.94‐m/s increase per decade per 20–mm Hg systolic BP. In limited studies, standardized associations between mean BP and arterial stiffness progression were not significant and heterogeneous (913 patients; β = 0.039; 95% CI, −0.008 to 0.086; P = 0.11; P value for heterogeneity = 0.03).

Conclusions

Baseline systolic BP was associated with a clinically important progression of arterial stiffness, independent of age, providing a reference for the potential effect of arterial stiffness in mediating changes in clinical outcomes associated with hypertension and providing a reference value to aid clinical trial design.

### Relationship between brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity and incident hypertension according to 2017 ACC / AHA high blood pressure guidelines [^112cbBXP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Blood pressure is a strong risk factor of cardiovascular events such as coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. 1, 2, 3 Globally, the prevalence of hypertension is predicted to increase to a total of 1.56 billion people. 4 Thus, early detection or prediction of hypertension is important from the perspective that cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality, disability, and global healthcare costs. 5

Arterial stiffness is one of the earliest detectable manifestations of adverse structural and functional changes within the vessel wall. 6 The relationship between arterial stiffness and hypertension has been reported in several studies. 7, 8 Blood pressure and vascular stiffness are interdependent. Increased blood pressure can damage blood vessels and accelerate vascular stiffness, and arterial stiffening increases pressure pulsatility and systolic blood pressure. 9 Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a reliable and noninvasive tool for measuring arterial stiffness. In addition, PWV is a reproducible, accurate, and negative prognostic factor of arterial stiffness. 10, 11, 12 Although carotid‐femoral PWV has traditionally been widely used to identify associations with cardiovascular disease such as coronary artery disease, brachial‐ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) has also become more widely used in recent years. 13, 14, 15

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) recently released revised guidelines for hypertension with lower blood pressure thresholds compared with previous guidelines (systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 versus 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 80 versus 90 mm Hg). 16, 17 These changes are expected to increase the prevalence of patients with hypertension, especially in higher‐risk populations compared with the general population. 18

Although carotid‐femoral PWV is the gold standard for estimating arterial stiffness, 19, 20 baPWV has recently been reported to be correlated with carotid‐femoral PWV. 15, 21 In addition, baPWV is easy to measure, requiring no special techniques or training. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between arterial stiffness as measured by baPWV and incident hypertension based on revised guidelines. We assessed whether an increase in PWV could predict the onset of hypertension.

than 140 mm Hg with a diastolic BP greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg by the JNC7 criteria. 3 Prior studies suggest that IDH is more common in younger individuals, is associated with future systolic hypertension, but is generally not associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease outcomes independently of baseline systolic BP. 4–14. In all 3 cohorts, we defined IDH as a systolic BP less than 130 mm Hg with a diastolic BP greater than or equal to 80 mm Hg by 2017 ACC/AHA criteria1 and a systolic BP less than 140 mm Hg with a diastolic BP greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg by JNC7 criteria.
3. Second, we adjusted for antihypertensive medication use and systolic BP as time-varying variables by updating information over the course of follow-up.

Third, we conducted analyses of the associations between IDH and ASCVD using a uniform reference group consisting of participants with systolic BP less than 120 mm Hg and diastolic BP less than 80 mm Hg.

We plotted the adjusted hazard ratio vs on-treatment diastolic BP. The × 100 is the percent increase in risk associated with the 5–mm Hg lower on-treatment diastolic BP. In the second analysis, we calculated HRs in 5–mm Hg decrements of on-treatment diastolic BP, as in the SHEP study. 15 For each cutoff value, outcome was compared between patients with diastolic BP below that level and patients with diastolic BP at or above that level. Adjustment was performed as described, with inclusion of on-treatment systolic BP as a dichotomized variable, as in the SHEP trial. 15 These analyses were repeated with on-treatment systolic BP as a continuous variable and without systolic BP. All analyses were performed on the basis of intention to treat. A 2-tailed P ≤. 05 was considered statistically significant. These values were, respectively, 78. 8 ±
6. 0 mm Hg and 83. 6 ±
6. 4 mm Hg for diastolic BP.

Table 2 gives the distribution of mean diastolic BP and of all diastolic BP measurements in the 2 groups. This conclusion is supported by the results from the European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly trial in which patients with low on-treatment BP had lower values for body mass index and hemoglobin, which can be considered indicators of poor health.
20. The SHEP investigators concluded that lower achieved diastolic BP was associated with increased risk of CHD, stroke, and cardiovascular disease in actively treated patients; thus, some patients may have been overtreated. 15 The relative risk for the combined cardiovascular events became significant for diastolic BP less than 70 mm Hg and approached a 2-fold increase in risk for diastolic BP less than 55 mm Hg. Several differences between the SHEP trail and the Syst-Eur Trial should be considered.

The cutoff value for diastolic BP required for randomization into the trial was 90 mm Hg in the SHEP trial and 95 mm Hg in the Syst-Eur Trial. The SHEP trial investigators could analyze on-treatment diastolic BP down to 25 mm Hg, whereas diastolic BP was rarely less than 55 mm Hg in the Syst-Eur Trial.

### Systolic vs diastolic blood pressure control in the hypertensive patients of the PAMELA population… [^111rMS4j]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

Background Previous studies have shown that in the treated fraction of the hypertensive population, blood pressure control is less common for systolic BP than for diastolic BP as measured in the physician's office. Whether this phenomenon is artifactually attributable to a temporary increase in BP owing to a "white-coat" effect or represents a true rarity of SBP control in daily life is unknown. for diastolic BP; ie, that in a number of patients, DBP values are lower than 90 mm Hg, while SBP values remain above 140 mm Hg. 10–12 This finding has important adverse implications for public health, because in the general population SBP has been shown to be an equal or even more important cardiovascular risk factor than DBP. 13, 14 Furthermore, in elderly individuals with hypertension, a reduction in SBP by treatment has often been shown to be a more important determinant of a patient's protection from cardiovascular disease than a reduction in DBP.
15.

The present analysis of the PAMELA data adds 2 pieces of evidence to these results: the rare BP control of the treated hypertensive subjects of the PAMELA population is more commonly attributable to an inadequate reduction of SBP than of DBP; once again, the rare BP control involves not only office values but home and ambulatory BP values as well. One explanation is that current hypertensive drugs are less effective in lowering SBP than DBP, because the alteration involved in an SBP elevation, ie, an increase in arterial stiffness, 23 is less easily reversible than the alteration that is involved in a DBP elevation, ie, an increase in arteriolar resistance to blood flow. 23 The second explanation is that physicians titrate antihypertensive treatment of DBP and terminate further therapeutic efforts once DBP values are lower than 90 mm Hg, even when SBP values are higher than 140 mm Hg.

It should be emphasized that both these explanations may be valid, because large-scale studies of isolated systolic hypertension have shown that drug treatment based on SBP reduction rarely lowers SBP values below 140 mm Hg. 24–26 Furthermore, in the large number of patients with systodiastolic hypertension who were recruited for the Hypertension Optimal Treatment study, 27 a reduction of DBP well below 90 mm Hg was achieved, even when the SBP remained above 140 mm Hg.

### The relative importance of focusing on elevations of systolic vs diastolic blood pressure… [^112YSVWZ]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Since the invention of indirect auscultatory sphygmomanometry at the turn of the century, physicians have tended to focus more on treating elevations of diastolic blood pressure than elevations of systolic blood pressure. As described by Rutan et al, 1 the primary focus on DBP resulted from theoretical concerns that the level of DBP was more related to end organ damage. Also, as mentioned by Mann2 in the review article in this edition, the original Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study, the first to prove benefit in treating high blood pressure, focused on DBP. The fact that SBP rises on average throughout the life span in industrialized societies gave impetus to the notion that elevation of SBP was an aging-related phenomenon attributable to decreased compliance of the major arteries. A common clinical dictum for years was that a normal SBP for older persons was "100 plus the person's age. " Therefore. Applegate WB.
