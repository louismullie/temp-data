## Question

When to order progesterone level in pregnancy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to order a progesterone level in pregnancy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical contexts where progesterone testing is actually useful versus where it is discouraged. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for each scenario, including thresholds and diagnostic performance. Next, I will align recommendations with major guidelines and highlight exceptions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and note limitations and controversies so we do not overgeneralize.

> Let me first confirm the overarching principle: routine progesterone testing is not recommended in normal, asymptomatic pregnancies, and it should not be used to screen for ectopic pregnancy or to guide routine management of threatened miscarriage without a specific indication, so I need to ensure I anchor on that before listing exceptions [^a9c4fae5] [^82484632] [^bae013dc].

> Now, I will examine the strongest evidence-based indication, which is in early pregnancy when a patient presents with pain or bleeding and the ultrasound is inconclusive. In this setting, a single serum progesterone can help rule out a viable pregnancy when it is very low, with pooled sensitivity around 74.6% and specificity around 98.4% using thresholds roughly 3.2–6 ng/mL, yielding a positive likelihood ratio near 45 and raising the probability of non-viability to about 99% when progesterone is low, though it cannot distinguish ectopic from intrauterine non-viable pregnancies, so I should be careful not to over-interpret it for localization [^d2296ac8] [^a85ddf40] [^c0fef8a6].

> Wait, let me verify the practical thresholds and performance characteristics so I do not misstate them. Multiple meta-analyses converge on the same message: progesterone less than about 3.2–6 ng/mL strongly predicts non-viability in symptomatic patients with inconclusive ultrasound, whereas higher values are less informative and cannot reliably confirm viability, reinforcing that progesterone is most useful to rule out viability when low rather than to rule in viability when normal or high [^d2296ac8] [^a85ddf40] [^c0fef8a6].

> Next, I should review threatened miscarriage without ultrasound confirmation. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — while some studies suggest progesterone less than about 10–12 ng/mL may predict miscarriage in this group, the evidence is weaker and more heterogeneous, and importantly, progesterone supplementation has not been shown to improve outcomes in unselected threatened miscarriage, so ordering progesterone here is primarily prognostic rather than therapeutic, and I need to counsel patients accordingly [^674676da] [^e57a6668] [^819f97ac] [^0b73f2e7].

> I will now examine recurrent pregnancy loss. Historically, I thought progesterone testing might help identify luteal phase deficiency, but wait, I should double-check that — there is no validated diagnostic test for luteal phase defect, and routine progesterone testing is not recommended to diagnose LPD or guide therapy in RPL, even though empiric progesterone may be considered in select RPL patients with bleeding in current pregnancy, so I should not order progesterone levels to diagnose LPD in RPL [^42946ae2] [^991f1ab7] [^35ad11ec] [^f0c25810].

> Let me consider preterm birth prevention, because this is where progesterone is therapeutic rather than diagnostic. I should confirm that we do not order progesterone levels to decide whether to treat; instead, we treat based on risk factors such as prior spontaneous preterm birth or a short cervix, typically identified on routine anatomy scan or by serial cervical length, and we offer vaginal progesterone for cervical length 25 mm or less, with shared decision-making for 21–25 mm, while 17-OHPC is no longer routinely recommended due to withdrawn FDA approval and mixed efficacy data, so progesterone levels are not used to guide initiation here [^a513a189] [^a1ac9fff] [^dc82a60b] [^7f4d2762] [^d2374cbe] [^b20aa9a9].

> But wait, what if the patient is undergoing assisted reproduction? I need to check whether progesterone monitoring changes management in fresh or frozen embryo transfer. In ART, progesterone is routinely provided for luteal support, and while some programs measure progesterone around transfer, evidence does not support using a single progesterone level to decide on rescue dosing or to predict outcomes reliably, so I should avoid ordering progesterone levels to titrate luteal support in ART unless following a specific protocol or research question [^d5f35219] [^0ed93ff1] [^1bd496db].

> I should confirm a few additional scenarios where progesterone testing is discouraged. Do not order progesterone to predict ectopic pregnancy, to diagnose early pregnancy loss when ultrasound is diagnostic, or to monitor routine luteal function in asymptomatic patients, and avoid using progesterone levels to guide supplementation in unselected threatened miscarriage, given the lack of benefit and potential for false reassurance or overtreatment [^a9c4fae5] [^82484632] [^bae013dc] [^819f97ac].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. Order a single serum progesterone when a patient presents with pain or bleeding in early pregnancy, typically before 12 weeks, and the ultrasound is inconclusive for viability, using it to help rule out a viable pregnancy if progesterone is very low, while recognizing it does not localize the pregnancy. Do not order progesterone in asymptomatic pregnancies, for ectopic screening, or to diagnose luteal phase defect, and do not use progesterone levels to decide whether to start vaginal progesterone for preterm birth prevention, which should be based on history and cervical length rather than serum values [^d2296ac8] [^a85ddf40] [^a9c4fae5] [^a513a189] [^a1ac9fff].

> Finally, I should double-check limitations and controversies so counseling is balanced. Progesterone is secreted in pulses and varies with gestational age, so a single value may not reflect true luteal function, thresholds vary across assays, and low progesterone may be a marker of failing pregnancy rather than its cause, which is why supplementation has not shown benefit in unselected threatened miscarriage despite plausible biology, reinforcing that progesterone testing should be reserved for well-supported indications and interpreted cautiously [^42946ae2] [^7413913f] [^819f97ac].

Order progesterone testing in pregnancy when there is **first-trimester bleeding or pain with inconclusive ultrasound** [^d2296ac8] to help distinguish viable from non-viable pregnancies; a single progesterone level has high specificity for non-viability when low (≤ 5–10 ng/mL) [^d2296ac8] [^51f153a6]. Do not use progesterone to **diagnose ectopic pregnancy** [^a9c4fae5] or to guide routine management of threatened miscarriage, as it does not change outcomes [^819f97ac] [^0b73f2e7]. Progesterone is not indicated for routine monitoring in asymptomatic pregnancies or for preterm birth prevention decisions, which rely on cervical length and history rather than serum levels [^a513a189] [^a1ac9fff].

## Indications for progesterone testing in pregnancy

### First-trimester bleeding or pain with inconclusive ultrasound

- **Indication**: Order progesterone when a patient presents with bleeding or pain in early pregnancy and transvaginal ultrasound is inconclusive, to help differentiate viable from non-viable pregnancies [^d2296ac8].

- **Diagnostic utility**: A single progesterone level is highly specific for non-viable pregnancy when low (≤ 5–10 ng/mL) [^d2296ac8] [^51f153a6], with pooled specificity 98.4% and positive likelihood ratio 45 [^d2296ac8].

- **Limitation**: Progesterone cannot distinguish ectopic from intrauterine non-viable pregnancies and should not be used to diagnose ectopic pregnancy [^a9c4fae5] [^d2296ac8].

---

### Threatened miscarriage

In threatened miscarriage, progesterone may be considered to **assess risk**, but it should not guide routine management because supplementation does not improve outcomes in unselected patients [^819f97ac] [^0b73f2e7]. Evidence shows that a low progesterone level predicts miscarriage, yet **routine supplementation is not recommended** outside of specific contexts (e.g. recurrent pregnancy loss with bleeding) [^674676da] [^35ad11ec].

---

### Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL)

In RPL, progesterone testing is **not routinely recommended** to diagnose luteal phase defect, as there is no validated diagnostic test for LPD [^42946ae2] [^991f1ab7]. However, progesterone supplementation may be considered in select patients with RPL and bleeding, but testing is not required to guide therapy [^35ad11ec] [^f0c25810].

---

### Preterm birth prevention

For preterm birth prevention, progesterone testing is **not indicated**; decisions are based on cervical length and history rather than serum progesterone [^a513a189] [^a1ac9fff]. Vaginal progesterone is recommended for singleton pregnancies with a short cervix (≤ 25 mm) or prior spontaneous preterm birth, without reliance on serum progesterone levels [^a513a189] [^a1ac9fff].

---

## Situations where progesterone testing is not recommended

- **Routine screening**: Do not order progesterone in asymptomatic pregnancies or as routine screening [^notfound].

- **Ectopic pregnancy**: Do not use progesterone to diagnose ectopic pregnancy; it cannot reliably distinguish ectopic from intrauterine non-viable pregnancies [^a9c4fae5] [^d2296ac8].

- **Monitoring supplementation**: Do not use serum progesterone to monitor or adjust progesterone supplementation, as levels do not reflect local endometrial effects [^c1b5b89f].

---

## Interpretation of progesterone results

| **Progesterone level** | **Clinical interpretation** | **Recommended action** |
|-|-|-|
| ≤ 5–10 ng/mL | High likelihood of non-viable pregnancy | - Confirm with repeat ultrasound <br/> - Serial hCG measurements [^d2296ac8] [^bae013dc] |
| 10–20 ng/mL | Indeterminate; viable pregnancy possible | - Repeat ultrasound <br/> - Serial hCG measurements [^d2296ac8] [^bae013dc] |
| ≥ 20 ng/mL | Likely viable pregnancy | - Reassure <br/> - Routine follow-up [^d2296ac8] |

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Variability**: Progesterone is secreted in pulses, causing significant intra-individual variability and limiting the reliability of single measurements [^42946ae2] [^2b7f44f9].

- **Assay differences**: Laboratory assays vary, and there is no universally accepted standard for progesterone measurement in early pregnancy [^notfound].

- **Clinical context**: Always interpret progesterone results alongside clinical findings, ultrasound, and hCG trends [^d2296ac8] [^bae013dc].

---

Progesterone testing is most useful in early pregnancy with bleeding or pain and an **inconclusive ultrasound** to help identify non-viable pregnancies, but it is not for routine screening, ectopic diagnosis, or guiding supplementation.

Progesterone supplementation for prevention of recurrent preterm birth — key recommendations state that vaginal progesterone may be considered for patients with a history of preterm birth, singleton gestation, and a shortened cervix; however, it has not been proven effective without a shortened cervix and should not be considered as an alternative to 17-OHPC. Intramuscular 17-OHPC is not recommended for the primary prevention of preterm birth in patients with a history of spontaneous preterm birth. Dependent upon cervical length measurement, prior pregnancy history, and past treatment, a discussion of available interventions should occur and a collaborative action plan should be developed.

### Diagnosis and treatment of luteal phase deficiency: a committee opinion [^42946ae2]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Progesterone levels for assessing luteal function — while luteal serum progesterone levels are commonly used in the absence of pregnancy, progesterone levels typically peak 6–8 days after ovulation, and a luteal progesterone value of > 3 ng/mL is considered indicative of ovulation, yet no minimum serum progesterone concentration defines normal or fertile luteal function. Progesterone is secreted in pulses with values oscillating between 5 and 40 ng/mL, making single random measurements difficult to interpret; in ovulatory cycles, luteal progesterone values of < 5 ng/mL occur 8.4% of the time and values of < 10 ng/mL occur 31.3% of the time, and therefore, there are substantial limitations to diagnosing LPD using a single progesterone level. To capture overall luteal production, an integrated luteal phase progesterone value of < 80 ng/mL has been proposed as a diagnostic test for LPD, and as an alternate criterion 3 daily luteal progesterone values obtained between luteal phase days 5–9 totaling < 30 ng/mL have been proposed, but this test has not been clinically validated and may be clinically impractical.

### Should progesterone on the human chorionic gonadotropin day still be measured? [^1bd496db]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate in our setting whether there is currently a level of P on the hCG day (P-hCG) predictive of no pregnancy.

Design

Observational study of prospectively collected data of the P-hCG levels of stimulated IVF cycles.

Setting

In vitro fertilization unit.

Patient(S)

All cycles of IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection with fresh embryo transfer performed between January 2009 and March 2014.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Pregnancy rate.

Result(S)

Clinical pregnancy rate per ET was 38.7% and live birth rate was 29.1%. The P-hCG concentration was positively correlated to E2 on the hCG day, and the number of oocytes was negatively correlated to age. Progesterone on hCG day was higher among agonist- compared with antagonist-treated patients (mean ± SD: 1.13 ± 0.69 ng/mL vs. 0.97 ± 0.50 ng/mL) and among recombinant FSH compared with recombinant FSH + hMG stimulation (mean ± SD: 1.11 ± 0.58 ng/mL vs. 0.94 ± 0.50 ng/mL). Pregnancy rate was positively associated with the number of oocytes. There was no correlation between P-hCG value and pregnancy rate, overall or according to the type of treatment.

Conclusion(S)

In our setting there is no P-hCG value differentiating a good from a poor cycle success rate.

American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) clinical guidance — progesterone for prevention of recurrent preterm birth: At this time, the body of evidence is described as "equivocal regarding the effectiveness of 17-OHPC", and the noted FDA action "will limit access to 17-OHPC for patients". The guidance further states that "the body of evidence does not indicate that vaginal progesterone is effective for the prevention of recurrent preterm birth in singleton pregnancies with a prior preterm birth between 20 and 37 weeks of gestation in the absence of a shortened cervix". For patients "with a singleton pregnancy and prior spontaneous preterm birth", clinicians "should be assessed with serial endovaginal ultrasound cervical length measurement", and, "dependent upon cervical length measurement, prior pregnancy history, and past treatment", a discussion of available interventions "should occur and a collaborative action plan should be developed".

2 ROLE OF PROGESTERONE IN PREGNANCY MAINTENANCE

Progesterone clearly plays a role in the maintenance of pregnancy. Circulating levels of progesterone rise during pregnancy: the major source (in humans) is the corpus luteum until approximately week 8 of pregnancy, and the placenta thereafter. One of the major mechanisms of progesterone action in maintaining pregnancy is inhibition of the contractions of the myometrium: research has demonstrated the relaxant effect of progesterone on myometrial strips in vitro.

The importance of progesterone in maintaining human pregnancy in vivo has been demonstrated by studies administering receptor antagonists such as mifepristone (RU486). If administered in early pregnancy, mifepristone increases uterine contractility in vivo, sensitizes the uterus to the pro‐contractile effects of prostaglandins, and acts as an effective abortifacient (although it is much more effective when combined with prostaglandin). In late pregnancy, mifepristone can be used to induce labor, although its safety in the absence of intrauterine fetal death is unclear. Lastly, the withdrawal of progesterone is probably involved in the spontaneous initiation of labor at term. In many animal species, progesterone withdrawal is caused by a decrease in circulating levels of progesterone. In humans, progesterone levels are maintained until the end of pregnancy and in labor, but complex alterations in progesterone receptor activity result in a decline in progesterone receptor signaling at the time of labor onset (reviewed by Menon et al.).

So, what is the evidence on which the FIGO recommendations for progesterone prophylaxis in women with a short cervix are based? To address this question, it is necessary to consider the efficacy of progesterone, the impact of such a strategy on a population basis, and the long‐term benefits and harmful effects of progesterone treatment in pregnancy.

### Validation of serum progesterone [^a1f3e22b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

We present a proposed cut off serum progesterone value of < 35 nmol/L as a validated threshold level to predict spontaneous miscarriage, which demonstrates both excellent accuracy and acceptable reproducibility. This threshold level allows clinicians to perform risk stratification relating to risk of spontaneous miscarriage, allowing for better prognostication and guiding therapeutic interventions. This model is both clinically applicable and easily implemented, as well as provides research opportunities for future miscarriage intervention studies.

### Progesterone and the luteal phase: a requisite to reproduction [^9f1af158]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Progesterone production from the corpus luteum is critical for natural reproduction. Progesterone supplementation seems to be an important aspect of any assisted reproductive technology treatment. Luteal phase deficiency in natural cycles is a plausible cause of infertility and pregnancy loss, though there is no adequate diagnostic test. This article describes the normal luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, investigates the controversy surrounding luteal phase deficiency, and presents the current literature for progesterone supplementation during assisted reproductive technologies.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 200: early pregnancy loss [^82484632]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 200 — prevention of early pregnancy loss states there are no effective preventive interventions; bed rest should not be recommended; a 2008 Cochrane review found no effect of prophylactic progesterone administration; for threatened early pregnancy loss the use of progestins is controversial with conclusive evidence lacking; and women who have experienced at least three prior pregnancy losses may benefit from progesterone therapy in the first trimester.

### Fertility evaluation of infertile women: a committee opinion [^24c24e35]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Luteal progesterone testing — Serum progesterone determinations provide a reliable and objective measure of ovulation if obtained at the appropriate time in the cycle. A serum progesterone measurement should generally be obtained approximately 1 week before the expected onset of the next menses, rather than on any one specific cycle day (eg, day 21), and a progesterone concentration > 3 ng/mL provides presumptive and sufficient evidence of recent ovulation. Because luteal serum progesterone levels can fluctuate sevenfold over a few hours, a single progesterone value may be used to confirm ovulation, but not to assess the quality of the luteal phase.

### Can single progesterone concentration predict miscarriage in early pregnant women with threatened miscarriage: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c4249e69]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

What ideas does our research provide for clinical applications

Previously, it had been reported that about 50% of women facing threatened miscarriage were affected depressive and anxiety symptomatology. When it comes to the case, they might benefit from an effective treatment or prevention strategy, due to the fear of pregnancy loss, especially for those who had an experience of miscarriage. Unfortunately, there is still absent an effective treatment or prevention strategy. Despite many experimental treatments are frequently prescribed in the real world including exogenous progesterone supplement, the latter had been demonstrated did not improve the clinical outcomes in this subpopulation. As the progesterone concentration < 10 ng/mL can predict a non-viable pregnancy, the issue is how is the prognostic value of progesterone concentration in early pregnant women with threatened miscarriage, especially for those who initially seek medical care and conduct the progesterone measurement. Our findings suggested that serum progesterone < 12 ng/mL at a single measurement can also effectively predict miscarriage in early pregnant patients with threatened miscarriage. Therefore, progesterone, a useful prognostic biomarker, would provide help to make a decision in practice and reduce the anxiety secondary to the threatened miscarriage.

What progress does our research provide for future research?

During the first trimester, serum progesterone levels fluctuate over a 24-hour period, the concentration at a single measurement would be influenced by a short-term pattern of pulses, distribution of the hormone and the diet. Moreover, 7 to 8 weeks is considered to be the stage of the luteal-placental shift, progesterone levels may be plateaus or even decrease trend, attracting the largest attentions during this period with a highest frequency of vaginal bleeding. Whereas few studies explored the performance of progesterone during the period before 7 weeks of gestation. Thus, studies are warranted to be conducted to further validate the prognostic value of progesterone prior 7 weeks of gestation and clarify the optimal time point of single measurement. In addition, the diagnostic performance of progesterone seemed to be little impacted by the exogenous progesterone supplement even thought at a single measurement without specific time point. This deserves to be validated by further studies, given the fact that exogenous progesterone supplement is still widely prescribed in clinical practice.

### Effectiveness of progesterone rescue in women presenting low circulating progesterone levels around the day of embryo transfer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0ed93ff1]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). Medium credibility.

Importance

Over the last decade, frozen embryo transfer (FET) has been increasingly used in contemporary fertility units. Despite the rapid increase in FET, there is still insufficient evidence to recommend an optimized protocol for endometrial preparation especially in patients with lower progesterone (P4) levels. Previous studies have concluded that P4 levels < 10 ng/mL are associated with poorer pregnancy outcomes than those reported with high levels of circulating P4.

Objective

To identify whether rescue P4 dosing in patients with low P4 can salvage adverse outcomes associated with low P4 levels, resulting in outcomes comparable to patients with adequate progesterone.

Data Sources

The study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines and prospectively registered under the PROSPERO database (CRD42022357125). Six databases (Embase, MEDLINE, APA PsycInfo, Global Health, HMIC Health Management Information Consortium, and Google Scholar) and 2 additional sources were searched from inception to August 29, 2022.

Study Selection and Synthesis

Prospective and retrospective cohort studies, reporting the association between rescue progesterone and one or more pregnancy outcomes, were included. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), while the quality of evidence by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Summative and subgroup data as well as heterogeneity were generated by the Cochrane platform RevMan (V. 5.4).

Main Outcome Measure(S)

To compare ongoing pregnancy rate as primary outcome and clinical pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, and live birth rate as secondary outcomes between patients with low (< 10 ng/mL) receiving rescue progesterone vs. those with adequate levels of P4 (≥ 10 ng/mL).

Result(S)

Overall, 7 observational studies were included in the analysis, with a total of 5927 patients of median age 34 (interquartile range [IQR]: 31.55, 37.13). Overall, patient group comparison, namely those with low P4 that received a rescue dose and those with adequate P4 levels, did not yield significant differences for either the primary or secondary outcomes. For ongoing clinical pregnancy, patients with low P4 receiving the rescue dose vs. those with adequate P4 levels was odds ratio (OR) 0.98 (95% CI: 0.78, 1.24; P = 0.86, I²: 41%), whereas for miscarriage events, OR was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.81, 1.17; P = 0.80, I²: 0). Equally, for clinical pregnancy, OR was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.78, 1.06; P = 0.24; I²: 33%), and for live birth, OR was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.77, 1.09; P = 0.33; I²: 43%). Subgroup analysis on the basis or rescue administration route successfully explained summative heterogeneity.

Conclusion(S)

Rescue P4 dosing in patients with low P4 results in ongoing pregnancy rate, clinical pregnancy and live birth rates were comparable to those of patients with adequate P4 levels. However, robust randomized controlled trials assessing rescue treatment in women with low P4 are needed to confirm these findings. Rescue P4 in patients with low circulating P4 around embryo transfer day may result in reproductive outcomes comparable to those with adequate P4 levels.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^13273eca]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Comments and evidence summary for POP initiation explain that when pregnancy status is uncertain, the benefits of starting POPs likely exceed any risk and starting POPs should be considered at any time with a follow-up pregnancy test in 2–4 weeks; unlike combined oral contraceptives, norethindrone or norgestrel POPs inhibit ovulation in about half of cycles, and peak serum steroid levels are reached about 2 hours after administration with levels near baseline by 24 hours, supporting the importance of taking these POPs at approximately the same time each day.

### HIV protease inhibitor use during pregnancy is associated with decreased progesterone levels, suggesting a potential mechanism contributing to fetal growth restriction [^b632b62f]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of antiretrovirals on progesterone levels in the context of pregnancy and to determine whether antiretroviral-induced alterations in progesterone levels influence pregnancy outcome. Deciphering the mechanisms by which antiretrovirals affect pregnancy outcome would facilitate the rational selection of optimal therapy during pregnancy and could inform the design of diagnostic tools and interventions to identify and treat those at high risk of adverse outcomes.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^42ed9bf2]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Progesterone hypersensitivity — general — notes that progesterone is an endogenous steroid hormone involved in the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. Synthetic progesterone preparations known as progestins are also used as contraception and hormone replacement, particularly in the setting of in vitro fertilization, and adverse reactions to both endogenous progesterone and exogenous progestins have been documented.

### Validation of serum progesterone [^3794095c]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Presently, the most promising is serum progesterone. A recent prospective cohort study of women with no signs of threatened miscarriage from 4 to 12 weeks of gestation reported risk of miscarriage to be significantly higher among women with low serum progesterone (< 38.3 nmol/L or 12 ng/ml). Progesterone levels were 48% lower in women experiencing threatened miscarriage with subsequent spontaneous miscarriage compared to women who delivered at term. In our group's paper, serum progesterone levels were significantly lower in women presenting with threatened miscarriage who subsequently experienced spontaneous miscarriage by 16 weeks gestation compared to those who did not miscarry. A cut-off serum progesterone level of 35 nmol/L was proposed to prognosticate low and high risk for spontaneous miscarriage after presenting with threatened miscarriage in early pregnancy. Notwithstanding these findings, serum progesterone is currently not used for miscarriage risk assessment in a clinical setting. One explanation may be insufficient evidence regarding appropriate or 'optimal' serum progesterone cut-off levels for risk stratification of spontaneous miscarriage. Thus, a validated serum progesterone cut-off as a prognostic risk assessment will allow clinicians the means to better stratify patients into low- and high-risk populations.

The current study employed a large, prospective cohort (Validation cohort) with the aim of validating the serum progesterone cut-off value of 35 nmol/L based on the results of an earlier, smaller study at the same institution (Pilot cohort). We compared areas under ROC curves (AUCs) as well as sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values between the Pilot and Validation cohorts using 35 nmol/L as the risk prognosis cut-off for spontaneous miscarriage at or before 16 weeks of gestation in women presenting with threatened miscarriage in weeks 6–10 of pregnancy.

### Validation of serum progesterone [^adce9dec]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Strengths and interpretation

Early pregnancy is maintained via mediation by hormones and endocrine-immune interactions. Progesterone is increasingly recognized as a critical hormone during implantation where it plays an important role in sustaining decidualization, controlling uterine contractility and promoting maternal immune tolerance to the fetal semi-allograft. Thus, high level of serum progesterone may be protective against early pregnancy loss. In contrast, low level of serum progesterone could contribute to an increased risk of subsequent spontaneous miscarriage, especially in women who presents with threatened miscarriage in the first trimester of pregnancy. However, very few studies have reported a specific cut-off progesterone level with high predictive value for spontaneous miscarriage.

The serum progesterone cutoff level of < 35 nmol/L originally proposed by Ku et al provides important information that can be used to provide individualized and patient-specific risk assessment for spontaneous miscarriage. This provides prognostic data available at entry to care. Our validated proposed cut off level for serum progesterone allows clinicians to quickly assess individual patient risk by calculating a probability based on presence or absence of various factors. This threshold level for serum progesterone can be applied in a clinical setting, accurately identifying high-risk patients who may require more therapeutic intervention or heightened surveillance. In addition, this subpopulation of patients may potentially contribute to further pharmacological intervention studies whereby its therapeutic effectiveness and efficacy can be determined. Although measurements of serum progesterone levels are not recommended for routine clinical use at this time, it can be determined that serum progesterone is a highly specific predictive biomarker for spontaneous miscarriage, with a high negative predictive value, allowing us to reassure anxious patients with a low risk of miscarriage. Finally, we are able to demonstrate that our serum progesterone cut off value of 35 nmol/L was highly reproducible in a temporally different patient population, thus supporting the validity of the model.

Limitation

However, our study has a few limitations. This proposed serum progesterone cut-off value was shown to be applicable in women who present with threatened miscarriage in early pregnancy. It is uncertain if the predictive values will be applicable in a low-risk population, but the sensitivity and the specificity should remain constant, as these parameters are independent of disease prevalence.

### Validation of serum progesterone [^32401e16]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

There is significant interest in developing clinically useful models for risk prognosis of pregnancy complications and outcomes, and to stratify pregnant women as low or high risk. The advantages of serum progesterone as a marker for spontaneous miscarriage in women with threatened miscarriage are three-fold: (1) high reliability for reassuring women at low risk of miscarriage (NPV > 90%), (2) provides clinical guidance for unnecessary progestogen treatments or bed rest, and (3) may prompt mobilization of resources supporting an expectant mother's psychological wellbeing.

Main findings

Our study was targeted at women presenting with threatened miscarriage in early pregnancy in order to validate a previously suggested serum progesterone cut-off level of < 35 nmol/L for predicting risk of spontaneous miscarriage in this high-risk population. In the past, a reliable marker or model for clinical prognosis of pregnancy outcome in women presenting with threatened miscarriage in early pregnancy has not been available. In this study, we have successfully validated the serum progesterone cut-off value of < 35 nmol/L (11 ng/ml) — originally identified in a previous study, as a clinically useful predictor of miscarriage prior to week 16 of pregnancy in a temporally different population from the same centre. Using this cut-off, individual patients can be quickly stratified as being at low risk or high risk of spontaneous miscarriage.

### Accuracy of single progesterone test to predict early pregnancy outcome in women with pain or bleeding: meta-analysis of cohort studies [^9e35e6ab]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

The meta-analysis shows that a single progesterone measurement is useful in predicting non-viable pregnancies in women with pain or bleeding when an ultrasound investigation proves to be inconclusive. A low concentration of progesterone (less than 3.2 to 6 ng/mL) in these women ruled out a viable pregnancy in 99.2% of women. However, the test cannot distinguish women with an ectopic pregnancy from those with an early normal pregnancy or a miscarriage and should not be used for this purpose. For women with symptoms but without an ultrasound investigation, it may also be a useful test but is less accurate for ruling out women with a normal viable pregnancy.

### Serum luteal phase progesterone in women undergoing frozen embryo transfer in assisted conception: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d5f35219]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the association between luteal serum progesterone levels and frozen embryo transfer (FET) outcomes.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Setting

Not applicable.

Patient(S)

Women undergoing FET.

Intervention(S)

We conducted electronic searches of MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and grey literature (not widely available) from inception to March 2021 to identify cohort studies in which the serum luteal progesterone level was measured around the time of FET.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Ongoing pregnancy or live birth rate, clinical pregnancy rate, and miscarriage rate.

Result(S)

Among the studies analyzing serum progesterone level thresholds < 10 ng/mL, a higher serum progesterone level was associated with increased rates of ongoing pregnancy or live birth (relative risk [RR] 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.28 to 1.70), higher chance of clinical pregnancy (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.49), and lower risk of miscarriage (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.77) in cycles using exclusively vaginal progesterone and blastocyst embryos. There was uncertainty about whether progesterone thresholds ≥ 10 ng/mL were associated with FET outcomes in sensitivity analyses including all studies, owing to high interstudy heterogeneity and wide CIs.

Conclusion(S)

Our findings indicate that there may be a minimum clinically important luteal serum concentration of progesterone required to ensure an optimal endocrine milieu during embryo implantation and early pregnancy after FET treatment. Future clinical trials are required to assess whether administering higher-dose luteal phase support improves outcomes in women with a low serum progesterone level at the time of FET.

### Progesterone withdrawal: key to parturition [^83bf731c]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Whereas the essential role of progesterone in the maintenance of pregnancy is accepted generally, the mechanisms that suppress progesterone's function near term to allow labor and delivery of the conceptus are still shrouded in uncertainty. In most subprimate placental mammals, the withdrawal of progesterone before the initiation of labor is manifest by a significant drop in circulating progesterone levels, which is due to either luteolysis or changes in placental steroidogenesis, which shunts precursors towards estrogen production. No such events can be demonstrated in human pregnancy. In this review, we shall present a brief historic background of the research that led to the concepts of "progesterone block" and its withdrawal, based on experiments with rabbits and laboratory rodents, and discuss some of the more recent ideas about "functional progesterone withdrawal", in an attempt to bridge the apparent differences between the regulation of parturition in human and subprimate mammals.

### Can single progesterone concentration predict miscarriage in early pregnant women with threatened miscarriage: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^bd0ed2fc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 25% of pregnant women experience bleeding in the early stage, and half of them eventually progress to pregnancy loss. Currently, neither effective treatment nor prevention strategy is available to manage this condition. Despite some medicines are frequently prescribed in clinical practice including progesterone, the latter seems only to benefit early pregnant women with a history of one or more previous miscarriages and vaginal bleeding.

The vaginal bleeding during the early pregnancy stage is proven to be strongly associated with miscarriage, which is indeed attributed to luteal insufficiency, leading to low progesterone concentration. Progesterone, a critical hormone during pregnancy, reflects the luteal function until 7 weeks of gestation, and thus serves as a biomarker to predict the pregnancy outcome in threatened miscarriage. However, the concentration of progesterone varies largely among individuals and across gestational age. Previously, two meta-analyses indicated that both less than 10 ng/mL and 6.3 ng/mL could predict a non-viable pregnancy in early pregnant women including threatened miscarriage. Nevertheless, it is still unclear whether a single progesterone measurement can predict miscarriage in early pregnant women with threatened miscarriage, because most of studies recruited mixed patients including biochemical pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy and threatened miscarriage.

Therefore, we conduct a diagnostic meta-analysis to evaluate the performance of single progesterone measurement predicting miscarriage in early pregnant women with threatened miscarriage.

### Serum progesterone distribution in normal pregnancies compared to pregnancies complicated by threatened miscarriage from 5 to 13 weeks gestation: a prospective cohort study [^51e51d6f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This study highlights the pivotal role of progesterone in supporting an early pregnancy, where lower serum progesterone is associated with threatened miscarriage and a subsequent complete miscarriage at 16 weeks gestation. This may serve as a platform for the development of reference ranges for women who present with low risk pregnancies or threatened miscarriage to predict the risk of subsequent spontaneous miscarriages based on their progesterone levels.

### Micronized vaginal progesterone to prevent miscarriage: a critical evaluation of randomized evidence [^7413913f]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The role of first-trimester progesterone supplementation in the treatment of pregnancies at high risk of miscarriage is a long-standing research question that has been debated in the medical literature for more than 60 years. The PROMISE and PRISM trials are 2 very high-quality trials that have addressed the effects of first-trimester use of vaginal micronized progesterone treatment in women at risk of a miscarriage.

Biologic plausibility

Approximately one half of all miscarriages, including pregnancy losses in women with recurrent miscarriage, are due to numeric chromosome errors with trisomy being the most frequent, especially with advancing maternal age, followed by polyploidy and monosomy X. Such "aneuploid" miscarriages are thought to occur on a random basis, meaning that the risk of subsequent miscarriage is not increased. "Euploid" miscarriages, in contrast, are more frequently diagnosed with increasing number of previous miscarriages, as shown in Figure 5.

A progesterone-related problem, often given the name "luteal phase defect" (LPD), is considered to be one of the causes of a euploid miscarriage. The corpus luteum in the ovary produces progesterone during early pregnancy. Progesterone is essential for maintaining the decidua, and it is hypothesized that a defect in the function of the corpus luteum can result in low progesterone levels which in turn may increase the risk of miscarriage. However, there is no clear definition for LPD, and there are certainly no reliable tests to identify patients who may have the condition. Serum and salivary progesterone have been used; however, the diagnostic and prognostic value of the progesterone level has remained unclear. Furthermore, direction of causality confounds interpretation of a progesterone result, ie, if the progesterone level is found to be low in early pregnancy, we cannot know whether the low progesterone is the cause or effect of a miscarriage. Histologic assessment of the endometrium, initially proposed by Noyes et al. in 1950, has been shown to have high interobserver and intraobserver variation and poorly discriminates between fertile and infertile women; therefore, molecular-based alternatives, in addition to histologic assessment, are being developed. The endometrium is a dynamic mixture of cells, primarily glandular and stromal, that undergo cycles of proliferation, differentiation, and menstruation. Timed evaluation of the endometrium, particularly in the luteal phase, is being evaluated critically to identify "endometrial factors" associated with recurrent pregnancy loss.

### Accuracy of single progesterone test to predict early pregnancy outcome in women with pain or bleeding: meta-analysis of cohort studies [^0987febb]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Meaning of study: implications for clinicians

The outcome of a pregnancy in women with pain or bleeding in early pregnancy cannot be determined clinically alone after inconclusive ultrasound assessments. In such situations, a chance exists of a normal viable pregnancy that may be too early to be detected on ultrasound; our review estimates the median prevalence of this to be 26.8%. Most women, however, have a non-viable pregnancy in the form of a miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy. Serial serum β-hCG measurements are needed to differentiate between these outcomes in most diagnostic algorithms. Suboptimal rise in β-hCG (< 66%) after 48 hours indicates that miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy is a possibility. However, a rise in suboptimal β-hCG may occur even in viable pregnancies in up to 19% of cases. Therefore, the β-hCG test should be complemented by another test to increase its diagnostic accuracy. Serum progesterone measurement is a non-invasive test that can be done at the same time that blood is drawn for β-hCG measurements. It is already in use in many early pregnancy assessment units, although the accuracy of the progesterone test and the interpretation of the measured concentrations are uncertain. This test could be added to the existing algorithms for evaluation of early pregnancy, and its effect should be evaluated through a randomised trial comparing algorithms with and without serum progesterone. Our review suggests that a single serum progesterone measurement is more accurate when it follows an inconclusive ultrasound assessment; in women with pain or bleeding who did not have an ultrasound scan, the progesterone test was less accurate in predicting viability of a pregnancy.

In conclusion, this meta-analysis found that a single progesterone measurement for women in early pregnancy presenting with bleeding or pain and inconclusive ultrasound assessments can rule out a viable pregnancy.

Discussion

Main results

This study indicated that single progesterone measurement can act as a biomarker predicting miscarriage in early pregnant women with threatened miscarriage, and the performance was better when the concentration was < 12 ng/mL.

Strengths and limitations

In this updated meta-analysis, we included 12 studies which focused on investigating the progesterone predicting miscarriage in early pregnant women with threatened miscarriage, providing a more robust evaluation compared with the previous one. In addition, as the incidence of threatened miscarriage varies widely across races, regions and countries, the use of sensitivity and specificity to assess progesterone predicting miscarriage in this condition is inappropriate and inaccuracy. Therefore, together with sensitivity and specificity, the LLR was calculated, because the latter had been proposed to be an prefer outcome in diagnostic study.

Also, there are several limitations in this study. First, the threshold interval was relatively wide, lowering the accuracy of estimation. Second, high heterogeneity was observed among studies, leading to increased risk of diagnostic bias and unstable evaluation. Last but not least, a meta-regression analysis can not be performed, due to the absent available data and limited studies.

### Accuracy of single progesterone test to predict early pregnancy outcome in women with pain or bleeding: meta-analysis of cohort studies [^322a241a]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain are the most common causes of consultation in early pregnancy; 30% of women will experience pain or bleeding in their first trimester. These symptoms lead to anxiety and can be the first signs of a possible miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy. Miscarriage occurs in 10–20% of all recognised pregnancies, and the prevalence of ectopic pregnancies in the United Kingdom is 1.6%, which is raised to 3% in women with symptoms. Most women seeking medical advice have a transvaginal ultrasound scan to confirm a viable pregnancy, a miscarriage, or an ectopic pregnancy. However, even with expert use of transvaginal ultrasound, confirming if a pregnancy is intrauterine or extrauterine may not be possible in 8–31% of cases at the first visit. An observational study of pregnancies with inconclusive ultrasound results has shown that 50% spontaneously resolve (decreasing concentrations of β human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-hCG)), 27% are subsequently diagnosed as viable, and 14% are diagnosed as ectopic pregnancies. The high incidence of miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies in women with inconclusive ultrasound results warrants further tests to reach a diagnosis. Measurement of serum β-hCG can be useful, but often more than one β-hCG measurements is needed to make a diagnosis.

Serum progesterone has been proposed as a useful test to distinguish a viable pregnancy from a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy. Low progesterone values are associated with miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies, both considered non-viable pregnancies, and high progesterone concentrations with viable pregnancies. Knowledge about the diagnostic accuracy of a single serum progesterone measurement to determine the viability of the pregnancy may accelerate diagnosis, avoiding further tests and unnecessary interventions, and improve outcomes. National recommendations refrain from defining how this test should be used in diagnostic algorithms. The reason for this is that clinical practice is informed by individual small studies with unstable inferences and conflicting results on the accuracy of a single serum progesterone measurement in determining the viability of the pregnancy. A meta-analysis in 1998 did not take into account the recent widespread use of transvaginal ultrasound, which may improve the accuracy of this test. The aim of our review was to evaluate the accuracy of a single progesterone measurement, by a meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies, to predict pregnancy outcome in women with pain or bleeding in early pregnancy with or without an inconclusive ultrasound diagnosis.

### Accuracy of single progesterone test to predict early pregnancy outcome in women with pain or bleeding: meta-analysis of cohort studies [^c766f016]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and weaknesses in relation to other studies

The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' guideline for early pregnancy suggests that the single serum progesterone measurement is a useful test to predict pregnancy outcome. It states that a threshold for serum progesterone of 20 nmol/L (about 6.2 ng/mL) has a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 94% to predict a non-viable pregnancy in women with symptoms and inconclusive ultrasound but acknowledges that no discriminatory value for this test exists to confidently rule in or out a normal viable pregnancy. This conflicts with the findings in this meta-analysis, which is based also on the studies cited by this guideline. The existing evidence shows that specificity is higher (98.4%) and sensitivity lower (74.6%) using a cut-off value around 5 ng/mL. The findings of our study support those of a meta-analysis by Mol et al in 1998, which focused on a single progesterone measurement to predict ectopic pregnancy. The results of that study showed that a single progesterone measurement was useful for predicting the viability of a pregnancy but not for discriminating between an ectopic and a non-ectopic pregnancy, and this agrees with our results. The clinically most relevant question of accuracy of progesterone in women with inconclusive ultrasound investigations, however, is not covered by Mol et al.

Progesterone test in women with pain or bleeding alone

Nineteen cohort studies, including 7057 women, evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the single serum progesterone measurement to predict pregnancy outcomes in women with pain or bleeding alone. The tableshows the pooled diagnostic accuracy estimates for identifying women with non-viable pregnancies with the most commonly reported thresholds, and figure 5shows the estimates separately for each study according to available cut-off values. For women with symptoms alone, the progesterone test had a higher specificity using a threshold of 10 ng/mL (nine studies with 4689 participants), rather than higher thresholds at 15 and 20 ng/mL, and predicted a non-viable pregnancy with pooled sensitivity of 66.5% (53.6% to 77.4%), specificity of 96.3% (91.1% to 98.5%), positive likelihood ratio of 18 (7.2 to 45), and negative likelihood ratio of 0.35 (0.24 to 0.50). The median prevalence of a non-viable pregnancy in the studies included in this analysis was 62.9%; this was raised to 96.8% if the progesterone was lower than 10 ng/mL compared with a 37.2% probability if the progesterone was higher.

Optimal Length of Progesterone Supplementation Before the Transfer of Cryopreserved-Thawed Embryos in an Artificial Cycle With Exogenous Estrogen and Progesterone. ClinicalTrials. gov ID
- clinical pregnancy rate
- live birth rate. In the Centre of Reproductive Medicine of the Brussels University Hospital, we start progesterone supplementation 7 days before the transfer of a day 5 embryo. In order to mimic the natural cycle, since progesterone starts to rise 2 to 3 days before ovulation, due to the LH-stimulated production by the peripheral granulosa cells. In fresh IVF-cycles, progesterone is started from the day of oocyte retrieval. HCG administration in fresh cycles will lead to an increase in progesterone levels and therefore, endometrium will progress quickly, compared with frozen-thawed cycles which are hormone supplemented.

Our approach in artificial FrET cycles results in a pregnancy rate of 26%. In other centres, progesterone supplementation is generally started 5 days before the embryo transfer. Recent studies show pregnancy rates up to 40. 5%, using this approach. In this trial, we want to determine the optimal duration of progesterone supplementation. Study Type. Transvaginal ultrasound and hormone analysis for FSH, LH, E2 and P on day 2 of the cycle will be performed. The artificial preparation of the endometrium consists of 7 days oestradiol valerate 2 mg bid, followed by 6 days oestradiol valerate 2 mg tid. On day 13, the endometrium is measured. If endometrial thickness is more than 7 mm, patients are randomly assigned to group A or B.

Group A receives 7 days of micronized progesterone vaginally, 3x200mg daily), group B receives 5 days of micronized progesterone vaginally. On the 7th or 5th day of progesterone supplementation, the cryopreserved-thawed day 5 embryo is transferred.

### Does a short luteal phase correlate with an increased risk of miscarriage? A cohort study [^677bcbb2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Miscarriage, spontaneous pregnancy loss < 20 weeks gestational age, is the most common adverse event in early pregnancy, occurring in 10–20% of clinically recognized pregnancies and up to 30% of all pregnancies including unrecognized pregnancies. Since miscarriage in recognized pregnancies is associated with significant physical and psychological morbidity, including post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression, it is important to identify women who may be at increased risk for miscarriage, especially recurrent miscarriage, currently defined as ≥ 2 pregnancy losses < 20 weeks gestational age.

The majority of all miscarriages is due to chromosomal abnormalities in the embryo. A number of medical conditions are also associated with sporadic and recurrent miscarriage, including uterine malformations, maternal thrombophilia, and immune dysfunction. Endocrine disorders, including insufficient luteal progesterone production, have also been suggested to be associated with early pregnancy losses. Specifically, insufficient levels or duration of progesterone production may result in a luteal phase deficiency, which inhibits maintenance of a normal secretory endometrium allowing for normal embryo implantation and growth. A recent Cochrane review suggests that there may be a reduction in the number of miscarriages for women with risk factors for miscarriage (including prior miscarriage or bleeding in early pregnancy), who are given progestogen supplementation compared to placebo. While inadequate progesterone levels are associated with a short luteal phase, to date there have been few studies investigating the link between the length of the luteal phase and risk of miscarriage.

The aim of this study is to address this data gap by establishing whether a short luteal phase (defined as < 10 days after estimated day of ovulation through the end of the cycle) correlates with an increased risk of miscarriage in women who are tracking their menstrual cycles. We hypothesize that a short luteal phase increases the risk of miscarriage, after taking into account important confounding factors. Furthermore, we hypothesize miscarriage risk will be augmented by increased number of cycles with short luteal phases prior to conception.

### Accuracy of single progesterone test to predict early pregnancy outcome in women with pain or bleeding: meta-analysis of cohort studies [^d2296ac8]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the accuracy with which a single progesterone measurement in early pregnancy discriminates between viable and non-viable pregnancy.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, ProQuest, Conference Proceedings Citation Index, and the Cochrane Library from inception until April 2012, plus reference lists of relevant studies.

Study Selection

Studies were selected on the basis of participants (women with spontaneous pregnancy of less than 14 weeks of gestation); test (single serum progesterone measurement); outcome (viable intrauterine pregnancy, miscarriage, or ectopic pregnancy) diagnosed on the basis of combinations of pregnancy test, ultrasound scan, laparoscopy, and histological examination; design (cohort studies of test accuracy); and sufficient data being reported.

Results

26 cohort studies, including 9436 pregnant women, were included, consisting of 7 studies in women with symptoms and inconclusive ultrasound assessment and 19 studies in women with symptoms alone. Among women with symptoms and inconclusive ultrasound assessments, the progesterone test (5 studies with 1998 participants and cut-off values from 3.2 to 6 ng/mL) predicted a non-viable pregnancy with pooled sensitivity of 74.6% (95% confidence interval 50.6% to 89.4%), specificity of 98.4% (90.9% to 99.7%), positive likelihood ratio of 45 (7.1 to 289), and negative likelihood ratio of 0.26 (0.12 to 0.57). The median prevalence of a non-viable pregnancy was 73.2%, and the probability of a non-viable pregnancy was raised to 99.2% if the progesterone was low. For women with symptoms alone, the progesterone test had a higher specificity when a threshold of 10 ng/mL was used (9 studies with 4689 participants) and predicted a non-viable pregnancy with pooled sensitivity of 66.5% (53.6% to 77.4%), specificity of 96.3% (91.1% to 98.5%), positive likelihood ratio of 18 (7.2 to 45), and negative likelihood ratio of 0.35 (0.24 to 0.50). The probability of a non-viable pregnancy was raised from 62.9% to 96.8%.

Conclusion

A single progesterone measurement for women in early pregnancy presenting with bleeding or pain and inconclusive ultrasound assessments can rule out a viable pregnancy.

### Progesterone level and progesterone / estradiol ratio on the day of hCG administration: detrimental cutoff levels and new treatment strategy [^18511244]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify if there are certain cutoff levels for P and or the P/E(2) ratio on the day of hCG that would be defined as detrimental for occurrence of pregnancy in women with normal ovarian reserve undergoing cleavage-stage embryo transfer (ET). Secondarily, to determine if these same cutoffs might have the same potential negative effect in women undergoing blastocyst ET.

Design

Prospective cohort study including two randomized cohorts.

Setting

Private and university fertility centers.

Participant(S)

A total of 240 women undergoing long agonist protocol with at least four grade 1 day 3 embryos.

Intervention(S)

Women were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to undergo day 3 or day 5 embryo transfer.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) was the primary outcome.

Result(S)

Using receiver operator characteristics, cutoffs for P and P/E(2) ratio were 1.5 ng/mL and 0.55, respectively. Patients with P ≤ 1.5 ng/mL and P/E(2) ≤ 0.55 undergoing cleavage-stage ET had higher CPR. Using multiple regression, P/E(2) ratio was the only independent predictor for pregnancy. The P and P/E(2) cutoffs were not correlated with CPR in blastocyst transfers.

Conclusion(S)

Progesterone > 1.5 ng/mL and P/E(2) > 0.55 affect the CPR in women undergoing cleavage-stage, but not blastocyst ET. P/E(2) ratio is the only independent prognosticator for cycle outcome in women undergoing cleavage-stage ET.

### Progesterone levels on the human chorionic gonadotropin trigger day affect the pregnancy rates for embryos transferred at different stages of development in both general and selected IVF / ICSI populations [^4ab2e785]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

One in six couples will consult for infertility, defined as failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse. In this setting, in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) is one possible treatment option for achieving a live birth. Even though IVF/ICSI has enabled the birth of over 8 million children since 1978, the pregnancy rates per embryo transfer vary from 10 to 50%. Predictive factors for pregnancy include the woman's age, the cycle rank, and the number of good-quality embryos. In 2013, we defined a select group of "top" IVF/ICSI cycles, with the following characteristics: the first or second IVF/ICSI cycle, female age under 35, and the transfer of no more than two top embryos.

Initially, IVF/ICSI was based on cleaved embryo transfer on day 2 (D2) or day 3 (D3). However, progress in in vitro culture and embryo cryopreservation has made it possible to envisage blastocyst transfer on day (D5) or day 6 (D6). Blastocyst transfer has several advantages: decreased uterine exposure to very high serum estradiol levels, better synchronization between embryonic development and endometrial maturation, the selection of embryos that progress to a blastocyst stage, and a decrease in uterine contractions. Several meta-analyses have shown that blastocyst transfer is associated with significantly higher clinical pregnancy and birth rates. In some cases, however, cleaved embryos do not develop into blastocysts in vitro, even though the couple may have achieved embryo implantation previously.

The luteal maturation of the endometrium (luteinization) required for embryo implantation depends on the estrogenic effect and adequate progesterone secretion as soon as the ovulatory LH peak has been triggered. In some women in IVF/ICSI, the serum progesterone level peaks too early; this results in premature luteinization and an implantation window that opens (but also closes) earlier. The administration of a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist is intended to limit the risk of premature luteinization in IVF/ICSI cycles. A key question in cases of premature luteinization is whether the embryo's development stage at the time of transfer influences the pregnancy rate. We therefore assessed GnRH antagonist-gonadotropin IVF/ICSI protocols in a general population and a selected population ("top cycles"). The study's objectives were to (i) measure the pregnancy rates after the transfer of blastocysts or cleaved embryos in these two populations, and (ii) determine whether the serum progesterone level just before the trigger influences the likelihood of pregnancy.

### Progesterone levels on the human chorionic gonadotropin trigger day affect the pregnancy rates for embryos transferred at different stages of development in both general and selected IVF / ICSI populations [^9dc1bd2e]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Elevated progesterone levels before the ovulation trigger are responsible for a decrease in pregnancy rates. The research question addressed in the literature concerns the serum progesterone threshold above which this effect appears. According to Bosch et al. the threshold is 1.5 ng/ml, whereas Xu et al. quoted values of 1.5 to 2.75 ng/ml, depending on the follicular response. In fact, Xu et al.'s study of 10,000 cycles found a fall in the rates of pregnancy above 2.75 ng/ml in strong responders (> 20 oocytes), above 1.75 ng/ml in normal responders, and above 1.5 ng/ml in nonresponders. In contrast, the pregnancy rates for frozen embryo transfers increased with the serum progesterone level. In our study, 77 couples in the selected population had frozen embryos after freeze-all (mean number of embryos frozen: 3.43 ± 2.14), which prompts us to expect even higher cumulative pregnancy and birth rates. Corti et al. reported a difference in the clinical pregnancy rate above vs. below a serum progesterone threshold of 1.5 ng/ml. (50% vs 33.3%, respectively; OR [95%CI]: 2 [1.07–3.75]). Other researchers have found a lower serum progesterone threshold. Venetis et al.'s study of 60,000 cycles found an OR for birth of 0.39 when the serum progesterone level on the trigger day was between 0.4–0.6 ng/ml, with 0.79 between 0.8 and 1.1 ng/ml, 0.67 between 1.2 and 1.4 ng/ml, 0.64 between 1.5 and 1.75 ng/ml, and 0.68 between 1.9 and 3 ng/ml. Venetis et al. did not observe an impact of a serum progesterone level ≥ 1.5 ng/ml in poor responders (< 6 oocytes, n = 796 cycles) or strong responders (> 18 oocytes, n = 730). In 2015, the same research group found a threshold of 0.9 ng/ml for 3296 cycles. Griesinger et al. found that the prevalence of an elevated serum progesterone level varied with the follicular response: 4.5% for poor responders (≤ 5 oocytes) vs. 19% for strong responders (> 18 oocytes). The pregnancy rate was also low (OR: 0.55 [0.37–0.81]), especially in poor responders. Fanchin et al. came to the same conclusion in poor responders for a serum progesterone threshold at 0.9 ng/ml but this level did not have an impact among normal responders. Requena et al. found the same pregnancy rates in strong responders (> 20 oocytes and 3000 pg/ml) above and below a serum progesterone level of 1.5 ng/ml. In our study, the serum estradiol level on the trigger day and the number of oocytes retrieved testified to a normal response to ovarian stimulation. Santos-Ribeiro et al. found the best pregnancy rate (29.7%) when the serum progesterone level was between 0.76 and 1 ng/ml, after adjustment for female age, the number of oocytes retrieved, the serum estradiol level, the FSH dose, the number of embryos transferred, and the embryo stage. Wang et al. studied the pregnancy rates after transfers of fresh embryos (n = 1455) or frozen embryos (n = 1455). They observed than when the serum progesterone level ≤ 1 ng/ml, the pregnancy rates for fresh and frozen embryo transfers were respectively of 56.4 and 54.6% in women aged ≤ 35 and 45.1 and 48.9% in woman over 35. When the serum progesterone level exceeded 1 ng/ml, the rate after fresh embryo transfer was lower (46.1% for age ≤ 35; OR: 1.38 [1.11–1.71], and 35.2% for age > 35; OR: 1.73 [1.34–2.24]); these values are similar to those found in the present study for the general population vs. the "top cycle" population. Papanikolaou et al. studied the clinical pregnancy rate in GnRH antagonist-rFSH protocols as a function of the serum progesterone level on the trigger day. In case of transfer of embryos on D3, the clinical pregnancy rate was 37.5% when the progesterone level was < 0.73 ng/ml, 34% for the range 0.74–0.90, 30.6% for the range 0.91–1.2, 25.9% for the range 1.21–1.53, and 15.7% when the level was > 1.53 ng/ml (p = 0.008). Following blastocyst transfer on D5, there was no significant difference in the pregnancy rates as a function of the serum progesterone level (< 0.67: 42.9%; 0.68–0.99: 39.5%; 1–1.15: 29.3%; 1.16–1.48: 40%, and > 1.48: 41.5%). The authors concluded that the transfer of a good-quality blastocyst compensates for the high progesterone level. In 2012, the same research group did not find a difference for a serum progesterone level above or below a threshold of 1.5 ng/ml in either GnRH antagonist or GnRH agonist protocols. In a study by Vanni et al. the serum progesterone threshold for obtaining good-quality blastocysts was 1.49 ng/ml, and the yield was better below 1 ng/ml. Shapiro et al. reported a lower pregnancy rate after fresh blastocyst transfer on D6 (relative to D5); this was probably due to transfer outside the implantation window, which is advanced by the ovarian stimulation (the pregnancy rate was the same for frozen embryo transfers). Healy et al. compared D5 and D6 transfers and observed an influence of the serum progesterone level above 0.8 ng/ml. On D6, the relative decrease in the pregnancy rate was 8% when the serum progesterone level was normal and 17% when it was > 1.5 ng/ml. On D5, the best pregnancy rate was obtained when the serum progesterone level was < 1 ng/ml, with an OR [95%CI] of 0.75 [0.67–0.88] (p < 0.001) when considering the serum progesterone level as a continuous variable. According to Huang et al. the best pregnancy rates were observed after embryo transfers on D3 or D5 when the serum progesterone level was between 0.5 and 0.74 ng/ml. Overall, 50.4% of the women became pregnant when the serum progesterone level was < 1 ng/ml, with 45.5% when it was between 1 and 1.49 ng/ml and 36.2% when it was ≥ 1.5 ng/ml (p < 0.01). In our study (with a threshold of 0.9 ng/ml), there was a significant difference in the clinical pregnancy rate between the blastocyst transfer and cleaved embryo transfer groups in the general population but not in the selected "top cycle" population (Fig. 2). Unlike Hill et al. who have showed that an elevated serum P level on the day of hCG administration was negatively associated with live birth, even in good prognosis embryo transfers, but in accordance with Papanikolaou et al. it appears in our study that the selection of "top cycles" reduced the impact of an elevated serum progesterone level on the trigger day. This influence can be seen in our Fig. 3, where the clinical pregnancy rates were high in the selected population up to a serum progesterone level of 1.1 ng/ml for both blastocyst transfer and cleaved embryo transfer.

### The epidemiology, pathology and pathogenesis of MS: therapeutic implications [^19525988]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

During pregnancy, also, progesterone is made by the ovaries and placenta. It increases markedly during the first trimester and then its concentrations level out for the second and third trimesters. It is involved in thickening the uterine lining to facilitate implantation of the fertilized egg and it increases blood flow to the uterus. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is secreted by the pituitary gland, and it promotes egg maturation and fertilization. It is made prior to and during first trimester. After this, it drops below non-pregnancy levels and remains low throughout pregnancy. Prolactin promotes breast growth and milk production, especially during the third trimester. After delivery, prolactin participates in causing milk to be released during breastfeeding. The hormone's level is highest in the first trimester, when it participates in the prevention of uterine contractions. Relaxin helps to regulate the cardiovascular system allowing for adjustment to an increased demand for oxygen. Relaxin levels peak at the end of the first trimester and then fall to intermediate levels for the remainder of the pregnancy, As the baby comes to term, relaxin helps to loosen the muscles, ligaments, and joints of the pelvis, thereby helping to prepare the mothers body for birth.

The non-hormonal effects of pregnancy on the immunological function of the individual are equally complex so that any attempt to recreate the "pregnancy state" in an individual and thereby capture the protective effect of pregnancy on disease activity in MS will be challenging. The three principal estrogens are estradiol, estrone and estriol. Estrogens act by regulating gene transcription via the nuclear estrogen receptors – ERα and Erβ – which (when ligand-activated) each exhibit distinct down-stream transcriptional effects. Estriol only very weakly interacts with ERα and preferentially binds to ERβ, which may be important because the consequences of binding to one or the other ER can lead to the opposite biological effects. Moreover, estriol seems to be the safest of the three estrogens. Perhaps, in part, because of the many physiological complexities of pregnancy, the results of several preliminary clinical trials of hormonal therapy in MS, mostly of estriol by itself, have not demonstrated any definite clinical benefit.

### Can single progesterone concentration predict miscarriage in early pregnant women with threatened miscarriage: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^674676da]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

About 25% of pregnant women experience bleeding in the early stage, and half of them eventually progress to pregnancy loss. Progesterone serves as a useful biomarker to predict miscarriage in threatened miscarriage, yet its performance is still debated.

Aim

To evaluate the performance of single serum progesterone predicting miscarriage in early pregnant patients with threatened miscarriage.

Method

The online database was searched to yield the literature using the terms of 'Abortion', 'Miscarriage', and 'serum Progesterone', including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane library, and China national knowledge infrastructure. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, likelihood ratio (LLR) and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed. Publication bias was assessed by the deeks funnel plot asymmetry test. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to the progesterone level (< 12 ng/mL), recruited location and region, progesterone measurement method, exogenous progesterone supplement and follow up.

Results

In total, 12 studies were eligible to be included in this study, with sample sizes ranging from 76 to 1087. The included patients' gestational age was between 4 and 12 weeks. No significant publication bias was detected from all included studies. The threshold of progesterone reported ranged from 8 to 30 ng/ml. The synthesized area under the ROC curve (0.85, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.88), positive LLR (6.2, 4.0 to 9.7) and DOR (18, 12 to 27) of single progesterone measurement distinguishing miscarriage were relatively good in early pregnant patients with threatened miscarriage. When the threshold of < 12 ng/mL was adapted, the progesterone provided a higher area under the ROC curve (0.90 vs. 0.78), positive LLR (8.3 vs. 3.8) and DOR (22 vs.12) than its counterpart (12 to 30 ng/mL).

Conclusion

Single progesterone measurement can act as a biomarker of miscarriage in early pregnant patients with threatened miscarriage, and it has a better performance when the concentration is < 12 ng/mL.

### Progestogen for preventing miscarriage in women with recurrent miscarriage of unclear etiology [^5521f144]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Progesterone, a female sex hormone, is known to induce secretory changes in the lining of the uterus essential for successful implantation of a fertilized egg. Miscarriage is an early pregnancy loss. For women who have recurrent miscarriage, it has been suggested that a causative factor may be inadequate secretion of progesterone. Therefore, clinicians sometimes use progestogens (drugs that interact with the progesterone receptors), beginning in the first trimester of pregnancy, in an attempt to prevent spontaneous miscarriage. It is important to understand if this is beneficial or harmful. This is an update of the review, last published in 2019. Previous versions included two trials that have since been retracted. This update included an updated trial search and evaluation of all trials using the Cochrane Trustworthiness Screening Tool.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of progestogens as a preventative therapy against recurrent miscarriage.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (July 2024). We also searched reference lists from relevant articles, attempted to contact trial authors where necessary, and contacted experts in the field for unpublished works.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials in pregnant participants comparing progestogens with placebo or no treatment, given in an effort to prevent miscarriage. We included trials of participants who were diagnosed with recurrent miscarriage (usually of unknown origin) and who began treatment with progestogens in the first trimester of pregnancy. We excluded trials treating participants with threatened miscarriage or who had conceived by in-vitro fertilization.

Outcomes

The critical outcome was miscarriage. The main important outcomes were live birth rate and preterm birth (< 37 weeks' gestation). Other important outcomes were neonatal death, fetal genital abnormalities, stillbirth, low birthweight (< 2500 g), maternal adverse events and neonatal intensive care unit admission. Other maternal outcomes of interest were severity of 'morning sickness', thromboembolic events, depression, admission to special care unit and subsequent fertility.

Risk Of Bias

Two review authors assessed the studies using the RoB 1 tool for selection, performance, detection, attrition, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other bias.

Synthesis Methods

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Two reviewers assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We utilized a random-effects model to synthesize the results.

Included Studies

Nine trials with 1426 randomized participants met the inclusion criteria. Eight trials included analyzable data for 1276 participants. Overall, the risk of bias was low for six trials, while three had areas of concern. Because few studies reported on important outcomes, imprecision was high for those outcomes, limiting the certainty of those analyses.

Synthesis Of Results

Seven of the included trials compared treatment with placebo and the other two compared progestogen administration with no treatment. The trials were a mix of multicenter and single-center trials, conducted in Jordan, the UK, the Netherlands, and the USA. In three trials, participants had three or more consecutive miscarriages and in six trials, participants had two or more consecutive miscarriages. Route, dosage and duration of progestogen treatment varied across the trials. The majority of trials were at low risk of bias for most domains. Eight trials with 1276 participants contributed data to the analyses. Meta-analysis suggests that there is probably little to no difference in the miscarriage rate for women given progestogen supplementation compared to placebo or no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.07; I² = 0%; 8 studies, 1276 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Subgroup analyses comparing placebo-controlled versus non-placebo-controlled trials, trials of participants with three or more prior miscarriages compared to women with two or more miscarriages, and different routes of administration showed no clear differences between subgroups for miscarriage. For women with recurrent miscarriage of unclear etiology receiving progestogen, there was probably little to no difference in live birth rate compared to placebo (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.12; 5 trials, 1063 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effect on the rate of preterm birth; there was probably little to no difference (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.41; 3 trials, 256 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No clear differences were seen for women receiving progestogen for the other important outcomes, including neonatal death, fetal genital abnormalities, or stillbirth. There was little or no data on other important outcomes of low birth weight, maternal adverse events, teratogenic effects, or admission to a special care unit. None of the trials reported on any other important maternal outcomes, including severity of morning sickness, thromboembolic events, depression, admission to a special care unit, or subsequent fertility.

Authors' Conclusions

For women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage, progestogen supplementation therapy probably results in little to no effect on outcomes in subsequent pregnancies.

### HIV protease inhibitor use during pregnancy is associated with decreased progesterone levels, suggesting a potential mechanism contributing to fetal growth restriction [^ec96eedc]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

In conclusion, we have provided evidence supporting an association between PI-based therapy (in particular, RTV-boosted LPV) and lower progesterone levels during pregnancy. We also demonstrated that lower progesterone levels are associated with fetal growth restriction and lower birth weight percentiles. We propose that PI-induced reduction in progesterone levels during pregnancy is a potential mechanism contributing to the higher incidence of SGA among infants delivered by PI-exposed HIV-infected women. While the molecular mechanisms that lead to progesterone reduction remain to be elucidated, our study provides needed information on the topic of antiretroviral safety in pregnancy that could translate into more-informed treatment choices for HIV-infected pregnant women and into potential interventions to improve pregnancy outcomes in these women.

### A rapid improvement event: progesterone prescribing in prevention of miscarriage [^8df0d88a]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Background

It is well recognised that endogenous progesterone is essential in a maintaining a pregnancy. The value of supplemented progesterone in the prevention of miscarriage has been the subject of numerous studies. Coomarasamy et al first investigated the role of supplemented progesterone in asymptomatic women with a history of recurrent miscarriages and found no benefit. They subsequently carried out the PRISM trial which was a multicentre randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial evaluating the use of vaginal progesterone in women with threatened miscarriage. The trial did not demonstrate that supplementing progesterone in threatened miscarriage results in a higher incidence of live births overall; however, it did demonstrate some benefit in those with a history of one to two miscarriages and substantial benefit in those with a history of three or more miscarriages.

The results of the PRISM trial led to a Cochrane review which concluded that there is 'high quality evidence' for supplementing progesterone in threatened miscarriage for those with a history of one to two miscarriages and 'high certainty evidence' for those with a history of three or more miscarriages. Subsequently, NICE guidance on the management of threatened miscarriage was updated to include offering vaginal micronised progesterone 400 mg two times per day to those with a history of miscarriage presenting with threatened miscarriage and a confirmed intrauterine pregnancy on ultrasound. It is recommended that the progesterone is continued up to 16 weeks where a viable pregnancy is continuing

### Prenatal administration of progesterone for preventing preterm birth in women considered to be at risk of preterm birth [^7e0c8593]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Preterm birth is a major complication of pregnancy associated with perinatal mortality and morbidity. Progesterone for the prevention of preterm labour has been advocated.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of progesterone for the prevention of preterm birth for women considered to be at increased risk of preterm birth and their infants.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (14 January 2013) and reviewed the reference list of all articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials, in which progesterone was given for preventing preterm birth.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently evaluated trials for methodological quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Thirty-six randomised controlled trials (8523 women and 12,515 infants) were included. Progesterone versus placebo for women with a past history of spontaneous preterm birth Progesterone was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of perinatal mortality (six studies; 1453 women; risk ratio (RR) 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.75), preterm birth less than 34 weeks (five studies; 602 women; average RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.69), infant birthweight less than 2500 g (four studies; 692 infants; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.79), use of assisted ventilation (three studies; 633 women; RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.90), necrotising enterocolitis (three studies; 1170 women; RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.89), neonatal death (six studies; 1453 women; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.76), admission to neonatal intensive care unit (three studies; 389 women; RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.40), preterm birth less than 37 weeks (10 studies; 1750 women; average RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.74) and a statistically significant increase in pregnancy prolongation in weeks (one study; 148 women; mean difference (MD) 4.47, 95% CI 2.15 to 6.79). No differential effects in terms of route of administration, time of commencing therapy and dose of progesterone were observed for the majority of outcomes examined. Progesterone versus placebo for women with a short cervix identified on ultrasound Progesterone was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of preterm birth less than 34 weeks (two studies; 438 women; RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.90), preterm birth at less than 28 weeks' gestation (two studies; 1115 women; RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.93) and increased risk of urticaria in women when compared with placebo (one study; 654 women; RR 5.03, 95% CI 1.11 to 22.78). It was not possible to assess the effect of route of progesterone administration, gestational age at commencing therapy, or total cumulative dose of medication. Progesterone versus placebo for women with a multiple pregnancy Progesterone was associated with no statistically significant differences for the reported outcomes. Progesterone versus no treatment/placebo for women following presentation with threatened preterm labour Progesterone, was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of infant birthweight less than 2500 g (one study; 70 infants; RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.98). Progesterone versus placebo for women with 'other' risk factors for preterm birth Progesterone, was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of infant birthweight less than 2500 g (three studies; 482 infants; RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.91).

Authors' Conclusions

The use of progesterone is associated with benefits in infant health following administration in women considered to be at increased risk of preterm birth due either to a prior preterm birth or where a short cervix has been identified on ultrasound examination. However, there is limited information available relating to longer-term infant and childhood outcomes, the assessment of which remains a priority. Further trials are required to assess the optimal timing, mode of administration and dose of administration of progesterone therapy when given to women considered to be at increased risk of early birth.

### Treatment of unexplained… [^b3083d1a]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

WHO categorizes ovulatory disorders into three groups: group I is caused by hypothalamic pituitary failure, group II results from dysfunction of hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, and group III is caused by ovarian failure. 8 Women in group I typically present with amenorrhea and low gonadotropin levels, most commonly from low body weight or excessive exercise. Women in group II include those with polycystic ovary syndrome and hyperprolactinemia. Women in group III can conceive only with oocyte donation and in vitro fertilization. Women with regular menstrual cycles are likely to be ovulating and should be offered serum progesterone testing at day 21 to confirm ovulation. 8 If a woman has irregular cycles, the testing should be conducted later in the cycle, starting seven days before presumed onset of menses, and repeated weekly until menses. 6, 8 A progesterone level of 5 ng per mL or greater implies ovulation.

A high FSH level drawn on day 3 of the menstrual cycle is associated with infertility. A high serum estradiol level in conjunction with a normal FSH level has also been associated with lower pregnancy rates. This combination of laboratory test results may indicate ovarian insufficiency or diminished ovarian reserve. Treatment of Anovulatory Conditions Women with WHO group I ovulatory disorders should be counseled to achieve a normal body weight. They may benefit from referral to a physician comfortable with prescribing pulsatile administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone or gonadotropins with luteinizing hormone activity to induce ovulation. 40 Patients using these agents should be counseled about these risks. The initial dosage of clomiphene is 50 mg daily for five days starting on day 3 to 5 of the menstrual cycle.

This should be followed by documentation of ovulation via serum progesterone. If this is unsuccessful, the dosage may be increased to 100 mg daily. Patients who do not achieve ovulation after three to six cycles should be referred to an infertility specialist for further treatment. Couples who do not conceive after treatment for six cycles with documented ovulation should also consider referral to an infertility specialist. 41.

### Accuracy of single progesterone test to predict early pregnancy outcome in women with pain or bleeding: meta-analysis of cohort studies [^e27752d6]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Literature search

We did a comprehensive literature search to identify studies with a population of women with spontaneous pregnancy of less than 14 weeks of gestation, in which the single serum progesterone measurement was used to predict the outcome of pregnancy (viable intrauterine pregnancy, miscarriage, or ectopic pregnancy). The databases searched included Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library from inception to April 2012. We searched Medline, Embase and CINAHL by a combination of the keywords for the test (progestor*) and outcomes of interest ("ectopic pregnancy", "tubal pregnancy", "viab* pregnancy", "failing pregnancy", "miscarr", and "abort") with their associated medical subject and Emtree headings. We searched the Cochrane Library with the keywords "progesterone" and "pregnancy". We placed no filters or language restrictions to ensure maximal sensitivity of the searches. We also checked the reference sections of all selected articles for relevant papers.

Study selection

We selected the studies in two rounds: firstly, on title and abstract, independently by two reviewers (IDG and MA); secondly, on full text, also independently by two reviewers (JV and NM), against pre-specified criteria. We selected studies that assessed diagnostic accuracy or derived prediction rules. We excluded case-control studies, narrative reviews, letters, editorials, comments, and case series. We used systematic reviews and meta-analyses only as a source of references. Studies needed to include women with spontaneous early pregnancy to be eligible for the review. We excluded studies including women who had conceived after treatment to induce ovulation, who had had progesterone supplementation or in vitro fertilisation, as well as studies that included women above a gestational age of 14 weeks. The index test was a single measurement of serum progesterone. We excluded studies that did not report a cut-off value for progesterone but reported results only by high or low progesterone.

### Defining thresholds for abnormal premature progesterone levels during ovarian stimulation for assisted reproduction technologies [^8db097a5]. Fertility and Sterility (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate methodologies to establish abnormal progesterone (P) levels on the day of trigger for recommending freeze only cycles.

Design

Threshold analysis and cost analysis.

Setting

Private ART practice.

Patient(S)

Fresh autologous ART.

Interventions(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Live birth.

Result(S)

Fourteen established statistical methodologies for generating clinical thresholds were evaluated. These methods were applied to 7,608 fresh ART transfer cycles to generate various P thresholds which ranged widely from 0.4 to 3.0 ng/mL. Lower thresholds ranged from 0.4 to 1 ng/mL and classified the majority of cycles as abnormal as well as required very large number needed to treat (NNT) to increase one live birth. Frozen embryo transfer was cost-effective when P was ≥ 1.5 ng/mL, with 12% of the population having an abnormal test result and an NNT of 13. Statistical and cost-effective thresholds clustered between 1.5 and 2.0 ng/mL.

Conclusion(S)

Statistically significant thresholds for P were demonstrated as low as 0.4 ng/mL but resulted in a very large NNT to increase one live birth. A clinical benefit to a freeze-only approach was demonstrated above P thresholds ranging from 1.5 to 2.0 ng/dL. At these thresholds, elevated P has a demonstrable and clinically significant negative effect and captures a smaller percentage of the patient population at higher risk for fresh transfer failure, thus making freeze-only a cost-effective option.

### FIGO good practice recommendations on progestogens for prevention of preterm delivery [^10a69ae6]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Women at high risk of preterm birth (either a previous spontaneous preterm birth and/or sonographic short cervix) with a singleton gestation should be offered daily vaginal progesterone or weekly 17-OHPC treatment to prevent preterm birth. Benefit is most significant in those with prior history of preterm birth and a short cervix. For women with a previous spontaneous preterm birth and a cervix ≥ 30 mm the effectiveness of progesterone is uncertain. In asymptomatic women with no prior history of previous preterm birth, no mid-trimester loss, or no short cervical length, progesterone therapy is not recommended for the prevention of preterm birth. For those with unselected multiple pregnancies, progesterone therapy is not recommended for the prevention of preterm birth. Daily vaginal progesterone or weekly 17-OHPC treatment can be used for the prevention of preterm birth. The preparation used should be decided by the woman and her clinician. There is no evidence of neurological or developmental benefit or harm in babies whose mothers use progestogens for preterm birth prevention antenatally.

### Prediction and prevention of spontaneous preterm birth: ACOG practice bulletin, number 234 [^56f7ea8e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Spontaneous preterm birth — progesterone for women with a singleton pregnancy and prior spontaneous preterm birth is characterized by mixed efficacy signals and shared decision-making guidance: An early randomized trial reported that 17-OHPC reduced preterm birth before 35 weeks (20.6% versus 30.7%; RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.48–0.93), whereas the PROLONG randomized trial (1,877 eligible; 1,740 randomized) showed no statistical difference for preterm birth before 35 0/7 weeks (11.0% versus 11.5%; RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.71–1.26) and for the neonatal composite index (5.6% versus 5.0%; RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.70–1.66). Meta-analyses comparing vaginal progesterone to 17-OHPC found a lower risk with vaginal progesterone for preterm birth before 34 weeks (17.5% versus 25.0%; RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53–0.95), while three blinded trials of vaginal progesterone versus placebo starting at 18–22 weeks have shown no benefit in reducing recurrent preterm birth. A network meta-analysis including 40 trials reported stronger evidence for vaginal progesterone (preterm birth before 34 weeks, OR, 0.29; 95% credibility interval, 0.12–0.68) than for 17-OHPC (preterm birth before 37 weeks, OR, 0.53; 95% credibility interval, 0.27–0.95), and an individual patient data meta-analysis found reductions with vaginal progesterone (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.68–0.90) with a nonsignificant estimate for 17-OHPC (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.68–1.01). Safety data showed no significant increase in composite maternal complications for 17-OHPC (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.97–1.43) or vaginal progesterone (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.93–1.40), and no maternal deaths were noted. Patients with a singleton pregnancy and a prior spontaneous preterm birth should be offered progesterone supplementation (either vaginal or intramuscular) in the context of a shared decision-making process incorporating the available evidence and the patient's preferences, and it appears that starting 17-OHPC earlier in the 16 0/7–20 6/7 weeks of gestation period is more effective than starting later.

### Progesterone levels predict pregnancy outcomes in individuals with fallopian tube associated infertility [^aa2f24b8]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Progesterone (P) is known to play important physiological functions during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. In assisted reproductive treatment (ART), the use of P levels during the late follicular phase to predict pregnancy outcomes remains controversial. A recent study revealed that elevated P levels on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) administration negatively affects live birth rates and are correlated with high rates of miscarriage. However, the detrimental impact of high P levels during pregnancy is not associated with endometrial receptivity. A different study reported that low P levels (≤ 0.5 ng/ml) on the day of HCG administration are associated with low live birth rates(LBR). Elevated P levels on the day of oocyte maturation have also been suggested to affect embryonic quality while high P levels (> 2.0 ng/ml) before oocyte maturation have been shown to negatively impact the oocyte. It has also been documented that premature luteinization does not affect in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcome. According to the controlled ovarian stimulation protocol, the growth of multiple follicles may result in different levels of serum P in the late follicles. Paulson and colleagues found that when serum P level exceeds a certain threshold, it triggers various endometrial changes that result in the pre-transformation of the endometrium. During the secretory phase, embryonic development rate gets out of sync with the endometrial phase, which negatively impacts successful implantation. Serum P levels in the late follicular phases correlate with the number of follicles formed. It has been suggested that ovarian reserve functions decreases with increasing serum P levels, and that too high or too low P level might lead to premature luteinization or follicle maturation. The quality of the embryo is impaired, and the opening time of the endometrial implantation window is significantly shortened, which interferes with embryonic implantation and development. Multiple studies have reported that in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) downregulated cycles, premature increase in P levels on the day of HCG administration negatively correlates with IVF outcomes. It should be noted that most of these studies included patients with different causes of infertility and the transplant date as well as the ovarian response degree were different. In addition, different P threshold values were used in different studies. These factors affect the reliability of the results and the capacity of P levels to be used as predictors of pregnancy outcomes. To address these shortcomings, we performed a retrospective analysis of the potential of P levels to be used as predictors of pregnancy outcomes in patients with simple fallopian tube defects-induced infertility. All participants in the studies were normal ovarian responders and the embryos were transferred on the third day.

### First trimester bleeding: evaluation and management [^bae013dc]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Approximately one-fourth of pregnant women will experience bleeding in the first trimester. The differential diagnosis includes threatened abortion, early pregnancy loss, and ectopic pregnancy. Pain and heavy bleeding are associated with an increased risk of early pregnancy loss. Treatment of threatened abortion is expectant management. Bed rest does not improve outcomes, and there is insufficient evidence supporting the use of progestins. Trends in quantitative ß subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (ß-hCG) levels provide useful information when distinguishing normal from abnormal early pregnancy. The discriminatory level (1,500 to 3,000 mIU per mL) is the ß-hCG level above which an intrauterine pregnancy should be visible on transvaginal ultrasonography. Failure to detect an intrauterine pregnancy, combined with ß-hCG levels higher than the discriminatory level, should raise concern for early pregnancy loss or ectopic pregnancy. Ultrasound findings diagnostic of early pregnancy loss include a mean gestational sac diameter of 25 mm or greater with no embryo and no fetal cardiac activity when the crown-rump length is 7 mm or more. Treatment options for early pregnancy loss include expectant management, medical management with mifepristone and misoprostol, or uterine aspiration. The incidence of ectopic pregnancy is 1% to 2% in the United States and accounts for 6% of all maternal deaths. Established criteria should be used to determine treatment options for ectopic pregnancy, including expectant management, medical management with methotrexate, or surgical intervention.

### Midluteal progesterone: a marker of treatment outcomes in couples with unexplained infertility [^3d1fdc89]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Context

Adequate luteal phase progesterone exposure is necessary to induce endometrial changes required for a successful pregnancy outcome. The relationship between low midluteal progesterone concentration and the outcome of live birth in ovarian stimulation with intrauterine insemination (OS-IUI) treatments is not defined.

Objective

To determine the level of midluteal progesterone portending a low chance of live birth after OS-IUI in couples with unexplained infertility.

Design and Setting

Secondary analyses of data from a prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trial that determined pregnancy outcomes following OS-IUI with clomiphene citrate, letrozole, or gonadotropins for couples with unexplained infertility.

Participants

Couples (n = 900) underwent 2376 OS-IUI cycles during the Assessment of Multiple Intrauterine Gestations from Ovarian Stimulation clinical trial.

Main Outcome Measures

Live birth as it relates to midluteal progesterone level and thresholds below which no live births occur by treatment group.

Results

Thresholds for non-live birth cycles were similar for clomiphene (14.4 ng/mL) and letrozole (13.1 ng/mL) yet were lower for gonadotropin (4.3 ng/mL) treatments. A midluteal progesterone level > 10th percentile specific for each treatment group independently was associated with greater odds for a live birth in all OS-IUI cycles (adjusted OR: 2.17; 95% CI: 1.05, 4.48).

Conclusions

During OS-IUI, a low midluteal progesterone level was associated with a low probability of live birth. Thresholds differed by medication, with the lowest threshold for gonadotropin. Several pathophysiologic mechanisms may account for low progesterone levels. Refinement of the predictive range associated with particular ovarian stimulation medications during treatment of unexplained infertility may improve accuracy.

### Can single progesterone concentration predict miscarriage in early pregnant women with threatened miscarriage: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^051a8381]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Subgroup analysis

The threshold of < 12 ng/mL was reported in 8 studies, the rest ranging from 12 to 30 ng/mL. When the threshold of < 12 ng/mL was adapted, progesterone yielded a higher ROC (0.90 vs. 0.78), positive LLR (8.3 vs. 3.8) and DOR (22 vs.12) than its counterpart (12 to 30 ng/mL), respectively (Table 3). Other factors including recruited location and region, progesterone measurement method, exogenous progesterone supplement and follow up, did little impacts on the diagnostic performance.

### Advancing human health in the decade ahead: pregnancy as a key window for discovery: a burroughs wellcome fund pregnancy think tank [^6e6f7aad]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Reconsidering fetal growth

Beyond the first trimester, precise changes in fetal growth represent a complex physiological process that may not be well captured by simple growth curves. Importantly, fetal growth is saltatory, not steady. Deciphering normal fetal growth requires deep understanding of cell differentiation and the individual, temporal growth patterns in response to environmental influences. These may perturb organ growth trajectories, such as those expressed in growth plate biology, where cell differentiation defines bone elongation.

Natural selection may favor rapid intrauterine growth of the human brain during fetal development, driving birth to occur relatively early, either before the fetal head becomes larger than the pelvic outlet or owing to maternal metabolic constraints. Yet, such acceleration in birth timing leads to an altricial neonate in terms of neurodevelopment and the lack of early independence. The traits may have influenced endocrine signals between the fetoplacental unit and the mother, thus linking fetal maturation (especially brain development) to 1 of the triggers for parturition. For example, although the onset of term labor in most species is triggered by a steep prepartum drop in maternal serum progesterone concentration, the serum abundance of progesterone in women remains high throughout pregnancy. Nonetheless, loss of the progesterone block to labor seems to be a terminal event in the parturition cascade of all viviparous species studies to date. In human pregnancy, this is thought to be achieved by redundant mechanisms that interfere with or overcome progesterone receptor signaling in uterine cells, which may be influenced by systemic or local factors, such as signals from an overdistended lower uterine segment.

Pregnancy can be viewed as a physical, cardiovascular, immunologic, metabolic, physiological, and psychosocial stress test for the mother whose homeostatic systems are challenged by placental hormones to mostly favor uterine quiescence while providing the fetus with resources needed to complete its growth and developmental program. In the future, gestational age as a surrogate for the developmental age of the fetus may be replaced by a panel of other biomarkers more reflective of fetal readiness for being delivered. A mismatch between the production of placental hormones and the responses of maternal organ systems to those hormones may disrupt maternal homeostasis leading to disease. Therefore, a detailed chronological map of the placental-maternal endocrine landscape during human pregnancy under different circumstances and in different environments is a central goal that is now attainable through recent advances in omic technologies. Such a map would illuminate key processes in normal and adverse pregnancy outcomes and may identify clinical disease risk biomarkers.

### Prenatal administration of progestogens for preventing spontaneous preterm birth in women with a multiple pregnancy [^f9844dec]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Multiple pregnancy is a strong risk factor for preterm birth, and more than 50% of women with a twin pregnancy will give birth prior to 37 weeks' gestation. Infants born preterm are recognised to be at increased risk of many adverse health outcomes, contributing to more than half of overall perinatal mortality. Progesterone is produced naturally in the body and has a role in maintaining pregnancy, although it is not clear whether administering progestogens to women with multiple pregnancy at high risk of early birth is effective and safe.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of progesterone administration for the prevention of preterm birth in women with a multiple pregnancy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (1 November 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials examining the administration of a progestogen by any route for the prevention of preterm birth in women with multiple pregnancy. We did not include quasi-randomised or cross-over studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed reports identified by the search for eligibility, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and graded the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We included 17 trials, which all compared either vaginal or intramuscular (IM) progesterone with a placebo or no treatment, and involved a total of 4773 women. The risk of bias for the majority of included studies was low, with the exception of four studies that had inadequate blinding, or significant loss to follow-up or both, or were not reported well enough for us to make a judgement. We graded the evidence low to high quality, with downgrading for statistical heterogeneity, design limitations in some of the studies contributing data, and imprecision of the effect estimate. 1 IM progesterone versus no treatment or placeboMore women delivered at less than 34 weeks' gestation in the IM progesterone group compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06 to 2.26; women = 399; studies = 2; low-quality evidence). Although the incidence of perinatal death in the progesterone group was higher, there was considerable uncertainty around the effect estimate and high heterogeneity between studies (average RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.60 to 3.51; infants = 3089; studies = 6; I² = 71%; low-quality evidence). No studies reported maternal mortality or major neurodevelopmental disability at childhood follow-up. There were no clear group differences found in any of the other maternal or infant outcomes (preterm birth less than 37 weeks (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.13; women = 2010; studies = 5; high-quality evidence); preterm birth less than 28 weeks (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.55; women = 1920; studies = 5; moderate-quality evidence); infant birthweight less than 2500 g (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.08; infants = 4071; studies = 5; I² = 76%, moderate-quality evidence)). No childhood outcomes were reported in the trials. 2 Vaginal progesterone versus no treatment or placebo by doseThere were no clear group differences in incidence of preterm birth before 34 weeks (average RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.09; women = 1727; studies = 6; I² = 46%; low-quality evidence). Although fewer births before 34 weeks appeared to occur in the progesterone group, the CIs crossed the line of no effect. Incidence of perinatal death was higher in the progesterone group, although there was considerable uncertainty in the effect estimate and the quality of the evidence was low for this outcome (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.06; infants = 2287; studies = 3; low-quality evidence). No studies reported maternal mortality or major neurodevelopmental disability at childhood follow-up. There were no clear group differences found in any of the other maternal or infant outcomes (preterm birth less than 37 weeks (average RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.06; women = 1597; studies = 6; moderate-quality evidence); preterm birth less than 28 weeks (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.21; women = 1569; studies = 4; low-quality evidence); infant birthweight less than 2500 g (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.03; infants = 3079; studies = 4; I² = 49%, moderate-quality evidence)). No childhood outcomes were reported in the trials. For secondary outcomes, there were no clear group differences found in any of the other maternal outcomes except for caesarean section, where women who received vaginal progesterone did not have as many caesarean sections as those in the placebo group, although the difference between groups was not large (7%) (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.98; women = 2143; studies = 6; I² = 0%). There were no clear group differences found in any of the infant outcomes except for mechanical ventilation, which was required by fewer infants whose mothers had received the vaginal progesterone (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.77; infants = 3134; studies = 5).

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, for women with a multiple pregnancy, the administration of progesterone (either IM or vaginal) does not appear to be associated with a reduction in risk of preterm birth or improved neonatal outcomes. Future research could focus on a comprehensive individual participant data meta-analysis including all of the available data relating to both IM and vaginal progesterone administration in women with a multiple pregnancy, before considering the need to conduct trials in subgroups of high-risk women (for example, women with a multiple pregnancy and a short cervical length identified on ultrasound).

### Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^2b0b6259]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in pregnancy — evidence and obstetric considerations state that androgen and cortisol levels increase gradually during pregnancy due to increases in sex hormone–binding globulin and corticosteroid-binding globulin, maternal 17OHP is elevated in normal pregnancy and hence cannot be used to monitor GC treatment, and clinicians should not use Dex, or other steroids that are not inactivated by placental 11β-HSD2, to treat pregnant women affected by CAH. High progesterone levels during pregnancy may compete for the MC receptor, theoretically necessitating increased fludrocortisone doses, but this possibility has not been tested, and nonspecific symptoms of adrenal insufficiency may develop in pregnancy such that GC and/or fludrocortisone doses may be increased if such signs and symptoms occur, with a GC dosage increase of 20% to 40% from the 24th week onward often beneficial. During labor and delivery, stress doses of GCs should be administered, but there are no controlled studies regarding optimal dosing. Women with CAH may be at increased risk for gestational diabetes; thus, clinicians should monitor glucose tolerance as clinical judgment indicates throughout pregnancy, and treatment should be individualized for pregnant patients with CAH. Caesarean section is the most common method of delivery, although vaginal delivery has been reported in 16% to 42% of women, and similar principles of pregnancy management apply to women with NCCAH requiring GC treatment during pregnancy.

### Pharmacokinetics of vaginal progesterone in pregnancy [^c1b5b89f]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Characterization of pharmacokinetics is lacking for vaginal progesterone in pregnancy. Dosing of vaginal progesterone for preterm birth prevention has been empirical. Owing to pregnancy-related changes in vaginal and uterine blood flow, hepatic metabolism, renal clearance, and endogenously elevated serum progesterone, studies outside of pregnancy may not be applicable. The lack of the pharmacokinetics profile of vaginally administered progesterone in pregnancy limits the ability to define the exposure-response relationship needed to optimize dosing, which has implications for its use in research and clinical care regarding management of short cervix, prevention of recurrent preterm birth, and prevention of recurrent miscarriage.

Objective

This was a study to establish the feasibility of using serum progesterone to establish basic pharmacokinetic parameters of vaginal progesterone in pregnancy for preterm birth prevention.

Study Design

This is a prospective study of 6 low-risk singletons at 18 0/7 to 23 6/7 weeks' gestation with body mass index 20–40. Exclusion criteria were current vaginitis, abnormal Pap smear, prescription medication use, cervical length ≤ 25 mm, prior preterm birth, and contraindication to progesterone. Participants received a single dose of 200 mg micronized vaginal progesterone and serum progesterone levels were evaluated every 2 hours from 0 to 12 hours and then 24 hours post dose. Primary outcome was concentration/time profile of serum progesterone.

Results

Median (range) maternal age was 27 (21.5–33.3) years, median body mass index was 26.5 (23.3–29.0) kg/m², and median gestational age was 22.9 (21.0–23.4) weeks. Median baseline serum progesterone was 47 (40–52) ng/mL, median peak concentration was 54 (48–68) ng/mL, and median time to peak was 12 (4–15) hours. There was a trend in rising serum progesterone over baseline with a median change in peak concentration of 11 ng/mL and interquartile range of 2–22. Median percent change from baseline was an increase by 24% (interquartile range, 4%-53%). However, there was no clear elimination phase and the median area under the curve was 112 ng*h/mL with an interquartile range of -43 to 239.

Conclusion

Unlike in nonpregnant individuals, administration of vaginal progesterone in pregnant individuals only minimally impacts systemic exposure. There is a limited trend of rising serum progesterone over baseline levels, with significant inter-individual variability. Serum progesterone is unlikely to be a good candidate for establishing pharmacokinetics or dosing of vaginal progesterone in pregnancy for preterm birth prevention.

### Updated clinical guidance for the use of progesterone supplementation for the prevention of recurrent preterm birth [^d2374cbe]. ACOG (2023). High credibility.

17-OHPC for recurrent preterm birth — regulatory context indicates the FDA's assessment concluded there were not sufficient data to indicate effectiveness in the broad population it was approved for, namely all pregnant people with a prior spontaneous preterm birth between 20 and 37 weeks of gestation, and the FDA does not seem to base its decision on safety concerns. Although compounding remains an option, the FDA's decision to withdraw approval of Makena will significantly impact access to and availability of 17-OHPC for the prevention of preterm birth. Whether this intervention would be useful in a subset of people requires future study.

Summary of recommendations and conclusions (Level A) — Based on good and consistent scientific evidence, there is no role for the prophylactic use of any tocolytic agent in women with multifetal gestations, including the prolonged use of betamimetics for this indication, and progesterone treatment does not reduce the incidence of spontaneous preterm birth in unselected women with twin or triplet gestations and, therefore, is not recommended.

### Accuracy of single progesterone test to predict early pregnancy outcome in women with pain or bleeding: meta-analysis of cohort studies [^a85ddf40]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Progesterone test in women with pain or bleeding and inconclusive ultrasound

Seven prospective cohort studies, including 2379 women, in women with pain or bleeding and inconclusive ultrasound diagnosis evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the single serum progesterone measurement to predict the possibility of a viable pregnancy, miscarriage, or ectopic pregnancy. The thresholds of progesterone used ranged from 3.2 to 11 ng/mL (10 to 35 nmol/L); the most commonly used threshold was 5 ng/mL (16 nmol/L), which was used in three studies. Figures 3and 4show the estimated sensitivities and specificities when using the single progesterone measurement test for differentiating between viable and non-viable pregnancies, which includes both miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies. After meta-analysis of five studies (1998 participants) with similar cut-off values (3.2 to 6 ng/mL), we found that a single progesterone measurement predicted a non-viable pregnancy with pooled sensitivity of 74.6% (95% confidence interval 50.6% to 89.4%), specificity of 98.4% (90.9% to 99.7%), positive likelihood ratio of 45 (7.1 to 289), and negative likelihood ratio of 0.26 (0.12 to 0.57). In the studies included in this meta-analysis, the median prevalence of a non-viable pregnancy was 73.2%. However, if progesterone was lower than the cut-off value (3.2 to 6 ng/mL), the probability of a non-viable pregnancy was 99.2% compared with 44.8% if progesterone was higher. The progesterone test had a very poor predictive accuracy for diagnosing ectopic pregnancy, for which a low progesterone concentration did not rule in or out an ectopic pregnancy (table).

### Luteal phase support [^054464b7]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop a consensus regarding the need for luteal phase support during assisted reproductive technology (ART), and to establish the optimal compound and route of administration for this purpose.

Design

Review of the published literature on luteal phase support.

Patient(S)

Women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies.

Intervention(S)

Progesterone was administered orally, vaginally, or by intramuscular (i.m.) injection to supplement the luteal phase after assisted reproductive technology (ART).

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Pregnancy following ART. RESULT(S); Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH)-agonist protocols necessitate the use of luteal phase support. Progesterone and human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) have both been used for this purpose, with comparable outcomes. Progesterone is the product of choice, however, as it is associated with a lower incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Its use is indicated up to the serum pregnancy test. Oral, i.m., and vaginal progesterone preparations are available. Intramuscular and vaginal preparations lead to comparable rates of implantation and clinical pregnancy, despite higher serum progesterone levels after i.m. injection. Oral formulations are inferior products for luteal support. Although widely used, i.m. progesterone is uncomfortable and inconvenient for patients. By contrast, the vaginal progesterone gel (Crinone 8%) is more convenient and easier to use.

Conclusion(S)

Progesterone support of the luteal phase in in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles is indicated, though support beyond the serum pregnancy test may not be needed. The pregnancy rates after vaginal and i.m. progesterone support are comparable, despite higher serum levels after i.m. injection. Patients prefer the vaginal progesterone gel.

### Validation of serum progesterone [^8ff7ae20]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Our recent paper, based on a pilot cohort of 119 women, showed that serum progesterone < 35 nmol/L was prognostic of spontaneous miscarriage by 16 weeks in women with threatened miscarriage in early pregnancy. Using a larger cohort of women from the same setting (validation cohort), we aim to assess the validity of serum progesterone < 35 nmol/L with the outcome of spontaneous miscarriage by 16 weeks.

Methods

In a prospective cohort study, 360 pregnant women presenting with threatened miscarriage between gestation weeks 6–10 at a tertiary hospital emergency unit for women in Singapore were recruited for this study. The main outcome measure measured is spontaneous miscarriage prior to week 16 of gestation. Area under the ROC curve (AUC) and test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value) at a serum progesterone cutpoint of < 35 nmol/L for predicting high and low risk of spontaneous miscarriage by 16 weeks were compared between the Pilot and Validation cohorts.

Results

Test characteristics and AUC values using serum progesterone < 35 nmol/L in the validation cohort were not significantly different from those in the Pilot cohort, demonstrating excellent accuracy and reproducibility of the proposed serum progesterone cut-off level.

Conclusions

The cut-off value for serum progesterone (35 nmol/L) demonstrated clinical relevance and allow clinicians to stratify patients into high and low risk groups for spontaneous miscarriage.

### Progesterone [^1b19fbeb]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of progesterone IM (also known as Prometrium, Crinone) in pregnant patients for first trimester: use with caution. Select progesterone products are specifically labeled for use to provide luteal support during early pregnancy. Animal studies involving oral, vaginal, or in utero administration of progesterone have not indicated evidence of fetal harm. Progesterone vaginal gel may be used to support early pregnancy as part of an ART (ART) program; if pregnancy occurs, the gel is typically continued for 10 to 12 weeks until placental production of progesterone is adequate to support the pregnancy. Similarly, progesterone vaginal inserts are used for up to 10 weeks in ART. Progesterone should only be used during early pregnancy under the observation of an ART specialist. Data suggest that vaginal progesterone is effective in preventing preterm delivery and associated neonatal complications, especially during high-risk singleton pregnancy; administration usually is initiated at 16 to 24 weeks gestation and continues through 34 weeks gestation. Progesterone should not be used if there is ectopic pregnancy, missed/ incomplete abortion, or during diagnostic tests for pregnancy. Progesterone capsules are only indicated in postmenopausal women, and thus this dosage form is specifically contraindicated for use during pregnancy. The drug progesterone IM (also known as Prometrium, Crinone) is classified under category A in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by a large number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without any proven increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the fetus having been observed.

### Progestogen for treating threatened miscarriage [^6fa65efd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Miscarriage is a common complication encountered during pregnancy. The role of progesterone in preparing the uterus for the implantation of the embryo and its role in maintaining the pregnancy have been known for a long time. Inadequate secretion of progesterone in early pregnancy has been linked to the aetiology of miscarriage and progesterone supplementation has been used as a treatment for threatened miscarriage to prevent spontaneous pregnancy loss.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and the safety of progestogens in the treatment of threatened miscarriage.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (December 2009) and bibliographies of all located articles for any unidentified articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials that compare progestogen with placebo, no treatment or any other treatment given in an effort to treat threatened miscarriage.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two authors assessed the trials for inclusion in the review and extracted the data.

Main Results

Two studies (84 participants) were included in the meta-analysis. In one study, all the participants met the inclusion criteria and in the other study, only the subgroup of participants who met the inclusion criteria was included in the meta-analysis. There was no evidence of effectiveness with the use vaginal progesterone compared to placebo in reducing the risk of miscarriage (risk ratio 0.47; 95% confidence interval 0.17 to 1.30).

Authors' Conclusions

Based on scarce data from two methodologically poor trials, there is no evidence to support the routine use of progestogens for the treatment of threatened miscarriage. Information about potential harms to the mother or child, or both, with the use of progestogens is lacking. Further, larger, randomized controlled trials on the effect of progestogens on the treatment of threatened miscarriage, which investigate potential harms as well as benefits, are needed.

### Oral progesterone for the prevention of recurrent preterm birth: systematic review and metaanalysis [^d08a0ab2]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective Data

The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review and metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials on oral progesterone compared with placebo or other interventions for preterm birth prevention in singleton pregnancies with previous spontaneous preterm birth. The primary outcome was preterm birth at < 37 weeks gestation; the secondary outcomes included preterm birth rate at < 34 weeks gestation, neonatal morbidity/death, and maternal side-effects.

Study

Searches were performed in PubMed, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, PROSPERO, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Register with the use of a combination of words related to "preterm birth", "preterm delivery", "progesterone", "progestogens", and "oral" from inception of each database to April 2018. Additionally, systematic reviews on progesterone for preterm birth prevention that were identified in our search were also reviewed for additional studies. We included all randomized trials of asymptomatic singleton gestations with previous spontaneous singleton preterm birth that had been randomized to prophylactic treatment with oral progesterone vs placebo, no treatment, or other preterm birth intervention. Exclusion criteria included quasirandomized trials, trials that involved women with preterm labor/membrane rupture at the time of randomization or multiple gestations.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

The risk of bias and quality of evidence were assessed for each study. All analyses were done with an intention-to-treat approach. The primary outcome was incidence of preterm birth at < 37 weeks gestation; the secondary outcomes included preterm birth at < 34 and < 28 weeks gestation, maternal adverse events, maternal serum progesterone level, and neonatal morbidity and death. Summary measures were reported as relative risk or mean difference. I² > 30% was used to identify heterogeneity.

Results

The search strategy identified 79 distinct studies. Three trials on oral progesterone vs placebo (involved 386 patients: 196 in oral progesterone and 190 in placebo) met the inclusion criteria; there were no studies on oral progesterone vs other intervention that met inclusion criteria. Metaanalysis demonstrated a significantly decreased risk of preterm birth at < 37 weeks gestation (42% vs 63%; P = 0.0005; relative risk, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.55–0.84), preterm birth at < 34 weeks gestation (29% vs 53%; P < .00001; relative risk, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.43–0.71), and increased gestational age of delivery (mean difference, 1.71 weeks; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–2.30) with oral progesterone compared with placebo. There was a significantly lower rate of perinatal death (5% vs 17%; P = 0.001; relative risk 0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.16–0.63), neonatal intensive care admission (relative risk, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.25–0.61), respiratory distress syndrome (relative risk, 0.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.05–0.93), and higher birthweight (mean difference, 435.06 g; 95% confidence interval, 324.59–545.52) with oral progesterone. There was a higher rate of maternal adverse effects with oral progesterone that included dizziness (relative risk, 2.95; 95% confidence interval, 1.47–5.90), somnolence (relative risk, 2.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.29–3.30), and vaginal dryness (relative risk, 2.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.10–5.11); no serious adverse effects were noted.

Conclusion

Oral progesterone appears to be effective for the prevention of recurrent preterm birth and a reduction in perinatal morbidity and mortality rates in asymptomatic singleton gestations with a history of previous spontaneous preterm birth compared with placebo. There were also increased adverse effects with oral progesterone therapy compared with placebo, although none were serious. Further randomized study on oral progesterone compared with other established therapies for the prevention of recurrent preterm birth are warranted.

Progesterone is essential for the establishment and maintenance of a pregnancy. Withdrawal of progesterone in early pregnancy typically results in a miscarriage, and antiprogesterone drugs are powerful inducers of abortion. The central role of progesterone in early pregnancy led clinicians and researchers to hypothesize that progesterone deficiency could be a cause of some miscarriages. This hypothesis has resulted in numerous clinical trials of progesterone supplementation in women at high risk of miscarriage. The 2 groups of women at particular risk of miscarriage are those who have a history of recurrent miscarriage and those who are bleeding in early pregnancy. The first randomized trial in women with recurrent miscarriage was published in 1953, and 11 trials followed in the subsequent decades. The first trial in women with threatened miscarriage was published in 1987, and since then 7 further trials have been conducted. However, these trials used different progestogens and were small and methodologically weak, producing heterogenous and unreliable results. Policy makers have therefore been unable to make evidence-based recommendations on the use of progestogen supplementation to improve outcomes in these cohorts of women. For instance, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists reviewed the evidence in 2015 and concluded that "For threatened early pregnancy loss, the use of progestins is controversial, and conclusive evidence supporting their use is lacking. Women who have experienced at least three prior pregnancy losses, however, may benefit from progesterone therapy in the first trimester". Similarly, in the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence concluded in 2012 that "a very large multicentre randomised controlled trial of women receiving treatment with either progesterone/progestogen or placebo for threatened miscarriage should be conducted". The PROMISE (PROgesterone in recurrent MIScarriagE) and PRISM (PRogesterone In Spontaneous Miscarriage) trials were conducted to generate robust evidence on the role of progesterone therapy to prevent miscarriage and increase the live birth rate.

In this review, we critically evaluate the results from the PROMISE and PRISM trials to assess what they add to our existing knowledge. We move beyond statistical inference to provide a full scientific inference by taking into account the context, biological rationale, biological gradient, external evidence, and consistency across the studies. We assess the evidence for key prespecified subgroup effects using robust guidelines. Finally, we provide our recommendations for clinical practice.

### Diagnosis and treatment of luteal phase deficiency: a committee opinion [^2b7f44f9]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Normal luteal physiology — A typical luteal phase length is relatively fixed at 12–14 days but may range from 11–17 days, and progesterone levels peak in nonpregnancy cycles 6–8 days after ovulation. Progesterone is secreted in pulses under the control of luteinizing hormone (LH), and progesterone levels may fluctuate up to eightfold within 90 minutes. Once implantation occurs, progesterone secretion by the corpus luteum depends on rising human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) levels, and failure of hCG levels to increase results directly in corpus luteum failure and a decline in progesterone levels.

### Accuracy of single progesterone test to predict early pregnancy outcome in women with pain or bleeding: meta-analysis of cohort studies [^c6c44eb1]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and weaknesses of study

The strengths of our study are that we did an extensive systematic search of electronic databases without language restrictions, which would have captured all existing good quality studies. The high number of included studies in our meta-analyses strengthens the power of our conclusions and enabled us to explore the diagnostic accuracy of the progesterone test for multiple cut-off values. The methodological quality of the studies included in the review was satisfactory, but some limitations of doing pragmatic studies in this clinical setting were highlighted. The classification of women according to their pregnancy outcome, which was used as the reference standard, is a problem for miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies as in many cases a firm diagnosis cannot be made. Even though the studies did not adopt a blinded assessment of the reference standard, which in our case was the final diagnosis, this is unlikely to have introduced bias when it comes to distinguishing between viable and non-viable pregnancies, as viable pregnancies lead to a live birth and most of the studies had long enough follow-up to verify this outcome. The primary studies did not adjust for known confounding factors, such as the gestational age, but this could be explained by the high prevalence of non-viable pregnancies, in which changes in progesterone concentrations are poorly described compared with viable pregnancies. Assessment of quality was also hampered by unclear reporting in some studies. Poor reporting occurred in most of the studies in the description of the reference standard, reporting of uninterpretable results, and explanation of withdrawals from the study.

Many studies, especially for women with pain or bleeding who did not have an ultrasound assessment, had very different prevalences of pregnancy outcomes compared with more recent studies; this reflects the different clinical settings and populations that this test evaluated. Despite the heterogeneity, all studies reported good predictive ability of the progesterone test to differentiate viable pregnancies from miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies, especially in women with pain or bleeding with inconclusive ultrasound results, in whom the chance of miscarriages or ectopic pregnancies is high. The test, therefore, has generalisability and may be applicable in clinical practice in a variety of settings.
