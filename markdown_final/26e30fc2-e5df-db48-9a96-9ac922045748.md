## Question

does tranexamic acid or naproxen pose the greater clot risk?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether tranexamic acid or naproxen poses the greater clot risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic mechanisms that plausibly influence thrombosis. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence for naproxen, especially boxed warnings and meta-analyses. Next, I will examine the highest-quality evidence for tranexamic acid, including large RCTs and meta-analyses, and I should double-check for context-specific exceptions. After that, I need to compare absolute and relative risks across populations and doses. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded conclusion with caveats and monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic starting points, because mechanism often predicts clinical risk. Naproxen, a nonselective NSAID, inhibits COX-1 and COX-2, reducing prostacyclin and tilting the hemostatic balance toward platelet aggregation and thrombosis; this is why NSAIDs carry class warnings for serious cardiovascular thrombotic events including MI and stroke, with risk emerging early and rising with dose and duration [^c74e298c] [^205b71c1] [^36424417]. Tranexamic acid, in contrast, is an antifibrinolytic that stabilizes fibrin by inhibiting plasminogen activation; theoretically it could promote thrombosis, but clinically the net effect depends on the fibrinolytic milieu and patient context, so I should not jump to conclusions without data [^3b595566] [^4b659b77].

> Next, I should review naproxen's risk signal from regulatory and high-quality syntheses. The FDA boxed warning repeatedly states that NSAIDs, including naproxen, increase the risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events such as MI and stroke, can be fatal, and that this risk can occur early in treatment; the relative increase appears similar in those with and without cardiovascular disease, though absolute risk is higher in patients with CVD or risk factors [^c74e298c] [^205b71c1] [^36424417]. Hold on, I should verify whether any NSAID is "safer" here; consensus statements note that while some data suggest naproxen may have a more favorable CV profile than COX-2–selective agents or diclofenac, the evidence is mixed and not sufficient to declare naproxen safe in high CV risk, so the class warning still applies [^c8bd2b54].

> Now, I will examine tranexamic acid's thrombotic risk in large, high-quality evidence sets. Multiple large meta-analyses of randomized trials show no increase in venous or arterial thrombotic events with intravenous tranexamic acid across diverse bleeding populations, including trauma, surgery, and obstetrics. For example, a 216-trial meta-analysis of 125,550 patients found no association with total thromboembolic events, and a 234-trial meta-analysis of 102,681 bleeding patients likewise found no increase in thrombotic events, VTE, ACS, or stroke, with high-certainty evidence for thrombosis outcomes [^3361dc3e] [^61860042] [^82f4085d]. Wait, let me verify exceptions; yes, in acute gastrointestinal bleeding, the HALT-IT trial showed no mortality benefit and a higher risk of venous thromboembolism with high-dose, prolonged TXA, particularly in patients with liver disease, so context matters and I should flag that exception explicitly [^ef18b33d] [^b0b24282] [^3b913ace].

> I should also review oral tranexamic acid for heavy menstrual bleeding, where theoretical concerns are most often raised. A large Danish nationwide cohort of 2 million women found a very small absolute increase in VTE with oral TXA of about 9 per 10,000 person-years, translating to a number needed to harm of roughly 78,549 for a 5-day course; importantly, the study excluded women with known thrombotic risk factors and concomitant prothrombotic exposures, and no increase in arterial thrombosis was observed, supporting that the absolute risk is extremely low in otherwise healthy reproductive-age women [^fc30c7ce] [^0393f487] [^523d88ca]. Hold on, I should verify consistency; yes, this aligns with earlier observational signals and with guideline positions that acknowledge theoretical risk but do not demonstrate clinically meaningful VTE excess in typical users [^f4a70dcd] [^11bad3c9].

> Let me consider dose, timing, and patient context, because these modify risk. For naproxen, higher daily doses and longer durations consistently associate with greater CV thrombotic risk, and risk can emerge within weeks of initiation; minimizing dose and duration is advised, especially in patients with CVD or multiple risk factors [^c74e298c] [^205b71c1] [^36424417]. For tranexamic acid, standard perioperative or trauma dosing (for example, 1–2 g IV bolus with or without infusion) has not been linked to increased thrombosis in RCTs and meta-analyses, whereas very high-dose, prolonged regimens (such as 4 g over 24 hours) in GI bleeding have been associated with more VTE, and seizures are dose-related; thus, dose restraint and indication-specific caution are prudent [^3361dc3e] [^61860042] [^ef18b33d] [^882e7826]. I should double-check that the balance remains favorable in surgery and trauma; indeed, major surgical guidelines endorse TXA to reduce bleeding without excess thrombosis when used appropriately [^c9ca4877] [^33183233].

> But wait, what if the clinical scenario is intracranial hemorrhage or a patient with active thrombosis? I need to ensure I don't overgeneralize. In spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage, some meta-analytic subgroup analyses suggest a higher rate of thrombotic events with TXA, though results are inconsistent and not definitive; given mechanistic plausibility and limited benefit, many neurocritical care pathways avoid TXA in this setting unless part of a trial or specific protocol [^9fa4d757] [^882e7826]. Likewise, TXA is contraindicated in active intravascular clotting, so patients with ongoing thrombosis should not receive it, and concomitant prothrombotic agents (for example, factor concentrates, hormonal contraception) should be avoided with TXA to mitigate compounded risk [^71a059a1] [^23ea91d0] [^9b53eb54].

> I will now compare magnitudes carefully. Naproxen confers a clear, clinically relevant increase in serious cardiovascular thrombotic events with a class effect signal that is dose- and duration-dependent and relevant even in patients without established CVD, though absolute risk varies with baseline risk [^c74e298c] [^205b71c1] [^36424417]. Tranexamic acid, in contrast, shows no increase in thrombotic events in the vast majority of bleeding contexts and populations, with the notable exception of high-dose, prolonged use in GI bleeding; in oral use for heavy menstrual bleeding, the absolute VTE excess is on the order of 0.09 per 1,000 person-years, which is negligible in typical users [^3361dc3e] [^61860042] [^ef18b33d] [^fc30c7ce]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overstating TXA's safety; yes, rare case reports of arterial thrombosis exist, but these do not overturn the large RCT and meta-analytic signal of no increased thrombosis with standard dosing in appropriate indications [^cfb7c378] [^3361dc3e].

> Putting this together, I should conclude clearly. Naproxen poses the greater clot risk in routine clinical use because it carries a consistent, dose-related increase in serious arterial thrombotic events (MI and stroke) across populations, with risk emerging early and persisting with continued use; this is reflected in boxed warnings and supported by meta-analytic data for the NSAID class [^c74e298c] [^205b71c1] [^36424417]. Tranexamic acid does not increase thrombotic events in most settings when used at standard doses, with the important exception of high-dose, prolonged regimens in gastrointestinal bleeding where VTE risk was higher in HALT-IT; in oral use for heavy menstrual bleeding, the absolute thrombotic risk is extremely low, and large meta-analyses of IV TXA in bleeding patients show no excess thrombosis overall [^ef18b33d] [^b0b24282] [^fc30c7ce] [^3361dc3e] [^61860042].

> Practically, I need to ensure risk is contextualized. For patients with cardiovascular disease or high CV risk who need analgesia, naproxen should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest time, with consideration of alternatives and close monitoring for CV symptoms; conversely, in patients with active bleeding or surgical indications, tranexamic acid is generally safe and beneficial at standard doses, with avoidance in active thrombosis and caution with very high doses or in liver disease where VTE risk may be amplified [^c74e298c] [^205b71c1] [^3361dc3e] [^ef18b33d] [^71a059a1]. I should confirm that this aligns with guidelines; yes, surgical and obstetric guidance supports TXA to reduce bleeding without excess thrombosis, while NSAID guidance emphasizes CV risk mitigation and individualized selection [^c9ca4877] [^33183233] [^c74e298c].

Naproxen carries a **greater clot risk** than tranexamic acid. Naproxen increases the risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events (myocardial infarction and stroke) [^c74e298c], especially with prolonged use or in patients with cardiovascular risk factors [^205b71c1]. In contrast, tranexamic acid does not increase thrombotic risk in most clinical settings [^3361dc3e] [^61860042], with the exception of a small increase in venous thromboembolism observed in gastrointestinal bleeding trials [^ef18b33d]. Overall, naproxen's clot risk is **clinically significant and dose-dependent**, whereas tranexamic acid's risk is low and context-specific.

---

## Pharmacological mechanisms influencing clot risk

### Naproxen

Naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, thereby reducing prostaglandin synthesis. This inhibition leads to **impaired platelet aggregation** and endothelial dysfunction, increasing the risk of arterial thrombotic events such as myocardial infarction and stroke [^c74e298c]. The risk is dose- and duration-dependent and is particularly elevated in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease or risk factors [^205b71c1].

---

### Tranexamic acid

Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent that inhibits plasminogen activation, thereby stabilizing fibrin clots and reducing bleeding. While its mechanism suggests a theoretical risk of promoting thrombosis, clinical evidence shows that tranexamic acid **does not significantly increase thrombotic events** in most settings [^3361dc3e] [^61860042]. The risk appears to be context-specific, with a small increase in venous thromboembolism observed in gastrointestinal bleeding trials [^ef18b33d].

---

## Clinical evidence on clot risk

### Naproxen

Multiple large clinical trials and meta-analyses have consistently demonstrated that naproxen increases the risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke [^c74e298c]. The risk is **similar in patients with and without cardiovascular disease**, although the absolute incidence is higher in those with pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors [^205b71c1]. The risk is dose- and duration-dependent, with higher doses and prolonged use further increasing the likelihood of thrombotic events [^36424417].

---

### Tranexamic acid

Extensive clinical evidence indicates that tranexamic acid **does not significantly increase thrombotic risk** in most clinical scenarios [^3361dc3e]. Large meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials have shown no significant increase in venous or arterial thrombotic events with tranexamic acid use in surgical, trauma, or obstetric settings [^61860042] [^82f4085d]. However, a notable exception is the HALT-IT trial in gastrointestinal bleeding, which reported a small increase in venous thromboembolism with high-dose tranexamic acid (4 g over 24 hours) [^ef18b33d]. This increased risk was not observed in lower-dose regimens or in other clinical contexts [^9fa4d757].

## Comparative summary of clot risk

| **Medication** | **Clot risk evidence** | **Clinical context** | **Risk level** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Naproxen | - Increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events (myocardial infarction, stroke) <br/> - Dose- and duration-dependent <br/> - Risk applies to all patients, higher absolute risk in those with cardiovascular disease | - General use <br/> - Especially concerning in patients with cardiovascular risk factors | High |
| Tranexamic acid | - No significant increase in thrombotic events in most clinical settings <br/> - Small increase in venous thromboembolism observed in gastrointestinal bleeding trials with high-dose regimens <br/> - No significant increase in surgical, trauma, or obstetric settings | - Surgical procedures <br/> - Trauma <br/> - Obstetric hemorrhage <br/> - Gastrointestinal bleeding (high-dose regimens) | Low to moderate (context-dependent) |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize the cardiovascular risks associated with NSAIDs, including naproxen, and recommend using the **lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible**, especially in patients with cardiovascular risk factors [^c74e298c]. In contrast, tranexamic acid is widely recommended for bleeding control in surgical, trauma, and obstetric settings due to its favorable safety profile regarding thrombotic events [^c9ca4877] [^f6d95d19].

---

## Conclusion

Naproxen carries a **greater clot risk** than tranexamic acid. Naproxen significantly increases the risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, particularly with prolonged use or in patients with cardiovascular risk factors [^c74e298c]. Tranexamic acid, on the other hand, does not significantly increase thrombotic risk in most clinical settings, with the exception of a small increase in venous thromboembolism observed in gastrointestinal bleeding trials using high-dose regimens [^3361dc3e] [^ef18b33d]. Therefore, clinicians should carefully consider patient-specific risk factors and clinical context when prescribing these medications.

### When to use tranexamic acid for the treatment of major bleeding? [^4b659b77]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). Medium credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an antifibrinolytic agent originally developed for the management of bleeding in the setting of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Over the last 15 years, there has been accumulating evidence on the use of TXA for the treatment of active bleeding in a variety of clinical contexts. Clinical trials have shown that the efficacy and safety of TXA for the treatment of bleeding differ according to the clinical context in which it is being administered, timing of administration, and dose. Early administration is important for efficacy, particularly in trauma and PPH. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms by which TXA provides benefit, optimal modes of administration and dosing, and its effect in some clinical settings, such as spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. There is no evidence that TXA increases the risk of thrombotic events in patients with major bleeding overall. However, there is evidence of increased risk of venous thrombosis in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding. There is also evidence of increased risk of seizures with the use of higher doses. This review summarizes the current evidence for the use of TXA for patients with active bleeding and highlights the importance of generating evidence of efficacy and safety of hemostatic interventions specific to the bleeding contexts-as findings from 1 clinical setting may not be generalizable to other contexts-and that of individual patient assessment for bleeding, thrombotic, and other risks, as well as important logistical and other practical considerations, to optimize care and outcomes in these settings.

### Wider use of tranexamic acid to reduce surgical bleeding could benefit patients and health systems [^1fcbc90b]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomised trials of tranexamic acid for bleeding show no evidence of any increased risk of intravascular thrombotic events. These meta-analyses include between 50 000 and 100 000 patients and even when limited to the large, high quality trials, there is no apparent increased risk of thrombosis. How do we explain this biologically? Tranexamic acid reduces blood transfusion and blood transfusion is pro-thrombotic. Large cohort studies that control for confounding show that perioperative blood transfusion doubles the risk of venous thromboembolism with a clear dose-response relation. Restrictive transfusion policies are associated with a statistically significant reduction in hospital mortality. By reducing the risk of major bleeding, tranexamic acid is likely to reduce the duration of anaesthesia and the need for intensive care. Furthermore, less postoperative anaemia and wound infection, facilitating early ambulation and discharge, should also reduce the risk of thrombosis while improving patient outcomes.

### Tranexamic acid: less bleeding and less thrombosis? [^00ece855]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

The early administration of tranexamic acid (TXA) to bleeding trauma patients reduces all-cause mortality without increasing the risk of vascular occlusive events. Indeed, the risk of arterial thrombosis appears to be reduced with TXA. In this commentary we hypothesize that TXA has an antithrombotic effect and explore potential mechanisms. These include inhibition of the inflammatory effects of plasmin, effects on platelets and effects on factors V and VIII. If proven, these antithrombotic effects would have major implications for the systemic use of TXA in surgical patients, where TXA has been clearly shown to reduce bleeding.

### Oral tranexamic acid and thrombosis risk in women [^fc30c7ce]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

We were able to exclude women with known increased risk of thrombotic disease. These restrictions were made to investigate, if oral tranexamic acid, in itself, and not in the presence of thrombotic risk factors, is associated with thrombotic disease. Since the majority of reproductive-aged women are in good health without thrombogenic diseases, the restrictions do not undermine the external validity of our findings, which is further confirmed by the consistency between the observed incidence rate of thrombotic disease in the reference population in the current study and the existing literature on reproductive-aged women.

Since the effect of oral tranexamic acid on heavy menstrual bleeding is well-established in randomised trials, it would be unethical to initiate a randomised trial for the purpose of investigating a possible fatal adverse event in patients suffering from a non-fatal condition that may be managed successfully with other treatment options. Considering that we had to follow more than 60,000 oral tranexamic acid users redeeming around 150,000 prescriptions to observe 16 venous thromboembolisms and ten arterial thromboses, a randomised trial would have to be of a significant size in order to study the risk of thrombosis associated with oral tranexamic acid in women with heavy menstrual bleeding. Thus, logistically, it would be very difficult and expensive to execute such randomised controlled trial. Therefore, we believe a non-interventional post-authorization safety study, such as the one conducted, to be the best possible way to study the research question of interest.

3.4 The age-standardised incidence rates of thrombosis associated with use of oral tranexamic acid and numbers needed to harm

While the age-standardised incidence rate of venous thromboembolism was 2·5 (2·4 to 2·6) per 10,000 person-years in non-use of oral tranexamic acid, the difference in age-standardised incidence rate of venous thromboembolism between use and non-use was 9·3 (8·4 to 10·3) per 10,000 person-years; approximately one extra venous thromboembolism was diagnosed for every 78,549 women using oral tranexamic acid for five days.

For arterial thrombosis, the age-standardised incidence rate in non-use was 3·0 (2·9 to 3·1) per 10,000 person-years, and the difference between use and non-use of oral tranexamic acid was non-significant, 0·4 (−0·7 to 1·5) per 10,000 person-years, the best estimated number needed to harm being 1826,262 for five days of treatment.

All exposed women experiencing a venous thromboembolism within five days plus one week from date of filled prescription only purchased 15 g of oral tranexamic acid prior to the event.

3.5 Thromboses in excluded and censored users of oral tranexamic acid

Only five additional thromboses occurred in excluded and permanently censored users of oral tranexamic acid (Supplementary Appendix Table S2). Similarly, only five venous thromboembolisms were observed during concomitant use of oral tranexamic acid and combined hormonal contraception, and even fewer thromboses were observed in concomitant use with systemic progestogens or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (Supplementary Appendix Table S3).

### Oral tranexamic acid and thrombosis risk in women [^523d88ca]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Only two observational studies have assessed the association between use of oral tranexamic acid for heavy menstrual bleeding and risk of venous thromboembolism. One indicated an increased risk, the other a protective effect. The case-control suggesting a protective effect (odds ratio 0.55 (0.31 to 0.97)) did not adjust for any potentially confounding factors other than age and geography. In the same study population, use of oral contraceptives was associated with two-fold odds of venous thromboembolism. Oral contraceptives are also known to reduce the risk of heavy menstrual bleeding and thereby the need for oral tranexamic acid. Thus, the apparent protective effect of tranexamic acid usage is likely explained by the lack of controlling for use of oral contraceptives.

This nationwide cohort study following around 2.0 million women for a total of almost 14 million person-years adds novel knowledge about the safety profile of a drug used to treat a high-frequent condition among reproductive-aged women. Through the reliable national registries, we were able to include all eligible women with no loss-to-follow-up and to eliminate a wealth of possible confounding factors such as use of hormonal contraception and pregnancy. In the Danish National Patient Registry, the positive predictive value of a first-time diagnosis of either deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism in a non-emergency department is quite high, i.e. 89%. Since most patients receive free anticoagulation therapy from the hospital without prescription following a venous thromboembolism, we were only able to confirm 42% of diagnoses. Nevertheless, we found a similar incidence rate ratio after restricting to diagnoses of venous thromboembolism followed by purchase of anticoagulation therapy, confirming the validity of our main findings and a non-differential misclassification of the potential 11% false-positive diagnoses.

### Risk of venous and arterial thrombosis in non-surgical patients receiving systemic tranexamic acid: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a1a9e19d]. Thrombosis Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Antifibrinolytic agents such as tranexamic acid (TXA) are commonly used as adjunctive therapies to prevent and treat excessive bleeding. In non-surgical settings, TXA is known to reduce bleeding related mortality. However, impact of TXA use on thrombosis is uncertain.

Methods

We systematically searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases from January 1985 to August 2018. Studies with the following characteristics were included: (i) RCT design; (ii) compared systemic (oral or intravenous) TXA for prevention or treatment of bleeding for non-surgical indications and placebo or no TXA, and (iii) reported thrombotic events or mortality. A Mantel-Haenzel, random-effects model was used to calculate risk ratios, and risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.

Results

Our search identified 22 studies representing 49,538 patients. Those receiving TXA had a significantly lower risk of death from any cause (RR = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.87–0.98; I² = 0%). There was no significant increase in the risk of stroke (RR = 1.10; 95% CI = 0.68–1.78; I² = 31%), myocardial infarction (RR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.43–1.84; I² = 46%), pulmonary embolism (RR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.75–1.26; I² = 0%), or deep vein thrombosis (RR = 0.99; 95% CI = 0.70–1.41; I² = 0%) from use of TXA. The results were similar when restricted to studies at low risk of bias.

Conclusions

In our systematic review and meta-analysis, the use of tranexamic acid reduced all-cause mortality without increased risk of venous or arterial thrombotic complications.

If a woman had uterine surgery (other than a hysterectomy) or any kind of surgery demanding hospitalization for more than one day, she was temporarily censored in eight weeks from day of discharge (Supplementary Appendix Table S1). Furthermore, a woman was also temporarily censored during use of hormonal contraception, other systemic progestogens, or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (Supplementary Appendix Table S1).

A woman was considered a user of hormonal contraception, if she filled a prescription of such. In Denmark, purchase of any hormonal contraceptive demands a prescription and is registered in the National Registry of Medicinal Product Statistics. Time exposed to hormonal contraception was defined from date of filled prescription. For hormonal contraceptives administrated orally, by patch, injection, or vaginal ring, duration of use was determined by amount of defined daily doses purchased. According to previous studies, duration of usage of intrauterine systems and implants was assumed to be one year less of the maximal possible usage to account for possible early discontinuation. All exposure periods were extended by 28 days to account for delays in initiation of use.

Due to the different possible dosages of systemic cyclic progestogen-only therapy, we used the program medicinMacro, available in the R package "github/tagteam/heaven", to calculate the most likely time and duration of treatment. The calculation was based on information on time of purchase and amount purchased, provided by the Registry of Medicinal Product Statistics, as well as information on minimal, maximal, and default dosage, defined according to the recommendations provided in the summary of product characteristics. The program assumed the default dosage at the initiation of treatment. If more than one purchase occurred, the program calculated whether treatment could have been continuous with minimal dosage or maximal dosage based on data of up to five previous purchases. All calculated treatment periods were extended with 28 days to account for possible delays in treatment initiation.

Time exposed to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs was assumed to be one week from a filled prescription of any such drug.

Temporarily censored time periods did not contribute with person-time or thromboembolic events in the analyses, and women experiencing an event, death, emigration, or any exclusion criterion during a temporarily censored time period were permanently censored from that time point.

Time-updated information on age, calendar time, and educational level was also retrieved (Supplementary Appendix Table S1). Information on body-mass index and smoking status was available for parous women only as it was recorded at first visit to a midwife during pregnancy (Supplementary Appendix Table S1).

### Oral tranexamic acid and thrombosis risk in women [^f0dc5d08]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Heavy menstrual bleeding is a high-prevalent condition affecting the quality of life of women worldwide. Studies objectively measuring menstrual blood loss have reported heavy menstrual bleeding in nine to 14% of pre- and perimenopausal women, while studies based on self-assessment methods report higher frequencies, ranging between 20 and 52%. The condition negatively impacts the physical, mental, and social wellbeing of affected women and has been associated with unemployment and absence from work, emphasizing the importance of effective and safe treatment options.

Orally administrated tranexamic acid is a potent haemostatic agent recommended both as acute and as long-term treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding. While the ability of oral tranexamic acid to reduce menstrual blood loss is well-established, the safety of the drug remains a concern. Being an antifibrinolytic agent, tranexamic acid inhibits the lysis of fibrin. Fibrin constitutes the main component of both venous and arterial thromboses, which has led to concerns about tranexamic acid being able to stabilize an initiating thrombosis formation and thereby increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Clinical trials on the treatment effects of oral tranexamic acid on heavy menstrual bleeding, most of them including less of 100 participants, have not been sufficiently powered to study the association with thromboembolism, and observational studies on the topic are sparse, small, and inconclusive.

The influence of tranexamic acid on thromboembolic risk has primarily been investigated in patients suffering from other bleeding conditions than heavy menstrual bleeding with conflicting results in trauma patients, no apparent risk when given for prevention of blood loss following vaginal delivery, and an increased risk in patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding.

Aiming to clarify the safety of tranexamic acid as a treatment option for heavy menstrual bleeding, this pharmacoepidemiologic study follows a nationwide cohort of women aged 15 to 49 years with the objective of assessing the association between use of oral tranexamic acid and the risk of venous thromboembolism and arterial thrombosis.

### Wider use of tranexamic acid to reduce surgical bleeding could benefit patients and health systems [^cae8587a]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Risk of thrombosis is not increased

Bleeding and thrombosis are often seen as the opposite ends of a seesaw, when one risk goes down, the other goes up. Anticoagulants reduce thrombosis but increase the risk of bleeding. Procoagulants such as recombinant activated factor VII reduce bleeding but can cause myocardial infarction. The seesaw is a useful rule of thumb for drugs acting on the coagulation cascade. However, tranexamic acid inhibits fibrinolysis rather than targeting coagulation factors, and the rule of thumb does seem to apply. Fibrinolysis has been described as "a natural mechanism of defence against thrombus formation", but this teleological view might be mistaken. People with a genetic deficiency of the key fibrinolytic enzyme plasminogen do not seem to experience excess thrombotic events.

The primary safety outcome in the Poise-3 trial was a composite of myocardial injury, peripheral arterial thrombosis, ischaemic stroke, and symptomatic proximal venous thromboembolism. This outcome occurred in 14.2% of the patients who received tranexamic acid and 13.9% of those that received placebo (hazard ratio = 1.02; 95% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.14). The Poise-3 trial is the largest trial of tranexamic acid in non-cardiac surgery. The largest trial of tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery was the Atacas (Aspirin and Tranexamic Acid for Coronary Artery Surgery) trial, conducted in 31 hospitals in seven counties. A total of 4661 patients scheduled to have coronary artery surgery and at risk of perioperative complications were randomly allocated to tranexamic acid or placebo. The primary outcome, a composite of death and thrombotic complications within 30 days of surgery, occurred in 16.7% of the tranexamic acid group and in 18.1% of the placebo group (relative risk = 0.92; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.05).

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^87c3a7fd]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) bleeding irregularities — counseling and management include that during contraceptive counseling and before placement of the Cu-IUD, information about common side effects such as spotting or light bleeding or heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding, especially during the first 3–6 months of use, should be discussed; if the patient desires Cu-IUD removal at any time, remove the Cu-IUD, offer counseling on alternative contraceptive methods, and initiate another method if it is desired; and if the patient wants treatment, the following treatment option may be considered during days of bleeding, depending on the patient's preferences, treatment goals, and medical history: NSAIDs for short-term treatment, 5–7 days. Evidence summarized on-page states that a systematic review identified 11 studies, that all but one NSAID study demonstrated statistically significant or notable reductions in mean total menstrual blood loss with NSAID use, and that one study among 19 Cu-IUD users with heavy bleeding suggested oral tranexamic acid can significantly reduce mean blood loss but a FDA warning states that tranexamic acid is contraindicated in women with active thromboembolic disease or with a history or intrinsic risk for thrombosis or thromboembolism; treatment with aspirin showed no statistically significant change in mean blood loss among women whose pretreatment menstrual blood loss was > 80 mL or 60–80 mL and a significant increase when pretreatment menstrual blood loss was < 60 mL; one study of intranasal desmopressin (300 μg/day) for the first 5 days of menses for three treatment cycles found a significant reduction in mean blood loss compared with baseline; and one small study did not observe improvements in spotting with three separate NSAIDs.

### FDA alerts healthcare professionals about the risk of… [^ef840531]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

FDA continues to receive reports of tranexamic acid injection being erroneously administered intrathecally instead of the intended intrathecal anesthetic for neuraxial anesthesia. These medication errors have resulted in severe outcomes, including death, disability, and prolonged hospitalization. FDA is conducting a safety evaluation and is investigating the issue. After the evaluation is complete, FDA will communicate any findings or additional actions that will help mitigate these medication errors. The U. S. Food and Drug Administration is alerting health care professionals about the risk of inadvertent intrathecal administration of tranexamic acid injection. Intrathecal administration of tranexamic acid injection may result in serious life-threatening injuries, including seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, paraplegia, permanent neurological injury, and death.

In most of the cases reported to FDA, tranexamic acid injection was erroneously administered instead of the intended intrathecal anesthetic for neuraxial anesthesia. Tranexamic acid injection is an antifibrinolytic indicated in patients with hemophilia for short-term use to reduce or prevent hemorrhage and reduce the need for replacement therapy during and following tooth extraction. Health care professionals should administer tranexamic acid injection by the intravenous route. It is supplied in single-dose ampules and single-dose vials containing 1, 000 mg tranexamic acid in 10 mL and is available as a generic drug product and under the proprietary name, Cyklokapron. Tranexamic acid injection, bupivacaine injection and other products used in the perioperative setting may have a similar appearance, such as similar vial cap color or packaging that may contribute to the mix-ups.

Other practice-level and facility-level contributing factors such as storing products with similar appearance in close-proximity may also contribute to these errors. The FDA is taking action to address tranexamic acid injection medication errors. This includes revising the tranexamic acid injection container labels and carton labeling to highlight the recommended intravenous route of administration; and strengthening the warnings in the tranexamic acid prescribing information to include the risk of medication errors due to incorrect route of administration.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^cc38d8a5]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Comments and Evidence Summary. During contraceptive counseling and before placement of the Cu-IUD, information about common side effects such as spotting or light bleeding or heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding, especially during the first 3–6 months of use, should be discussed. These bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful but might be bothersome to the patient. Enhanced counseling about expected bleeding patterns and reassurance that bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful has been reported to reduce method discontinuation in clinical trials with other contraceptives (i.e. DMPA).

Evidence is limited on specific drugs, doses, and durations of use for effective treatments for bleeding irregularities with Cu-IUD use. Therefore, this report includes general recommendations for treatments to consider rather than specific regimens.

A systematic review identified 11 studies that examined various therapeutic treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding, prolonged menstrual bleeding, or both among women using Cu-IUDs. Nine studies examined the use of various oral NSAIDs for the treatment of heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding among Cu-IUD users and compared them with either a placebo or a baseline cycle. Three of these trials examined the use of indomethacin, three examined mefenamic acid, and three examined flufenamic acid. Other NSAIDs used in the reported trials included alclofenac, suprofen, and diclofenac sodium. All but one NSAID study demonstrated statistically significant or notable reductions in mean total menstrual blood loss with NSAID use. One study among 19 Cu-IUD users with heavy bleeding suggested that treatment with oral tranexamic acid can significantly reduce mean blood loss during treatment compared with placebo. Data regarding the overall safety of tranexamic acid are limited; an FDA warning states that tranexamic acid is contraindicated in women with active thromboembolic disease or with a history or intrinsic risk for thrombosis or thromboembolism. Treatment with aspirin demonstrated no statistically significant change in mean blood loss among women whose pretreatment menstrual blood loss was > 80 mL or 60–80 mL; treatment resulted in a significant increase among women whose pretreatment menstrual blood loss was < 60 mL. One study examined the use of a synthetic form of vasopressin, intranasal desmopressin (300 µ g/day) for the first 5 days of menses for three treatment cycles and found a significant reduction in mean blood loss compared with baseline (Level of evidence: I to II-3, poor to fair, direct). Only one small study examined treatment of spotting with three separate NSAIDs and did not observe improvements in spotting in any of the groups (Level of evidence: I, poor, direct).

### The never ending success story of tranexamic acid in acquired bleeding [^3b595566]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an anti-fibrinolytic agent that acts by inhibiting plasminogen activation and fibrinolysis. Although its first clinical use dates back more than 50 years, this hemostatic agent is still the object of intense clinical and developmental research. In particular, renewed interest in TXA has arisen following evidence that it has a beneficial effect in reducing blood loss in a variety of medical and surgical conditions at increased risk of bleeding. Given this characteristic, TXA is currently considered a mainstay of Patient Blood Management programs aimed at reducing patients' exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion. Importantly, recent large randomized controlled trials have consistently documented that the use of TXA confers a survival advantage in a number of globally critical clinical conditions associated with acute bleeding, including traumatic injury and post-partum hemorrhage, without increasing the thromboembolic risk.

### Tranexamic acid [^23ea91d0]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Thromboembolic Risk

Tranexamic Acid Injection is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting.

Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with Tranexamic Acid Injection. Avoid concomitant use of Tranexamic Acid Injection and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].

5.2 Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration

Tranexamic Acid Injection is for intravenous use only. Serious adverse reactions including seizures and cardiac arrythmias have occurred when Tranexamic Acid Injection was inadvertently administered intrathecally instead of intravenously.

Confirm the correct route of administration for Tranexamic Acid Injection and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that might be administered at the same time as Tranexamic Acid Injection. Syringes containing Tranexamic Acid Injection should be clearly labeled with the intravenous route of administration.

5.3 Seizures

Tranexamic Acid Injection may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which Tranexamic Acid Injection is not FDA-approved and which uses doses of up to 10-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid into the neuraxial system). Tranexamic Acid Injection is not approved and not recommended for neuraxial administration. Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue Tranexamic Acid Injection if seizures occur.

5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with Tranexamic Acid Injection if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic Acid Injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid.

### Association of intravenous tranexamic acid with thromboembolic events and mortality: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression [^3361dc3e]. JAMA Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an efficient antifibrinolytic agent; however, concerns remain about the potential adverse effects, particularly vascular occlusive events, that may be associated with its use.

Objective

To examine the association between intravenous TXA and total thromboembolic events (TEs) and mortality in patients of all ages and of any medical disciplines.

Data Source

Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and MEDLINE were searched for eligible studies investigating intravenous TXA and postinterventional outcome published between 1976 and 2020.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials comparing intravenous TXA with placebo/no treatment. The electronic database search yielded a total of 782 studies, and 381 were considered for full-text review. Included studies were published in English, German, French, and Spanish. Studies with only oral or topical tranexamic administration were excluded.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Meta-analysis, subgroup and sensitivity analysis, and meta-regression were performed. This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Vascular occlusive events and mortality.

Results

A total of 216 eligible trials including 125 550 patients were analyzed. Total TEs were found in 1020 (2.1%) in the group receiving TXA and 900 (2.0%) in the control group. This study found no association between TXA and risk for total TEs (risk difference = 0.001; 95% CI, -0.001 to 0.002; P = 0.49) for venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, venous TEs, myocardial infarction or ischemia, and cerebral infarction or ischemia. Sensitivity analysis using the risk ratio as an effect measure with (risk ratio = 1.02; 95% CI, 0.94–1.11; P = 0.56) and without (risk ratio = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.95–1.12; P = 0.52) studies with double-zero events revealed robust effect size estimates. Sensitivity analysis with studies judged at low risk for selection bias showed similar results. Administration of TXA was associated with a significant reduction in overall mortality and bleeding mortality but not with nonbleeding mortality. In addition, an increased risk for vascular occlusive events was not found in studies including patients with a history of thromboembolism. Comparison of studies with sample sizes of less than or equal to 99 (risk difference = 0.004; 95% CI, -0.006 to 0.014; P = 0.40), 100 to 999 (risk difference = 0.004; 95% CI, -0.003 to 0.011; P = 0.26), and greater than or equal to 1000 (risk difference = -0.001; 95% CI, -0.003 to 0.001; P = 0.44) showed no association between TXA and incidence of total TEs. Meta-regression of 143 intervention groups showed no association between TXA dosing and risk for venous TEs (risk difference, -0.005; 95% CI, -0.021 to 0.011; P = 0.53).

Conclusions and Relevance

Findings from this systematic review and meta-analysis of 216 studies suggested that intravenous TXA, irrespective of dosing, is not associated with increased risk of any TE. These results help clarify the incidence of adverse events associated with administration of intravenous TXA and suggest that TXA is safe for use with undetermined utility for patients receiving neurological care.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of hip fractures in older adults [^c9ca4877]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

AAOS Clinical Practice Guideline — tranexamic acid for hip fracture patients — states that tranexamic acid should be administered to reduce blood loss and blood transfusion in patients with hip fractures, with Quality of Evidence: High and Strength of Recommendation: Strong. In implementation, use of tranexamic acid in hip fracture patients may result in lower blood loss and transfusion rates compared to placebo, and studies were unable to detect any difference in adverse events with use of tranexamic acid such as infection, wound complication, DVT, CVA, PE or MI; caution may be exercised in patients with strong thrombotic risk factors as many of the studies excluded patients with previous thrombotic events. Patients with hip fractures may benefit from TXA to reduce blood loss and subsequent transfusion. Cost considerations note that additional use of tranexamic acid in orthopaedic surgery has been demonstrated to be very cost effective, and this intervention of TXA may offer potential cost savings for institutions as a health care system as a whole. Future research should determine which factors may place patients at higher risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) or cerebrovascular accident (CVA), what is the optimal dose for tranexamic acid, and which mode of administration is best.

Table 3
Effect of tranexamic acid on all-cause death

Table 4
Effect of tranexamic acid on the need for surgical, endoscopic, and radiological interventions or blood product transfusion

The risk of fatal or non-fatal thromboembolic events and arterial thromboembolic events (myocardial infarction or stroke) was similar in the tranexamic acid group and the placebo group (table 5). The risk of venous thromboembolic events (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolus) was higher in the tranexamic group than in the placebo group (table 5) and similar risk was observed after excluding patients who did not receive the maintenance dose (42 events with tranexamic acid vs 20 with placebo); RR 2·11, 95% CI 1·24–3·59). In an exploratory subgroup analysis, the risk of venous thromboembolic events was higher in patients with suspected variceal bleeding or liver disease (14 vs two events; 7·26, 1·65–31·90) than in patients with other causes of bleeding (34 vs 24 events; 1·38, 0·82–2·32; p = 0·035 for heterogeneity). The risk of renal, hepatic, and respiratory failure, cardiac events, sepsis, and pneumonia was similar in tranexamic acid and placebo treated patients (table 5). Seizures occurred in 38 patients on tranexamic acid and 22 on placebo (0·6% vs 0·4%; 1·73, 1·03–2·93; table 5), and after excluding patients who did not receive the maintenance dose the corresponding numbers were 33 versus 17 events (1·95, 1·09–3·50).

Complications and self-care capacity in study groups

The mean number of days spent in intensive care was similar in both groups (table 5). The mean score on the Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living was also similar in both groups (table 5).

### Naproxen (Ec-naproxen) [^c74e298c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as naproxen, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Topical application of tranexamic acid for the reduction of bleeding [^8d4b65c0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Intravenous tranexamic acid reduces bleeding in surgery, however, its effect on the risk of thromboembolic events is uncertain and an increased risk remains a theoretical concern. Because there is less systemic absorption following topical administration, the direct application of tranexamic acid to the bleeding surface has the potential to reduce bleeding with minimal systemic effects.

Objectives

To assess the effects of the topical administration of tranexamic acid in the control of bleeding.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library; Ovid MEDLINE®, Ovid MEDLINE® In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE® Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE®; Embase Classic + Embase (OvidSP); PubMed and ISI Web of Science (including Science Citation Index Expanded and Social Science Citation Index (SCI-EXPANDED & CPCI-S)). We also searched online trials registers to identify ongoing or unpublished trials. The search was run on the 31st May 2013.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing topical tranexamic acid with no topical tranexamic acid or placebo in bleeding patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors examined the titles and abstracts of citations from the electronic databases for eligibility. Two authors extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias for each trial. Outcome measures of interest were blood loss, mortality, thromboembolic events (myocardial infarction, stroke, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) and receipt of a blood transfusion.

Main Results

We included 29 trials involving 2612 participants. Twenty-eight trials involved patients undergoing surgery and one trial involved patients with epistaxis (nosebleed). Tranexamic acid (TXA) reduced blood loss by 29% (pooled ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 0.72; P < 0.0001). There was uncertainty regarding the effect on death (risk ratio (RR) 0.28, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.34; P = 0.11), myocardial infarction (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.08; P = 0.33), stroke (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.96; P = 0.49), deep vein thrombosis (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.57; P = 0.38) and pulmonary embolism (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.09 to 3.15; P = 0.48). TXA reduced the risk of receiving a blood transfusion by a relative 45% (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.46; P < 0.0001). There was substantial statistical heterogeneity between trials for the blood loss and blood transfusion outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

There is reliable evidence that topical application of tranexamic acid reduces bleeding and blood transfusion in surgical patients, however the effect on the risk of thromboembolic events is uncertain. The effects of topical tranexamic acid in patients with bleeding from non-surgical causes has yet to be reliably assessed. Further high-quality trials are warranted to resolve these uncertainties before topical tranexamic acid can be recommended for routine use.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) in primary TJA for patients with a history of venous thromboembolism (VTE), myocardial infarction (MI), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), transient ischemic attack (TIA), and/or vascular stent placement — There is a paucity of randomized, clinical trials, but the existing high-quality literature does not suggest increased risk of adverse thromboembolic events during the perioperative episode of a primary TJA. Strength of Recommendation: Moderate. Supporting rationale notes that in a meta-regression analysis comparing populations with greater than 50% American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status ≥ 3 versus greater than 50% ASA status 1 or 2, there was no increase in the risk of VTE, large database studies suggest TXA administration in patients with a history of VTE or ASA status ≥ 3 does not experience an increased risk of VTE, and the number needed to harm for VTE was 983 patients while the number needed to treat with IV TXA and topical TXA to prevent a transfusion was only 4 and 3 patients, respectively.

### Practice bulletin no. 183: postpartum hemorrhage [^f6d95d19]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Tranexamic acid — efficacy, timing, safety, and use in postpartum hemorrhage are detailed. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic that can be given intravenously or orally, and the WOMAN trial compared 1 g of intravenous tranexamic acid to placebo. Although the composite endpoint was not reduced, death from obstetric hemorrhage was lower with tranexamic acid (1.5% versus 1.9%, P = 0.045), and when given within 3 hours of birth mortality from obstetric hemorrhage was 1.2% versus 1.7% (P = 0.008). The risk of thrombosis appears not different from controls in surgeries and was not higher in WOMAN trial recipients. At this time, data are insufficient to recommend prophylactic use outside research, but tranexamic acid should be considered for obstetric hemorrhage when initial medical therapy fails; earlier use is likely superior, with benefit primarily in women treated sooner than 3 hours. For clinicians unfamiliar with tranexamic acid, consultation with a local or regional expert and incorporation into management guidelines is advised.

### Wider use of tranexamic acid to reduce surgical bleeding could benefit patients and health systems [^9fbab420]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Are there other potential harms in surgical patients?

High doses of tranexamic acid can cause seizures, but a 1 g preoperative dose is not associated with an increased risk. Inadvertent intrathecal administration of tranexamic acid has serious adverse effects and must be avoided. A history of thromboembolic events is not an absolute contraindication to using tranexamic acid. The drug is excreted by the kidneys, but there is no risk of accumulation with a single preoperative dose. Body weight based dosing can be used in children.

Tranexamic acid may be detrimental in conditions associated with microvascular thrombosis. The Crash-2 trial (Clinical Randomization of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Hemorrhage) examined use of tranexamic acid in bleeding trauma patients within eight hours after injury. It enrolled 20 211 patients from 274 hospitals in 40 countries. Early treatment (within three hours of injury) with tranexamic acid significantly reduced deaths from bleeding and all-cause mortality, but late administration was ineffective and there were more deaths from bleeding, although no increase in all-cause mortality.

Patients in the late phase of trauma can develop prothrombotic intravascular coagulation, driven by damage associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs), and tranexamic acid is contraindicated in this period. Disseminated intravascular coagulation is characterised by microvascular fibrin formation with consumption of coagulation proteins leading to their exhaustion and consequent bleeding. For this reason, the balance of benefits and harms of tranexamic acid in patients at risk of microvascular thrombosis, such as patients with multiple trauma having orthopaedic surgery more than three hours after injury, remains uncertain.

Because there is strong evidence that tranexamic acid reduces bleeding and transfusion and no indication of any increased risk of thrombosis, the benefits exceed the harms in patients having major surgery. Even in patients who do not require transfusion, reducing bleeding will reduce postoperative anaemia and facilitate more rapid recovery. Postoperative anaemia is associated with an increased risk of infection, longer hospital stays, heart failure, and death. Research is needed to evaluate the effects of tranexamic acid on patient centred outcomes such as postoperative pain and mobility, patient satisfaction, and time to discharge and resumption of normal activities.

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) antifibrinolytics — use of tranexamic acid: We recommend against the administration of antifibrinolytic agents such as tranexamic acid in LGIB. (Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 96 patients with LGIB, there was no significant difference between tranexamic acid and placebo in hemoglobin reduction, transfusion rates and volumes, intervention rates, or length of stay, and in a large international randomized placebo-controlled trial that included over 12,000 patients with stable gastrointestinal bleeding, tranexamic acid was not associated with a reduction in death from bleeding, all-cause bleeding, or mortality and had higher venous thromboembolic events and seizures than placebo; overall, tranexamic acid does not have a benefit in LGIB and may be associated with an increased risk of harm.

### Effect of tranexamic acid by baseline risk of death in acute bleeding patients: a meta-analysis of individual patient-level data from 28 333 patients [^3724a5c7]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Tranexamic acid appears to be safe and effective regardless of the baseline risk for patients treated within 3 h since injury. Because many deaths are in patients at low and intermediate risk, tranexamic acid use should not be restricted to the most severely injured or bleeding patients. As tranexamic acid is safe, it should be considered as an early preventive measure rather than a treatment for severe coagulopathic bleeding.

### Serum concentrations and pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid after two means of topical administration in massive weight loss skin-reducing surgery [^cb75d4d7]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

The antifibrinolytic drug tranexamic acid is routinely used for blood conservation in surgery with high risk of significant bleeding. Tranexamic acid prevents clot breakdown by inhibiting the activation of plasminogen to plasmin, and intravenous use reduces bleeding and transfusion needs by approximately one-third. Fear of unrecognized adverse effects has so far limited routine use of intravenous tranexamic acid to high-risk surgery.

A drug that prevents bleeding may also promote thrombosis. However, no increased risk of vascular occlusive events has been shown after intravenous use – and this worry may be unwarranted. In contrast, increasing attention is given to reports of a tranexamic acid–associated dose-dependent increased risk of nonischemic convulsive seizures, particularly in cardiac surgery. –

In vitro studies suggest that the minimum plasma concentration that significantly inhibits fibrinolysis is approximately 5 µg/ml in children and 10 µg/ml in adults. – In clinical practice, doses vary greatly, and some regimens advocate doses causing plasma levels above 150 µg/ml. – Tranexamic acid passes the blood-brain barrier and results in cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of approximately 10% of the plasma concentrations. Tranexamic acid may cause central nervous system hyperexcitability by blocking the action of the inhibitory neurotransmitters gamma-aminobutyric acid and glycine, – and a cerebrospinal fluid concentration of 15 µg/ml has been postulated as a threshold value for a potentially excitatory effect. –

Pharmacological interventions that may prevent or reverse coagulopathy

Tranexamic acid

The evidence for the efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid appears to be greater than that of many other patient blood management interventions. Large, pragmatic randomised controlled trials have shown a reduction in mortality in major trauma, postpartum haemorrhage and mild‐to‐moderate traumatic brain injury, along with reducing transfusion requirements after cardiac surgery and caesarean delivery. More recently, Devereaux et al. showed that administration of tranexamic acid results in fewer bleeding episodes (life‐threatening, major or in a critical organ) when compared with placebo in a trial of 9535 patients undergoing major, non‐cardiac surgery.

In patients who have suffered major trauma, tranexamic acid should be given as early as possible and ideally within the first 3 h, as the survival benefit decreases by 10% for every 15‐min delay after this time‐point. Similar benefits of giving tranexamic acid within 3 h have also been observed in postpartum haemorrhage. The safety of tranexamic acid is supported by a meta‐analysis of 216 trials (125,550 participants) which found no evidence of an increased risk of thromboembolic events, myocardial infarction and cerebral ischaemia. One patient group where tranexamic acid may not be beneficial is in those with gastrointestinal bleeding, where the results of a large, pragmatic trial showed no reduction in mortality and increased risk of venous thrombosis. Possible reasons for these findings include the high dose of tranexamic acid that was administered (4 g over 24 h) and the delayed presentation to hospital of many of these patients, missing the early period of excessive fibrinolysis.

Current areas of tranexamic acid research include dose, route (e.g. intramuscular which may allow for quicker pre‐hospital administration) and timing of tranexamic acid administration across a range of clinical settings. A pharmacokinetic study found that in high‐risk patients undergoing caesarean delivery, plasma tranexamic acid levels correlated inversely with BMI, which raises the question as to whether higher doses may be required in patients with increased BMI.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of tranexamic acid PO (also known as Lysteda, Cyklokapron):
- **Arterial thromboembolism, VTE**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as tranexamic acid is associated with an increased risk of arterial and VTE, including DVT, PE, and retinal vascular occlusions.
- **Cerebral edema, AIS**: use extreme caution in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
- **Exacerbation of dizziness**: use caution when taken concomitantly with other medications that may cause dizziness, as this could exacerbate the effect. Advise patients to refrain from driving or operating machinery until they understand how the drug impacts them.
- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as tranexamic acid may increase the risk of hypersensitivity reactions, ranging from mild pruritus to severe conditions such as angioedema, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylactic shock.
- **Ligneous conjunctivitis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as tranexamic acid has been associated with a risk of ligneous conjunctivitis.
- **Myoclonus, seizures**: use extreme caution in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery, females, individuals over 70 years old, those in poor health, patients with renal impairment, or those with prior neurological or cardiovascular disorders, including a history of stroke.
- **Visual impairment, vision loss, conjunctivitis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as tranexamic acid is associated with visual disturbances and retinal vascular occlusions. Patients expected to be treated for over 3 months should undergo regular visual acuity and optical coherence assessments. If visual disturbances or ocular symptoms occur, refer the patient to an ophthalmologist for a comprehensive evaluation, including a dilated retinal examination.

### Association of intravenous tranexamic acid with thromboembolic events and mortality… [^bea22d4d]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

These results clarify whether vascular occlusive events are associated with administration of tranexamic acid. Importance Tranexamic acid is an efficient antifibrinolytic agent; however, concerns remain about the potential adverse effects, particularly vascular occlusive events, that may be associated with its use. Objective. Meta-regression of 143 intervention groups showed no association between TXA dosing and risk for venous TEs. Conclusions and Relevance Findings from this systematic review and meta-analysis of 216 studies suggested that intravenous TXA, irrespective of dosing, is not associated with increased risk of any TE. These results help clarify the incidence of adverse events associated with administration of intravenous TXA and suggest that TXA is safe for use with undetermined utility for patients receiving neurological care.

Ker and colleagues3 performed a meta-analysis including 129 trials encompassing more than 10 000 patients suggesting that administration of TXA is associated with reductions in allogeneic blood transfusion by 38% and that further trials assessing this effect are unlikely to add new insights. However, TXA is only applied with caution because antifibrinolytic therapy may be associated with an increased risk of seizures, 4, 5 myocardial infarction, 6 and other thrombotic complications. 7–9 Nevertheless, the association of vascular occlusive events with TXA administration is controversial. However, trials with 0 events were excluded from analysis. Overall, TXA was not associated with an increased risk of PE in 10 trials and DVT in 19 trials.

We also investigated whether intravenous TXA was associated with increased risk for TE, VT, PE, VTEs, and overall mortality in patients with risks for TEs. Therefore, secondary analyses were performed only with studies including patients with a history of any TE, coronary artery disease, thrombophilia, or contraindication for TXA.

5.1 Thromboembolic Risk

Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting.

Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with tranexamic acid. Avoid concomitant use of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].

5.2 Seizures

Tranexamic acid may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is not FDA approved and which uses doses of up to ten-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid into the neuraxial system). Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is not approved and not recommended for neuraxial administration. Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection if seizures occur.

5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^8777f2c4]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Cu-IUD — bleeding irregularities management and evidence: During contraceptive counseling and before placement of the Cu-IUD, common side effects including spotting or light bleeding or heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding, especially during the first 3–6 months of use, should be discussed. If the patient wants treatment during days of bleeding, NSAIDs for short-term treatment, 5–7 days, may be considered. Evidence includes a systematic review that identified 11 studies among Cu-IUD users, with Nine studies examining oral NSAIDs; however, only one NSAID study demonstrated statistically significant or notable reductions in mean total menstrual blood loss. One study among 19 Cu-IUD users with heavy bleeding suggested that oral tranexamic acid can significantly reduce mean blood loss during treatment compared with placebo, but an FDA warning states that tranexamic acid is contraindicated in women with active thromboembolic disease or with a history or intrinsic risk for thrombosis or thromboembolism. Treatment with aspirin demonstrated no statistically significant change in mean blood loss for pretreatment menstrual blood loss ≥ 80 mL or 60–80 mL and resulted in a significant increase when pretreatment menstrual blood loss was < 60 mL. A trial of intranasal desmopressin (300 μg/day) for the first 5 days of menses for three treatment cycles found a significant reduction in mean blood loss compared with baseline, while one small study of three separate NSAIDs did not observe improvements in spotting in any group.

### Special considerations for women of reproductive age on anticoagulation [^caf12293]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The use of combined estrogen-progestin medications by patients at increased risk of thrombosis is controversial. Estrogen has been shown to have a dose-dependent thrombotic risk, with the highest thrombotic risk in patients treated with 50μg ethinylestradiol-levonorgestrel and the lowest in 20–30μg ethinylestradiol-levonorgestrel. A Cochrane meta-analysis on venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk associated with different combined oral contraceptives among women who were not anticoagulated found that when compared to levonorgestrel, other progestins' pooled relative risk (95% confidence interval, CI) of VTE was 1.33 (1.08–1.63) for gestodene, 1.93 (1.31–2.83) for desogestrel, and 1.67 (1.10–2.55) for drospirenone. A prior systematic review also found that levonorgestrel was associated with lower thrombotic risk compared to other progestins: relative risk of VTE (95% CI) of ethinylestradiol with progestins in patients taking combined oral contraceptives versus non-users was 2.9 (2.2–3.8) for levonorgestrel, 6.6 (5.6–7.8) for desogestrel, and 6.4 (5.4–7.5) for drospirenone.

Tranexamic acid is another option for managing heavy menses, which has been available without a prescription in Scandinavia for decades. For women at risk of recurrent thrombosis, however, the safety of this medication remains controversial. One large historical prospective cohort study showed an increased incidence of VTE in women of reproductive age treated with tranexamic acid (without anticoagulation) compared to those not treated, though this small increase in VTE risk is not clinically significant for use during menstruation alone (number needed to harm per 5 days of treatment was 78,549 persons). A meta-analysis of a more general, non-surgical patient population treated with tranexamic acid for indications including but not limited to menstrual bleeding demonstrated reduction in all-cause mortality without increased venous or arterial thrombotic complications. While further studies that control for indication for anticoagulation are needed, many clinicians cautiously recommend tranexamic acid to control troublesome menstrual bleeding in women treated with anticoagulation.

### Naproxen oral (naproxen oral suspension) [^205b71c1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as naproxen, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Effects of a high-dose 24-h infusion of tranexamic acid on death and thromboembolic events in patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding (HALT-IT): an international randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^b0b24282]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Administration of tranexamic acid within 3 h of bleeding onset reduces death due to bleeding in trauma and post-partum haemorrhage without increasing the risk of thromboembolic events. In these bleeding scenarios, the timing of onset is easy to determine, most patients present early, and there are well documented changes in fibrinolysis that provide a biological rationale for tranexamic acid treatment. However, in gastrointestinal bleeding it is difficult to determine the time of bleeding onset, presentation is often delayed (over 80% of patients presented more than 3 h after bleeding onset), and the contribution of increased fibrinolysis to bleeding is less clear.

Almost half of the patients included in our trial had suspected variceal bleeding due to liver disease and because these patients had a greater risk of death, they accounted for nearly three-quarters of deaths. Recent research shows that acutely ill patients with cirrhosis have a mixed fibrinolytic phenotype. Some have increased fibrinolysis, but others have profound hypofibrinolysis. The prevalence of hypofibrinolysis appears to be greatest in the most critically ill patients. Using the same clot lysis assay, reduced fibrinolysis has been shown to be associated with a small increased risk of venous thrombosis. In our trial, the increased risk of venous thromboembolic events with tranexamic acid appeared to be more marked in patients with liver disease, although this was an exploratory subgroup analysis and there was no strong evidence for heterogeneity. Nevertheless, reduced fibrinolysis in patients with liver disease might explain the absence of reduction in bleeding deaths with tranexamic acid and the increased risk of venous thromboembolic events.

### Effect of tranexamic acid on thrombotic events and seizures in bleeding patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^61860042]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces surgical bleeding and reduces death from bleeding after trauma and childbirth. However, its effects on thrombotic events and seizures are less clear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the safety of TXA in bleeding patients.

Methods

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials from inception until June 1, 2020. We included randomized trials comparing intravenous tranexamic acid and placebo or no intervention in bleeding patients. The primary outcomes were thrombotic events, venous thromboembolism, acute coronary syndrome, stroke and seizures. A meta-analysis was performed using a random effects model and meta-regression analysis was performed to evaluate how effects vary by dose. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluations (GRADE) approach.

Results

A total of 234 studies with 102,681 patients were included in the meta-analysis. In bleeding patients, there was no evidence that TXA increased the risk of thrombotic events (RR = 1.00 [95% CI 0.93–1.08]), seizures (1.18 [0.91–1.53]), venous thromboembolism (1.04 [0.92–1.17]), acute coronary syndrome (0.88 [0.78–1.00]) or stroke (1.12 [0.98–1.27]). In a dose-by-dose sensitivity analysis, seizures were increased in patients receiving more than 2 g/day of TXA (3.05 [1.01–9.20]). Meta-regression showed an increased risk of seizures with increased dose of TXA (p = 0.011).

Conclusion

Tranexamic acid did not appear to increase the risk of thrombotic events in bleeding patients. However, because there may be dose-dependent increase in the risk of seizures, very high doses should be avoided.

### Tranexamic acid for postpartum bleeding: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^664f9b6f]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Our results suggest that tranexamic acid reduces the risk of life-threatening bleeding after childbirth. There was no evidence that the odds ratio varies with underlying risk of life-threatening bleeding, the presence or absence of moderate or severe anaemia, the type of birth, or whether or not a diagnosis of postpartum haemorrhage has been made. Because thromboembolic events were rare in the included trials the effect estimate is imprecise, and we cannot exclude a modest increase in thrombosis with tranexamic acid.

To reduce bias, we excluded trials with fewer than 500 participants. A previous systematic review of the available trials showed that including the smaller clinical trials in this area might not improve the validity of the results. Furthermore, small trials may be underpowered to assess effects on life-threatening bleeding, and there is a greater risk of selective reporting and small study effects when such trials are included. All of the included trials were at low risk of bias; they were prospectively registered, had well concealed allocation, were double-blind, and had minimal missing data. These trials should provide the most reliable estimates of the effects of tranexamic acid. We obtained individual patient-level data from four of the five trials that met our inclusion criteria, with data on 43 409 women. We used aggregate data from one trial with data available for 10 995 women. Our sensitivity analyses showed that the results were similar with and without the inclusion of the aggregate data.

5.1 Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration

CYKLOKAPRON is for intravenous use only. Serious, including fatal, adverse reactions including seizures and cardiac arrythmias have occurred when CYKLOKAPRON was inadvertently administered via the neuraxial route.

Confirm the correct route of administration for CYKLOKAPRON and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that might be administered at the same time as CYKLOKAPRON. Clearly label syringes containing CYKLOKAPRON with the intravenous route of administration.

5.2 Thromboembolic Risk

CYKLOKAPRON is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting.

Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with CYKLOKAPRON. Avoid concomitant use of CYKLOKAPRON and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].

5.3 Seizures

CYKLOKAPRON may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which CYKLOKAPRON is not FDA‑approved and which uses doses of up to 10‑fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid via the neuraxial route). CYKLOKAPRON is contraindicated for neuraxial administration (i.e., epidural, intrathecal). Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue CYKLOKAPRON if seizures occur.

5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with CYKLOKAPRON if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. CYKLOKAPRON is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid.

### Mechanism of action of tranexamic acid in bleeding trauma patients: an exploratory analysis of data from the CRASH-2 trial [^096f622f]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

The effect of TXA on mortality is greatest on the day of the injury, when TXA reduces the risk of death from all causes by about 20%. This survival benefit is only evident in patients in whom treatment is initiated within 3 h of injury. Thereafter, early TXA treatment has a smaller effect on all-cause mortality, although a reduction in the hazard of death due to bleeding is evident for several days. Our results suggest that there is a short time interval during which TXA administration can prevent exsanguination and that urgent treatment is therefore essential.

Whilst the benefit of early TXA treatment is greatest on the day of injury, the adverse effect of late administration manifests as an increased risk of death due to bleeding over subsequent days. We have previously postulated that late initiation of TXA treatment may increase the risk of thrombotic disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). By inhibiting fibrinolysis, TXA might increase the risk of DIC. Although the underlying pathology in DIC is thrombosis, due to the consumption of coagulation factors DIC often manifests as bleeding. Among patients in whom treatment is initiated beyond 3 h of the injury, deaths apparently due to bleeding may have been due to thrombotic DIC.

### Tranexamic acid for postpartum bleeding: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^6d5e7cd6]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

The inadvertent intrathecal injection of tranexamic acid can cause serious harms. There were no such cases in any of the included trials. However, with the increasing use of tranexamic acid to reduce life-threatening bleeding, measures should be taken to avoid this error.

Our results differ from those of previous reviews of aggregate data from trials of tranexamic acid for preventing postpartum bleeding. – Systematic reviews that included smaller trials (≤ 500 participants) found a reduction in postpartum haemorrhage and blood transfusion, although the studies were not powered to make reliable inferences about the effect of tranexamic acid on life-threatening bleeding. Our decision to limit our review to large, prospectively registered, high-quality trials, including the most recent trial evidence, might account for this difference.

In conclusion, tranexamic acid reduces life-threatening bleeding, defined as death or surgical intervention for bleeding within 24 h. There is no evidence that tranexamic acid reduces other non-fatal bleeding endpoints, although fewer women in the tranexamic acid group received additional uterotonic use than did women in the placebo group, and women given tranexamic acid had higher postpartum haemoglobin concentrations than women in the placebo group. No apparent increase in thromboembolic events was observed with tranexamic acid, but because thrombosis is a rare outcome and was possibly under-reported in some of the trials, we cannot exclude a modest increase. Although administration of tranexamic acid before a diagnosis of postpartum haemorrhage should be considered in women at high risk of death from bleeding, the evidence does not support extending the use of tranexamic acid to all women to prevent postpartum bleeding. For women at higher risk of life-threatening bleeding (eg, ≥ 1 per 100 women giving birth) the number needed to treat to prevent one woman from developing a life-threatening bleed is fewer than 500. However, for women at lower risk (eg, ≤ 1 per 100 000 women giving birth), hundreds of thousands of women would need to be treated to prevent one woman from developing a life-threatening bleed. In women at low risk of life-threatening bleeding, even a small number of adverse events from inadvertent intrathecal injection of tranexamic acid could outweigh any treatment benefit. Caution must be taken with regard to offering tranexamic acid to women at low risk of life-threatening bleeding since the balance of benefit and potential harm is more uncertain in these women. Further research including cost-effectiveness modelling is needed to inform treatment decisions.

### Tranexamic acid for postpartum bleeding: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^9e0cd36b]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Tranexamic acid is a recommended treatment for women with a clinical diagnosis of postpartum haemorrhage, but whether it can prevent bleeding is unclear. We conducted a systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials to assess the effects of tranexamic acid in women giving birth.

Methods

In this systematic review and IPD meta-analysis, we searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from database inception to Aug 4, 2024 for randomised trials that assessed the effects of tranexamic acid in women giving birth. Trials were eligible if they were prospectively registered, placebo-controlled, included more than 500 women, and had a low risk of bias for random sequence generation and allocation concealment. IPD were requested from the trial investigators. The primary outcomes were the numbers of women with life-threatening bleeding and thromboembolic events. We used a one-stage model to analyse the data and explored whether the effect of tranexamic acid varied by the underlying risk of life-threatening bleeding, type of birth, presence of moderate or severe anaemia, or timing of administration (before or after a diagnosis of postpartum haemorrhage). This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42022345775.

Findings

We analysed data on 54404 women from five trials. We obtained IPD for 43409 women from four trials and aggregate data on 10995 women from one trial. All trials had a low risk of bias. Life-threatening bleeding occurred in 178 (0·65%) of 27300 women in the tranexamic acid group versus 230 (0·85%) of 27093 women in the placebo group (pooled odds ratio [OR] 0·77 [95% CI 0·63–0·93]; p = 0·008). There was no evidence that the effect of tranexamic acid varied by the underlying risk of life-threatening bleeding, type of birth, presence of moderate or severe anaemia or timing of administration. No significant difference was identified between tranexamic acid and placebo groups with regard to thromboembolic events: 50 (0·2%) of 26571 women in the tranexamic acid group had fatal or non-fatal thromboembolic events versus 52 (0·2%) of 26373 women in the placebo group (pooled OR 0·96 [0·65–1·41]; p = 0·82) with no significant heterogeneity identified in the subgroup analyses.

Interpretation

Tranexamic acid reduces the risk of life-threatening postpartum bleeding. We found no evidence that tranexamic acid increases the risk of thrombosis. Although we do not recommend the use of tranexamic acid in all women giving birth, consideration should be given to its use before a diagnosis of postpartum haemorrhage in women at high risk of death.

### Screening and management of bleeding disorders in adolescents with heavy menstrual bleeding: ACOG COMMITTEE OPINION, number 785 [^11bad3c9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Tranexamic acid with or without combined oral contraceptives in adolescents with heavy menstrual bleeding — mechanism and thrombotic risk: Tranexamic acid inhibits fibrinolysis, and although there is a theoretical risk of thrombosis, the concomitant administration of tranexamic acid and OCs has been used when monotherapy has failed; review of the existing literature has not identified an increased risk of venous thromboembolism in this setting, although studies are very limited. It is an important treatment option to control bleeding in this population and a reasonable approach to management when other options have failed.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) in primary total joint arthroplasty (TJA) — arterial thromboembolic events (ATE) risk: For patients undergoing primary TJA, there is a paucity of randomized clinical trials on the risk of ATE due to the administration of TXA intravenously, topically and orally, but the existing evidence does not suggest that TXA increases the risk of developing an ATE compared with placebo during the perioperative episode of a primary TJA; strength of recommendation: Moderate.

### Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction due to in-stent thrombosis after administering tranexamic acid in a high cardiac risk patient [^cfb7c378]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an antifibrinolytic which minimises bleeding and transfusions, with thrombotic risk. Our patient had known coronary artery disease with post-TXA acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) due to in-stent thrombosis. He had five drug-eluting stents (DES): two overlapping DES in mid-LAD (3 years ago), and two overlapping DES in distal right coronary artery and one DES in obtuse-marginal (1.5 years ago). After TXA, both overlapping stent locations thrombosed. Of nine reports of post-TXA acute MI, only one had complex stent anatomy (bifurcation stent to left circumflex/first obtuse-marginal) with other single stents, and only the complex stent thrombosed. Post-TXA MI was more often STEMI caused by arterial thrombosis, rather than non-STEMI caused by blood loss, hypotension or demand ischaemia. Overlapping and bifurcation stents thrombosed; single stents remained patent. In conclusion, overlapping stents, bifurcation stents, excessive stent length and previous in-stent restenosis/thrombosis may increase thrombotic risk. TXA should be administered cautiously with complex stent anatomy.

### Naproxen [^f189a63f]. FDA. Low credibility.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of naproxen sodium PO (also known as Anaprox, Aleve):
- **Cardiovascular thrombotic events**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as naproxen increases cardiovascular thrombotic event risk (myocardial infarction, stroke), especially in patients with CVD or risk factors. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible and closely monitor patients with CVD or risk factors. Inform patients of symptoms indicating serious cardiovascular events (e.g., chest pain, shortness of breath) and advise them to seek immediate medical attention if they occur.
- **Gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulcer disease, gastric perforation**: use extreme caution in patients with peptic ulcer disease/GI bleeding history, or those with risk factors including prolonged treatment, high-risk medications (e.g., aspirin, anticoagulants, SSRIs), smoking, alcohol, advanced age, poor health, liver disease, or coagulopathy, as fatal GI events are more common in elderly or debilitated patients. To minimize GI risks, use NSAIDs at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, avoid concurrent NSAID use, monitor closely for GI bleeding, and discontinue therapy if serious adverse events occur, especially in high-risk patients or those taking low-dose aspirin.

### Alternative routes to intravenous tranexamic acid for postpartum hemorrhage: a systematic search and narrative review [^20bd9b57]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Prophylactic administration of TXA in surgical procedures reduces the probability of receiving a blood transfusion by one‐third (RR 0.62; 95% CI, 0.58–0.65) and reduces blood loss by a similar amount (pooled ratio 0.66; 95% CI 0.65–0.67).

When used to treat acute traumatic hemorrhage, the CRASH‐2 trial showed a one‐third reduction in bleeding mortality when TXA was given within 3 h of injury. Also, the CRASH‐3 trial showed a significant reduction in head injury‐related deaths when TXA was administered within 3 h of injury to patients with mild‐to‐moderate traumatic brain injury. When used to treat heavy menstrual bleeding, evidence suggests there is a 40%–50% reduction in the amount of menstrual blood lost per menstrual cycle for participants taking TXA.

Although concerns are sometimes expressed about the risk of thrombotic adverse events associated with TXA use, a recent systematic review and meta‐analysis of 216 randomized trials including 125 550 patients found no increased risk of any thromboembolic events in patients who received TXA compared with placebo.

### Effect of tranexamic acid on thrombotic events and seizures in bleeding patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9fa4d757]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Sensitivity and subgroup analysis with thrombotic events

In sensitivity and subgroup analysis, we did not find any increase in thrombotic events in trauma (0.89 [0.69–1.17]), obstetrics and gynecology (0.81 [0.53–1.26]), cardiac surgery (0.92 [0.81–1.05]), orthopedic surgery (0.98 [0.80–1.21]) (Fig. 3 A; Additional file 2: Figure S5). However, the risk of thrombotic events appeared higher in the TXA group than in the control group in spontaneous (non-traumatic) intracranial hemorrhage (1.33 [1.09–1.63]) (Fig. 3 A). In a dose-by-dose sensitivity analysis, thrombotic events were not increased in patients receiving 2 g/day of TXA or less (≤ 2 g/day: 0.94 [0.84–1.05]) (Fig. 3 A; Additional file 2: Figure S6). There was uncertainty on thrombotic events in patients receiving more than 2 g/day of TXA (> 2 g/day: 1.18 [0.98–1.43]). Meta-regression analysis showed there was no statistically significant association between higher dose of TXA and increased risk of thrombotic events (p = 0.122) (Fig. 4 A). The results were similar to primary analysis, when the analyses were restricted to trials with low risk of bias (0.98 [0.90–1.06]) and sample size over 500 (0.96 [0.85–1.07]) (Fig. 3 A). Of trials conducted in children, one patient had a thrombotic event in the TXA group, compared to none in the placebo group (Additional file 2: Figure S7).

### Effects of a high-dose 24-h infusion of tranexamic acid on death and thromboembolic events in patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding (HALT-IT): an international randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^cd39d2c6]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

The dose of tranexamic acid used in this trial was higher and the duration of treatment was longer (4 g over 24 h) than in randomised trials of tranexamic acid in trauma (2 g over 8 h) or post-partum haemorrhage (1 g bolus with a repeat 1 g dose if bleeding continued), which did not record any increase in adverse events with tranexamic acid. Patients with gastrointestinal bleeding often rebleed after initial haemostasis, particularly within the first 24 h. Because tranexamic acid has a short half-life, we used a longer treatment duration to cover this high-risk period. Furthermore, previous trials in gastrointestinal bleeding that appeared to show a large mortality reduction with tranexamic acid used a high dose and a longer duration of treatment than trials in trauma and post-partum haemorrhage. The longer duration of tranexamic acid treatment in this trial might explain the increased risk of venous thromboembolic events and the higher dose could possibly explain the increased risk of seizures.

In summary, we found no evidence that tranexamic acid decreases the risk of death in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding. Our results caution against a uniform approach to the management of patients with major haemorrhage and highlight the need for randomised trials targeted at specific pathophysiological processes. Because gastrointestinal bleeding is a licensed indication for tranexamic acid, our results could have regulatory implications. Although this trial can rule out the large mortality reduction suggested by the meta-analysis of previous small trials, it cannot rule out more modest treatment effects. Because tranexamic acid reduces bleeding deaths in patients with traumatic and postpartum haemorrhage, individual patient data meta-analyses should assess the strength of the evidence that the effectiveness and safety of tranexamic acid varies by the site and cause of bleeding.

### Consensus about managing gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs? [^c8bd2b54]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The second issue worthy of comment is the conclusion the consensus group reached about whether some NSAIDs are safer than others from the standpoint of CV risk. Statement 8 reads: ' The risk of CV events associated with celecoxib use is similar to that associated with the use of most ns-NSAIDs'. Eighty-four percent of the panel agreed strongly or moderately, although only just over half the panel rated the level of evidence as high. They did not endorse earlier strong recommendations from bodies such as the American Heart Association and American College of Gastroenterology that naproxen should be the NSAID of choice for patients with high CV risk. Instead, the treatment-guidance algorithm they propose allows either naproxen or low-dose celecoxib as the preferred agents in patients with high CV risk, adding in a PPI to either if patients are judged to also be at high GI risk.

As Scarpignato et al. indicate, the evidence about whether naproxen has a lower CV risk has been conflicting; there is some pharmacokinetic basis to suspect it might. Aspirin exerts its prolonged anti-platelet effect because it irreversibly acetylates platelet cyclooxygenase. However, other nsNSAIDs are reversible inhibitors of the enzyme, so their platelet inhibitory effect disappears as their plasma levels dissipate. Naproxen is one of the longer acting nsNSAIDs, with a plasma elimination half-life of about 14 hours; a small study of volunteers given a single dose of 1,000 mg found platelet aggregation still reduced after 24 hours in 60% of cases. Thus, it is plausible that twice daily dosing may offer some protection against thrombotic events.

Seemingly in support of this, a recent large meta-analysis (the CNT collaboration) found that a coxib, diclofenac, or ibuprofen increased the rate of major vascular events by about a third (not quite significant for ibuprofen), but naproxen did not. However, a meta-analysis is only as strong as its component parts, and a particular weakness of the CNT meta-analysis was that it had to indirectly compare the effects of the different drugs. That is to say, studies of drug A versus drug B were combined with studies of drug A versus placebo to estimate relative risks for drug B versus placebo.

### Preliminary results suggest tranexamic acid is safe and effective in arthroplasty patients with severe comorbidities [^1784ba8c]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces blood loss and transfusion after total joint arthroplasty (TJA) but concerns remain that patients with severe medical comorbidities might be at increased risk for thromboembolic complications.

Questions/Purposes

Among patients undergoing primary TJA with severe systemic medical disease, (1) was TXA associated with increased symptomatic thromboembolic events; (2) was TXA associated with decreased blood transfusion rates; and (3) were there differences in symptomatic thromboembolism or transfusions in the subset of patients with a history of, or risk factors for; thromboembolic disease?

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of 1131 primary TJAs in 1002 patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists score III or IV. Of these, 402 had at least one of seven risk factors for thromboembolic events and were designated as high risk; 240 of those patients received TXA. Outcome measures included 30-day postoperative symptomatic thromboembolic events and postoperative transfusion.

Results

There were no differences in symptomatic thromboembolic events within 30 days of surgery between patients who received TXA and those who did not (2.5% versus 2.6%, p = 0.97). Fewer patients treated with TXA received transfusions (11% with versus 41% without; p < 0.0001). In high-risk patients, TXA was not associated with an increase in symptomatic thromboembolic events (6.7% with versus 4.3% without; p = 0.27) and was associated with a decrease in transfusion rates (17% with versus 48% without; p = 0.001).

Conclusions

Although TXA seemed safe and effective in this database review of patients with severe medical comorbidities, a larger prospective trial is warranted to confirm these results.

### TXA (tranexamic acid) risk evaluation in combat casualties (TRECC) [^b1c9c3e8]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In trauma patients, uncontrolled post-traumatic hemorrhage accounts for a significant percentage of mortality. When the body's natural blood coagulation mechanisms malfunction and cause an inappropriate increase in blood clot breakdown, known as hyperfibrinolysis, there can be a negative impact in the patient's ability to survive. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a synthetic derivative of the amino acid lysine that was created to serve as an antifibrinolytic agent.TXA acts by binding to plasminogen and blocking the interaction of plasminogen with fibrin, thereby stopping dissolution of the fibrin clot and preventing or reducing hemorrhage.TXA is an inexpensive yet effective treatment for patients with severe blood loss and it has been used in many settings, including during surgical procedures, dentistry, pregnancy, menstrual bleeding, hemophilia and trauma. Previous studies investigating the use of TXA have demonstrated improved survival and decreased hemorrhagic events with TXA use with few side effects. Consequently, TXA is included on the WHO's List of Essential Medicines.

### Effect of tranexamic acid on thrombotic events and seizures in bleeding patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^82f4085d]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Primary outcome in all hemorrhagic patients

We found no evidence that TXA administration increased the risk of thrombotic events (RR = 1.00 [95% CI 0.93–1.08], I² = 0%, high certainty of evidence), seizures (1.18 [0.91–1.53], I² = 34%, moderate certainty), venous thromboembolism (1.04 [0.92–1.17], I² = 0%), acute coronary syndrome (0.88 [0.78–1.00], I² = 0%) or stroke (1.12 [0.98–1.27], I² = 0%) (Fig. 2). These results were consistent for both random effects and fixed effect statistical model and we observed no evidence of publication bias, either when evaluating the funnel plot (Additional file 2: Figures S3 and S4) or statistically for thrombotic events (Begg's rank correlation test: p = 0.12 and Egger's linear regression test: 0.424) and seizures (Begg's rank correlation test: p = 0.63 and Egger's linear regression test: 0.199). The certainty of evidence was judged as high for thrombotic events but moderate for seizures due to imprecision (Table 2).

### Intra-articular tranexamic acid injection during the hip hemi-arthroplasty in elderly patients: a retrospective study [^acea95cc]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Tranexamic acid is excreted largely unchanged in urine and has a circulating half-life of approximately 2 hours; a small amount of the drug is metabolized through the liver. Topical application of TXA leads to 70% lower systemic absorption and a higher concentration in the wound, and it is even safer for older patients who have renal or liver dysfunction. At therapeutic concentrations, TXA does not affect platelet count, platelet aggregation, or coagulation parameters. Tranexamic acid is of value in elderly patients who take aspirin or clopidogrel for secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases because such antiplatelet drugs influence coagulation.

Although the use of TXA has yielded excellent results, in THA, and a number of meta-analyses have shown no increase in thromboembolic complications, it is still too early to acknowledge the safety of TXA. Most of the available data would likely support TXA's safety in relatively healthy patients rather those with higher risk. Furthermore, there were proposed contraindications for TXA use, including arterial and venous thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, myocardial infarct, and acute renal failure. With current evidence, the safety of TXA in patients with higher risk conditions is still uncertain. A case report by Bruce-Brand et al revealed a 65-year-old man with a previously undiagnosed patent foramen ovale who suffered pulmonary emboli and cerebrovascular infarction after synchronous bilateral TKA, during which TXA was administered intravenously. Nearly all of elderly patients received HA after femoral neck fracture were older than 80 and had several comorbidities simultaneously and were regarded as higher risk to a certain degree. Moreover, the method of applying of TXA in most of current studies has been intravenous; there are still few studies concerning the safety of topical use of TXA. Martin et alreported no clinically significant increase in complications in TXA group. Konig et alreported no thromboembolic complications with topical use of TXA in THA and TKA patients. We also achieved similar results with the topical use of TXA.

The results from our study are promising. As it was a retrospective and small study with a limited number of patients, some limitations need to be further improved. More patients should be included in a future study and randomized controlled trials would be a better way to demonstrate the results. As body mass index (BMI) has been shown to be an important predictor for transfusion for hip arthroplasty, it is necessary to add the BMI data into observation outcomes in further study.

### Tranexamic acid can Be administered to arthroplasty patients who receive aspirin for venous thromboembolic prophylaxis [^20c83bb6]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is not uncommon after total joint arthroplasty (TJA). Various prophylactic agents have been used to minimize this complication after TJA. Numerous studies have demonstrated that acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) has equivalent efficacy to other agents in preventing VTE after TJA. However, some have expressed theoretical concern that ASA may not be an adequate VTE prophylaxis in TJA patients receiving tranexamic acid (TA), which is an antifibrinolytic agent. The purpose of the study was to assess the safety and efficacy of administering systemic TA in TJA patients who also received ASA for VTE prophylaxis.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted on 2835 consecutive patients (1678 receiving TA and 1157 not receiving TA) who underwent primary or revision TJA between January 2013 and June 2014 and also received aspirin for VTE prophylaxis. The incidence of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism was evaluated.

Results

Blood loss and transfusion rates were significantly lower in the TA group compared to the non-TA group (P < .0001, P = 0.017, respectively). The incidence of VTE, bleeding events, and wound complications was similar (P > .05) between the groups.

Conclusion

In patients undergoing TJA who receive ASA for VTE prophylaxis, TA reduces bleeding and transfusions without increasing the incidence of subsequent VTE.

### Tranexamic acid in patients undergoing coronary-artery surgery [^367782b8]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Tranexamic acid reduces the risk of bleeding among patients undergoing cardiac surgery, but it is unclear whether this leads to improved outcomes. Furthermore, there are concerns that tranexamic acid may have prothrombotic and proconvulsant effects.

Methods

In a trial with a 2-by-2 factorial design, we randomly assigned patients who were scheduled to undergo coronary-artery surgery and were at risk for perioperative complications to receive aspirin or placebo and tranexamic acid or placebo. The results of the tranexamic acid comparison are reported here. The primary outcome was a composite of death and thrombotic complications (nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, renal failure, or bowel infarction) within 30 days after surgery.

Results

Of the 4662 patients who were enrolled and provided consent, 4631 underwent surgery and had available outcomes data; 2311 were assigned to the tranexamic acid group and 2320 to the placebo group. A primary outcome event occurred in 386 patients (16.7%) in the tranexamic acid group and in 420 patients (18.1%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.81 to 1.05; P = 0.22). The total number of units of blood products that were transfused during hospitalization was 4331 in the tranexamic acid group and 7994 in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Major hemorrhage or cardiac tamponade leading to reoperation occurred in 1.4% of the patients in the tranexamic acid group and in 2.8% of the patients in the placebo group (P = 0.001), and seizures occurred in 0.7% and 0.1%, respectively (P = 0.002 by Fisher's exact test).

Conclusions

Among patients undergoing coronary-artery surgery, tranexamic acid was associated with a lower risk of bleeding than was placebo, without a higher risk of death or thrombotic complications within 30 days after surgery. Tranexamic acid was associated with a higher risk of postoperative seizures.

### Antifibrinolytics for heavy menstrual bleeding [^f4a70dcd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is an important physical and social problem for women. Oral treatment for HMB includes antifibrinolytic drugs, which are designed to reduce bleeding by inhibiting clot-dissolving enzymes in the endometrium. Historically, there has been some concern that using the antifibrinolytic tranexamic acid (TXA) for HMB may increase the risk of venous thromboembolic disease. This is an umbrella term for deep venous thrombosis (blood clots in the blood vessels in the legs) and pulmonary emboli (blood clots in the blood vessels in the lungs).

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of antifibrinolytic medications as a treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility (CGF) Group trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and two trials registers in November 2017, together with reference checking and contact with study authors and experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antifibrinolytic agents versus placebo, no treatment or other medical treatment in women of reproductive age with HMB. Twelve studies utilised TXA and one utilised a prodrug of TXA (Kabi).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary review outcomes were menstrual blood loss (MBL), improvement in HMB, and thromboembolic events.

Main Results

We included 13 RCTs (1312 participants analysed). The evidence was very low to moderate quality: the main limitations were risk of bias (associated with lack of blinding, and poor reporting of study methods), imprecision and inconsistency. Antifibrinolytics (TXA or Kabi) versus no treatment or placeboWhen compared with a placebo, antifibrinolytics were associated with reduced mean blood loss (MD -53.20 mL per cycle, 95% CI -62.70 to -43.70; I² = 8%; 4 RCTs, participants = 565; moderate-quality evidence) and higher rates of improvement (RR 3.34, 95% CI 1.84 to 6.09; 3 RCTS, participants = 271; moderate-quality evidence). This suggests that if 11% of women improve without treatment, 43% to 63% of women taking antifibrinolytics will do so. There was no clear evidence of a difference between the groups in adverse events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.18; 1 RCT, participants = 297; low-quality evidence). Only one thromboembolic event occurred in the two studies that reported this outcome.TXA versus progestogensThere was no clear evidence of a difference between the groups in mean blood loss measured using the Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart (PBAC) (MD -12.22 points per cycle, 95% CI -30.8 to 6.36; I² = 0%; 3 RCTs, participants = 312; very low quality evidence), but TXA was associated with a higher likelihood of improvement (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.80; I² = 32%; 5 RCTs, participants = 422; low-quality evidence). This suggests that if 46% of women improve with progestogens, 61% to 83% of women will do so with TXA. Adverse events were less common in the TXA group (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.94; I² = 28%; 4 RCTs, participants = 349; low-quality evidence). No thromboembolic events were reported in any group.TXA versus non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)TXA was associated with reduced mean blood loss (MD -73.00 mL per cycle, 95% CI -123.35 to -22.65; 1 RCT, participants = 49; low-quality evidence) and higher likelihood of improvement (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.74; 1 2 = 0%; 2 RCTs, participants = 161; low-quality evidence). This suggests that if 61% of women improve with NSAIDs, 71% to 100% of women will do so with TXA. Adverse events were uncommon and no comparative data were available. No thromboembolic events were reported.TXA versus ethamsylateTXA was associated with reduced mean blood loss (MD 100 mL per cycle, 95% CI -141.82 to -58.18; 1 RCT, participants = 53; low-quality evidence), but there was insufficient evidence to determine whether the groups differed in rates of improvement (RR 1.56, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.55; 1 RCT, participants = 53; very low quality evidence) or withdrawal due to adverse events (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.19 to 3.15; 1 RCT, participants = 53; very low quality evidence).TXA versus herbal medicines (Safoof Habis and Punica granatum)TXA was associated with a reduced mean PBAC score after three months' treatment (MD -23.90 pts per cycle, 95% CI -31.92 to -15.88; I² = 0%; 2 RCTs, participants = 121; low-quality evidence). No data were available for rates of improvement. TXA was associated with a reduced mean PBAC score three months after the end of the treatment phase (MD -10.40 points per cycle, 95% CI -19.20 to -1.60; I² not applicable; 1 RCT, participants = 84; very low quality evidence). There was insufficient evidence to determine whether the groups differed in rates of adverse events (RR 2.25, 95% CI 0.74 to 6.80; 1 RCT, participants = 94; very low quality evidence). No thromboembolic events were reported.TXA versus levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LIUS)TXA was associated with a higher median PBAC score than TXA (median difference 125.5 points; 1 RCT, participants = 42; very low quality evidence) and a lower likelihood of improvement (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.77; 1 RCT, participants = 42; very low quality evidence). This suggests that if 85% of women improve with LIUS, 20% to 65% of women will do so with TXA. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether the groups differed in rates of adverse events (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.80; 1 RCT, participants = 42; very low quality evidence). No thromboembolic events were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Antifibrinolytic treatment (such as TXA) appears effective for treating HMB compared to placebo, NSAIDs, oral luteal progestogens, ethamsylate, or herbal remedies, but may be less effective than LIUS. There were too few data for most comparisons to determine whether antifibrinolytics were associated with increased risk of adverse events, and most studies did not specifically include thromboembolism as an outcome.

### To bleed or not to bleed: observing risk of concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and oral anticoagulant use after venous thromboembolism [^e8c1c034]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) patients on anticoagulation therapy often present with pain and inflammation amenable to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but the decision regarding their use can be contentious given increased bleeding risk. NSAIDs are widely prescribed for their analgesic, anti-pyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the cyclo-oxygenase (COX-1, COX-2) enzymes. This alters the arachidonic acid pathway metabolites including prostaglandins (causes pain and inflammation), prostacyclins (promotes vasodilation and inhibits platelet aggregation), and thromboxanes (causes platelet aggregation). Upsetting this pathway can increase bleeding risk by causing gastrointestinal tract toxicity and disrupting platelet function. The development of selective COX-2 inhibitors was aimed to ameliorate this by maintaining prostaglandins levels, but resulted in increased cardiovascular events for some patients.

### Effect of tranexamic acid on thrombotic events and seizures in bleeding patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^882e7826]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews

In the previous cumulative systematic review and meta-analysis including surgical bleeding, there was no observed increase in thromboembolic events such as stroke, ACS and VTE, although harmful effects were undeniable due to imprecision. Moreover, recent individual patient-data meta-analysis including two large-scale RCTs reported that vascular occlusive events did not increase in acute severe bleeding, considered as beneficial population for TXA treatment. As well as the previous reports, the present study showed that TXA did not appear to increase thrombotic events in bleeding populations with high certainty of evidence. On the other hand, the risk of thrombotic events, especially stroke, were higher in TXA group than control group in intracranial (non-traumatic) hemorrhage, which was consistent with previous systematic review and meta-analysis. With regard to the thrombotic risk in females, tranexamic acid did not appear to increase the risk of thrombotic events in patients in obstetrics and gynecology trials.

As for seizures, administration of high dose TXA was associated with increased risk of seizures in cardiac surgery according to previous studies. A recently published large-scale randomized controlled trial (HALT-IT) comparing high dose of TXA (4 g/day) and placebo in gastrointestinal hemorrhage also showed increased risk of seizures. With totaling this evidence, the present study demonstrated dose-dependent increase in seizures with TXA use in bleeding patients. However, TXA did not appear to increase the risk of seizures when administered at a dose of 2 g/day or less.

### Naproxen [^4d2ffc33]. FDA. Low credibility.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of naproxen PO (also known as Naprosyn, Naprosyn):
- **Cardiovascular thrombotic events**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as naproxen increases cardiovascular thrombotic event risk (myocardial infarction, stroke), especially in patients with CVD or risk factors. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible and closely monitor patients with CVD or risk factors. Inform patients of symptoms indicating serious cardiovascular events (e.g., chest pain, shortness of breath) and advise them to seek immediate medical attention if they occur.
- **Gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulcer disease, gastric perforation**: use extreme caution in patients with peptic ulcer disease/GI bleeding history, or those with risk factors including prolonged treatment, high-risk medications (e.g., aspirin, anticoagulants, SSRIs), smoking, alcohol, advanced age, poor health, liver disease, or coagulopathy, as fatal GI events are more common in elderly or debilitated patients. To minimize GI risks, use NSAIDs at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, avoid concurrent NSAID use, monitor closely for GI bleeding, and discontinue therapy if serious adverse events occur, especially in high-risk patients or those taking low-dose aspirin.

### Tranexamic acid for acute hemorrhage: a narrative review of landmark studies and a critical reappraisal of its use over the last decade [^53883fa3]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

The publication of the Clinical Randomization of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Hemorrhage-2 (CRASH-2) study and its intense dissemination prompted a renaissance for the use of the antifibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid (TXA) in acute trauma hemorrhage. Subsequent studies led to its widespread use as a therapeutic as well as prophylactic agent across different clinical scenarios involving bleeding, such as trauma, postpartum, and orthopedic surgery. However, results from the existing studies are confounded by methodological and statistical ambiguities and are open to varied interpretations. Substantial knowledge gaps remain on dosing, pharmacokinetics, mechanism of action, and clinical applications for TXA. The risk for potential thromboembolic complications with the use of TXA must be balanced against its clinical benefits. The present article aims to provide a critical reappraisal of TXA use over the last decade and a "thought exercise" in the potential downsides of TXA. A more selective and individualized use of TXA, guided by extended and functional coagulation assays, is advocated in the context of the evolving concept of precision medicine.

### Effect of early tranexamic acid administration on mortality, hysterectomy, and other morbidities in women with post-partum haemorrhage (WOMAN): an international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^6aab80af]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

The study WOMAN was published by WOMAN Trial Collaborators. and colleagues in 2017 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Postpartum hemorrhage. In the WOMAN study, the trial question was: what is the effect of early tranexamic acid administration in patients with postpartum hemorrhage? In the WOMAN study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the WOMAN study, the population was: 20060 female patients. The inclusion criteria were female patients ≥ 16 years with a clinical diagnosis of postpartum hemorrhage after vaginal birth or C-section. The key exclusion criteria were consideration of a clear indication or contraindication for tranexamic acid by the responsible clinician. In the WOMAN study, the interventions were: n = 10051 tranexamic acid (an intravenous dose of 1 g plus usual care) n = 10009 placebo (matching placebo plus usual care). In the WOMAN study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death due to bleeding (1.5% vs. 1.9%; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.65 to 1). In the WOMAN study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death from all causes or hysterectomy at day 42 (5.3% vs. 5.6%; RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.09) Significant decrease in death due to bleeding in women given treatment within 3 hours of giving birth (1.2% vs. 1.7%; RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.91) No significant difference in hysterectomy (3.6% vs. 3.5%; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.07). In the WOMAN study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events including thromboembolic events. significant differences in use of brace sutures (3.0% vs. 2.5%), laparotomy for bleeding (0.8% vs. 1.3%). In the WOMAN study, the conclusion was: in female patients ≥ 16 years with a clinical diagnosis of postpartum hemorrhage after vaginal birth or C-section, tranexamic acid was superior to placebo with respect to death due to bleeding.

### The never ending success story of tranexamic acid in acquired bleeding [^de068949]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Tranexamic acid in acute bleeding conditions

In addition to the preventive use of TXA, a number of studies have investigated the role of this anti-fibrinolytic agent in patients presenting with acute, critical bleeding.– In trauma patients, the largest body of evidence stems from the Clinical Randomisation of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Haemorrhage (CRASH) trials. In the CRASH-2 trial, 20,211 severely injured adults with confirmed or suspected hemorrhage were randomly assigned within 8 h from the occurrence of trauma to receive TXA (loading bolus dose of 1 g and then an infusion of 1 g over 8 h) or placebo. Despite no difference in bleeding rate and transfusion use, all-cause mortality was lower in the treatment group than in the placebo group (14.5% vs. 16%, respectively; RR 0.91; 95% CI: 0.85–0.97, P = 0.0035). Similarly, the rate of deaths attributed to bleeding was reduced from 5.7% to 4.9% (P = 0.0077) (Table 1). Yet, from a sub-analysis of CRASH-2, the timing of TXA administration was crucial for patients' outcomes. Early infusion of TXA within 1 h after trauma was associated with the largest survival benefit (absolute reduction = 2.4%, number needed to treat = 41). TXA infused between 1 and 3 h also reduced the risk of death due to bleeding (absolute reduction = 1.3%, number needed to treat = 77), but a later administration (> 3 h after trauma) was associated with an increased risk of death from bleeding compared with the risk among patients receiving placebo (RR 1.44, 95% CI: 1.12–1.84; P = 0.004). There was no evidence that TXA increased the risk of vascular occlusive events and, in a pre-specified analysis of the data collected when TXA was given within 3 h of injury, there was even a reduction in the odds of fatal and non-fatal vascular occlusive events (odds ratio = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.53–0.89; P = 0.005). Following the publication of this study, the World Health Organization (WHO) included TXA in their list of essential medicines (available at:). Since this seminal study, a number of randomized clinical trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the efficacy of anti-fibrinolytic agents have been published. The Cochrane systematic review regarding anti-fibrinolytic drugs for acute traumatic injury found that, after the analysis of four trials involving 20,548 patients, TXA reduced the risk of death by 10% (RR 0.90, 95% CI: 0.85–0.96; P = 0.002) without increasing the risk of adverse events.

### Effect of tranexamic acid on mortality in patients with traumatic bleeding: prespecified analysis of data from randomised controlled trial [^db6de5df]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Potential biological mechanisms

Tranexamic acid reduces the risk of death from haemorrhage and seems to reduce the risk of arterial thrombotic events. It is possible that by reducing bleeding, tranexamic acid reduces myocardial oxygen demand and increases oxygen supply. It is also possible that the reduction in arterial thrombotic events could be mediated through an anti-inflammatory effect of tranexamic acid.

Implications for patients

These results have important implications for the care of trauma patients. Firstly, they suggest that tranexamic acid can safely be used in all trauma patients with or at risk of severe bleeding, as in the inclusion criteria used in the CRASH-2 trial, and not just in the most severely injured. Secondly, the observed reduction in the risk of arterial events with tranexamic acid suggests that the absolute benefits from administration of tranexamic acid are likely to be greatest in older trauma patients, who at any given level of severity of injury have a higher baseline risk of death from haemorrhage and thrombotic events. Clinical concern about an increased risk of ischaemic cardiac events might be a reason to give rather than to withhold tranexamic acid. It is worth noting that trials of tranexamic acid in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, a group at high risk of cardiac events, provide no evidence of any increased risk. We acknowledge that estimating the risk of severe bleeding is a challenging ongoing process that uses not only physiological variables but other variables such as laboratory measurements and response to treatments. Physicians will use all this information and their clinical judgment when deciding whether to use tranexamic acid. In situations of uncertainty, however, physicians can use the prognostic model to support the decision making process and should certainly consider administering tranexamic acid to patients with a risk of death higher than 5%.

### Effect of tranexamic acid on thrombotic events and seizures in bleeding patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0055b41e]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Summary of main results

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, intravenous tranexamic acid administration did not appear to increase the risk of thrombotic events and seizures in bleeding patients. In per disease analysis, the risk of thrombotic events and stroke was higher in the TXA group than control in intracranial hemorrhage. With regard to seizures, its risk was increased in cardiac surgery and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and those increase probably came from higher dose of TXA use. In view of the evidence, tranexamic can be safely used in bleeding patients, especially in trauma, obstetrics and gynecology and orthopedic surgery. There may be a dose-dependent increase in the risk of seizures.

Mechanism of TXA on thrombotic events and seizures

Although theoretically, TXA might be expected to increase the risk of thrombotic events due to its antifibrinolytic activity, the present analysis found no evidence in support of this hypothesis. In the early phase of bleeding in trauma or surgery, early fibrinolysis is triggered by the release of tissue plasminogen activator and causes excessive bleeding. Subsequently, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 level increases and inhibit fibrinolysis. TXA is targeted to modulate early fibrinolysis, and thus it is rational we could not find any increase in thrombotic events in bleeding patients with hyperfibrinolysis even for TXA use.

TXA-associated seizures are caused by another mechanism. TXA is a competitive antagonist of GABA A in brain. In in vitro and animal experiment, higher TXA level in the cerebral spinal fluid, correlated with serum concentration, was associated with the incidence of seizures. In fact, the results of this meta-analysis were consistent with the basic research reporting dose-dependent increase in the risk of seizures.

Strength of the review

A major strength of this analysis is that the present meta-analysis included recently published all the available large-scale randomized controlled trials. Pooling data from 102,681 patients enrolled in 234 randomized controlled trials of tranexamic acid, our study included by far more information than any previous meta-analysis that have addressed this issue. Therefore, this meta-analysis would provide greater evidence regarding safety of tranexamic acid in bleeding populations. In fact, the certainty of evidence evaluated by the GRADE approach was high in thrombotic events with narrow confidence intervals.

### Heavy menstrual bleeding in premenopausal patients and… [^6e8809af]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Do nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs effectively reduce heavy menstrual bleeding in premenopausal patients. Evidence-Based Answer NSAIDs are effective for reducing heavy menstrual bleeding in premenopausal patients with menorrhagia when compared with placebo. However, NSAIDs are less effective than tranexamic acid and the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system for reducing heavy menstrual bleeding. Adverse effects of NSAIDs, particularly gastrointestinal effects, are variable in frequency, although typically not severe.

1. Compared with placebo, mefenamic acid taken from start to finish of menses resulted in fewer reports of heavy menstrual bleeding.

Naproxen taken at the onset of menses reduced menstrual blood loss by 37 to 54 mL when compared with placebo. Ibuprofen taken throughout the menstrual cycle decreased menstrual blood loss by 36 mL compared with placebo. Ibuprofen taken throughout the cycle did not decrease menstrual blood loss vs. placebo. The dosages of mefenamic acid in these studies were higher than the typical recommended dosing in the United States, which is a single dose of 500 mg, followed by 250 mg four times daily for up to three days. NSAIDs are contraindicated in patients with both heavy menstrual bleeding and bleeding disorders caused by platelet aggregation inhibition, and they carry an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events and adverse gastrointestinal events, including bleeding.

4 Tranexamic acid taken for five days decreased menstrual blood loss compared with mefenamic acid without a significant difference in subjective report of menstrual blood loss. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system significantly reduced median menstrual blood loss compared with NSAIDs.

### Tranexamic acid versus oxytocin prophylaxis in reducing post-partum blood loss, in low-risk pregnant women: TRANOXY STUDY, a phase III randomized clinical trial [^691f6570]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study demonstrates, for the first time, that tranexamic acid, administered alone and for slow intravenous infusion within 5 min of vaginal childbirth, is equivalent to intramuscular oxytocin in preventing postpartum blood loss in term patients at low risk of PPH. Thus, suggesting its potential use for PPH prophylaxis in the absence of uterine atony.

PPH is one of the leading causes of maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide. Available evidence supports the use of tranexamic acid associated with uterotonic to reduce PPH in women of all risk categories in both industrialized and developing countries. There is evidence demonstrating the usefulness of TRAN in the treatment of PPH when administered within 3 h after birth in combination with oxytocin.

Current knowledge indicates that fibrinogenemia levels are higher in pregnant women than in non-pregnant women. Fibrinogenemia levels increase significantly in the third trimester with estrogen levels and decrease during the third stage of labor (delivery of placenta and membranes). This decrease in fibrinogenemia is due to intravascular fibrin deposition during postpartum, which leads to an increase in fibrinogen consumption. In fact, tissue biopsies studies of the placental bed using an electron microscope reveal that, immediately after a normal childbirth, an extravascular fibrin network forms on the endometrial surface. These physiological mechanisms have led us to hypothesize that TRAN, as an antifibrinolytic agent, may be an effective prophylaxis in the control of postpartum bleeding.

The therapeutic inhibition of fibrinolysis has already proven effective in other clinical settings, such as cardiac surgery, hepatic, traumatology, and neurosurgery, reducing the risk of blood transfusions, the average volume of blood transfused, the need for reoperation, without increasing the thromboembolic risk, Clinical Randomization of an Antifibrinolytic in significant hemorrhage has shown that administration of TRAN (1 g loading dose in 10 min followed by 1 g in 8 h) within 3 h of trauma, reduces all-cause mortality by 16%–14.5% within four weeks (hemorrhage, vascular occlusion, myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism) in the traumatized patient, without increasing thrombotic events (pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis). The survival benefit is only evident if TRAN treatment is initiated within 3 h of injury and does not increase the risk of cardio-vascular occlusive events.

### Tranexamic acid for the prevention of blood loss after cesarean section: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^b5451c84]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Tranexamic acid is a cost-effective intervention for the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage among women who undergo cesarean delivery, but the evidence to support its use is conflicting. We conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid in low- and high-risk cesarean deliveries.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, the Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform portal from inception to April 2022 (updated October 2022 and February 2023) with no language restrictions. In addition, grey literature sources were also explored.

Study Eligibility Criteria

All randomized controlled trials that investigated the prophylactic use of intravenous tranexamic acid in addition to standard uterotonic agents among women who underwent cesarean deliveries in comparison with a placebo, standard treatment, or prostaglandins were included in this meta-analysis.

Methods

We used the revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (RoB 2.0) to assess the quality of the included randomized controlled trials. RevMan 5.4 was used to conduct all statistical analyses using a random-effects model.

Results

We included 50 randomized controlled trials (6 in only high-risk patients and 2 with prostaglandins as the comparator) that evaluated tranexamic acid in our meta-analysis. Tranexamic acid reduced the risk for blood loss > 1000 mL, the mean total blood loss, and the need for blood transfusion in both low- and high-risk patients. Tranexamic acid was associated with a beneficial effect in the secondary outcomes, including a decline in hemoglobin levels and the need for additional uterotonic agents. Tranexamic acid increased the risk for nonthromboembolic adverse events but, based on limited data, did not increase the incidence of thromboembolic events. The administration of tranexamic acid before skin incision, but not after cord clamping, was associated with a large benefit. The quality of evidence was rated as low to very low for outcomes in the low-risk population and moderate for most outcomes in the high-risk subgroup.

Conclusion

Tranexamic acid may reduce the risk for blood loss in cesarean deliveries with a higher benefit observed in high-risk patients, but the lack of high-quality evidence precludes any strong conclusions. The administration of tranexamic acid before skin incision, but not after cord clamping, was associated with a large benefit. Additional studies, especially in the high-risk population and focused on evaluating the timing of tranexamic acid administration, are needed to confirm or refute these findings.

Severe maternal adverse events related to tranexamic acid

Caution is necessary before recommending the use of this drug in routine practice for prevention or treatment of PPH, in view of the number of eligible women who would be eligible to receive it in both cases: not only is the evidence supporting its efficacy still insufficient, but also and especially the number of venous and arterial thrombotic events might increase after its administration. Consequently, until now, no authorities or learned societies have recommended the administration of TXA to prevent PPH, after either vaginal or cesarean delivery.

Because TXA inhibits fibrinolysis, it carries a potential risk of thrombosis, especially in patients with a previous history of thrombosis and in pregnant women. Nevertheless, the systematic review of randomized controlled trials of elective surgical patients cited above (129 randomized controlled trials including 10 488 randomized participants, 5484 of them allocated to TXA) showed no significant increases in the incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. Moreover, the CRASH-2 trial of TXA in bleeding trauma patients showed a statistically significant reduction in global mortality with no increase in thromboembolic events. Nevertheless, as thromboembolic events are relatively rare, these trials do not resolve the uncertainties about this risk because most of these trials lacked the statistical power to detect clinically important increases in risk. In particular, five cases of acute renal failure due to thrombosis-induced cortical necrosis following TXA administration have been described.

### Tranexamic acid in trauma: how should we use it? [^fcfb69f3]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces blood loss by inhibiting the enzymatic breakdown of fibrin. It is often used in surgery to decrease bleeding and the need for blood transfusion. In 2011, results from a multi-center, randomized, and placebo-controlled trial (CRASH-2 trial) showed that TXA (1 g loading dose over 10 min followed by an infusion of 1 g over 8 h) safely reduces mortality in bleeding trauma patients. Initiation of TXA treatment within 3 h of injury reduces the risk of hemorrhage death by about one-third, regardless of baseline risk. Because it does not have any serious adverse effects, TXA can be administered to a wide spectrum of bleeding trauma patients. Limiting its use to the most severely injured or those with a diagnosis of 'hyperfibrinolysis' would result in thousands of avoidable deaths. A clinical trial (CRASH-3 trial) of TXA in patients with traumatic brain injury is now in progress.

BOXED WARNING

Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, which can be fatal. This risk may occur early in treatment and may increase with duration of use.
Ketoprofen capsules are contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.

Gastrointestinal Risk

NSAIDs cause an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms. Elderly patients are at greater risk for serious gastrointestinal (GI) events.

### Sulindac [^09951fdf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as sulindac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings].

### Post-partum haemorrhage and tranexamic acid: a global issue [^979f6b6f]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Post-partum haemorrhage (PPH) remains the major cause of maternal death worldwide, with the overwhelming majority of bleeding deaths occurring in low income countries. These bleeding deaths occur due to a complex network of biological and socioeconomic factors, including changes to haemostasis and fibrinolysis during pregnancy. Tranexamic acid (TxA) has been shown to reduce death in bleeding trauma patients safely and is effective in reducing bleeding in surgical patients, however its role in PPH has been less well established. We discuss the impact of the recently published World Maternal Antifibrinolytic (WOMAN) trial, which demonstrated a significant reduction in bleeding deaths (Risk ratio 0·81) in women with PPH who received intravenous TxA compared to those receiving placebo. There were no increases in post-partum thrombotic rates in mothers or breast-fed babies. This trial has shown that intravenous TxA can be used safely and effectively to treat PPH, and should be implemented widely to reduce death due to PPH. However, for the full benefit of TxA to be fully realised in resource-constrained settings, the effectiveness of oral or topical administration and/or pre-emptive dosing need to be investigated.

### Effectiveness and safety of low-dose intraoperative tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery: a retrospective before-and-after study [^049a5ca9]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The emphasis on our findings, derived from a low-dose TXA regimen, stems from concerns about TXA-related adverse effects. Given its antifibrinolytic properties, TXA has been linked to the potential risk of thrombotic complications, including bowel ischemia, pulmonary thromboembolism, deep vein thrombosis, and ischemic stroke. However, current guidelines only recommend the use of TXA in cardiac surgery but do not specify an appropriate dose that provides sufficient hemostatic efficacy while minimizing adverse events. The CRASH-2 trial demonstrated that administering TXA at a dose of 1 g twice in trauma patients did not increase thrombotic complications compared with placebo. Similarly, the WOMAN trial found no increased thrombotic risk with a comparable TXA regimen for postpartum hemorrhage. In noncardiac surgery, the recent POISE-3 trial reported that a 1 g bolus at the beginning and end of surgery significantly reduced the composite bleeding outcome without increasing thrombotic complications. In cardiac surgery, the ATACAS trial evaluated TXA at doses of 50 or 100 mg/kg administered at anesthesia induction and found no significant difference in thrombotic complications compared with placebo. Recently, the OPTIMAL trial was the first randomized controlled trial to compare different TXA dosing strategies during cardiac surgery (n = 3,031). It showed that a high-dose regimen (30 mg/kg bolus, 16 mg/kg/h maintenance, and 2 mg/kg CPB prime) led to a modest reduction in transfusion rates and met non-inferiority criteria for a composite complication outcome compared to a low-dose regimen (10 mg/kg bolus, 2 mg/kg/h maintenance, and 1 mg/kg CPB prime). Nevertheless, current evidence is insufficient to conclude that higher doses should be universally adopted, highlighting the need for further research on various dosing regimens. Indeed, meta-analyses have suggested that beyond a certain threshold (which is yet to be determined), additional TXA may not provide further hemostatic benefits, whereas the risk of adverse events is expected to increase linearly with dose escalation. Our study employed a modified regimen with a lower bolus dose of TXA (5 mg/kg) but a higher maintenance dose (5 mg/kg/h) than the low-dose arm of the OPTIMAL trial, yet thrombotic complications remained comparable to those in the non-TXA group. At the time our regimen was established, we considered that reducing the bolus dose while using a relatively higher infusion rate could avoid excessively high peak plasma levels and still achieve the plasma concentration of 20 µg/ml known to maintain antifibrinolytic activity throughout CPB. Compared with no TXA use, this regimen demonstrated clinically meaningful effects in our study; however, future studies directly comparing this regimen with protocols that use lower maintenance infusion rates are warranted, as the optimal protocol remains undefined.

### Study protocol. TRAAPREVIA-TRAnexamic acid for preventing blood loss following a cesarean delivery in women with a placenta pREVIA or low-lying placenta: a multicenter randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial [^5b611219]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Potential and implementation of the findings

Placenta previa is a well-known condition that can significantly increase severe PPH-related maternal morbidity and the risk of life-threatening postpartum bleeding, the incidence of which is increasing along with the worldwide rise in cesarean rates. Very few interventions have been specifically tested among women with placenta previa to reduce blood loss and maternal morbidity. Tranexamic acid is an inexpensive agent that is simple to administer and acts by inhibiting the fibrinolytic pathway and protecting blood clots from being degraded. It can easily be added to the routine management of cesarean deliveries worldwide. It has been considered a promising candidate for prevention, although four large multicenter well-conducted and adequately powered randomized controlled trials report either no or a weak prophylactic effect on clinical secondary blood loss-related outcomes after childbirth.

Nevertheless, some authorities recommend the use of the tranexamic acid for PPH prevention for women with cesarean delivery at high risk of PPH, such as those with placenta previa. It is possible that the effect magnitude of tranexamic acid for the prevention of blood loss is much higher among women at high rather than low or moderate risk for PPH. On the safety side, the possibility that the antifibrinolytic properties of tranexamic acid may increase the thromboembolic risk associated with it cannot be ruled out given the limited power to detect differences in the incidence of thromboembolic events in the trials, although the data available are reassuring. That is, it remains possible that tranexamic acid may be associated with a significant increase in the rate of thromboembolic events among women with cesarean delivery at high risk of transfusion, such as those with placenta previa, for both cesarean and massive hemorrhage requiring transfusion are risk factors for thrombosis. Therefore, although some authorities consider that prophylactic tranexamic acid in these high-risk conditions may be valuable because it may have a stronger effect, we cannot rule out the possibility that this medication may have an effect opposite to that intended, i.e. no prophylactic effect on blood loss, but an increase in the rate of postpartum thromboembolic events.

This large, multicenter, randomized placebo-controlled trial aims to determine with adequate power if the prophylactic use of tranexamic acid among women with cesarean delivery and placenta previa or low-lying placenta would decrease the incidence of transfusion. It also aims to provide safety data to attempt to determine if the benefits of the routine prophylactic use of tranexamic acid among those women significantly outweigh its risks for the prevention of transfusion.

### Does tranexamic acid increase venous thromboembolism risk among trauma patients? A prospective multicenter analysis across 17 level I trauma centers [^13057b5d]. Injury (2023). Medium credibility.

Importance

The early use of tranexamic acid (TXA) has demonstrated benefit among some trauma patients in hemorrhagic shock. The association between TXA administration and thromboembolic events (including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE) and pulmonary thrombosis (PT)) remains unclear. We aimed to characterize the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) subtypes among trauma patients receiving TXA and to determine whether TXA is associated with VTE risk and mortality.

Methods

We analyzed a prospective, observational, multicenter cohort data from the Consortium of Leaders in the Study of Traumatic Thromboembolism (CLOTT) study group. The study was conducted across 17 US level I trauma centers between January 1, 2018, and December 31,2020. We studied trauma patients ages 18–40 years, admitted for at least 48 h with a minimum of 1 VTE risk factor and followed until hospital discharge or 30 days. We compared TXA recipients to non-recipients for VTE and mortality using inverse probability weighted Cox models. The primary outcome was the presence of documented venous thromboembolism (VTE). The secondary outcome was mortality. VTE was defined as DVT, PE, or PT.

Results

Among the 7,331 trauma patients analyzed, 466 (6.4%) received TXA. Patients in the TXA group were more severely injured than patients in the non-TXA group (ISS 16+: 69.1% vs. 48.5%, p < 0.001) and a higher percentage underwent a major surgical procedure (85.8% vs. 73.6%, p < 0.001). Among TXA recipients, 12.5% developed VTE (1.3% PT, 2.4% PE, 8.8% DVT) with 5.6% mortality. In the non-TXA group, 4.6% developed VTE (1.1% PT, 0.5% PE, 3.0% DVT) with 1.7% mortality. In analyses adjusting for patient demographic and clinical characteristics, TXA administration was not significantly associated with VTE (aHR 1.00, 95%CI: 0.69–1.46, p = 0.99) but was significantly associated with increased mortality (aHR 2.01, 95%CI: 1.46–2.77, p < 0.001).

Conclusion

TXA was not clearly identified as an independent risk factor for VTE in adjusted analyses, but the risk of VTE among trauma patients receiving TXA remains high (12.5%). This supports the judicious use of TXA in resuscitation, with consideration of early initiation of DVT prophylaxis in this high-risk group.
