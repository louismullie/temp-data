## Question

Renal Biopsy from a patient suffering from Membranous Glomerulonephritis will show: a) Crescents b) Proliferation of Mesangial Cells
82c) Deposition of Amyloid d) Diffuse Thickening of Basement Membrane e) Focal Glomeruloscleritis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which histopathologic feature is most characteristic of membranous glomerulonephritis on renal biopsy, choosing among crescents, mesangial proliferation, amyloid deposition, diffuse basement membrane thickening, and focal glomerulosclerosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology of membranous nephropathy. Then, I should verify the classic light microscopy findings. Next, I will review immunofluorescence and electron microscopy to confirm the diagnostic pattern. After that, I need to check which of the listed options are atypical or only occur in special circumstances. Finally, I will synthesize and select the best answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the disease mechanism, because that will anchor the expected biopsy changes. Membranous nephropathy is an autoantibody-mediated glomerulopathy in which immune complexes form in the subepithelial space, activating complement and injuring podocytes, which drives proteinuria and basement membrane remodeling; this is distinct from inflammatory proliferative glomerulonephritides that show endocapillary or extracapillary proliferation [^112RdY2P].

> Wait, let me verify the classic light microscopy appearance. The hallmark on light microscopy is diffuse thickening of the glomerular basement membrane with a "spike" pattern on silver stains reflecting new basement membrane material forming between subepithelial immune deposits; mesangial proliferation is not expected in typical primary membranous nephropathy, and crescents are rare and suggest a superimposed process rather than primary MN itself [^112SaoBS].

> I need to check immunofluorescence to ensure I'm not missing a key diagnostic clue. By immunofluorescence, membranous nephropathy shows granular capillary wall staining for IgG and C3, often with IgG4 predominance in primary disease; this granular capillary wall pattern is characteristic and helps distinguish MN from other patterns of injury [^117DFU4Z].

> Next, I should review electron microscopy, because staging relies on it. Electron microscopy demonstrates subepithelial electron-dense deposits between the podocyte and the GBM, with foot process effacement; this is the definitive ultrastructural signature of MN and confirms the subepithelial immune complex localization that underlies the light microscopic thickening [^116wL9th].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the distractors. Crescents are uncommon in primary MN and, when present, usually reflect a dual process such as anti-GBM disease or ANCA-associated vasculitis superimposed on MN; mesangial proliferation is not a typical feature of primary MN and, if prominent, should raise suspicion for a secondary form or a different diagnosis; amyloid deposition is a different disease entirely and not part of MN; focal segmental glomerulosclerosis can be superimposed on MN and portends worse prognosis, but it is not the defining lesion of MN itself [^112SaoBS] [^111BMr4j] [^116FriPu].

> Let me synthesize and double-check the best answer. Given the classic light microscopy finding of diffuse GBM thickening with spikes, the immunofluorescence pattern of granular capillary wall IgG/C3, and the electron microscopy evidence of subepithelial deposits, the most characteristic and expected biopsy feature among the choices is diffuse thickening of the basement membrane; the other options either reflect atypical or superimposed processes or different diseases altogether [^116wL9th].

> Final answer: d) Diffuse Thickening of Basement Membrane [^116wL9th] [^1157xYEc].

---

The correct answer is **d) Diffuse thickening of the basement membrane**. Membranous glomerulonephritis is defined by **subepithelial immune deposits** that cause diffuse thickening of the glomerular basement membrane with a **spike-and-dome** pattern on silver stain, and granular IgG/C3 along capillary walls on immunofluorescence [^116wL9th] [^1157xYEc]. Crescents and mesangial proliferation are not typical of primary membranous GN, amyloid deposition indicates amyloidosis, and focal glomerulosclerosis is a separate lesion that may coexist but is not diagnostic of membranous GN [^111BMr4j] [^116FriPu].

## Histopathological features of membranous glomerulonephritis

Membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) is characterized by a **distinctive pattern of injury** on renal biopsy, which can be identified through light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy [^116wL9th].

---

### Light microscopy

On light microscopy, MGN shows **diffuse thickening of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM)** due to subepithelial immune deposits [^116wL9th]. Silver staining (Jones' stain) reveals a characteristic "spike-and-dome" pattern, reflecting projections of new basement membrane material between the immune deposits [^116wL9th]. Mesangial proliferation is typically absent or minimal in primary MGN, and crescent formation is rare and suggests a secondary process [^111BMr4j] [^112SaoBS].

---

### Immunofluorescence microscopy

Immunofluorescence shows **granular deposition of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and complement C3** along the glomerular capillary walls, corresponding to the subepithelial immune deposits [^116wL9th]. In primary MGN, IgG4 is the predominant subclass, whereas secondary MGN may show a broader IgG subclass distribution [^117DFU4Z].

---

### Electron microscopy

Electron microscopy reveals **subepithelial electron-dense deposits** between the podocyte and the GBM, with effacement of podocyte foot processes [^116wL9th]. The disease is staged I–IV based on the size and distribution of these deposits and the degree of GBM thickening and remodeling [^116wL9th].

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Histopathological feature** | **Presence in mgn** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| a) Crescents | Crescent formation | Rare | Crescents are not typical of primary MGN and suggest a secondary process such as anti-GBM disease or ANCA-associated vasculitis [^112SaoBS] [^114RDT7U] |
| b) Proliferation of mesangial cells | Mesangial proliferation | Minimal or absent | Mesangial proliferation is not a characteristic feature of primary MGN and, if present, suggests a secondary form or a different diagnosis [^111BMr4j] |
| c) Deposition of amyloid | Amyloid deposition | Absent | Amyloid deposition is characteristic of amyloidosis, not MGN [^notfound] |
| d) Diffuse thickening of basement membrane | Diffuse GBM thickening | Present | Diffuse GBM thickening with a "spike-and-dome" pattern is the hallmark of MGN [^116wL9th] [^1157xYEc] |
| e) Focal glomerulosclerosis | Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) | Possible but not diagnostic | FSGS may coexist with MGN but is not a defining feature of MGN [^116FriPu] |

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **d) Diffuse thickening of the basement membrane**, as it is the hallmark histopathological feature of membranous glomerulonephritis. This thickening results from subepithelial immune deposits and is best visualized with silver staining, which reveals the characteristic "spike-and-dome" pattern [^116wL9th].

### Membranous nephropathy with crescents [^114RDT7U]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Membranous nephropathy is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults and can be primary or secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic infection, or drugs. Rapid decline in renal function in patients with membranous nephropathy may be due to renal vein thrombosis, malignant hypertension, or an additional superimposed destructive process involving the renal parenchyma. Crescents are rare in primary membranous nephropathy and thus suggest another underlying disease process, such as combined membranous and focal or diffuse lupus nephritis. However, in some patients with membranous nephropathy and crescents, the crescentic lesion may be due to a distinct, separate disease process, such as anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies or anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies-related pauci-immune glomerulonephritis. Here we describe a case with such renal biopsy findings, review previous reported cases, and discuss possible implications for pathogenesis of the coexistence of these lesions.

KDIGO 2022 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease — kidney biopsy adequacy and methods: Practice Point 1.1.2 states that "The evaluation of kidney tissue should meet standards of biopsy adequacy", and Figure 3 specifies methods and size criteria. Methods of analysis include light microscopy with "Initial diagnostic evaluation based on morphological pattern of appearance observed with periodic acid Schiff, hematoxylin and eosin, trichrome, Jones' silver stains", immunohistology to "Detect immunoreactants: IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C4, C1q, fibrin, λ + κ light chains", and electron microscopy to "Define location, extent, and characteristics of immune or monoclonal deposits; extent of foot process effacement, and structural GBM alterations". Size guidance states "Usually at least 8–10 glomeruli are needed to diagnose or exclude a specific histopathologic pattern with reasonable confidence", with exceptions that "More tissue may be needed to accurately diagnose focal and segmental lesions", while "In diffuse and global disorders, even a portion of a single glomerulus may be adequate (e.g., membranous GN)".

### The value of repeat kidney biopsy during an atypical course of membranous nephropathy [^112Lc9Z4]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The clinical trajectory for patients with primary membranous nephropathy ranges widely from spontaneous remission to a rapid decline in kidney function. Etiologies for rapid progression with membranous nephropathy include concurrent bilateral renal vein thrombosis, malignant hypertension, and crescentic membranous nephropathy. Given the wide heterogeneity in prognosis, timing of immunosuppressive therapy is often challenging and centers around an individual patient's perceived risk for rapidly progressive disease.

Case Presentation

Herein, we describe the clinical course of a young patient who initially developed a typical presentation of membranous nephropathy with consistent kidney biopsy findings. Given clinical stability, a six month observation period was undertaken prior to initiating immunosuppression. Within this observation window, the patient developed community acquired pneumonia followed several weeks later by a sudden, rapid decline in kidney function requiring dialysis. Repeat kidney biopsy revealed post-infectious glomerulonephritis superimposed upon a background of membranous nephropathy. Immunosuppressive therapy resulted in a favorable long-term outcome with normalization of kidney function and remission of nephrotic syndrome. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the simultaneous occurrence of these two glomerular disease processes.

Conclusion

This case illustrates the value of repeat kidney biopsy during an atypical course of membranous nephropathy. Superimposed glomerular disease processes should be considered during a course of rapidly progressive membranous nephropathy.

### Renal pathology in idiopathic membranous nephropathy: a new perspective [^114tzfZm]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

Histology findings in idiopathic membranous nephropathy (MGN) have been associated with the risk of renal failure, but whether they are independent of the clinical variables at the time of biopsy, predict rate of progression, or should guide therapy is uncertain. Renal biopsies of 389 adult MGN patients were evaluated semiquantitatively for interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, vascular sclerosis, focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis lesions (FSGS), complement deposition, and stage and synchrony of deposits by electron microscopy (EM). Associations were tested between these findings and the rate of renal function decline (slope), renal survival, remission in proteinuria, and response to immunosuppression. Patients with a greater degree of tubulo-interstitial disease, vascular sclerosis, and secondary FSGS were older, had a higher mean arterial pressure, and a lower creatinine clearance at presentation. Although these histologic features were associated with a reduced renal survival, they did not predict this outcome independently of the baseline clinical variables nor did they correlate with the rate of decline in function or with baseline proteinuria. Furthermore, the severity of tubulo-interstitial and vascular lesions did not preclude a remission in proteinuria in those who received immunosuppressive therapy. Neither stage nor synchronicity of EM deposits nor the amount of complement deposition predicted renal survival but the latter did correlate with progression rate. In MGN, certain histologic changes are associated with renal survival outcome. However, the indicators of chronic injury are associated with age, blood pressure, and creatinine clearance at presentation and not with rate of disease progression or initial proteinuria.

Introduction

Primary membranous nephropathy (PMN) remains the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in white adults, representing 20–30% of cases in 50–60‐year‐old patients, rising to 40% in ages greater than 60 years. 1, 2, 3

Diagnosis of MN is based on optical microscopy and immunohistochemistry and/or immunofluoresence findings, showing thickening of glomerular basement membrane with or without spikes and granular deposition of immunoglobulin (Ig)G and C3 along the glomerular capillary walls. Electron microscopy demonstrates the subepithelial deposits and helps in disease classification. 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 Recent discovery of circulating pathogenic antibodies, the M‐type phospholipase A2 receptor 1 (PLA2R) and the thrombospondin type 1 domain‐containing 7A (THSD7A), supported the theory of immunological pathogenesis of the disease and helped to change the term 'idiopathic' MN to 'primary' MN (PMN). 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 Although the description of PLA2R and THSD7A antibodies has regenerated the clinicians' wish to substitute a serum or urinary biomarker for renal biopsy, we are far from coming to this point, as renal biopsy gives much more information than a histopathologically unsupported diagnosis. Therefore, renal biopsy remains vital for diagnosis of PMN and assessment of disease severity. Classification of the disease on a scale of 0–IV, based on electron microscopy findings, was an attempt to estimate disease severity and categorise patients according to renal lesions, although it has not always been proved to be of clinical significance. 14 Also, electron microscopy is not broadly available within pathology centres. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate optical microscopy and define specific features which can be easily assessed in clinical everyday practice, and have the capacity to estimate severity of the disease and guide treatment.

The present study included patients from the Greek Registry of Primary Membranous Nephropathy, part of the Greek Network of Glomerular Diseases. All patients had undergone a thorough investigation to exclude secondary cases; they had a long‐term follow‐up, reaching more than 10 years, and their histological reports were re‐evaluated in an attempt to define parameters which may determine disease progression. Furthermore, we defined specific histological findings which, in combination with clinical symptoms at presentation, may identify the profile of patients who are likely to benefit from immunosuppressive treatment.

### A conceptual framework linking immunology, pathology, and clinical features in primary membranous nephropathy [^115PfSvX]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

Primary membranous nephropathy is a leading cause of adult nephrotic syndrome. The field took a major step forward with the identification of phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) as a target antigen in the majority of cases and with the ability to measure circulating autoantibodies to PLA2R. Since then, the existence of additional target antigens such as thrombospondin type-1 domain-containing 7A, exostosin 1 and 2, neural EGFL like 1, and semaphorin 3B has been demonstrated. The ability to detect and monitor levels of circulating autoantibodies has opened a new window onto the humoral aspect of primary membranous nephropathy. Clinicians now rely on clinical parameters such as proteinuria, as well as levels of circulating autoantibodies against PLA2R and the results of immunofluorescence staining for PLA2R within kidney biopsy tissue, to guide the management of this disease. The relationship between immunologic and clinical disease course is consistent, but not necessarily intuitive. In addition, kidney biopsy provides only a single snapshot of disease that needs to be interpreted in light of changing clinical and serological findings. A clear understanding of these dynamic parameters is essential for staging, treatment, and management of this disease. This review aims to shed light on current knowledge regarding the development and time course of changes in the serum levels of autoantibodies against PLA2R, proteinuria, and histological findings that underlie the pathophysiology of primary membranous nephropathy.

### Diagnostic tests and treatment options in glomerular disease: 2014 update [^114LdPAy]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Glomerular diseases historically have been challenging disorders to comprehend and treat for patients and physicians alike. Kidney biopsy is the gold standard of diagnosis, but the link between pathophysiology and the histologic representation of kidney injury has remained elusive in many of these diseases. As a result, treatment of glomerular disease usually involves therapies that are not specific to disease pathogenesis, such as blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and various immunosuppression regimens. Recent research has resulted in greater insight into some glomerular diseases, leading to the hope that new diagnostic tests and treatments targeting disease-specific mechanisms are on the horizon. We review recent progress on the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of 4 glomerular diseases: immunoglobulin A nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, the C3 glomerulopathies, and idiopathic membranous nephropathy.

### Renal biopsy in patients aged 80 years and older [^116wzdPV]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Renal abnormalities discovered in the elderly have often been considered the result of aging, hypertensive changes, and so on. Recently, we noted an increase in renal biopsies among patients 80 years and older. This is a demographic subset with little or no previously reported clinicopathologic correlation between renal biopsy findings and clinical syndromes.

Methods

We examined our files for all biopsies performed in patients 80 years and older and report 100 patients of a total of 3,227 biopsies (3.1%) from multiple referral centers.

Results

Significant differences in the disease spectrum were found in the very elderly, not only compared with studies of adults and children, but also compared with studies of renal biopsies in the elderly. Crescentic glomerulonephritis was the most common diagnosis in patients aged 80 years and older. Although membranous glomerulopathy is the most common cause of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in studies of the elderly (23% to 38%) and adults (35% to 40%), only 15% of our patients aged 80 years and older with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome had membranous nephropathy. Overall, at least 40 of 100 biopsies performed on the very elderly showed a renal condition that would benefit from therapeutic intervention, and the remaining biopsies provided at least prognostic information and/or ruled out a more severe condition, preventing potentially harmful empiric therapy.

Conclusion

As the population ages, more elderly patients are undergoing diagnostic renal biopsies. This study emphasizes the variance between clinical presentation and expected diagnosis compared with actual biopsy findings in patients aged 80 years and older.

### Kidney biopsy in patients with glomerulonephritis: is the earlier the better? [^113krqU4]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

A limitation of the analysis of efficiency of drug treatment is the fact that response rates have improved over time by the availability of refined dosing schemes and new drugs. However, this does not limit the principal finding of this observational study, because no therapy was withheld and all patients had access to optimized medical treatment provided by the national sickness fund during the observation period. This study has not compared individual treatments within groups of patients with different GN entities and numbers within subgroups are too small for such analysis. While this is a large study, the median follow-up is 4 years, which may not be long enough to observe clinically relevant outcome or progression in diseases such as IgA nephropathy or membranous nephropathy. A further limitation of our study is that only a controlled interventional trial may demonstrate if baseline differences may be accounted for the results seen. However, ethical concerns prevent conduct of such a trial.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2021 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the management of glomerular diseases [^116avUTZ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Membranous nephropathy diagnosis — kidney biopsy role versus serology: "Despite the increasing use and availability of serologic testing, the kidney biopsy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of MN", yet "the high specificity of a positive anti-PLA2R antibody test allows a high-confidence diagnosis of primary MN" without biopsy risks. However, "autoantibodies other than anti-PLA2R antibodies — for example, anti-THSD7A antibodies and anti-NELL1 antibodies — should not be used as the sole diagnostic test in the absence of a biopsy". "Certain situations may warrant a confirmatory kidney biopsy" despite seropositivity, including "where a secondary MN remains a suspicion or if there is a rapidly progressive eGFR decline that is out of proportion to the disease". Biopsy "should also be considered" when the clinical course is atypical; decisions about biopsy in seropositive patients "are more nuanced and should be considered on an individual basis, especially if immunosuppression is being considered". Biopsy can also address "rare cases of dual autoantibodies" and provides prognostic information such as the burden of chronic interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy.

### Repeat renal biopsy in lupus nephritis: a change in histological pattern is common [^1121NSw4]. American Journal of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The role of longitudinal change in sequential renal biopsies of lupus nephritis (LN) patient remains elusive.

Methods

Clinical and pathological documents of 156 LN patients with repeat renal biopsies (412 times) were collected from a database.

Results

The percent of transformation of the biopsy class from reference biopsies to repeat biopsies was 75%. For the reference biopsies that showed pure proliferative, pure membranous, and mixed nephritis, the histological pattern in the repeat biopsies changed in 57.8, 50.0, and 60.4%, respectively. As compared to reference biopsy, repeat biopsy had a higher degree of tubulointerstitial scarring (p < 0.001), chronicity index (p < 0.001) and serum creatinine (p < 0.001). In addition, baseline serum creatinine was significantly lower (p = 0.004), and the time lapse between the two biopsies was significantly longer (p < 0.001) amongst patients who had a change in the histological pattern upon repeat renal biopsy than those whose histological pattern remained the same.

Conclusion

The present study suggests that a change in the histological class of LN is common in systemic lupus erythematosus patients with lupus flare, and the histology during disease flare could not be predicted by baseline clinical, biochemical, or pathological parameters. Our results indicate that when there is lupus flare with renal involvement, repeat renal biopsy is often necessary to guide the treatment.

Membranous nephropathy (MN) — proposed use and interpretation of anti-PLA2R testing indicates that the authors "tentatively propose that these tests be used as follows". For patients with MN on biopsy, "a positive anti-PLA2R antibody test result indicates immunologically active MN", and "In seropositive patients, it appears that anti-PLA2R levels indicate the degree of immunologic activity", with "Increases or decreases in the antibody titer" preceding clinical changes such that "directional changes in anti-PLA2R might indicate the need to start, stop, or change immunosuppressive therapy". They add that "localization of the PLA2R antigen within immune deposits on biopsy also indicates primary MN" for certain seronegative cases, and "Patients with neither circulating anti-PLA2R antibodies nor PLA2R within immune deposits may represent the 20% of patients with seronegative 'idiopathic' primary MN, or instead may have a secondary form of the disease and may warrant further investigation for secondary causes of MN".

### Membranous nephropathy: current understanding of various causes in light of new target antigens [^112mbk4W]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Membranous nephropathy is a rare disease affecting the podocytes, which play a key role in controlling the kidney's permeability to proteins. Membranous nephropathy is characterized by the accumulation of immune deposits on the subepithelial (outside) aspect of the glomerular capillary wall, which causes a membrane-like thickening with the formation of spikes. The immune deposits consist of immunoglobulin (Ig) G, of antigens that have long eluded identification, and of the membrane attack complex of complement. There is no infiltration of the glomerulus by inflammatory cells most likely as the immunological conflict takes place outside the glomerular basement membrane. Despite a common histopathological pattern, membranous nephropathy is a heterogeneous disease, occurring either in the absence of an established cause (80% of cases) or in association with clinical conditions, such as infections (hepatitis B), lupus erythematosus, cancer, or drug intoxication, thus defining the so-called primary and secondary membranous nephropathy, respectively. The discovery of target antigens has introduced an additional layer of heterogeneity as membranous nephropathy can now be defined molecularly by serological studies of antibody or by biopsy staining of antigen. Here, we will review the latest antigens that have been identified in the last 2 years and discuss how these discoveries question the primary versus secondary classification.

### Clinical implications of pathological features of primary membranous nephropathy [^115tPxMA]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our study identified the chronic damage > 50% of interstitium as an independent predictor of kidney progression to ESKD in pMN. The grade of tubulointerstitial lesions "T" should be important in the histopathological report of pMN.

### Clinical implications of pathological features of primary membranous nephropathy [^111wTUQT]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Primary membranous nephropathy (pMN) is the most common cause of adult-onset nephrotic syndrome. The diagnosis of pMN depends on the pathological manifestation which is characterized by the presence of subepithelial immune complexes, diffuse thickening of glomerular basement membrane by light microscopy, and granular deposit of IgG and complement along the periphery of glomerular capillary loops by immunofluorescence. M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R), a transmembrane protein expressed on podocytes, has been defined as the major autoantigen of this disease. The specific antigen is co-localized with IgG4 in the subepithelial immune deposits. Circulating antibodies against PLA2R were detected in about 70% of patients. It has been documented that the presence of anti-PLA2R has close associations with clinical parameters, thus the antibody has been utilized as a good biomarker in clinical practice.

The clinical consequence of pMN varies considerably. If untreated, about one-third of patients undergo spontaneous remission, especially those with absent or low levels of anti-PLA2R antibodies, another one-third of patients progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) over 10 years, and the remainder develop non-progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, if with proper management, only 10% or less will develop ESKD over the subsequent 10 years.

Various risk factors affect kidney prognosis. The established ones include age, male gender, persistent heavy proteinuria, decreased GFR on presentation, increased excretion of β2 microglobulin and increased urinary excretion of C3dg and C5b-9. Persistent elevation of anti-PLA2R levels after therapy is a significant indicator to poor prognosis. However, the findings on histologic variables are controversial. The advanced stage of glomerular lesions detected by electron microscopy has been suggested to correlate with worse renal survival in some but not all studies. Several researches have reported that chronic interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy are independent predictors of progressive renal failure. In addition, focal segmental glomerular sclerosis superimposed on MN has been found as indicator of a poor prognosis, while its importance was not substantiated in a retrospective analysis of a large cohort from the University of Toronto.

Using a large cohort of patients with biopsy-proven pMN, we have demonstrated that the presence of crescents showed undesirable response to the treatments and worse kidney outcomes. In the current study, we investigated the histopathologic features of pMN patients with credible medical records of therapeutic responses and kidney outcomes during follow-up, aiming to clarify the clinical indications of pathological parameters of pMN.

### Clinical and pathological features of idiopathic membranous nephropathy with focal segmental sclerosis [^113K3aXn]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The occurrence of segmental glomerulosclerosis can occur in the course of membranous nephropathy. Pathological changes, such a manifestation of chronic kidney injury, often indicate a poor prognosis of membranous nephropathy. Membranous nephropathy complicated with FSGS is a risk factor for IMN, but it is not an independent risk factor. Patients with membranous nephropathy complicated with FSGS often present hypertension and tubule injury; therefore, when selecting immunosuppressants, nonselective cyclophosphamide should be the first choice, and CNIs should be used cautiously.

### The pathology and clinical features of early recurrent membranous glomerulonephritis [^111PPXHE]. American Journal of Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

We assessed the earliest manifestations of recurrent membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) in renal allografts. Clinical, laboratory and pathologic data were reviewed in 21 patients at the initial biopsy within 4 months post-transplant with evidence of MGN and on follow-up biopsies, compared to a biopsy control group of eight transplants without recurrent MGN. The mean time of first biopsy with pathologic changes was 2.7 months. In each earliest biopsy, immunofluorescence (IF) showed granular glomerular basement membrane (GBM) staining for C4d, IgG, kappa and lambda. IF for C3 was negative or showed trace staining in 16/21. On each MGN biopsy positive by IF, 14/19 showed absence of deposits or rare tiny subepithelial deposits by electron microscopy (EM). At the earliest biopsy, the mean proteinuria was 1.1 g/day; 16 patients had < 1 g/day proteinuria. Follow-up was available in all patients (mean 35 months posttransplant). A total of 13 patients developed > 1 g/day proteinuria; 12 were treated with: rituximab (n = 8), ACEI and increased prednisone dose (n = 2), ACEI or ARB only (n = 2). All patients showed reduction in proteinuria after treatment. A total of 11/16 patients showed progression of disease by EM on follow-up biopsy. Recognition of early allograft biopsy features aids in diagnosis of recurrent MGN before patients develop significant proteinuria.

### Membranous nephropathy: thinking through the therapeutic options [^112NKCbE]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN) remains the most common cause of the nephrotic syndrome in adults and one of the leading identifiable causes of end-stage kidney disease. Prior to considering the best approach to treatment, three important components need to be considered. First, the natural history of the typical membranous patient today; second, the importance of identifying the causative factors; and third, the integration of the current data on the known autoantibody/antigen systems involved in IMN into the diagnosis and management of the patient. Combining this with information on the known indicators associated with a poor prognosis plus new data on surrogate markers that provide important clues that the treatment plan is correct has provided us with a more secure platform for choosing the right treatment for each patient. This already provides a more rational and precise approach to the use of our current therapeutic options. Even today, we can slow disease progression and in the future new approaches and new therapies are likely to lead to prevention of progression or even reversal of the injury in IMN, thereby leading to improved quality of life of our patients.

Prognosis of membranous nephropathy (MN) — risk assessment criteria and antibody dynamics: Practice Point 3.2.1 states to use clinical and laboratory criteria to assess the risk of progressive loss of kidney function. Risk stratification has historically relied on the degree of proteinuria, eGFR at the time of kidney biopsy, and irreversible histologic damage such as interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, and traditional risk factors include kidney function (estimated by Scr), urinary protein excretion, and serum albumin. A decrease in anti-PLA2R antibody levels predicted a decline in proteinuria by 6 or more months, spontaneous remission rates are highest among patients with low anti-PLA2R antibody levels and the opposite is true for those with severely elevated antibody titers, and the commentary emphasizes antibody trajectory rather than an arbitrary threshold (> 50 RU/ml) for risk assessment.

### The value of repeat kidney biopsy during an atypical course of membranous nephropathy [^112WJmiE]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

This patient's initial presentation was typical of classic primary membranous nephropathy with nephrotic-range proteinuria, edema, hypoalbuminemia, and venous thromboembolism which corresponded to the classic kidney biopsy findings. However, the sudden and rapid decline in kidney function during a six month observation period, in addition to a newly active urinary sediment, was highly atypical and raised concern for transformation into a crescentic form of membranous nephropathy. There are a growing number of reports of crescentic membranous nephropathy which are typically associated with co-existence of ANCA and anti-GBM disease (repeat serologies for which were negative in this case) and have a variable prognosis with approximately 40% of such patients progressing to end-stage kidney disease. However, this case highlights the value in pursuing a repeat kidney biopsy when the course of nephrotic syndrome is atypical as it provided an alternate explanation for this patient's sudden decline – the development of PIGN superimposed upon a background of pre-existing untreated membranous nephropathy. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the simultaneous occurrence of these two glomerular disease processes.

Among otherwise healthy young adults with PIGN, the need for dialysis is uncommon and the likelihood of complete recovery is high. This may reflect the influence of kidney functional reserve – the ability of the kidneys to hemodynamically adapt during stress to maintain glomerular filtration rate (GFR). When this physiologic 'reserve' becomes depleted, the ability of the kidneys to compensate to such a stressor may be diminished. For instance, the course of PIGN is more severe with a lower likelihood of complete recovery in older populations where nephron mass is reduced and among patients with additional concurrent glomerular or tubulointerstital disease. Perhaps the pre-existing kidney damage in these patients heightens the risk for severe acute kidney injury due to an inability to hemodynamically regulate GFR with the added disease stressor of PIGN. In the present case, the co-existing glomerular damage from active and untreated membranous glomerulopathy may have restricted this young patient's ability to maintain adequate GFR with the acute stressor of PIGN and the combination of the two glomerular processes led to severe acute kidney injury requiring dialysis.

### Pathologic findings of initial biopsies reflect the outcomes of membranous nephropathy [^112v7cnW]. Kidney International (2004). Low credibility.

Background

A considerable diversity of prognosis is seen with idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN). The initial factors affecting long-term outcome remain unclear.

Methods

We studied retrospectively 105 patients with IMN who had been followed up for at least 5 years, or until end-stage renal failure (ESRF) (primary outcome), or death (secondary outcome). We analyzed the initial clinicopathologic factors affecting primary and secondary outcomes. We assigned the patients to two groups and one subgroup, based on the electron microscopic findings. The groupings were: homogeneous type with synchronous electron dense deposits; homogeneous type with large dense deposits (deep subgroup); and heterogeneous type with various phases of dense deposits.

Results

No differences in the initial clinicopathologic states were seen between the homogeneous (N = 60) and heterogeneous types (N = 45), apart from hypertension and disease history before biopsy. In the homogeneous type, only one patient developed ESRF, which was drug-induced, and remission occurred earlier than in the heterogeneous type. With regard to secondary outcomes, increased age, male gender, heterogeneous type, and deep subgroup were independent risk factors. There were no significant differences attributable to therapeutic regime with respect to primary or secondary outcome in either group.

Conclusion

Our results indicate that an electron microscopic classification, at initial biopsy, as heterogeneous type or deep subgroup type with dense deposits are independent indicators of poor prognosis in IMN.

### Membranous-like glomerulopathy with masked IgG kappa deposits [^113Vm6G1]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

The diagnostic classification of glomerulonephritis is determined by the interplay of changes seen using light, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy of the renal biopsy. Routine direct immunofluorescence on fresh tissue is currently considered the gold standard for the detection and characterization of immune deposits. We recently found a peculiar form of glomerular immune complex deposition in which masked deposits required an antigen-retrieval step to be visualized. Over a 2-year period, 14 cases were characterized by numerous, large subepithelial deposits visualized by electron microscopy and C3-predominant staining by routine immunofluorescence on fresh tissue with weak to negative immunoglobulin staining. Repeat immunofluorescence after digestion of the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue with pronase elicited strong IgG-κ staining restricted within the deposits. The patients were often young with a mean age of 26 years and commonly had clinical evidence of vague autoimmune phenomenon. The clinicopathologic findings in this unusual form of glomerulopathy do not fit neatly into any currently existing diagnostic category. We have termed this unique form of glomerulopathy membranous-like glomerulopathy with masked IgG-κ deposits.

Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) — classification commentary notes that the KDIGO recommendations for MPGN appear at a time of major transition amid significant developments in understanding molecular bases. There are limitations to the current histologic classification of MPGN into types I, II, and III using only light and electron microscopy, and a proposed new system places greater emphasis on the pattern of immunofluorescence combined with electron microscopy findings on renal biopsy. True "idiopathic" MPGN is probably very uncommon and will likely become even more so as additional underlying disease mechanisms are identified.

### Mayo clinic consensus report on membranous nephropathy: proposal for a novel classification [^113E54sf]. Kidney International (2023). Medium credibility.

Membranous nephropathy (MN) is a pattern of injury caused by autoantibodies binding to specific target antigens, with accumulation of immune complexes along the subepithelial region of glomerular basement membranes. The past 20 years have brought revolutionary advances in the understanding of MN, particularly via the discovery of novel target antigens and their respective autoantibodies. These discoveries have challenged the traditional classification of MN into primary and secondary forms. At least 14 target antigens have been identified, accounting for 80%-90% of cases of MN. Many of the forms of MN associated with these novel MN target antigens have distinctive clinical and pathologic phenotypes. The Mayo Clinic consensus report on MN proposes a 2-step classification of MN. The first step, when possible, is identification of the target antigen, based on a multistep algorithm and using a combination of serology, staining of the kidney biopsy tissue by immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry, and/or mass spectrometry methodology. The second step is the search for a potential underlying disease or associated condition, which is particularly relevant when knowledge of the target antigen is available to direct it. The meeting acknowledges that the resources and equipment required to perform the proposed testing may not be generally available. However, the meeting consensus was that the time has come to adopt an antigen-based classification of MN because this approach will allow for accurate and specific MN diagnosis, with significant implications for patient management and targeted treatment.

### Diagnosis of membranous nephropathy with Anti-GBM glomerulonephritis: a case series report [^116dkGAM]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Membranous nephropathy (MN) is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults, and it is characterized by the presence of subepithelial immune complexes followed by complement activation, basement membrane damage, and proteinuria. Fibrinoid necrosis and crescent formation are rarely encountered with MN. MN with crescents may occur as a "dual glomerulopathy" with superimposed antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated crescentic glomerulonephritis or, less often, anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies. The combination of MN and anti-GBM disease has been well documented since the first report in 1974. This dual glomerulopathy likely represents the coincidental occurrence of two separate disease processes, MN followed by anti-GBM disease or the simultaneous presence of the two diseases. Occasionally, anti-GBM followed by MN has also been reported in individual cases.

We report 3 cases on MN with anti-GBM disease and analyzed their clinical and pathological characteristics. The correct diagnosis of MN with anti-GBM disease should rely on a combination of renal biopsy findings and serological testing.

### The spectrum of renal diseases associated with anti-basement membrane antibodies… [^116LKEjD]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Nephritis associated with anti-basement membrane antibodies includes a spectrum of glomerular and/or tubulointerstitial involvement. The glomerular disease may present as Goodpasture's syndrome, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, a mild focal, segmental, proliferative glomerulonephritis, or chronic glomerulonephritis. The tubulointerstitial nephritis is associated with antibodies directed against the basement membrane of the tubules and may occur as a result of drug hypersensitivity. Routine light microscopy or electron microscopy may not be diagnostic of these syndromes. Immunofluorescent examination of renal tissue demonstrates a smooth, linear pattern of immunoglobulin or complement deposition along the glomerular or tubular basement membrane. Anti-basement membrane antibodies may also be detected in the circulation.

Treatment of these syndromes is directed at eradication of the stimulus for antibody production, blockage of antibody production by immunosuppressive drugs, and removal of the existing antibody from the circulation by plasmapheresis or plasma exchange transfusion.

### The pathogenesis of membranous nephropathy: evolution and revolution [^112kaPMi]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The morphological features of membranous nephropathy have been recognized for over five decades, but the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying this lesion in humans have only recently been elucidated. This review analyzes the recent developments in understanding the pathogenesis of the primary and secondary forms of membranous nephropathy.

Recent Findings

Seminal studies have identified several autologous antigens that are targets of an autoantibody response in primary membranous nephropathy. The leading candidate autoantigen is M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) protein. Autoantibodies to PLA2R, usually of IgG4 subclass, are found in 70–80% of patients with primary membranous nephropathy, bind to conformational epitopes on PLA2R expressed in the glomerular podocyte, form immune complexes in situ and induce proteinuria, mostly likely via local activation of complement. The autoimmune response is governed by genes at the HLA-DQA1 locus. The level of autoantibody to PLA2R correlates with the severity of the clinical disease and predicts recurrences in renal allografts (at least in some patients). Most forms of secondary membranous nephropathy appear to be due to distinctly different pathogenetic mechanisms.

Summary

The identification of target antigens provides new tools for diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of therapy in human membranous nephropathy.

### Distribution of IgG subclasses in a biopsy specimen showing membranous nephropathy with anti-glomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis: an uncharacteristically good outcome with corticosteroid therapy [^115wAaEj]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Few occurrences of anti-glomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis superimposed on membranous nephropathy have been reported; most reported cases began as membranous nephropathy. Little is known about the etiology, pathogenesis, or immunoglobulin G subclasses in glomerular basement membrane deposits in these combined cases. The authors report the case of an elderly patient with apparently simultaneous onset of both membranous nephropathy and anti-glomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis who had an excellent outcome with only pulse corticosteroid therapy. Successive renal biopsy specimens showed occurrence and disappearance of immunoglobulin G4 deposits in the glomerular basement membrane. Immunoglobulin G subclass analysis was important in recognizing membranous nephropathy underlying the anti-glomerular basement membrane disease.

### Frequency of renal pathology in Spain 1994–1999 [^116UHLAk]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

There are not enough large epidemiological population-based studies of biopsy-proven nephropathies with detailed clinical and histopathological data.

Methods

The Glomerulonephritis Registry of the Spanish Society of Nephrology has obtained data from 7016 patients with biopsied renal diseases between 1994 and 1999, investigating prevalence, incidence and clinical and histopathological data. Biopsies of transplant kidneys have not been considered.

Results

The observed biopsy rate for all ages is 4.8 per 100 000 inhabitants. A male predominance is seen for all age groups. The most common clinical syndrome at any age is nephrotic syndrome. The prevalence of hypertension is higher in adults and elderly patients. The most common pathologies are IgA nephropathy, focal glomerulosclerosis, membranous nephropathy and lupus nephritis. The mean annual incidence (per million of population) of the most common nephropathies is IgA nephropathy 7.9, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis 6.4, membranous nephropathy 6.2, lupus nephritis 5.6, minimal-change disease 4.8, nephroangiosclerosis 4.6, vasculitis 4.3, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis 3.6 and amyloidosis 3.3. In children, the most frequent causes are minimal-change disease, IgA nephropathy and focal glomerulosclerosis. In adults, the most common diagnoses are IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and focal glomerulosclerosis. In elderly patients, the most frequently reported pathologies are vasculitis, membranous nephropathy and amyloidosis. Membranous nephropathy has increased in incidence in recent years.

Conclusions

We provide representative population-based descriptive data on native biopsy-proven renal diseases in Spain.

### Observational study of immunosuppressive treatment patterns and outcomes in primary membranous nephropathy: a multicenter retrospective analysis [^1132tRFq]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Histopathological examination

At each center, a nephropathologist evaluated individual kidney biopsies. In general, adequate kidney biopsy specimens with at least eight glomeruli were assessed using light and immunofluorescence microscopy. Immunofluorescence staining was conducted for IgG, IgM, IgA, C1q, C3, and fibrinogen. Staining was graded from 0 to 3 (0, negative; 1, weak; 2, moderate; 3, strong). Routine stains for light microscopy included hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, methenamine silver-periodic acid, Masson trichrome, and Congo red. Diagnosis of membranous nephropathy involved identifying thickening and a spike appearance of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) between the immune deposits on light microscopy, along with granular subepithelial IgG and variable C3 staining along the GBM on immunofluorescence. Interstitial fibrosis (IF) and tubular atrophy (TA) were graded on a scale from 0 to 3: 0, normal; 1 (mild), < 25% of interstitium; 2 (moderate), 25–50%; and 3 (severe), > 50%.

Treatment modalities

Treatment regimens were decided according to the nephrologist's discretion at each center. After 2012, treatment decisions were made based on the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines.

All patients included in the study received at least one treatment regimen. The different treatment regimens evaluated are as follows: GC-CYC, CNIs with or without glucocorticoids, glucocorticoid monotherapy, RTX, mycophenolic acid analogs (MPA) with or without glucocorticoids, and azathioprine (AZA) with or without glucocorticoids. Patients with refractory nephrotic syndrome were switched to a different regimen. CNIs were discontinued gradually if withdrawal of these agents were necessary. Remission assessment was conducted based on the last treatment administered. Subsequent and tertiary treatments were only considered if the initial treatment(s) failed to achieve a response or relapsed after the first treatment.

Additionally, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers were started in all patients except in patients with stage 4 or 5 CKD, and these agents were maintained as long as the patients tolerated.

Follow-up

Patients were hospitalized to perform kidney biopsies and followed up on outpatient visits afterwards. Baseline data before immunosuppressive therapy and data at 3, 6, and 12 months, and every six months thereafter were collected and included serum creatinine, quantitative proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated by CKD Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) 2009 formula, serum albumin, and hemoglobin. Patients were evaluated for adverse events at every follow-up visit. Infectious complications and thromboembolism were recorded.

### Membranous nephropathy: when and how to treat [^113oqbGy]. Kidney International (2007). Low credibility.

The treatment of idiopathic membranous nephropathy is heavily debated because of wide variation in outcome. A rational treatment strategy is needed to appropriately administer conservative treatment to the low-risk group but immunosuppressive therapy to those with medium or high risk of renal deterioration. Currently, combinations of steroids with alkylating agents are best studied. Newer forms of immunosuppressive treatment are currently under study.

### Clinical implications of pathological features of primary membranous nephropathy [^111NFBSF]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this large consecutive cohort of patients with biopsy-proven pMN, we performed a comprehensive investigation on the pathological parameters of pMN to explore their clinical applications. The intensity of C3 deposit, the stage of membranous lesion, and the severity of tubulointerstitial injury were all associated with the severity of proteinuria and the level of eGFR at the time of kidney biopsy. Only the severity of chronic tubulointerstitial injury was an independent risk factor to the kidney outcome of ESKD and was risk to kidney dysfunction defined as eGFR reduction over 50%. None of the pathological parameters was associated with treatment responses.

We found that the intensity of C3 deposit, the stage of membranous lesion, and the severity of tubulointerstitial injury were all related to the positivity of anti-PLA2R antibodies. This finding implies that the autoantibody was not only a biomarker for clinical presentation of pMN but also a good indicator for the pathological features. There was a correlation between the granular staining of C3 and the proteinuria and kidney function of the patient, which was not observed of IgG deposit. It implies that the deposited anti-PLA2R-IgG may be the beginning of autoimmune disorder and the subsequent complement activation might be more effective to induce kidney pathological injury.

There are many studies focus on the prognostic significance of histopathological parameters of pMN, but a large diversity exists. The reason may be that different parameters were assessed in different studies. In the current study, we investigated all the pathological parameters including immunofluorescence intensity, membranous stages, acute and chronic tubulointerstitial injury, crescent formation, global and focal segmental sclerosis, together with the clinical features including anti-PLA2R antibodies and different treatment regiments and responses, in a large cohort of pMN patients. Then we found that the severity of chronic tubulointerstitial injury was an independent risk factor to the kidney outcome of ESKD. It was also a risk factor to kidney dysfunction. These results were consistent with previous studies. Although a Parisian study showed that interstitial fibrosis was not significantly associated with cumulative renal insufficiency, when FSGS was removed as a variable, they declared that the interstitial fibrosis showed a significant association with renal insufficiency. In the histopathological report of pMN kidney biopsy, we highly recommend to describe the grades of chronic tubulointerstitial injury, instead of membranous lesion alone. It could provide helpful information to the physicians on kidney prognosis.

### The value of repeat kidney biopsy during an atypical course of membranous nephropathy [^1144VMi1]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

This case also highlights the debate around which patients with membranous nephropathy should receive immunosuppressive therapy at initial presentation versus which patients should be observed. The pros (e.g. expedited kidney improvement, lower venous thromboembolism risk, etc.) must be weighed against the cons (e.g. heightened infection risk, medication side effects, etc.) on a case-by-case basis. In this instance, despite a normal eGFR and appearing 'clinically well' at presentation, the patient had severe nephrotic range proteinuria and had already suffered a major nephrotic syndrome-associated complication of venous thromboembolism which many nephrologists would likely consider as justification for immunosuppression. Perhaps earlier initiation of immunosuppression would have replenished her kidney functional reserve such that she would have been less susceptible to the added stressor of PIGN and limited the severity of her clinical course. Alternatively, earlier immunosuppression may have potentiated the severity of her pneumonia course.

In conclusion, we report the case of a young patient with a classic initial presentation of membranous nephropathy with a sudden and rapid deterioration in kidney function requiring hemodialysis during a six month observation period. The sudden worsening was related to superimposed PIGN likely related to a recent community acquired pneumonia with perhaps reduced kidney functional reserve due to untreated membranous nephropathy. Concurrent glomerular diseases, such as PIGN, should be considered in the differential diagnosis for rapidly progressive membranous nephropathy, and repeat kidney biopsy may be necessary to provide an accurate diagnosis and direct patient care.

### Atypical anti-glomerular basement membrane disease with membranous hyperplasia: diagnostic challenges and treatment variability [^1152eDbo]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

This case report presents a detailed analysis of a 31-year-old male patient who presented with a complex array of clinical symptoms, including proteinuria, hematuria, edema, and kidney insufficiency. Despite undergoing multiple tests, the results for anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies yielded negative findings. Subsequently, kidney biopsy pathology revealed a distinct diagnosis of atypical anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease with membrane hyperplasia. Treatment was initiated with a comprehensive approach involving high doses of corticosteroids therapy and cyclophosphamide (CTX). However, contrary to expectations, the patient's kidney function exhibited rapid deterioration following this therapeutic regimen. The culmination of these complications necessitated a pivotal transition to maintenance hemodialysis. This case underscores the intricate challenges associated with diagnosing and managing rare and atypical presentations of kidney disorders. The negative anti-GBM antibody results and subsequent identification of atypical anti-GBM nephropathy highlight the need for tailored diagnostic strategies to discern subtle nuances within complex clinical scenarios. Additionally, the unexpected response to the treatment regimen emphasizes the potential variability in individual patient responses, underlining the necessity for vigilant monitoring and adaptable treatment strategies. This case report contributes to the evolving understanding of atypical kidney pathologies and the complexities involved in their management.

### Recurrent idiopathic membranous nephropathy after kidney transplantation: a surveillance biopsy study [^113aAEMr]. American Journal of Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

Membranous nephropathy (MN) is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. MN can recur after kidney transplantation causing proteinuria, allograft dysfunction and graft failure. In this study we assessed the incidence of MN recurrence utilizing surveillance graft biopsies. The study included 1310 renal allograft recipients from 2000 to 2006. Glomerular diseases were the cause of kidney failure in 28% of patients and 23 (2%) had idiopathic MN. Recurrent MN was diagnosed in eight of 19 patients included in this analysis (42%) 13 ± 20 months (median = 4; range 2–61 months) after transplant. The initial clinical manifestations of recurrent MN were mild or absent. Urine protein excretion was 825 ± 959 (64–2286) mg/day and three patients had no proteinuria. Five of seven patients who did not receive additional immunosuppression for MN had significant increases in proteinuria during follow up and three became nephrotic. At diagnosis, light microscopic changes were subtle or absent. All patients had granular glomerular basement membrane deposits of IgG but little or absent C3 by immunofluorescence. Subepithelial deposits were observed in all cases by electron microscopy. In conclusion, idiopathic MN recurred in 42% of patients after transplantation. The initial clinical and histologic manifestations are subtle but the disease is progressive.

### Pathology of immune-mediated tissue lesions following treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors [^115Vv31r]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Renal toxicities

Only a few studies have reported findings from renal biopsies in patients with CPI-induced kidney injury. Overall, tubulointerstitial inflammation is the most common observation either alone or in combination with other glomerular pathologies. Biopsy-proven acute interstitial nephritis was found in 12/13 patients with CPI-kidney injury (across a range of regimens). Acute interstitial nephritis was characterized by diffuse interstitial inflammation and focal severe tubulitis, with a predominantly CD4 + lymphocytic infiltrate, and some eosinophils and plasma cells. Granulomatous features were present in 3/12 patients.

Other pathological findings include granulomatous formations with multinucleated giant cells, lupus nephropathy, thrombotic microangiopathy, nephrotic syndrome focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, minimal-change disease, membranous nephropathy, pauci-immune glomerulonephritis and IgA nephropathy. Renal biopsy of sicca-associated interstitial nephritis demonstrates a T-cell rich infiltrate, suggestive of autoimmune interstitial nephritis, and eosinophils, which are suggestive of a hypersensitivity-like reaction.

Administering CPI in renal transplant patients and indeed other recipients of solid organ transplants has been a major concern, with limited data in this subgroup given they are frequently excluded from clinical trials. Similar transplant rejection rates have been reported in both anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 treated patients. Where available, biopsy findings were consistent with acute… with acute rejection, with a mixture of cellular and antibody mediated rejection.

### Update on membranoproliferative GN [^116fcg2H]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Membranoproliferative GN represents a pattern of injury seen on light microscopy. Historically, findings on electron microscopy have been used to further subclassify this pathologic entity. Recent advances in understanding of the underlying pathobiology have led to a proposed classification scheme based on immunofluorescence findings. Dysregulation of the complement system has been shown to be a major risk factor for the development of a membranoproliferative GN pattern of injury on kidney biopsy. Evaluation and treatment of this complex disorder rest on defining the underlying mechanisms.

### Diagnosis of membranous nephropathy with Anti-GBM glomerulonephritis: a case series report [^112xixfH]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The concomitant occurrence of membranous nephropathy and anti-glomerular basement (anti-GBM) disease has been previously described but is extremely rare. However, delayed recognition or misdiagnosis leads to delayed treatment, resulting in worse renal and patient outcomes.

Case Presentation

We present 3 patients with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN), anti-GBM and serum-positive M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (anti-PLA2R) antibody. Renal biopsies revealed PLA2R-associated membranous nephropathy with anti-GBM glomerulonephritis. We analyzed the clinical and pathological characteristics and discussed that the correct diagnosis of membranous nephropathy with anti-GBM should rely on a combination of renal biopsy findings and serological testing. Despite aggressive treatment, one patient received maintenance hemodialysis, one patient progressed to CKD 3 stage, and the other patient died of cerebral infarction.

Conclusion

The simultaneous occurrence of membranous nephropathy and anti-GBM disease is extremely rare. The correct diagnosis of membranous nephropathy with anti-GBM relies on a combination of renal biopsy findings and serological testing. Early diagnosis is needed to improve the renal dysfunction.

### KDIGO 2022 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease [^112zRqxH]. Kidney International (2022). High credibility.

Membranous nephropathy diagnosis — anti-PLA2R antibody and kidney biopsy. Practice Point 3.1.1: A kidney biopsy is not required to confirm the diagnosis of membranous nephropathy (MN) in patients with nephrotic syndrome and a positive anti-PLA2R antibody test. There are currently insufficient data to support the use of anti-THSD7A antibody as a diagnostic biomarker for MN in lieu of a biopsy. In a meta-analysis of 9 studies including 710 patients with MN and 1502 controls, the sensitivity of a positive anti-PLA2R antibody test for the diagnosis of MN was 0.78 and specificity 0.99; a recent single-center study reported sensitivity of 64% and specificity of 99%, and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for specificity is 0.96 to 1.0, which is comparable to the diagnostic performance of kidney biopsy. The added value of biopsy among anti-PLA2R–positive patients without secondary causes was studied in 97 patients, in whom the primary diagnosis in all biopsies was MN. Among 60 patients with baseline eGFR > 60 ml/min per 1.73 m², only 2 had superimposed diabetic nephropathy or FSGS and these findings did not affect care; among 37 patients with eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m², additional findings were reported in 5 patients including acute interstitial nephritis (n = 1), diabetic nephropathy (n = 1), and FSGS (n = 2) with cellular crescents (n = 1). Thus, a kidney biopsy should be considered when there are indications for purposes other than establishing a diagnosis of MN in patients who are anti-PLA2R antibody–positive.

### KDIGO 2022 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease [^114JMxRh]. Kidney International (2022). High credibility.

Membranous nephropathy (MN) — kidney biopsy considerations by anti-PLA2R antibody status: In anti-PLA2R antibody–positive patients with normal eGFR, a kidney biopsy does not alter the diagnosis of primary MN. In patients who are anti-PLA2R antibody–negative, a kidney biopsy should be performed with staining of the biopsy for the PLA2R antigen, and this may disclose anti-PLA2R antibody–associated MN. This can occur in patients for whom the serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence test is falsely negative, for example, because of low titers. Moreover, it has been suggested that antibodies may be absent in the early phase of MN, being captured in the kidney, and becoming detectable after prolonged follow-up. In making a decision to perform a kidney biopsy, the risks of a biopsy must be taken into account. The decision is based on patient and physician preferences.

### Primary glomerulonephritides [^116DQJ6g]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Most glomerulonephritides, even the more common types, are rare diseases. They are nevertheless important since they frequently affect young people, often cannot be cured, and can lead to chronic kidney disease, including end-stage renal failure, with associated morbidity and cost. For example, in young adults, IgA nephropathy is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease. In this Seminar, we summarise existing knowledge of clinical signs, pathogenesis, prognosis, and treatment of glomerulonephritides, with a particular focus on data published between 2008 and 2015, and the most common European glomerulonephritis types, namely IgA nephropathy, membranous glomerulonephritis, minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, and the rare complement-associated glomerulonephritides such as dense deposit disease and C3 glomerulonephritis.

### Pathophysiological advances in membranous nephropathy: time for a shift in patient's care [^112RdY2P]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Membranous nephropathy is a major cause of nephrotic syndrome of non-diabetic origin in adults. It is the second or third leading cause of end-stage renal disease in patients with primary glomerulonephritis, and is the leading glomerulopathy that recurs after kidney transplantation (occurring in about 40% of patients). Treatment with costly and potentially toxic drugs remains controversial and challenging, partly because of insufficient insight into the pathogenesis of the disease and absence of sensitive biomarkers of disease activity. The disease is caused by the formation of immune deposits on the outer aspect of the glomerular basement membrane, which contain podocyte or planted antigens and circulating antibodies specific to those antigens, resulting in complement activation. In 2002, podocyte neutral endopeptidase was identified as an antigenic target of circulating antibodies in alloimmune neonatal nephropathy, and in 2009, podocyte phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) was reported as an antigenic target in autoimmune adult membranous nephropathy. These major breakthroughs were translated to clinical practice very quickly. Measurement of anti-PLA2R antibodies in serum and detection of PLA2R antigen in glomerular deposits can now be done routinely. Anti-PLA2R antibodies have high specificity (close to 100%), sensitivity (70–80%), and predictive value. PLA2R detection in immune deposits allows for retrospective diagnosis of PLA2R-related membranous nephropathy in archival kidney biopsies. These tests already have a major effect on diagnosis and monitoring of treatment, including after transplantation.

We also found that approximately one-fifth of patients with membranous nephropathy complicated with FSGS lesions (IMN-FSGS) were found during renal biopsy. In this paper, the clinicopathological features of cases of IMN-FSGS were analyzed. Then, through follow-up, the remission rates of several common clinical regimens were compared, and some suggestions for the treatment of membranous nephropathy complicated with focal segmental sclerosis were proposed. Finally, the risk factors affecting the prognosis of membranous nephropathy were further analyzed.

Introduction

Membranous nephropathy (MN) is considered as an autoantibody-mediated glomerular disease, leading one of the causes of nephrotic syndrome among non-diabetic adults. The cause of most cases of MN is unknown and idiopathic.

MN refers to the early histological changes including thickening of the glomerular base membrane as a result of anti-podocyte targeted antibodies (IgG) depositions on the subepithelial region of the glomerular wall which may be accompanied by slight cell proliferation or infiltration. Patients with MN usually show manifestations such as severe proteinuria, edema, hypoalbuminemia and hyperlipidemia. Primary MN is identified as the most common type of the disease and secondary MN occurs by causative disease including autoimmune disease (most often systemic lupus erythematosus), infectious disease, drug reactions and malignancies served as approximately 25% of all types of MN. Multiple studies have identified IgG antibodies against a podocyte-expressed protein namely M-type phospholipase A2 receptor type 1 (PLA2R) that can be existed in the 75–85% of patients with primary MN. PLA2R has been identified as a main autoantigen on podocytes of majority of primary MN patients, while the immune complex involve in secondary MN is not pertinent to renal antigens. As demonstrated by clinical evidences, IgG4 subclass participate in autoimmune settings of primary MN. However, in secondary MN, the major antibodies are related to other subclasses of IgG. Clinical studies support podocyte damage and consequent proteinuria caused by accumulation of subepithelial autoantibodies deposition. PLA2R describes as a mannose receptor in human and consider being highly produced through podocytes, alveolar type II epithelial cells and also neutrophils, so that autoantibodies against PLA2R uniquely cause nephrotic syndrome with no serious damage to other organs. Using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or immunofluorescence (IF), IgG4 antibodies against anti-PLA2R can be identified in primary MN patients. The PLA2R antigen less commonly found on the podocytes in normal kidneys or another cases of glomerular disease. Overall, a robust relationship between PLA2R staining and anti-PLA2R circulating antibodies can specially be found at the time of autoantibody measurements during biopsy evaluations. Based on previous studies using delayed serum sampling, evaluation of PLA2R antigen in biopsy samples can be more sensitive rather than serological assessment in order to detection of PLA2R-associated MN. Since antibodies against PLA2R are detectable in nearly 70–80% of adult MN patients with no secondary reasons, the clinical significance of anti- PLA2R can be taken into account as a biomarker of primary MN detection. Although many clinical studies have investigated the role of serum PLA2R antibodies among MN patients, limited data has been provided in terms of simultaneously staining of PLA2R and IgG4 in renal tissues of MN patients, particularly in large samples. To our knowledge, the glomerular deposition of both PLA2R and IgG4 in primary and secondary forms of membranous nephropathy has not previously been evaluated in large samples of Iranian population. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the potential value of immunohistochemical staining for differential detection of primary and secondary MN and pathological severity of the disease.

### Reimagining the kidney biopsy in the era of diagnostic biomarkers of glomerular disease [^114ARa9y]. Kidney International (2019). Medium credibility.

Anti-phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) antibody is a specific biomarker for primary membranous nephropathy (MN). Testing positive for anti-PLA2R has been postulated to establish a diagnosis of MN in the absence of a kidney biopsy. Bobart et al. tested this hypothesis and concluded that anti-PLA2R positivity is sufficient to diagnose primary MN and initiate treatment in a subset of patients with nephropathy. This biomarker, however, does not render the kidney biopsy obsolete, but encourages the application of molecular analyses to renal pathology to keep the biopsy relevant.

### Membranous nephropathy with crescents: a series of 19 cases [^112SaoBS]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Membranous nephropathy (MN) with crescents is rare and, in the absence of lupus, usually is associated with anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) nephritis or antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-positive glomerulonephritis. Only rare cases of crescentic MN without ANCA or anti-GBM have been reported.

Study Design

Case series.

Setting & Participants

19 patients with ANCA- and anti-GBM-negative crescentic MN and no clinical evidence of systemic lupus.

Outcomes

Clinical features, kidney biopsy findings, laboratory results, treatment, and follow-up of patients with crescentic MN.

Results

Mean age was 55 (range, 5–86) years. All patients presented with proteinuria (mean protein excretion, 11.5 [range, 3.3–29] g/d) and nearly all had hematuria; 16 of 19 (84%) patients had decreased estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs; mean serum creatinine, 2.9 [range, 0.4–10] mg/dL; mean eGFR, 39.7 [range, 4 to > 100] mL/min/1.73 m²). Glomeruli showed on average 25% (range, 2%-73%) involvement by crescents. All showed a membranous pattern; 7 showed mesangial and 2 showed segmental endocapillary proliferation. By immunofluorescence, all cases showed granular subepithelial immunoglobulin G (IgG) and κ and λ light chains, and all but one showed C3; 5 showed C1q or IgA. Electron microscopy revealed stages I-III MN; 38% of cases were M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) associated, indicating that at least some were primary MN. Follow-up clinical data were available for all patients (mean, 22 [range, 1.5–138] months). 14 patients received immunosuppressive therapy, and 2, only angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker therapy. 4 patients (21%) progressed to end-stage renal disease, at 0–9 months postbiopsy. Mean serum creatinine level of those without end-stage renal disease at follow-up was 1.7 (range, 0.5–4.1) mg/dL; mean eGFR was 53.3 (range, 16–103) mL/min/1.73 m2. 67% of patients had proteinuria with protein excretion ≥ 1 (mean, 3.2) g/d at follow-up.

Limitations

Retrospective study.

Conclusions

Crescentic MN is a rare variant of MN that usually presents with heavy proteinuria, hematuria, and decline in GFR. The prognosis is variable and the disease may respond to therapy, but most patients develop a long-term decline in GFR.

### Glomerulonephritis histopathological pattern change [^113Ldf8y]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

The other single center study from Kuwait, about a decade after the first one, looked at kidney biopsies between 2009–2014 showed membranous GN to be the most common lesion (12.1%), followed by IgAN (11.7%), minimal change disease (9.8%), focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (9.3%). Percentages were close by where one can notice a rising trend in IgAN.

Kuwait has diversity of populations living together where about 70% of the residents are expatriates from close by countries like the Middle East and South East Asia. However, this cohort represents equal number of nationals and expatriates. About half of the total number of IgAN cases, as well as other histological diagnoses in this cohort where in Kuwaiti nationals. The difference in the histological patterns of GN found in this cohort in comparison to the other two mentioned earlier can not be attributed completely to ethnic background.

Lupus nephritis remains the commonest secondary GN and this finding is universal throughout the world. However, the number of males with lupus nephritis in our cohort is large (27%). Males represent 4–22% of SLE patients in reported cases, with higher percentage for males in lupus nephritis. Acute interstitial nephritis is not an uncommon pathology. There were 30 cases of AIN in the whole cohort (5.5%) and six cases (5%) among diabetic patients, more than half of them presented with unexplained renal failure. One needs to be vigilant about new medications like antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors and over the counter painkillers as these are the common causes of AIN. It is becoming increasingly more prevalent in recent analyses that might be due to more aggressive diagnostic measures being undertaken.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published November 6, 2019 Linear autoantibody deposition along glomerular basement membranes is pathognomonic for antiglomerular basement membrane disease. A negative or pauci-immune pattern is associated with the antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody –associated vasculitis syndromes of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Read the Clinical Problem-Solving Article here. Clinical Pearls Q: In what ways are anti-GBM disease and ANCA-associated vasculitis similar. A: Complement factor levels are often normal in ANCA-associated vasculitis or anti-GBM disease, both of which have pulmonary and renal manifestations. Both ANCA-associated vasculitis and anti-GBM disease cause rapidly progressive crescentic glomerulonephritis. Q: In what ways are anti-GBM disease and ANCA-associated vasculitis different. A: Malaise, arthralgia, and extended illness are more characteristic of an ANCA-associated vasculitis than of anti-GBM disease, which usually does not cause constitutional symptoms. The pathogenic anti-GBM antibodies affect the alveolar basement membranes and lead to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage; these antibodies would not be expected to cause a focal pneumonitis or pleuritis. A: Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with coexistent ANCAs and anti-GBM antibodies is referred to as double antibody–positive disease. Up to one third of patients with anti-GBM antibodies also have ANCAs. Approximately 5% of patients who are initially positive for ANCAs are found to have anti-GBM antibodies. Therapy for double positive–antibody disease mirrors treatment for anti-GBM disease and typically involves high-dose glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide, and plasmapheresis.

Case series suggest that these treatments are unlikely to improve renal function in patients who are initially dependent on dialysis or who have a biopsy that shows a high percentage of glomeruli with crescents, although nonrenal manifestations may abate.

Membranous nephropathy (MN) — remission definitions and monitoring are addressed as "We therefore suggest that current definitions of complete and partial remissions, as currently detailed in Guideline Table 14, be modified to reflect both the clinical (proteinuria) and immunological (anti-PLA2R antibody) status of disease", because "The combination of these parameters may be a more accurate reflection of the disease process than measurement of proteinuria alone", and "Also, use of these broader definitions of remission may help compare the efficacy of different therapeutic agents in clinical trials".

Regarding medical management for immunoglobulin A nephropathy, more specifically with respect to treatment goals, KDIGO 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that kidney biopsy features are often used to inform treatment decisions in IgAN, but biopsies provide only a snapshot of a small tissue sample. There is no evidence from clinical studies showing that patients randomized to treatment regimens based on Oxford Classification MEST-C scores have better outcomes. Specifically:

- there is insufficient evidence to base treatment decisions solely on the presence and number of cellular/fibrocellular crescents in the kidney biopsy. Interpret histopathologic features in the context of clinical features, particularly the rate of change in eGFR

- while it seems logical that very proliferative or inflammatory lesions may respond better to anti-inflammatory treatments than sclerotic or fibrotic lesions, this has not been proven in prospective clinical trials.

### Membranous nephropathy: new pathogenic mechanisms and their clinical implications [^1157xYEc]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2022). High credibility.

Membranous nephropathy (MN) is characterized histomorphologically by the presence of immune deposits in the subepithelial space of the glomerular filtration barrier; its clinical hallmarks are nephrotic range proteinuria with oedema. In patients with primary MN, autoimmunity is driven by circulating autoantibodies that bind to one or more antigens on the surface of glomerular podocytes. Compared with other autoimmune kidney diseases, the understanding of the pathogenesis of MN has substantially improved in the past decade, thanks to the discovery of pathogenic circulating autoantibodies against phospholipase A 2 receptor 1 (PLA 2 R1) and thrombospondin type 1 domain-containing protein 7A (THSD7A). The subsequent identification of more proteins associated with MN, some of which are also endogenous podocyte antigens, might further advance the clinical characterization of MN, including its diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. Insights from studies in patients with MN, combined with the development of novel in vivo and in vitro experimental models, have potential to improve the management of patients with MN. Characterizing the interaction between autoimmunity and local glomerular lesions provides an opportunity to develop more specific, pathogenesis-based treatments.

Membranous nephropathy (MN) — secondary causes and malignancy evaluation — includes agreement to exclude secondary causes, noting that "the main secondary causes in the United States are lupus, HBV, therapeutic agents (especially NSAIDs [nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]), and malignancy", and that "there is a greater-than-expected frequency of cancer in patients with MN, most evident in older patients". The commentary states, "we suggest limiting a malignancy workup in patients with MN to age-appropriate cancer screening unless specific risk factors or symptoms suggest the need for additional testing", while aligning with "recommendation 7.1.1 to exclude secondary causes of MN".

### Membranous nephropathy treatment standard [^114Lpypz]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Membranous nephropathy (MN) is characterized by deposition of immune complexes leading to thickening of glomerular basement membranes. Over time, the understanding of MN has evolved, with the identification of specific autoantibodies against novel podocyte antigens and the unraveling of intricate pathogenic pathways. Although the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab is favored as part of the initial therapy in MN, a subgroup of MN patients may be resistant to rituximab necessitating the use of alternative agents such as cytotoxic therapies. In addition, newer agents such as novel anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, therapies targeting the CD38-positive plasma cells and anti-complement therapy are being studied in patients who are resistant to traditional treatment strategies. This manuscript furnishes a review of the novel developments in the pathophysiology of MN including the identification of target antigens and current treatment standards for MN, concentrating on evidenced-based interventions designed to attain remission and to prevent disease progression.

### Histological grading in primary membranous nephropathy is essential for clinical management and predicts outcome of patients [^113vMMoq]. Histopathology (2019). Medium credibility.

The Influence of Histology in Patients with NS and in Patients with Preserved Renal Function

From the whole cohort of 752 patients, 622 (82.7%) had NS and 590 (78.5%) had preserved renal function (eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m²) at diagnosis.

The presence of FSGS and VH had a similar distribution, and the degree of TA and IF were also comparable between patients who presented with or without NS. Patients with preserved renal function had a significantly reduced frequency of FSGS (χ² = 4.8, P = 0.02) and VH (χ² = 10.51, P = 0.001) and lower degrees of TA and IF (χ² = 47.38, P < 0.0001, and χ² = 54.63, P < 0.0001, respectively) (Table 3).

Table 3
Differences in the presence and severity of histological findings between patients presenting without or with CKD

Response to treatment in patients who presented with NS was correlated with all four histological parameters: the presence of FSGS (P = 0.005) and VH (P = 0.006) and the degree of TA (P < 0.0001) and IF (P < 0.0001) (Figure 3). However, slope‐eGFR was associated only with the presence of FSGS in renal biopsy, and was estimated to −2.2 ± 4.3 versus −1.2 ± 3.2 ml/min/1.73 m² /year, P = 0.02, in FSGS (+) and FSGS (−), respectively.

### Clinical and morphological prognostic factors in membranous nephropathy: significance of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis [^116FriPu]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Progression of idiopathic membranous glomerulonephritis (IMGN) to renal insufficiency depends on various clinical and laboratory factors that have been taken into account in most therapeutic trials based on such aggressive drugs as alkylating agents or cyclosporine. However, few studies have envisaged the prognostic significance of morphological factors and their importance for stratification of patients enrolled in therapeutic trials.

Methods

Records of patients with membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) from 1976 to 2001 from five nephrology units were reviewed retrospectively. Secondary causes were ruled out, especially occult malignancy. Eligible cases were analyzed according to clinical profile, abundance of proteinuria, blood pressure, and standard renal pathological characteristics, including MGN staging, vascular lesions, and degree of interstitial fibrosis on a semiquantitative scale. Renal survival curves from renal insufficiency were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Mean follow-up was 68 months.

Results

Initial multiple regression analysis showed that the most significant prognostic variable was the presence of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)-type glomerular lesions (P < 0.001), and patients therefore were divided into two groups: 42 patients had MGN only (group I) and 30 patients had superimposed FSGS (group II). Group II patients were more hypertensive, and all renal lesions were significantly more severe, with a higher mean stage of membranous lesions, more obsolescent glomeruli, greater mesangial proliferation, and worse interstitial fibrosis and vascular lesions. Renal survival for group II was significantly lower (P < 0.001, log-rank test). Only one remission occurred in group II, whereas 38% of group I patients experienced remission (P = 0.002). We pooled our results with those of three previous studies in the literature, totaling 282 patients (156 patients, MGN alone; 126 patients, MGN plus FSGS). Remission rates were 32% and 12.7%, respectively (P < 0.001). The prognostic value of hypertension was noted in three of the four series, including ours.

Conclusion

FSGS lesions superimposed on IMGN are common and portend a significantly worse outcome in terms of nephrotic syndrome and renal insufficiency. Therefore, we consider that future therapeutic trials of IMGN should include case stratification based on the presence or absence of FSGS on pretreatment biopsy.

### Histological grading in primary membranous nephropathy is essential for clinical management and predicts outcome of patients [^111BMr4j]. Histopathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Diagnosis of PMN and exclusion of secondary cases are widely based on immunohistochemistry and/or immunofluorescent findings, and classification currently depends on electron microscopy. However, electron microscopy is not widely available in every centre, and current classification has not been proved to correlate with disease outcome. 14, 16 Therefore, in the present study we intended to search for a simplified grading in PMN, including histological parameters, which can be easily identified and evaluated in a routine base optical microscopy.

Histology in MN does not include proliferative lesions. Mesangial proliferation is unusual and may act as an indicator of secondary forms of disease, and crescent formation and endothelial proliferation are extremely rare. Besides, tubulointerstitial lesions are widely accepted as the most important findings for disease outcome. 17, 18, 19 We therefore decided to integrate only four parameters in the assessment of renal biopsies, namely: (i) the presence of FSGS, representing glomerular damage, (ii) degree of TA, (iii) severity of IF, to assess tubulointerstitial damage and (iv) presence of VH, to estimate the vasculature implication. Our objective was to review the importance of ordinary histological findings into a routine pathology assessment of PMN, and to provide parameters with prognostic significance and indices to guide treatment approach. Furthermore, we combined the above four histological parameters in a novel, concise score (the FSTIV score), and assessed its significance in predicting response to immunosuppressive treatment and renal function outcome in long‐term follow‐up.

FSGS and vascular hyalinosis were present in one‐third and half of cases, respectively, while moderate to severe (grades 1 and 2) tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis were seen in more than 50% of the patients. Clinical presentation of our patients covered all aspects of disease, from mild proteinuria and normal renal function to severe renal impairment with or without nephrotic syndrome, hypertension and haematuria. Clinical parameters, such as age, male sex, hypertension and degree of proteinuria and histological findings, including obsolescent glomeruli, presence of focal sclerosis and vascular hyalinosis, severity of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, correlated with severity of renal function impairment at the time of renal biopsy. These findings are in agreement with previous results, which showed that clinical parameters with predictive significance were age, male sex, hypertension and renal insufficiency. 20

Idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN) — patient selection for immunosuppressive therapy (KDIGO 7.2) — states, "We suggest that immunosuppressive therapy be considered in patients with nephrotic syndrome AND when at least one of the following conditions is met:" persistent proteinuria "exceeds 4 g/d AND remains at > 50% of the baseline value… during an observation period of at least 6 mo"; severe or life-threatening nephrotic symptoms; or kidney function change where "SCr has risen by 30% or more within 6–12 mo… but the eGFR is not less than 25–30 ml/min per 1.73 m²". It also directs, "Do not use immunosuppressive therapy in patients with a SCr persistently > 3.5 mg/dl (or an eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m²) AND reduction of kidney size on ultrasound (e.g., < 8 cm in length) OR those with concomitant severe or potentially life-threatening infections".

### Diagnosis of membranous nephropathy with Anti-GBM glomerulonephritis: a case series report [^115zJrWH]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Renal biopsy was performed for diagnosis. Light microscopy revealed crescentic glomerulonephritis with cellular crescents involving 24 of 31 glomeruli, 22 of which had fibrinoid necrosis. Light microscopy pathology indicated the presence of crescentic glomerulonephritis as case 1 and case 2. Immunofluorescence demonstrated the coexistence of fine granular and linear depositions of IgG, IgG subclass except IgG4, C3 and κ and λ light chains along the glomerular capillary walls. PLA2R and IgG4 staining was granular along the glomerular capillary walls (Fig. 4). Electron microscopy revealed diffuse podocyte foot-process effacement and microvillous transformation in biopsy specimens. Very few mesangial electron-dense deposits were observed, and subendothelial deposits were absent. There was no evidence of an organized substructure within the deposits, and tubulovesicular inclusions were not present.

A IF staining showing global linear and granular deposition of IgG on capillary loops. B IF staining showing positive for IgG3 (global linear and granular deposition) on capillary loops. C - D IF staining showing strong granular deposition for IgG4 (C) and PLA2R (D) on capillary loops

Based on these histological findings, we diagnosed stage II MN with anti-GBM glomerulonephritis. After diagnosis, the patient received 3 plasma exchange treatments and continuous renal replacement treatment. Pulse intravenous methylprednisolone (500 mg) was administered for 3 days during the early phase of the disease, followed by an oral prednisolone taper regimen (60 mg/day). However, renal function never improved, and serum creatinine decreased to 10.18 mg/dL. The patient died of cerebral infarction one week after renal biopsy.

Pediatric membranous nephropathy (MN) — management and etiologic considerations emphasize rarity in children and tailored therapy, noting MN is a very uncommon histological lesion in children and more common in adolescents, and Anti-PLA2R–associated primary MN can occur in adolescents as young as 12 years. Recently, cationic bovine serum albumin (BSA) has been implicated in rare early-childhood MN (aged < 5 years); in very young children, consider BSA-related MN, analyze immune deposits for BSA, and eliminate dietary BSA if detected. It is reasonable to provide conservative management and to avoid immunosuppression in children with non-nephrotic proteinuria; children with nephrotic syndrome (NS) may receive dose-adjusted immunosuppression including alkylating agents or CNIs, with one option providing less exposure to cyclophosphamide (< 200 mg/kg total dose) using a 12-week regimen of noncyclical cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg/d) plus alternate-day steroids, whereas corticosteroid monotherapy has been shown to be ineffective as monotherapy in adults.

Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) pattern of injury — concept and diagnostic approach clarifies that "Since the 2012 guideline, the concept of MPGN as a single diagnosis or disease has been rendered obsolete" and that "The term MPGN merely reflects a characteristic pattern of injury with multiple different causes; the specific etiologies can be narrowed down by correlating clinical associations with the patterns of immunoglobulin and complement immunofluorescence staining on biopsy". Historically, "the renal presentation was typically one of hypertension, hematuria, proteinuria (often nephrotic), and hypocomplementemia" with biopsy showing "basement membrane duplication, "tram-tracking", and a lobular appearance", and MPGN was "further classified based on the presence and location of deposits on the electron microscopy", but "neither the clinical renal presentation nor electron microscopy biopsy classification were found to be helpful to delineate the underlying cause".

### Recurrent and de novo glomerular immune-complex deposits in renal transplant biopsies [^1141cCKt]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Context

Recurrent and de novo glomerulonephritis is an important cause of renal allograft failure, but estimates of its prevalence vary widely. One reason for such variability is the inconsistency with which electron microscopy and immunofluorescence are used in assessing renal allograft biopsies.

Objective

To determine the prevalence of immune-complex deposits in all renal allograft biopsies performed during a 1-year period and to correlate their presence with clinical data.

Design

Our center accessioned a total of 118 renal allograft biopsies during 1 year from 88 patients. All biopsies were examined by both electron microscopy and immunofluorescence in addition to conventional light microscopy. Patient and donor characteristics were obtained as well as follow-up data for a minimum of 26 months after the index biopsy.

Results

Eight cases of immunoglobulin (Ig) A nephropathy were found (recurrent in 7 and de novo in 1). There were 9 instances of what we designate "IgM-positive immune deposits" without specific features of a recognized glomerulonephritis. To the best of our knowledge, the latter has not hitherto been described and may be part of a heterogeneous group of glomerulopathies. Other unexpected findings included de novo fibrillary glomerulonephritis and de novo membranous glomerulonephritis, the latter occurring at 3 months after engraftment.

Conclusions

A high proportion (19.5%) of unselected renal allograft biopsies show immune-complex deposits both with and without a recognized glomerulopathy. These require both electron microscopy and immunofluorescence for detection. IgM-positive deposits of uncertain etiology are relatively frequent.

Kidney outcomes

During a median follow up of 26.9 (13.9–45.4) months, 8/371 (2.2%) patients progressed to ESKD, 67 (18.1%) patients experienced kidney dysfunction with an over 50% decline of eGFR from the baseline at kidney biopsy.

Kaplan-Meier curve showed that the kidney outcome of ESKD (P < 0.001) (Fig. 2) and kidney dysfunction (P = 0.079) became worse according to the deterioration of tubulointerstitial injury.

Fig. 2
Kaplan-Meier curves analysis for the end stage kidney disease (ESKD) in patients with pMN, with a comparison among the patients with different severity of chronic tubulointerstitial injury. The patients with severe tubulointerstitial injury (grade 3) had worse kidney outcome during follow-up

Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that the severity of chronic tubulointerstitial injury (HR = 61.02, 95%CI 7.75–480.57, P < 0.001), acute tubulointerstitial injury (HR = 6.94, 95%CI 1.65–29.22, P = 0.008), and no-remission after treatments (HR = 14.34, 95%CI 2.98–68.97, P = 0.001) were risk factors of ESKD. The higher level of eGFR at baseline on biopsy (HR = 0.97, 95%CI 0.95–0.99, P = 0.006) was protective factor of ESKD. Multivariate analysis identified that the severity of chronic tubulointerstitial injury (HR = 25.77, 95%CI 1.27–523.91, P = 0.035) and no-remission (HR = 10.17, 95%CI 1.75–59.02, P = 0.010) were two independent risk factors of the kidney outcome ESKD (Table 4).

### Concurrent IgG4-related membranous nephropathy and proliferative diabetic kidney disease: a diagnostic dilemma and therapeutic strategy in long-standing diabetes [^116GnwQn]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this case provides several critical clinical insights into the management of complex renal disease in patients with long-standing diabetes. First, this case underscores the indispensability of renal biopsy for patients with diabetes who present with atypical features, such as nephrotic-range proteinuria disproportionate to the duration of diabetes or the degree of retinopathy. Second, the diagnosis of IgG4-MN, particularly in the absence of classic TIN, requires a comprehensive, multidisciplinary evaluation integrating serological, radiological, and extrarenal histopathological findings. Finally, this report demonstrates that a carefully tailored, low-intensity immunosuppressive regimen can achieve favorable renal outcomes without compromising metabolic control, highlighting the importance of individualized therapy in this complex, comorbid patient population. Early and accurate diagnosis is paramount to guide appropriate treatment and mitigate the risks associated with both complex renal disease and its treatment.

### Case report: a man with untreated rheumatoid arthritis, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, membranous nephropathy and pulmonary sarcoidosis [^117DxyN1]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic dilemma

The constellation of cutaneous vasculitis, positive serum qualitative cryoprecipitate and eosinophilic intracapillary thrombi representing immune globulin plugs in the glomerular tufts suggests an immune complex-mediated disease process — systemic cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. However, the glomerular pathology was incongruent with the pre-existing literature, which suggests that cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis rarely presents with membranous nephropathy. The immunofluorescent stain of our patient's renal biopsy showed diffuse finely granular deposits of IgG (3+), IgA (3+), IgM (3+) with positive C3 and C1Q (or a "full house" pattern) typically seen in cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis. No macrophages were found in the intracapillary hyaline thrombi in the sampled glomeruli. It is also worth noticing that our patient does not have significant impairment of his GFR during the one and half year follow-up, with an overall Cr level ranging from 0.8 ~ 1.1 mg/dl (GFR 73 ~ 106 ml/min per MDRD equation). Reduced GFR is typically expected in patients with cryoglobulinemic vasculitis due to endocapillary proliferative lesions. Based on the aforementioned French CryoVas Survey, a mean GFR of 39.5 ml/min was observed in the cases of biopsy-proven cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis. In addition, despite the "full-house" staining on immunofluorescence, lupus nephritis was deemed to be unlikely given a repeatedly negative serological profile, the lack of typical extra-renal lupus manifestations (e.g. malar rash, photosensitivity, oral ulcers), and lack of typical pathological features on renal biopsy (no signs of extra-glomerular immune deposits on IF, no signs of subendothelial or mesangial tubulo-reticular inclusions on electron microscopy).

### Diagnosis of membranous nephropathy with Anti-GBM glomerulonephritis: a case series report [^112uvj8d]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Renal biopsy was performed for diagnosis. Light microscopy revealed crescentic glomerulonephritis with 15 of 17 glomeruli showing circumferential cellular crescent formation with fibrinoid necrosis. The glomerular capillary walls had spikes on PAM staining. Diffuse interstitial cell infiltration was observed with moderate tubular degeneration and interstitial fibrosis. Light microscopy pathology indicated the presence of crescentic glomerulonephritis (Fig. 1). Immunofluorescence demonstrated coexistent finely granular and linear depositions of IgG, IgG subclass except IgG4, C3 and κ and λ light chains along the glomerular capillary walls. However, PLA2R and IgG4 staining was granular along the glomerular capillary walls (Fig. 2). Electron microscopy revealed irregularly thickened glomerular basement membranes, rupture of the GBM and subepithelial electron-dense deposits. Podocytes revealed diffuse foot-process effacement and microvillous transformation (Fig. 1).

Based on these histological findings, MN stage II with anti-GBM glomerulonephritis was diagnosed. The patient received 10 plasma exchange treatments and a pulse of 500 mg intravenous methylprednisolone for 3 days during the early phase of the disease, followed by an oral prednisolone taper regimen (60 mg/day). After this aggressive treatment, renal function never improved, and the serum creatinine decreased to 4.52 mg/dL. The patient received maintenance hemodialysis therapy during follow-up.

### Clinical implications of pathological features of primary membranous nephropathy [^1123a9ku]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

There are two advantages in our study. First, all the pathological parameters were comprehensively included into the models to explore their impacts on kidney outcomes in this large cohort, which makes the results much reliable. The second advantage is the enrollment of anti-PLA2R antibody (positivity rate and antibody level) as one of the clinical features, which has been revealed as a prognostic factor to both treatment responses and kidney outcomes. The severity of pathological injury was related to antibody positivity. Multivariate Cox analysis showed that severe chronic tubulointerstitial injury was an independent risk factor to ESKD, but not anti-PLA2R antibody which could be depleted by immunosuppressive therapies. Anti-PLA2R antibody positivity and higher level were risk factors to no-remission. And no-remission was another independent risk factor to ESKD. Thus, anti-PLA2R antibody may display its prognostic role by affecting on treatment response. This finding highlights the necessity of kidney biopsy for pMN, despite the diagnosis based on positive anti-PLA2R antibodies. The information on tubulointerstitial injury and crescent formation could be helpful for evaluating prognosis.

There are limitations in the current study. As a retrospective study, the staining of PLA2R in glomeruli was not available, which might lead to an underestimation of the percentage of PLA2R-related MN. Another limitation was the short time of follow-up. For a slowly progressive glomerular disease like pMN, 7–10 years of follow-up is considered appropriate for the assessment of primary endpoints ESKD. Thus, we added the secondary endpoint as kidney dysfunction defined as the over 50% reduction of eGFR. The unfavorable prognostic effects of tubulointerstitial injury were observed on both endpoints.

### Membranous nephropathy transplanted in the donor kidney: observations of resolving glomerulopathy in serial allograft biopsies [^112fFGy3]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

We report a case of idiopathic, PLA2R-negative membranous nephropathy (MN) transplanted via a deceased donor kidney. Changes in glomerular immune deposits were followed in serial biopsies. The allograft recipient had end-stage disease without significant proteinuria from ischemic nephropathy due to chronic heart failure, hypertension, atherosclerosis and presumed diabetic nephropathy. Combined cardiac and renal transplants were performed. Maintenance immunosuppression consisted of prednisone, a calcineurin inhibitor and mycophenolate mofetil. MN was identified in the pre-implantation biopsy of the donor kidney. The recipient never developed significant proteinuria and there was no identifiable impact on graft function. Serial biopsies performed at Days 0, 18, 150, 234 and 812 revealed mild effacement of podocyte foot processes, progressive change from Ehrenreich-Churg Stage III-IV lesions of MN to segmental resolution by electron microscopy, and progressive decrease of IgG staining by immunofluorescence. The findings provide a novel observation of the protracted process of glomerular immune deposit resolution in healing MN transplanted in a neutral host environment.

### Membranous nephropathy: updates on management [^116rjfmp]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Membranous nephropathy is a major etiology of nephrotic syndrome in adults and less frequently in children. Circulating antibodies to intrinsic podocyte antigens, such as M-type phospholipase A2 receptor, or to extrinsic proteins accumulate beneath the podocyte to cause damage via complement activation and/or other mechanisms. The availability of clinical testing for autoantibodies to M-type phospholipase A2 receptor has allowed noninvasive diagnosis of this form of membranous nephropathy and a means to monitor immunologic activity to guide immunosuppressive therapy. Treatment of membranous nephropathy includes optimal supportive care with renin-angiotensin-system blockers, lipid-lowering agents, diuretics, lifestyle changes, and additional immunosuppressive therapy in patients with an increased risk of progression to kidney failure. Rituximab has been recognized as a first-line immunosuppressive therapy for most membranous nephropathy patients with an increased risk of progressive disease, except those with life-threatening nephrotic syndrome or rapidly deteriorating kidney function from membranous nephropathy. This article discusses the major and minor antigens described in membranous nephropathy, the natural history of the disease, and guidelines for clinical management and immunosuppressive treatment.

### Presentation, pathology and prognosis of renal disease in type 2 diabetes [^113hoPNe]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2017). Medium credibility.

In patients with NDRD alone, the mode of presentation did not significantly impact renal prognosis. Patients in the NDRD and mixed group displayed a lesser degree of glomerular sclerosis, interstitial scarring and greater capillary patency on histology, which likely reflect an underlying greater renal reserve. Furthermore alterations in medical management after biopsy may have changed the natural progression of the renal disease in some of those presenting acutely.

In non-acute presentations (typically with heavy proteinuria, a short duration of T2D and little or no retinopathy), FSGS was the dominant pathology in both the NDRD and mixed groups. The prevalence of FSGS in our population was greater than that seen in studies from other countries. The incidence of obesity-related FSGS has steadily increased over timeand carries a substantial risk of progressive renal decline. High rates of proteinuric renal disease (independent of diabetes) have previously been observed in Māori and Pāsifika people, and this likely reflects a high incidence of obesity-related glomerulopathy and associated FSGS. Patients with FSGS in our study were notably more overweight than those with other renal pathologies. A high BMI is also independently associated with the progression of CKD. Proposed mechanisms include maladaptive changes and glomerular hypertension resulting in glomerulosclerosis and podocyte strain.

A faster decline of eGFR has been demonstrated in proteinuric patients in those with severe retinopathy; however, renal prognosis may improve if remission of proteinuria can be achieved. Management of diabetic renal disease has largely been focused on remission of proteinuria through blood pressure lowering and the antiproteinuric effects of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. While RAS blockade remains the mainstay treatment in renal disease in people with diabetes, a large number of patients with T2D continue to progress to ESRD. Trials of novel treatments have had little success. These studies however were conducted without histopathological diagnoses, and it is perhaps unrealistic to expect a single treatment modality to be effective in such a heterogeneous disorder.

In the other studies that have shown a better renal prognosis for NDRD, the predominant pathologies (55%–71%) were mostly associated with a slowly progressive disease course: IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, FSGS or minimal change disease. Thus, NDRD typically associated with a CKD presentation (predominantly FSGS in our population) has a more benign natural history than DN. However, overall survival was less affected by the etiology of renal disease or the severity of diabetic lesions, probably because of high cardiovascular mortality.

Renal involvement in cryoglobulinemic vasculitis

Renal pathology was not included during the development of the aforementioned GISC criteria. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) was known to be the predominant histologic pattern in cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. In a retrospective analysis of the 62 cases of non-infectious mixed cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis (GN) identified in the French CryoVas Survey, 92.5% of the 62 cases had a pathological feature of MPGN, with mesangial proliferative GN constituting the rest of the pathology and none of the cases showing a membranous pattern on biopsy. On detailed review of the renal pathology of our patient, there were rare eosinophilic intracapillary thrombi (Figs. 2, 3), which have been traditionally viewed as a characteristic feature of cryoglobulinemic GN, correlating with rapid immunoglobulin (often IgM) deposition into the glomerular basement membrane. However, the specificity of this feature is less clear in the background of membranous GN, instead of MPGN.

### Paraneoplastic glomerulopathies: mechanistic and pathogenic insights [^112PxVd6]. American Journal of Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Paraneoplastic glomerular diseases are triggered by substances secreted by tumor cells, such as tumor antigens, rather than direct tumor invasion.

Summary

These conditions frequently manifest as glomerular disorders, particularly in the elderly, with membranous nephropathy being the most observed lesion. They often present with proteinuria, hematuria, and/or varying levels of kidney dysfunction. In some cases, the initial presentation may precede the diagnosis of malignancy and can be indistinguishable from the idiopathic glomerulopathies, requiring a high level of clinical suspicion to accurately identify a paraneoplastic origin. Although the exact pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying paraneoplastic glomerulopathy are not fully understood, they are thought to involve an immune-mediated response to tumor antigens in most cases.

Key Message

Recognizing paraneoplastic glomerulopathies is of significant clinical importance as their management is distinct and has substantial implications for the treatment of the associated malignancy.

### An unusual case of glomerulonephritis in a patient with non-Hodgkin mucosal associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) B-cell lymphoma [^115ZDBXS]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Glomerulonephritis in the setting of lymphoma is rare and the pattern of glomerular injury varies widely. MPGN has been the most commonly reported histological type of glomerulonephritis, with the prevalence ranging between 14–25%. Consequently, MPGN may present in association with cryoglobulinemia or monoclonal gammopathy. Other histopathology previously reported includes minimal change disease, mesangial proliferative IgA nephropathy and membranous nephropathy. Concurrent glomerulonephritis and direct infiltration of the kidneys by lymphocytic neoplasms has been reported as well, and the pattern of glomerular injury is similar, showing features of MPGN, membranous nephropathy or paraprotein deposition disease. In one series, Kowalewska et al. showed that 10 (55%) out of 18 patients with renal biopsies demonstrating infiltration of parenchyma by lymphoplasmocytic neoplasms revealed co-existent glomerular injury and suggested that the prevalence of significant glomerulonephritis in this setting may be greater than previously appreciated. It brings to question whether the described associated glomerular disease is paraneoplastic in origin or that of a concurrent primary glomerulonephritis, considering that the occurrence of glomerulonephritis is rare and the morphology of glomerular injury in patients with lymphoma are often heterogeneous. The paraneoplastic nature of these renal lesions may be suspected if spontaneous remission of the glomerular disease follows the successful treatment of the lymphoma. Consequently, the similar heightened immunological activity that exists with lymphoma and glomerulonephritides, resulting in the development of pathological immunoglobulin and immune complexes, could provide a clearer pathophysiologic explanation of the renal lesions observed.

In our report, we described a unique case of severe diffuse proliferative and exudative lupus-like glomerulonephritis in the setting of a recurrence of non-Hodgkin MALT lymphoma. Whilst cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis was considered as a possibility, the absence of clinical and laboratory evidence of cryoglobulinemia makes it unlikely to be the case. While considering the differential diagnosis of a lupus nephritis, it is noted that MALT lymphoma frequently arises in association with chronic inflammation due to chronic infection or autoimmune disorders. Patients with autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE) are at increased risk of developing B-cell NHL, including the MALT lymphoma subtype, with the risk increasing with SLE disease activity and duration of the autoimmune condition. While it is convenient to regard this as due to an unassociated and concomitant proliferative lupus nephritis, it is unlikely after taking into account the clinical course of this patient and the biochemical progression.

Results

Clinical and pathological data

Three hundred seventy-one consecutive patients with kidney biopsy-proven pMN were reviewed in this study. The clinical and pathological data are shown in Table 1.

Table 1
Clinical characters of the patients with pMN

a Antibody level was calculated only for those over the cut-off value of 20 U/mL. Continuous and normally distributed variables were presented as mean ± SD; continuous and non-normally distributed variables were presented as median, IQR; categorical variables were presented as number (%)

Three hundred sixty seven (98.9%) patients presented with granular staining of IgG and 351 (94.6%) patients showed C3 staining along the glomerular capillary walls (Table 1). They all had immune deposit on the epithelial area by electron microscopy. IgG subclasses staining was available in 171 consecutive patients after 2014. Among them, IgG4 deposit was shown in 167 (97.7%) patients and IgG4 dominance was in 154 (90.1%) patients.

The stage of membranous lesion was parallel with the intensity of C3 deposition (r = 0.147, P = 0.005) and the grades of chronic tubulointerstitial injury (r = 0.247, P < 0.001). There were 48 (12.9%) patients having global sclerosis with a median percentage of 5.1 (3.0–7.4) %, and 19 (5.1%) patients having focal segmental sclerosis with a median percentage of 5.3 (4.2–6.3) %. Crescents were shown in 29 (7.8%) patients with a median percentage of 4.2 (2.7–5.1) %. The global sclerosis (7.0% vs. 7.1% vs. 17.4% vs. 12.5%, P = 0.030) and crescent (1.0% vs. 7.1% vs. 11.1% vs. 12.5%, P = 0.005) were more frequently shown in the patients with severer chronic tubulointerstitial injury (Fig. 1).

### The uncertain significance of anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody among HIV-infected persons with kidney disease [^111csmBJ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Glomerular lesions that complicate patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection include HIV-associated nephropathy, membranous glomerulopathy, and immune-complex glomerulonephritides. This case series presents 3 patients with clinically significant renal disease and positive test results for anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antigen. Characteristic histological findings that would suggest anti-GBM antibodies have a significant role in the pathological state of each patient's kidney disease were absent. In addition, each patient recovered without specific treatment for anti-GBM disease. This case series suggests that anti-GBM antibodies likely are related to the B-cell expansion previously described in patients with HIV infection. We propose that clinicians interpret results of anti-GBM antibody tests carefully for patients with HIV infection, considering biopsy before empiric therapy, particularly in a clinical presentation that is atypical for Goodpasture disease.

### Noninvasive diagnosis of primary membranous nephropathy using phospholipase A2 receptor antibodies [^114ku5ji]. Kidney International (2019). Medium credibility.

Kidney biopsy is the gold standard to diagnose membranous nephropathy (MN). Approximately 70%-80% of patients with primary MN have anti-phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) antibodies. We hypothesized that PLA2R antibody testing without kidney biopsy may be a valid strategy to make a non-invasive diagnosis of MN in patients with a negative work-up for secondary causes. The medical records of all Mayo Clinic patients in Minnesota, Florida, and Arizona with serum PLA2R antibody tests between January 2015 and June 2018 were reviewed. PLA2R antibody testing was performed in 838 unique patients, with 143 testing positive. In 132 of these patients, a native kidney biopsy was performed. The primary diagnosis in all biopsies was MN. Potential secondary causes were identified in 35 cases, with the most common being malignancy and autoimmunity. Ninety-seven patients had a negative work-up for secondary causes of MN. Sixty of those 97 patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 60 ml/min/1.73 m². In these patients, the kidney biopsy did not provide significant information that altered management; one patient had a superimposed diabetic nephropathy and a second patient had a superimposed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) lesion. Among the 37 patients with primary MN and eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m², additional findings included acute interstitial nephritis, diabetic nephropathy, and cellular crescents in one case each. Thus, among patients with preserved kidney function and no evidence of secondary causes, a positive PLA2R antibody test highly predicts a tissue diagnosis of PLA2R-associated MN. Further validation in a prospective study is warranted to determine whether PLA2R antibody testing be used as a non-invasive diagnostic test to guide therapy.

### Diagnosis of membranous nephropathy with Anti-GBM glomerulonephritis: a case series report [^113wxy8B]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Immunofluorescence revealed variably intense fine granular and linear staining for IgG, IgG subclass, and κ and λ light chains involving GBMs in our 3 patients. On high-power examination, staining was resolved as an inner layer of linear positivity and an outer layer of fine-to coarse granular staining. There was diffuse granular and linear staining of glomerular capillary walls for complement C3. Immunofluorescence staining for the PLA2R antigen and IgG4 revealed a strong granular pattern in 3 patients. We could not obtain clinical data before the 3 patients admitted to our hospital, so subepithelial electron-dense deposits were identified in a global distribution by electron microscopy, which indicated that MN preceded the anti-GBM disease.

However, there are no precise recommendations for therapy for MN combined with anti-GBM disease, and we used treatment according to the KDIGO recommendations for anti-GBM disease. In addition to immunosuppressive therapy and plasmapheresis, the prognosis is primarily dependent on a rapid diagnosis. The longer the time from diagnosis, the greater the extent of global sclerosis and tubulointerstitial chronicity, and the worse the prognosis. Delayed recognition or misdiagnosis can lead to delayed treatment, which worsens renal and patient outcomes, and increases financial costs. Among our 3 patients, patient 2 experienced nausea and vomiting for 2 days, and we performed renal biopsy in the early phase. Light microscopy demonstrated fewer and smaller crescents and mild tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. The patient received 5 plasma exchanges and pulse intravenous methylprednisolone (240 mg) for 3 days, followed by an oral prednisolone taper regimen. Her serum creatinine decreased to 2.84 mg/dL. However, patient 1 was admitted to our hospital 14 days after disease onset, and renal biopsy revealed a greater percentage of crescents, moderate tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, which have a worse prognosis.

### Noninvasive diagnosis of PLA2R-associated membranous nephropathy: a validation study [^111jks9a]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Kidney biopsy is the current gold standard to diagnose membranous nephropathy. Approximately 70%-80% of patients with primary membranous nephropathy have circulating anti-phospholipase A2 receptor antibodies. We previously demonstrated that in proteinuric patients with preserved eGFR and absence of associated conditions (e.g., autoimmunity, malignancy, infection, drugs, and paraproteinemia), a positive anti-phospholipase A2 receptor antibody test by ELISA and immunofluorescence assay confirms the diagnosis of membranous nephropathy noninvasively. These data have not been externally validated.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

The clinical and pathologic characteristics of patients with a positive anti-phospholipase A2 receptor antibody test at the Mayo Clinic, the University Hospital Vall D'Hebron (Barcelona), and the Columbia University Medical Center (New York) were retrospectively reviewed. Biopsy findings and presence or absence of a potential associated condition were assessed.

Results

From a total of 276 patients with positive anti-phospholipase A2 receptor serology, previously reported patients (n = 33), kidney transplant recipients (n = 9), pediatric patients (n = 2), and patients without kidney biopsy (n = 69) were excluded. Among the 163 remaining patients, associated conditions were identified in 47 patients, and 15 patients had diabetes mellitus. All 101 patients of the final cohort had a primary diagnosis of membranous nephropathy on kidney biopsy. In the 79 patients with eGFR ≥ 60ml/min per 1.73 m², none of the biopsy findings altered diagnosis or management. Among the 22 patients with decreased eGFR, additional findings included superimposed acute interstitial nephritis (n = 1).

Conclusions

In patients with preserved eGFR and absence of associated conditions or diabetes, a positive anti-phospholipase A2 receptor test by either ELISA > 20 RU/ml or a positive immunofluorescence assay confirms the diagnosis of membranous nephropathy, precluding the requirement for a kidney biopsy.

### Immune complex disease with a lupus-like pattern of deposition in an antinuclear antibody-negative patient [^1147gFTS]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis can be caused by a multitude of disease processes and may manifest in a variety of histologic patterns. Lupus nephritis is an immune complex disease, the diagnosis of which requires that the affected patient have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In the absence of SLE, the finding of glomerulonephritis with certain patterns of immune complex deposition characteristic of lupus nephritis has been referred to as lupus-like glomerulonephritis. Immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, IgM, complement C3, and C1q deposition in glomerular immune deposits is one such pattern. We report a case of immune complex disease in a primarily membranous distribution with mesangial, subendothelial, and tubular basement membrane deposits with IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, and C1q deposition in a patient with proteinuria, photosensitive dermatitis, and a positive lupus anticoagulant test. The patient had 3 of the clinical criteria for SLE, thus failing to meet the diagnosis based on the American College of Rheumatology definition. In this case, a diagnosis of lupus-like glomerulonephritis was made after other causes of membranous glomerulopathy were excluded. This teaching case highlights the broad differential diagnosis of this pattern of injury and reviews similar cases in the literature.

### The clinicopathological implications of endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions found in glomeruli having histopathology of idiopathic membranous nephropathy [^1113rUBy]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The pathological recognition of secondary membranous nephropathy (MN) is sometimes difficult, especially in those showing primary idiopathic MN-like histomorphology. The ultrastructural finding of tubuloreticular inclusions (TRIs) in MN always evokes suspicion of their association with underlying diseases such as viral infections and autoimmune diseases. However, it is not clear whether some other underlying diseases are associated with TRI expression in MN. Since treatment of the underlying diseases is the primary consideration for the management of secondary MN, it is important to make out the clinical significance of TRI expression in MN.

Methods

Excluding the patients fully qualified for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) diagnostic criteria, we recruited 36 cases having a renal biopsy featured with histopathology of primary idiopathic MN but ultrastructural appearance of TRIs in glomerular endothelial cells (GECs). We investigated their clinical and pathological profiles and focused on the potential connections with the underlying diseases and treatment outcomes.

Results

One-third of our cases showed no identifiable underlying aetiology. Other underlying disease groups included autoimmune disease (25%), hepatitis (14.7%), potential Helicobacter pylori infection (13%), diabetes (5.6%) and lymphoma (5.6%). Pathologically, patients in the autoimmune group tended to have more heterogeneous membranous deposits with frequent mesangial and subendothelial deposits. While all patients of the autoimmune group presented complement C1q in glomeruli, more than two-thirds of the patients in others groups were negative for C1q. Clinically, the patients in autoimmune and hepatitis groups were younger in age and had less remission of proteinuria following treatment, while the other groups of patients achieved partial or complete remission more frequently.

Conclusion

The underlying diseases of our patients were consistent with the major disease categories that have been frequently linked to secondary MN. The HP group was more akin to undefined groups regarding their pathological and clinical profiles. Since the MN in the undefined group might be the only renal manifestation antedating other clinical presentations of the corresponding underlying disease, a long-term follow-up and meticulous search for aetiological factors are required to validate this assumption.
