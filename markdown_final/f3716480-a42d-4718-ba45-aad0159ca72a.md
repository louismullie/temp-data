## Question

How to correct sodium of 120 when patient has brain bleed

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage severe hyponatremia (serum sodium 120 mmol/L) in a patient with a brain bleed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate risk stratification and whether this is a neurologic emergency. Then, I should verify the likely etiologies in brain injury and how they alter management. Next, I will outline the initial hypertonic saline strategy, dosing, and monitoring cadence. After that, I need to set correction limits and define what to do if overcorrection occurs. Then, I will consider neurocritical care adjuncts, including mineralocorticoids and fluid strategies. Finally, I will integrate special considerations for intracerebral hemorrhage and close with a concise, actionable summary algorithm, ensuring each step aligns with guideline-backed evidence and neurocritical care principles.

> Let me first confirm the severity and urgency. A serum sodium of 120 mmol/L is severe hyponatremia, and in the context of a brain bleed, the risk of cerebral edema and herniation is magnified. Therefore, I should treat this as a neurologic emergency if there are moderate to severe symptoms such as seizures, coma, or respiratory compromise, and proceed with hypertonic saline without delay [^114hmeK4] [^113SHKnQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about chronicity. I need to check whether this is acute versus chronic because that determines how aggressively I can correct. If the onset is unclear or beyond 48 hours, I should assume chronic adaptation and apply conservative correction limits to mitigate osmotic demyelination risk; if there is reliable evidence of acute onset within 24–48 hours, a faster initial correction is acceptable to reverse cerebral edema, but I should still avoid exceeding safe daily limits thereafter [^116cKhyo] [^114C7k4P].

> Next, I should review the likely etiologies in brain injury. Let me consider SIADH versus cerebral salt wasting, because misclassification leads to harmful therapy: SIADH is euvolemic or mildly hypervolemic and responds to fluid restriction, whereas CSW is hypovolemic and requires isotonic saline and sometimes mineralocorticoids. In SAH, both can coexist, so I need to assess volume status carefully and avoid reflex fluid restriction if CSW is suspected [^112JHuzX] [^112JfeM5] [^114pTHrV].

> I will now examine the initial treatment strategy. Bolus hypertonic saline is preferred over continuous infusion for rapid effect and less overcorrection. 100 mL of 3% saline over about 10–15 minutes is a reasonable starting dose, with the option to repeat up to two additional times at 10-minute intervals if symptoms persist, targeting a 4–6 mmol/L rise in sodium to reverse cerebral edema and stabilize the airway and seizures [^113cgXyq] [^114yeaQw] [^113SHKnQ].

> Wait, let me verify the dosing nuance. Some centers use 150 mL over 20 minutes per European guidance, and a recent study suggested 250 mL boluses achieved a ≥ 5 mmol/L rise more often than 100 mL without increasing overcorrection risk. However, given the brain bleed context and the need to avoid overshoot, I should start with 100 mL and escalate only if the clinical response is inadequate, balancing efficacy and safety [^116Rry73] [^112XKmFq].

> Next, I should review monitoring cadence. I need to check serum sodium within 20 minutes after each bolus and reassess neurologic status. If continuous 3% saline is used, sodium should be measured every 4–6 hours initially, with strict urine output monitoring because aquaresis can drive abrupt overcorrection even when the administered dose seems modest [^115WbE1C] [^114jzD4z] [^113SHKnQ].

> I should confirm correction limits to prevent osmotic demyelination. For chronic or unknown-duration hyponatremia, the safe daily rise is generally ≤ 8–10 mmol/L in 24 hours, with an absolute cap of 18 mmol/L in 48 hours; for high-risk patients (alcohol use disorder, malnutrition, hypokalemia, liver disease), I should not exceed 8 mmol/L in 24 hours, and I must plan to stop or slow further correction once symptoms abate or sodium reaches about 130 mmol/L [^114C7k4P] [^116JUkNn] [^114mqwBU].

> But wait, what if the sodium starts rising too fast. I need to ensure a proactive plan: if the rise exceeds 8–10 mmol/L in 24 hours, I should administer desmopressin 2 mcg IV and give electrolyte-free water (about 10 mL/kg over 1 hour) to re-lower sodium into the safe range, then pause further correction for 24 hours. This is especially critical in high-risk patients to mitigate ODS risk [^113ToEcJ] [^113PyTGH] [^116VvNY1].

> Let me consider neurocritical care adjuncts now. In SAH, mineralocorticoids such as fludrocortisone or hydrocortisone can reduce natriuresis and hyponatremia, but they do not consistently improve delayed cerebral ischemia or functional outcomes and carry risks like hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. Therefore, I should reserve them for persistent natriuresis with hypovolemia or difficult-to-control hyponatremia, and avoid fluid restriction in suspected CSW [^116uKo7q] [^115api9e] [^115Riod5].

> Hold on, I should verify fluid strategy specifics. Fluid restriction is appropriate for SIADH but contraindicated in CSW. In brain-injured patients, maintaining euvolemia is paramount, so I should tailor fluids to volume status, favor isotonic solutions when repleting, and avoid large free water loads that can worsen hyponatremia or cerebral edema. If I mistakenly restrict fluids in CSW, I risk worsening cerebral perfusion and secondary injury [^112JHuzX] [^114pTHrV] [^116uKo7q].

> Next, I should review special considerations for intracerebral hemorrhage. Hyponatremia at presentation is associated with higher mortality in ICH, but simply correcting sodium does not necessarily improve outcomes; therefore, my focus should be on safe, guideline-concordant correction while aggressively managing the hemorrhage, blood pressure, and cerebral edema, and I should avoid overcorrection that could theoretically worsen perihematomal dynamics [^1165oQp3] [^111c4qE9] [^114hmeK4].

> I need to ensure the plan is coherent and actionable. Summary algorithm: 1) Confirm severe hyponatremia and assess symptoms; 2) Assume chronic if onset unclear; 3) Give 3% saline 100 mL bolus over 10–15 minutes and repeat up to two times if needed to achieve a 4–6 mmol/L rise; 4) Monitor sodium every 20 minutes initially and track urine output; 5) Limit total correction to ≤ 8–10 mmol/L in 24 hours and ≤ 18 mmol/L in 48 hours, with tighter limits in high-risk patients; 6) Use desmopressin and electrolyte-free water if overcorrection occurs; 7) Address etiology with volume-guided therapy and consider mineralocorticoids in SAH with persistent natriuresis; 8) Continue close neurologic and laboratory monitoring until stable [^113SHKnQ] [^114C7k4P] [^113ToEcJ].

For a patient with a brain bleed and sodium of 120 mmol/L, **treat symptomatic hyponatremia with 3% hypertonic saline** [^114yeaQw] to raise sodium by 4–6 mmol/L [^113SHKnQ] rapidly, then slow correction to ≤ 8 mmol/L in 24 hours to avoid osmotic demyelination [^117M8SDu]. Use **bolus dosing** (100 mL over 10 minutes, repeat up to three times) [^113cgXyq] for faster, controlled correction with less overcorrection than continuous infusion [^113SHKnQ]. Monitor sodium every 2–4 hours initially, then every 6 hours; if overcorrection occurs, administer desmopressin and give free water to relower sodium [^113ToEcJ]. Avoid fluid restriction in cerebral salt wasting; consider fludrocortisone for persistent natriuresis [^116uKo7q] [^112kNVG4].

## Clinical significance of hyponatremia in brain bleed patients

Hyponatremia in brain bleed patients is common and associated with **increased morbidity and mortality** [^111c4qE9], including cerebral edema, seizures, and neurological deterioration [^114hmeK4]. Prompt, controlled correction is essential to prevent these complications [^113SHKnQ].

---

## Initial assessment and monitoring

- **Neurological assessment**: Evaluate for seizures, altered mental status, and signs of cerebral edema or herniation [^113cgXyq].

- **Laboratory monitoring**: Measure serum sodium every 2–4 hours initially, then every 6 hours once stable [^notfound].

- **Volume status assessment**: Determine if the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic to guide therapy [^114hmeK4].

---

## Indications for rapid correction

Rapid correction is indicated for **severe symptomatic hyponatremia** (seizures, coma, or respiratory arrest) [^114hmeK4]. The initial target is a **4–6 mmol/L rise in serum sodium** within the first few hours to rapidly reduce cerebral edema and intracranial pressure [^113SHKnQ].

---

## Recommended treatment: hypertonic saline

Hypertonic saline (3% NaCl) is the **cornerstone of therapy** for severe symptomatic hyponatremia in brain bleed patients [^112ph1vU].

---

### Dosage and administration

- **Bolus dosing**: 100 mL of 3% NaCl over 10 minutes, repeated up to three times if necessary, targeting a 4–6 mmol/L rise in sodium [^113cgXyq].

- **Continuous infusion**: If boluses are insufficient, initiate a continuous infusion of 3% NaCl at 0.5–1 mL/kg/h, titrated to response [^notfound].

- **Monitoring**: Check serum sodium every 2–4 hours initially, then every 6 hours once stable [^111czwib].

---

### Advantages of bolus dosing

Bolus dosing achieves **faster correction** than continuous infusion and is associated with less overcorrection and improved clinical outcomes [^113SHKnQ] [^114yeaQw].

---

## Risks and complications of rapid correction

Rapid correction of hyponatremia carries a **risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS)** [^111fLWER], a rare but severe neurological complication. To minimize this risk, limit total correction to ≤ 8 mmol/L in 24 hours [^117M8SDu].

---

## Management of overcorrection

If sodium rises too quickly, **take immediate action**:

- **Desmopressin**: Administer 2 mcg IV to halt further correction [^113ToEcJ].

- **Free water administration**: Give 10 mL/kg of electrolyte-free water (e.g. D5W) over 1 hour to relower sodium [^113PyTGH].

- **Close monitoring**: Check sodium every 2–4 hours until stable [^114jzD4z].

---

## Special considerations in brain bleed patients

- **Cerebral salt wasting (CSW)**: Common after SAH/ICH; treat with isotonic saline and consider fludrocortisone [^116uKo7q] [^112kNVG4].

- **Fluid restriction**: Avoid in CSW, as it can worsen hypovolemia and cerebral perfusion [^114pTHrV].

- **Mineralocorticoids**: Fludrocortisone or hydrocortisone can reduce natriuresis and stabilize sodium [^116uKo7q] [^112kNVG4].

---

## Summary of recommendations

1. Assess neurological status and volume status
2. - Administer 3% NaCl boluses (100 mL over 10 min, repeat up to three times) [^notfound]
3. - Target initial rise of 4–6 mmol/L [^113SHKnQ]
4. - Limit total correction to ≤ 8 mmol/L in 24 hours [^115yzmgu]
5. - Monitor sodium every 2–4 hours initially, then every 6 hours [^notfound]
6. - If overcorrection, administer desmopressin and free water [^114EiBw4]
7. - Treat underlying cause (e.g. CSW with fludrocortisone) [^116uKo7q]

---

Correcting sodium in brain bleed patients with hyponatremia requires **careful balance** between rapid initial correction to prevent cerebral edema and slow, controlled correction to avoid osmotic demyelination. Hypertonic saline boluses are preferred, with close monitoring and proactive management of overcorrection [^113SHKnQ].

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage — hyponatremia monitoring, treatment triggers, and practice patterns: The participants agreed that they all monitor sodium concentration carefully and take measures to avoid or treat hyponatremia. Generally the trigger used for treatment is a sodium concentration of < 135 mEq/l or if neurological deterioration is attributed to falling sodium concentration. Current practice varied somewhat with free water restriction, hypertonic saline solutions and fludrocortisone being most commonly used. Several participants reported anecdotally, that mildly hypertonic solutions (1.25–2.0% saline) were effective in managing mild hyponatremia when it occurred. Others routinely administered fludrocortisone.

Introduction

For years, the maintenance of normal or supranormal serum sodium (Na) concentrations has been believed to be beneficial in brain injuries. Recently published guidelines for cerebral trauma recommend the use of hypertonic saline to achieve hypernatremia for the management of increased intracranial pressure and these standards are generally practiced across most diseases in neurocritical care including stroke, hemorrhage and tumors. Severe hyponatremia has long been known to be detrimental, but objective evidence for the harm of mild hyponatremia as a secondary injury has been scarce.

Description Of Case

In this case report, we describe a child with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage who had a sudden, inadvertent decrease in serum Na (128 meq/l) that was associated with a deterioration of her neurological examination and evidence of early transtentorial herniation on emergent brain CT scan. These findings were quickly reversed after the serum Na was corrected.

Discussion

This report emphasizes that close monitoring of serum Na and osmolarity in acute head injured children is important, and provides evidence that alterations of these parameters is a substantial risk for cerebral edema in children with evolving brain injuries and briefly reviews the literature regarding the risks of hyponatremia in children.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^116cKhyo]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Biochemical and symptomatic severity are not always well correlated, as patients with chronic hyponatremia may have very low serum sodium concentrations with minimal symptoms due to cerebral adaptation, yet patients with an acute precipitous fall in serum sodium, even to concentrations above 120 mmol/L, may present with severe symptoms. The presence of severe symptoms should prompt treatment with careful bolus hypertonic saline aiming for an increment in serum sodium of 4 to 6 mmol, based on clinical improvements seen in published cases. There is clinical evidence to support a 50% reduction in ICP with a pNa increase of this magnitude. A retrospective observational study of 68 patients with transtentorial herniation due to cerebral hemorrhage, stroke, or tumor but with normal serum sodium concentration (mean pNa 140 mmol/L), were administered a small, 30- to 60-mL bolus of very concentrated hypertonic saline (NaCl 23.4%, equivalent Na + to 240 mL of 3% NaCl). ICP reduced from 23 to 11 mm Hg over 24 hours, and reversal of herniation occurred in 75% of cases, predicted by a 5-mmol/L or greater increase in pNa (P = 0.001). There was no control group comparison, however — and this was not a hyponatremic cohort. Collectively, however, these studies illustrate the rationale for active intervention with hypertonic saline in symptomatic hyponatremia to reduce ICP and improve morbidity and mortality.

In patients definitively known to have acute hyponatremia, it is thought that pNa can be corrected (or allowed to correct) more rapidly, as the second phase of cerebral adaptation to low pNa (depletion of organic osmolytes) has not yet occurred (see Fig. 3). In practice, however, when a patient presents to hospital for care, it is often unclear whether their hyponatremia is acute or chronic. Even if there is a compelling history of water intoxication, endurance exercise with hypotonic fluid consumption, or recreational 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA/"ecstasy") use that supports acuity, unless a reliable normal pNa measurement within the previous 24 hours it is available, it is not possible to confirm. While symptom-defined severe hyponatremia should always prompt treatment with hypertonic saline to achieve the initial small increment in serum sodium described earlier, in most cases it is necessary to assume chronicity and adopt conservative serum sodium correction targets from that point to avoid the risk of ODS (see "Osmotic Demyelination Syndrome").

### NaCl 3% bolus therapy as emergency treatment for severe hyponatremia: comparison of 100 mL vs 250 mL [^112XKmFq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Context

The aim of initial treatment of severe hyponatremia is to rapidly increase serum sodium to reduce the complications of cerebral edema. The optimal strategy to achieve this goal safely is still under debate.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety of 100 and 250 mL NaCl 3% rapid bolus therapy as initial treatment of severe hypotonic hyponatremia.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of patients admitted to a teaching hospital in The Netherlands between 2017 and 2019. The patients were 130 adults with severe hypotonic hyponatremia, defined as serum sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L. A bolus of either 100 mL (n = 63) or 250 mL (n = 67) NaCl 3% was the initial treatment. Successful treatment was defined as a rise in serum sodium ≥ 5 mmol/L within the first 4 hours after bolus therapy. Overcorrection of serum sodium was defined as an increase of more than 10 mmol/L in the first 24 hours.

Results

The percentage of patients with a rise in serum sodium ≥ 5 mmol/L within 4 hours was 32% and 52% after a bolus of 100 and 250 mL, respectively (P = 0.018). Overcorrection of serum sodium was observed after a median of 13 hours (range 9–17 hours) in 21% of patients in both treatment groups (P = 0.971). Osmotic demyelination syndrome did not occur.

Conclusion

Initial treatment of severe hypotonic hyponatremia is more effective with a NaCl 3% bolus of 250 mL than of 100 mL and does not increase the risk of overcorrection.

10. 1001/archinternmed.
2007. 126 © 2025 Hyponatremia following cerebral trauma has commonly been attributed to the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. Cerebral salt wasting can lead to a similar clinical picture, for which treatment is not well defined. Report of a Case. A 75-year-old man presented with a 3-week history of worsening ataxia following blunt head trauma in a motor vehicle crash 1 month earlier.

His history included uncomplicated type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, managed with rosiglitazone, 4 mg/d, and ramipril, 2. 5 mg/d. The patient was confused and had marked truncal ataxia. Central venous pressure was low at 3 mm Hg, indicating volume depletion. Euglycemia and normotension were maintained following the discontinuation of both rosiglitazone and ramipril therapies. A computed tomographic scan of the brain demonstrated acute and chronic bilateral frontoparietal subdural hematomas measuring up to 22 mm in the maximum dimension, with shift of the septum pellucidum to the right by 5 mm and subfalcine herniation. Findings from serum biochemical analysis demonstrated a serum sodium level of 123 mEq/L; an osmolality of 259 mOsm/kg, a uric acid level of 0. 34 mg/dL, a urinary sodium level of 236 mEq/L; and a urinary osmolality of 825 mOsm/kg. Hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism, and liver and renal failure were excluded from serum biochemical analysis. Findings from serum biochemical analysis performed 1 month prior immediately following the motor vehicle crash were normal. Bilateral burr holes were made for drainage, with subsequent reduction in size of bilateral hematomas. Hyponatremia was corrected with 3% hypertonic saline. Withdrawal of hypertonic saline 3 days later led to a decrease in serum sodium level to 120 mEq/L. Hypertonic saline was reintroduced to maintain a serum sodium level above 125 mEq/L. A repeated attempt to withdraw hypertonic saline 3 days later again led to a fall in serum sodium level with persistent inappropriate natriuresis. N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide level was not elevated.

Plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration measured on day 6 were undetectable. Treatment with fludrocortisone was commenced initially at 0. 2 mg/d and later reduced to
0. 1 mg/d, and a rapid reduction in natriuresis and restoration of serum sodium level to the normal range was observed. Comment. Both CSW and SIADH are associated with hyponatremia, hypouricemia, and inappropriately high urinary sodium concentration and osmolality. The only distinguishing features are signs of volume depletion. It has been postulated that CSW is a centrally mediated process, possibly via secretion of natruretic peptides1 or disrupted sympathetic neural input to the proximal tubules. 2 Serum N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide level was not elevated in our case.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^11168QRU]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Potential reasons for a less pronounced effect on mortality in SIAD (if this is a true effect confirmed in future studies) are unclear and remain speculative. It has been shown that paradoxically, mortality rate seems to be lower in patients with pronounced hyponatremia (< 120 mmol/L) compared to patients with a milder hyponatremia. Interestingly, the degree of hyponatremia varies according to hyponatremia etiology, and notably, SIAD seems to predispose to very low sodium concentrations. In patients with pNa below 120 mmol/L, the therapeutic approach has been shown to be different, with a higher percentage of ICU admission and of hypertonic saline administration as well as a more rapid initial sodium correction rate. This could possibly explain the lower mortality rates but higher ICU admission rates in these patients. However, since exact sodium concentrations were not known, this remains speculative. An alternative explanation for the "protective" role of SIAD might be the exact opposite, that is, that patients with SIAD had milder hyponatremia. Finally, the severity of the intercurrent diseases, medical complications during hospitalization, or the proportion of patients receiving palliative care might not have been distributed in a comparable way in both groups.

Regardless of cause, hyponatremia as a whole is associated with increased mortality, and timely diagnosis and treatment are important in improving clinical outcomes.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^111fLWER]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyponatremia:

- **Definition**: Hyponatremia an electrolyte disorder characterized by low serum sodium concentration, and is typically defined as a serum sodium of < 135 mEq/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: Causes of hyponatremia include increased water intake (psychogenic polydipsia), low dietary solute intake (tea and toast diet), decreased water excretion secondary to elevated plasma ADH levels (volume depletion, SIADH, severe hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency), and expansion of plasma volume in the context of edematous states.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyponatremia in the general population of the US is 1.72%.
- **Disease course**: Treatment of hyponatremia requires careful attention to avoid overly rapid correction of serum sodium, which can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome, permanent neurological impairment, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 40% of patients with osmotic demyelination syndrome recover fully, whereas 25% have persistent neurological deficits. Mortality associated with osmotic demyelination syndrome is approximately 6%.

### Performance characteristics of a sliding-scale hypertonic saline infusion protocol for the treatment of acute neurologic hyponatremia [^114Fvvw4]. Neurocritical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Hypertonic saline (3% NaCl) infusions can be used to treat acute neurologic hyponatremia (ANH) in critically ill patients with neurological and neurosurgical disorders such as subarachnoid hemorrhage. Adjustments in the rate of hypertonic saline infusions to treat ANH are needed to achieve a goal sodium range and are usually made on an empiric basis. To date, no data are available to determine how reliably such adjustments achieve stable, normal serum sodium concentrations or how often iatrogenic hypernatremia occurs during the course of treatment with hypertonic saline.

Methods

We have instituted a standardized sliding-scale hypertonic saline protocol to minimize patient-to-patient variability of hypertonic saline administration and to attempt to achieve safe rates of sodium correction and stable maintenance of serum sodium concentration with minimal overshoot. Here, we present a retrospective analysis of the performance characteristics of our standardized hypertonic saline protocol over a 1-year period, in 49 patients.

Results

The mean rate of initial sodium correction was 0.44 ± 0.36 (mEq/l)/h. During the maintenance infusion phase, 84.3 ± 17.8% of the time was spent in goal range (Na 136–145 mEq/l), 14.9 ± 18.1% of the time was spent in mild undershoot (Na 130–135 mEq/l), and 0.7 ± 3.1% of the time was spent in overshoot (Na > 145 mEq/l). No adverse events attributable to infusion of hypertonic saline were encountered.

Conclusion

Our hypertonic saline sliding-scale protocol for treatment of ANH can be used reliably and achieves normal sodium concentrations in a safe manner with minimal overshoot.

### Sodium and its impact on outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in patients with and without delayed cerebral ischemia [^115jcdJz]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study in a large cohort of aSAH patients shows that sodium levels, hyponatremia and fluctuations of sodium levels are not predictive of the development of DCI. However, higher sodium levels, hypernatremia and greater sodium fluctuations were associated with poor clinical outcome, irrespective of the occurrence of DCI.

Since 1985, the importance of volemic status and dysnatremia has been emphasized as a possible risk factor for DCI, leading to the recommendation of maintaining euvolemia and preventing/treating hyponatremia to prevent DCI. Thus, the use of fludrocortisone or hypertonic saline was deemed reasonable, although evidence is weak. Although hyponatremia is one of the most common electrolyte disturbances after aSAH, guidelines vary widely on management of dysnatremia and often lack recommendations on electrolyte monitoring (,–), perhaps resulting in practice variation across hospitals worldwide. Despite these recommendations, studies still find that hyponatremia occurs more often in DCI patients, but with conflicting associations between hyponatremia, sodium fluctuations, and DCI (,–). Significantly lower sodium levels, within the hyponatremia and normal range, and natriuresis were observed more in DCI patients than no-DCI patients. Similarly, evidence regarding poor outcome and sodium is conflicting; some find significant associations between poor outcome, hyponatremia, hypernatremia or both, whereas others do not find any significant associations. Furthermore, a recent randomized trial showed that continuous infusion of 20% hypertonic saline for a minimum of 48 hours did not have a significant effect on clinical outcome than standard care after moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). This is despite the observation that patients in the intervention group had higher blood osmolality and sodium levels than the control group. Hereby suggesting a lack of effect of sodium on clinical outcome. However, only moderate to severe TBI patients were included and sodium levels were measured only the first 5 days, while we demonstrate that sodium levels start to differ around day 4 after aSAH between patients with poor and good outcome. Additionally, the power of the trial was limited, the CIs for the findings were wide and the pathophysiological mechanisms triggered by aneurysmal rupture is essentially different from TBI, which makes it difficult to extrapolate these results to aSAH. Interestingly, recent studies consistently show an association between sodium fluctuations and poor outcome, and patients with poor outcome have significantly higher mean sodium levels than good outcome, which is in line with our findings. In previous reports, sodium and free water disorders were more often observed in patients with a ruptured ACOM aneurysm; however, we did not find differences between these patients. Comparison of different studies is virtually impossible due to heterogeneity in the definition of hyponatremia and sodium fluctuations, methodology, frequency/timing of sampling, without regards to the day of DCI onset and the timing of clinical outcome assessment. Similarly, there is significant variation in fluid management across hospitals. Of note, it is well known that fluid balance does not reflect volemic status adequately and higher fluid input, besides fluid restriction, is also associated with DCI and poor outcome. Vergouw et al even showed that significant reduction of fluid input was possible while maintaining adequate cardiac preload and thus CBF. This suggests that current approaches for assessing and maintaining optimal volemic status in aSAH need to be further optimized.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^115yzmgu]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Analytical limitations of serum sodium measurements must also be considered when setting correction goals and limits. Because of unavoidable imprecision, a laboratory report indicating that the serum sodium has increased by 8 mmol/L might, in reality, reflect an increase of 10 mmol/L. For that reason, when planning therapy, the targeted rate of correction should not be too close to rates that can result in patient harm.

Administration of desmopressin (a synthetic antidiuretic hormone) either after or in anticipation of a water diuresis has been used to reverse or prevent inadvertent excessive correction of hyponatremia. Both the European Clinical Practice Guidelines and the US/Irish expert panel suggest that relowering of the serum sodium should be considered if correction limits have been exceeded. However, the approach should depend on the relative risks of injury from excessive correction. The strongest case for relowering the serum sodium to prevent osmotic demyelination can be made in patients at very high risk of developing the disorder (those with a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L or patients with heavy alcohol use, severe hypokalemia, malnutrition, or advanced liver disease). It would be reasonable to relower the serum sodium in such patients if it has increased by > 8 mmol/L in < 24 hours. On the other hand, patients who have rapidly become hyponatremic due to self-induced water intoxication related to psychosis or endurance exercise often develop a spontaneous water diuresis that rapidly brings the serum sodium back to normal; because their risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome is extremely low, the US/Irish expert panel deemed efforts to prevent or reverse excessive correction to be unnecessary. Similarly, in most patients presenting with a sodium > 120 mmol/L, relowering the serum sodium after correction by > 8 mmol/L or even > 12 mmol/L was not recommended. In patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L without major risk factors for osmotic demyelination, initial correction by 8–12 mmol/L is more than necessary, but unlikely to be harmful unless the 48-hours limit of 18 mmol/L is exceeded; the panel deemed relowering of the serum sodium to be optional after correction by > 10–12 mmol/L but recommended that further increases in serum sodium should be avoided for the next 24 hours. Other experts have adopted the stricter limit of 8 mmol/L in 24 hours for all patients.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^113SHKnQ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

For patients presenting with severe symptoms, the European Clinical Practice Guidelines and US/Irish expert panel both advocate bolus infusions of hypertonic saline in an effort to raise the serum sodium by 5 mmol/L (European) or by 4–6 mmol/L (US/Irish) within a few hours. An increase of this magnitude is sufficient to markedly reduce intracranial pressure and can reverse impending brain herniation. Bolus infusion of hypertonic saline has been reported to achieve the desired increment in serum sodium more rapidly than a continuous infusion of 3% saline, and it is associated with better clinical outcomes.

After treatment with either isotonic saline or hypertonic saline given by bolus or continuous infusion, the serum sodium often increases by more than intended. Indeed, the risk of "overshooting the mark" is one of the stated reasons for setting conservative correction goals when treating patients for severe hyponatremia. However, the main reason for an excessive rise in serum sodium is not an excessive dose of saline; rather, it is the sudden elimination of a large volume of dilute urine. If the cause of water retention and hyponatremia resolves, a water diuresis (often called an aquaresis) will emerge during treatment and can increase serum sodium by more than 2 mmol/L per hour. For this reason, in patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L, it is important to measure the serum sodium frequently and to monitor urine output carefully during treatment.

### Hyponatremia is an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage [^111c4qE9]. Stroke (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Hyponatremia is the most frequent electrolyte disturbance in critical care. Across various disciplines, hyponatremia is associated with increased mortality and longer hospital stay, yet in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) no data are available. This the first study that investigated the prevalence and clinical associations of hyponatremia in patients with ICH.

Methods

This observational study included all consecutive spontaneous ICH patients (n = 464) admitted during a 5-year period to the Department of Neurology. Patient characteristics, in-hospital measures, mortality, and functional outcome (90 days and 1 year) were analyzed to determine the effects of hyponatremia (Na < 135 mEq/L). Multivariable regression analyses were calculated for factors associated with hyponatremia and predictors of in-hospital mortality.

Results

The prevalence of hyponatremia on hospital admission was 15.6% (n = 66). Normonatremia was achieved and maintained in almost all hyponatremia patients < 48 hours. In-hospital mortality was roughly doubled in hyponatremia compared with nonhyponatremia patients (40.9%; n = 27 versus 21.1%; n = 75), translating into a 2.5-fold increased odds ratio (P < 0.001). Multivariable analyses identified hyponatremia as an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.05–4.62; P = 0.037). Within 90 days after ICH, hyponatremia patients surviving hospital stay were also at greater risk of death (odds ratio, 4.8; 95% confidence interval, 2.1–10.6; P < 0.001); thereafter, mortality rates were similar.

Conclusions

Hyponatremia was identified as an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality with a fairly high prevalence in spontaneous ICH patients. The presence of hyponatremia at hospital admission is related to an increased short-term mortality in patients surviving acute care, possibly reflecting a preexisting condition that is linked to worse outcome due to greater comorbidity. Correction of hyponatremia does not seem to compensate its influence on mortality, which strongly warrants future research.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^116pbtxt]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage — hypertonic sodium solutions (HTS) dosing and sodium targets: In patients with SAH, studies titrating HTS to a target serum sodium of 145–155 mEq/L included a retrospective cohort in which the total sample was robust (n = 215) but only 38 had SAH, and there was not a statistically significant difference in episodes of critically elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) or neurological outcomes; accordingly, the panel felt the available data prevented endorsement of targeting a specific serum sodium concentration to improve ICP, cerebral edema, or neurological outcomes, while noting enough consistency across studies to suggest symptom-based bolus dosing of HTS as an effective means of reducing ICP and cerebral edema; at present, there are insufficient data to support improved neurological outcome regardless of administration strategy.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^114hmeK4]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and it affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia is defined by a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and most commonly results from water retention. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality.

Observations

Symptoms and signs of hyponatremia range from mild and nonspecific (such as weakness or nausea) to severe and life-threatening (such as seizures or coma). Symptom severity depends on the rapidity of development, duration, and severity of hyponatremia. Mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and increased rates of falls and fractures. In a prospective study, patients with hyponatremia more frequently reported a history of falling compared with people with normal serum sodium levels (23.8% vs 16.4%, respectively; P < .01) and had a higher rate of new fractures over a mean follow-up of 7.4 years (23.3% vs 17.3%; P < .004). Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status (hypovolemic hyponatremia, euvolemic hyponatremia, or hypervolemic hyponatremia). For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. Urea and vaptans can be effective treatments for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure, but have adverse effects (eg, poor palatability and gastric intolerance with urea; and overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and increased thirst with vaptans). Severely symptomatic hyponatremia (with signs of somnolence, obtundation, coma, seizures, or cardiorespiratory distress) is a medical emergency. US and European guidelines recommend treating severely symptomatic hyponatremia with bolus hypertonic saline to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy by increasing the serum sodium level by 4 mEq/L to 6 mEq/L within 1 to 2 hours but by no more than 10 mEq/L (correction limit) within the first 24 hours. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4.5% to 28% of people. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination, a rare but severe neurological condition, which can result in parkinsonism, quadriparesis, or even death.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hyponatremia affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of patients who are hospitalized. Most patients should be managed by treating their underlying disease and according to whether they have hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia. Urea and vaptans can be effective in managing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure; hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.

### Prevention and correction of dysnatremia after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^116fiu5a]. Neurocritical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Dysnatremia occurs commonly in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). The mechanisms for development of sodium dyshomeostasis are complex, including the cerebral salt-wasting syndrome, the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, diabetes insipidus. Iatrogenic occurrence of altered sodium levels plays a role, as sodium homeostasis is tightly linked to fluid and volume management.

Methods

Narrative review of the literature.

Results

Many studies have aimed to identify factors predictive of the development of dysnatremia, but data on associations between dysnatremia and demographic and clinical variables are variable. Furthermore, although a clear relationship between serum sodium serum concentrations and outcomes has not been established-poor outcomes have been associated with both hyponatremia and hypernatremia in the immediate period following aSAH and set the basis for seeking interventions to correct dysnatremia. While sodium supplementation and mineralocorticoids are frequently administered to prevent or counter natriuresis and hyponatremia, evidence to date is insufficient to gauge the effect of such treatment on outcomes.

Conclusions

In this article, we reviewed available data and provide a practical interpretation of these data as a complement to the newly issued guidelines for management of aSAH. Gaps in knowledge and future directions are discussed.

### Prognostic significance of hypernatremia and hyponatremia among patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^113MFQy5]. Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Abnormal serum sodium levels (hyponatremia and hypernatremia) are frequently observed during the acute period after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and may worsen cerebral edema and mass effect. We performed this study to determine the prognostic significance of serum sodium concentration abnormalities.

Methods

We analyzed prospectively collected data for the placebo treatment group in a clinical trial conducted at 54 neurosurgical centers in North America. The presence of hypernatremia (serum sodium concentration of > 145 mmol/L) and hyponatremia (serum sodium concentration of < 135 mmol/L) was determined with serum sodium measurements obtained at admission and 3, 6, and 9 days after SAH. The effects of hypernatremia and hyponatremia on the risk of symptomatic vasospasm and on 3-month outcomes were analyzed after adjustment for the following potential confounding factors: age, sex, preexisting hypertension, admission Glasgow Coma Scale score, initial mean arterial pressure, subarachnoid clot thickness, intraventricular blood or intraparenchymal hematoma, ventricular dilation, and aneurysm size and location.

Results

Of 298 patients in the analysis, 58 (19%) developed hypernatremia and 88 (30%) developed hyponatremia. Hypernatremia was significantly associated with poor outcomes (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.2–6.1). A positive correlation was observed between the highest sodium values recorded and Glasgow Outcome Scale scores at 3 months (P < 0.0001 by analysis of variance). Hyponatremia was not associated with 3-month outcomes (odds ratio, 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 0.9–4.3). Neither hypernatremia nor hyponatremia was associated with the risk of symptomatic vasospasm.

Conclusion

Hyponatremia seems to be more common than hypernatremia after SAH. However, hypernatremia after SAH is independently associated with poor outcomes, and this association is independent of previously identified outcome predictors, including age and admission Glasgow Coma Scale scores. Further studies are needed to define the underlying mechanism of this association.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^111hiyrd]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For the past decade, most physicians treating severe hyponatremia have followed international guidelines that recommend limiting the rate of correction to avoid serious iatrogenic neurologic complications, most notably osmotic demyelination. Although these guidelines are based on small retrospective case series, they have been widely accepted by expert clinicians and are designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia. – Established practice has recently been challenged by the publication of a retrospective analysis of hospital administrative data derived from a cohort of over 17,000 patients hospitalized with hyponatremia. On the basis of the results of that study, an accompanying editorial suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of correction; its authors questioned the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration. We believe such conclusions are unwarranted and potentially dangerous; they are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. A review of that controversy, and of how current guidelines came to be, will explain the reason for our position.

It should be emphasized that during any intervention restoring patients' Na + levels, physicians should rigorously search for solutions, drugs or factors contributing to or provoking hyponatraemia. In addition, the correction rate should be frequently checked until Na + levels stabilization and not exceed 10 mmol/l per day. In case this happens, infusion of an electrolyte-free water solution (10 ml/kg) with or without 2 μg desmopressin can be administered.

### Mild chronic hyponatremia in the ambulatory setting: significance and management [^115rvcWm]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Mild chronic hyponatremia, as defined by a persistent (> 72 hours) plasma sodium concentration between 125 and 135 mEq/L without apparent symptoms, is common in ambulatory patients and generally perceived as being inconsequential. The association between increased mortality and hyponatremia in hospitalized patients in various settings and etiologies is widely recognized. This review analyzes the significance of mild chronic hyponatremia in ambulatory subjects and its effects on mortality and morbidity. It addresses whether this disorder should even be treated and if so, which patients are likely to benefit from treatment. The available approaches to correct hyponatremia in such patients in the context of recently published panel-generated recommendations and guidelines are described.

Evidence cited includes four RCTs with small size between 28 and 91 patients, testing fludrocortisone or hydrocortisone started within 48–72 h of aSAH onset and continued for 10–14 days; hyponatremia endpoints were commonly defined as serum sodium lower than 135 mEq/L on at least 2 consecutive days. Mineralocorticoids appeared to reduce hyponatremia and natriuresis without any effect on delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) or functional outcomes, and hypokalemia was more common in treated patients; overall, "There is no evidence that mineralocorticoids improve functional outcomes in aSAH", and although they might reduce the incidence of hyponatremia when started early and continued for 10–14 days, the available evidence is inconclusive.

Although he starts by disagreeing with my approach in the treatment of diuretic-induced hyponatremia, he recommends, in the last paragraph of his letter, "if the patient presents with either seizures or deep coma, it is reasonable to administer enough hypertonic saline to improve these symptoms". This is the exact therapeutic approach that I have advocated since my initial article on this subject in 1982, 1 and I am glad to see that Dr Sterns also thinks that these patients should be treated rapidly with hypertonic saline to correct the neurologic symptomatology. In our experience, these neurologic symptoms usually subside when the serum sodium concentration is raised to 120 to 125 mEq/L. After this, the patient needs to be closely monitored for several days to avoid overcorrection. In spite of Dr Sterns' recommendation of administering hypertonic saline Ayus JC.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^116uPKAA]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines of hyponatraemia treatment

Hypotonic hyponatraemia is a clinical state where there is a relative excess of water to sodium content in the extracellular fluid. Acute hyponatraemia is clinically important as it can cause significant morbidity and mortality associated with rapid development of symptomatic cerebral oedema. Prompt treatment to raise the serum sodium concentration in this setting is life-saving. Chronic hyponatraemia, even if asymptomatic, is associated with many adverse outcomes including prolonged hospitalisation, gait instability, falls, fractures, and increased bone loss. Diverse strategies to correct chronic hyponatraemia have been recommended and success of such treatment is dependent on the underlying aetiology for hyponatraemia. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatraemia may trigger an osmotic demyelination syndrome resulting in serious neurological deficits and death.

The methodological quality of guideline development and consensus statements can be assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) process. This tool is used to systematically evaluate six guideline domains including scope, stakeholder involvement, editorial independence, rigour of development, clarity, and applicability. Nagler et al. identified five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements after a comprehensive search of English and non-English publications, guideline databases, and professional society websites. Their recommendations differed with respect to classification of hyponatraemia, diagnostic tests, doses of saline to use for correction, limits for the rise in serum sodium concentration, and the most appropriate second line therapies for management. The overall quality of these publications (measured by the AGREE tool) was mixed.

Should we be surprised that individual hyponatraemia guidelines "failed" this test of quality? Arguably, the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia cannot be subjected to this sort of rigorous analysis because of the low level of evidence available to help various expert panels and guideline groups write internationally consistent advice. For example, hyponatraemia occurring within 48 hours is an arbitrary cut-off for determining the presence of acute hyponatraemia, the desired rate of correction for hyponatraemia in most settings is not universally agreed, availability of certain recommended therapies is country dependent and impacted by differing regulatory indications for drugs, and even the biochemical threshold for defining hyponatraemia varies widely in the literature. Furthermore, many of the clinical algorithms require initial assessment of the extracellular fluid volume to determine if a hyponatraemic patient is hypovolaemic, euvolaemic, or hypervolaemic. In practice, this physical examination of fluid balance can be subject to misinterpretation if the clinical signs are subtle.

### A step-by-step guide for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia in patients with stroke [^114Nsp3o]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyponatraemia is a frequently encountered electrolyte disorder both in hospitalized and community patients with a reported incidence up to 30% and 8%, respectively. – Low sodium (Na +) levels are commonly noticed in neurologic diseases, including stroke, and are present in 38–54% of such patients. – In this setting, hyponatraemia and water balance exhibit detrimental effects on the injured brain and might increase the corresponding mortality by 60%.

Clinical symptoms owing to hyponatraemia are related with the severity, the onset and rate of change of serum Na + levels. The presence of a serum Na + concentration lower than 135 mEq/l is defined as hyponatraemia. In case it develops over a period of < 48 h, hyponatraemia is considered acute, whereas chronic hyponatraemia may be present for > 48 h or over an unclear duration. Its severity is classified according to the serum Na + concentration: (1) severe hyponatraemia: Na + < 120 mEq/l, (2) moderate hyponatraemia: Na + 120–129 mEq/l and (3) mild hyponatraemia: Na + 130–134 mEq/l. Clinical symptoms of acute hyponatraemia range from mild headache, confusion, nausea and vomiting to seizures, respiratory arrest, coma or even death. On the contrary, a patient with chronic hyponatraemia might present with nausea and vomiting, fatigue, gait instability, falls and attention deficits. Overall, the management of hyponatremia remains problematic in everyday clinical practice due to its prevalence under widely different conditions and prompts towards the endorsement of an institution-based approach with regard to diagnosis and treatment algorithms.

As hyponatraemia might play a significant role in the clinical course of patients with stroke, early recognition and appropriate management are critical to preventing from potential complications.

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage — hyponatremia epidemiology, mechanisms, and therapies: Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte imbalance in patients with aneurysmal SAH, occurring in 30–50% of cases. More recent work emphasizes that the diagnosis of CSW requires hypovolemia, whereas SIADH usually results in euvolemia or modest hypervolemia, and it appears that in SAH both entities may coexist in the same patient. Older studies reported an association between hyponatremia and higher risk of cerebral infarctions, especially with fluid restriction, but subsequent studies during aggressive fluid administration found no conclusive evidence that hyponatremia influences prognosis. Controlled studies of fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone to prevent hyponatremia found both consistently effective when started early, but use was associated with increased hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, and significantly increased infection. Data suggest that 3% saline may be safe but are too scant to assess its value. Vasopressin-receptor antagonists, such as conivaptan, are effective in euvolemic or hypervolemic conditions and in hyponatremic SAH patients, but they can produce a significant rise in urine output raising concern about intravascular volume contraction, especially in the setting of DCI.

Initial Evaluation and Treatment of Hyponatremia

Emergency Management of Severe Hyponatremia

Initial management of hyponatremia includes assessment of neurological symptoms and signs to determine whether urgent treatment of severe hyponatremia with hypertonic saline is required. As discussed in "Acute Severe Hyponatremia", severe hyponatremia can cause cerebral edema leading to seizures, coma, or death, and urgent intervention is recommended with a 100-mL bolus of hypertonic (3%) sodium chloride administered over approximately 15 minutes. An initial dose should be followed by clinical reassessment and a repeat dose if no clinical response, until this target increment has been achieved (Fig. 8). The goal is to achieve an initial sodium increase of 4 to 6 mmol. According to the Adrogué-Madias formula to estimate the effect of fluid administration on pNa, 100 mL of NaCl 3%, containing 51.3 mmol of Na +, may be expected to increase serum sodium by 1 to 1.5 mmol/L in most adults of average size (50–80 kg) (assuming no urinary electrolyte-free water clearance in the same interval) (see Fig. 2).

In the absence of diuretics, a clinical assessment of the volume status may aid further the differential diagnosis. Symptoms such as tachycardia, postural hypotension, dry skin mucosa and a low central venous pressure indicate depletion of circulating volume. In that case, apart from occult diuretics as previously mentioned, vomiting, primary hypoaldosteronism and renal or cerebral salt wasting syndrome (CSW) would be the most usual causes of hyponatraemia (Figure 1). Severe vomiting could be a sign of increased endocranial pressure, a complication of stroke. Interestingly, metabolic alkalosis associated with vomiting represents one of the conditions in which volume depletion may not be associated with decreased UNa +, despite the activation of the renin–angiotensin system. In this clinical setting, urinary chloride excretion is low (< 10–20 mmol/l) due to increased renal re-absorption of chloride. Second, patient previously treated with corticosteroids can be complicated with primary hypoaldosteronism in the setting of acute stroke if corticosteroid therapy is interrupted abruptly. Primary hypoaldosteronism causes renal Na + loss, contracted extracellular fluid volume and hyponatraemia. Although primary adrenal insufficiency usually presents with other clinical symptoms and biochemical abnormalities, physicians should keep in mind that hyponatraemia can be its first and only sign. Of note, only one study has investigated its prevalence in the setting of acute ischemic stroke and shown that 18 of 58 patients (31%) had relative adrenal insufficiency. Third, renal salt wasting can also occur in patients with salt-losing nephropathies, such as tubulopathy after chemotherapy or in analgesic nephropathy, medullary cystic kidney disease and certain pharmacological compounds inhibiting the kidney's ability to re-absorb appropriate Na + amounts. Finally, renal Na + loss has been documented in patients with intracranial disorders and mostly in those with subarachnoid bleeding. This renal salt wasting syndrome has been rather confusingly named 'cerebral' salt wasting (CSW), and brain natriuretic peptide has been implicated in its pathogenesis. Because diagnosis may be difficult, and both SIADH and secondary adrenal insufficiency are more common in this clinical setting, CSW might be overdiagnosed. In clinical practice, there are cases of hyponatremia potentially attributed to SIADH or CSW that cannot be strictly separated or both can be present. Nevertheless, CSW recognition is of major importance because its treatment requires volume resuscitation rather than water restriction, as SIADH.

### Sodium and water perturbations in patients who had an acute stroke: clinical relevance and management strategies for the neurologist [^114bB7zx]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical relevance

The severity of neurological symptoms associated with hyponatraemia remains the most clinically relevant indication for prompt treatment. Symptoms of hyponatraemia can vary from mild and non-specific to severe and life-threatening, and are dependent on the level and rapidity of changes of serum sodium levels. As serum sodium levels decrease, water moves into the brain cells causing mild symptoms such as headache, fatigue, nausea, dizziness, gait disturbances, muscle cramps, falls, forgetfulness and attention deficits. The brain adapts rapidly by losing other intracellular solutes to decrease the risk of developing cerebral oedema. At this point, if hyponatraemia is not stabilised or corrected, patients can develop moderate to severe symptoms such as seizures, coma and/or death. Multiple case series recommend the use of hypertonic saline bolus to rapidly correct serum sodium levels, as corrections as small as 5 mmol/L can improve symptoms and achieve seizure control. Severe neurological symptoms such as seizures, obtundation, and coma are associated with acute hyponatraemia. A serum sodium drop of > 1 mmol/L/hour is associated with a higher likelihood of neurological sequelae and death, caused by cerebral oedema and increased intracranial pressure. Brain cells swell when water moves from the extracellular to the intracellular compartment because of a difference in effective osmolality between brain and plasma as the brain has had too little time to adapt to its hypotonic environment. Over time, the brain reduces the number of osmotically active particles within its cells (mostly potassium and organic solutes) to restore brain volume. This process takes approximately 24–48 hours, hence the rationale for using the 48-hour threshold to distinguish acute (< 48 hours) from chronic (≥ 48 hours) hyponatraemia.

Conversely, hypernatraemia tends to develop in patients who had an acute stroke who are unable to increase fluid intake due to impaired neurocognition and conscious levels. As opposed to hyponatraemia, water moves out into the extracellular space resulting in brain cell shrinkage, and this can precipitate intracerebral haemorrhage caused by tearing of the cerebral vasculature. Symptoms of hypernatraemia include lethargy, restlessness, seizures, decreased left ventricular contractility, muscle cramps and rhabdomyolysis. The worsening progression of symptoms is not only related to absolute increases in serum sodium levels, but also the rapidity at which the increase occurs due to the speed of brain cell dehydration.

### Hyponatremia treatment guidelines 2007: expert panel recommendations [^116MdcXm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Although hyponatremia is a common, usually mild, and relatively asymptomatic disorder of electrolytes, acute severe hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with concomitant disease. In addition, overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic deficits and death, and optimal treatment strategies for such cases are not established. An expert panel assessed the potential contributions of aquaretic nonpeptide small-molecule arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR) antagonists to hyponatremia therapies. This review presents their conclusions, including identification of appropriate treatment populations and possible future indications for aquaretic AVPR antagonists.

### Treatment of hyponatremia in patients with acute neurological injury [^112BB41W]. Neurocritical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Little data exist regarding the practice of sodium management in acute neurologically injured patients. This study describes the practice variations, thresholds for treatment, and effectiveness of treatment in this population.

Methods

This retrospective, multicenter, observational study identified 400 ICU patients, from 17 centers, admitted for ≥ 48 h with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), traumatic brain injury (TBI), intraparenchymal hemorrhage, or intracranial tumors between January 1, 2011 and July 31, 2012. Data collection included demographics, APACHE II, Glascow Coma Score (GCS), serum sodium (Na+), fluid rate and tonicity, use of sodium-altering therapies, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay, and modified Rankin score upon discharge. Data were collected for the first 21 days of ICU admission or ICU discharge, whichever came first. Sodium trigger for treatment defined as the Na+ value prior to treatment with response defined as an increase of ≥ 4 mEq/L at 24 h.

Results

Sodium-altering therapy was initiated in 34% (137/400) of patients with 23% (32/137) having Na + > 135 mEq/L at time of treatment initiation. The most common indications for treatment were declining serum Na + (68/116, 59%) and cerebral edema with mental status changes (21/116, 18%). Median Na + treatment trigger was 133 mEq/L (IQR 129–139) with no difference between diagnoses. Incidence and treatment of hyponatremia was more common in SAH and TBI [SAH (49/106, 46%), TBI (39/97, 40%), ICH (27/102, 26%), tumor (22/95, 23%); p = 0.001]. The most common initial treatment was hypertonic saline (85/137, 62%), followed by oral sodium chloride tablets (42/137, 31%) and fluid restriction (15/137, 11%). Among treated patients, 60% had a response at 24 h. Treated patients had lower admission GCS (12 vs. 14, p = 0.02) and higher APACHE II scores (12 vs. 10, p = 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in outcome when comparing treated and untreated patients.

Conclusion

Sodium-altering therapy is commonly employed among neurologically injured patients. Hypertonic saline infusions were used first line in more than half of treated patients with the majority having a positive response at 24 h. Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of various treatments on patient outcomes.

### Prognostic significance of hyponatremia in acute intracerebral hemorrhage: pooled analysis of the intensive blood pressure reduction in acute cerebral hemorrhage trial studies [^1165oQp3]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the association of hyponatremia at presentation with clinical and imaging outcomes in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage.

Design

Retrospective pooled analysis of prospectively collected data from 3,243 participants of the pilot and main phases of the Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trials 1 and 2 (international, multicenter, open, blinded endpoint, randomized controlled trials designed to assess the effects of early intensive blood pressure lowering in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage).

Setting

Clinical hospital sites in 21 countries.

Patients

Patients with predominantly mild-moderate severity of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage within 6 hours of onset and elevated systolic blood pressure (150–220mm Hg) were included in the study.

Interventions

Patients were assigned to receive intensive (target systolic blood pressure, < 140mm Hg within 1hr) or guideline-recommended (target systolic blood pressure, < 180mm Hg) blood pressure-lowering therapy.

Measurements and Main Results

Presentation hyponatremia was defined as serum sodium less than 135 mEq/L. The primary outcome was death at 90 days. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association of hyponatremia with important clinical events. Of 3,002 patients with available data, 349 (12%) had hyponatremia. Hyponatremia was associated with death (18% vs 11%; multivariable-adjusted odds ratio, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.28–2.57; p < 0.001) and larger baseline intracerebral hemorrhage volume (multivariable adjusted, p = 0.046) but not with baseline perihematomal edema volume nor with growth of intracerebral hemorrhage or perihematomal edema during the initial 24 hours.

Conclusions

Hyponatremia at presentation is associated with increased mortality in patients with predominantly deep and modest volume intracerebral hemorrhage through mechanisms that seem independent of growth in intracerebral hemorrhage or perihematomal edema.

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) — intravascular volume and electrolyte management: In patients with aSAH, close monitoring and goal-directed treatment of volume status are reasonable to maintain euvolemia (COR 2a; LOE B-R). In patients with aSAH, use of mineralocorticoids is reasonable to treat natriuresis and hyponatremia (COR 2a; LOE B-R). In patients with aSAH, induction of hypervolemia is potentially harmful because of the association with excess morbidity (COR 3: Harm; LOE B-R).

### Hypertonic saline for hyponatremia: meeting goals and avoiding harm [^1175CAmS]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertonic saline has been used for the treatment of hyponatremia for nearly a century. There is now general consensus that hypertonic saline should be used in patients with hyponatremia associated with moderate or severe symptoms to prevent neurological complications. However, much less agreement exists among experts regarding other aspects of its use. Should hypertonic saline be administered as a bolus injection or continuous infusion? What is the appropriate dose? Is a central venous line necessary? Should desmopressin be used concomitantly and for how long? This article considers these important questions, briefly explores the historical origins of hypertonic saline use for hyponatremia, and reviews recent evidence behind its indications, dosing, administration modality and route, combined use with desmopressin to prevent rapid correction of serum sodium, and other considerations such as the need and degree for fluid restriction. The authors conclude by offering some practical recommendations for the use of hypertonic saline.

### Correction rates and clinical outcomes in hospitalized adults with severe hyponatremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1147wBVW]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Hyponatremia treatment guidelines recommend limiting the correction of severe hyponatremia during the first 24 hours to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). Recent evidence suggests that slower rates of correction are associated with increased mortality.

Objective

To evaluate the association of sodium correction rates with mortality among hospitalized adults with severe hyponatremia.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, LILACS, Web of Science, CINAHL, and international congress proceedings for studies published between January 2013 and October 2023.

Study Selection

Comparative studies assessing rapid (≥ 8–10 mEq/L per 24 hours) vs slow (< 8 or 6–10 mEq/L per 24 hours) and very slow (< 4–6 mEq/L per 24 hours) correction of severe hyponatremia (serum sodium < 120 mEq/L or < 125 mEq/L plus severe symptoms) in hospitalized patients.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Pairs of reviewers (N. A.F. J.R.M. J.M. A. A.C.) independently reviewed studies, extracted data, and assessed each included study's risk of bias using ROBINS-I. Cochrane methods, PRISMA reporting guidelines, and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to rate the certainty of evidence were followed. Data were pooled using a random-effects model.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes were in-hospital and 30-day mortality, and secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay (LOS) and ODS.

Results

Sixteen cohort studies involving a total of 11 811 patients with severe hyponatremia were included (mean [SD] age, 68.22 [6.88] years; 56.7% female across 15 studies reporting sex). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that rapid correction was associated with 32 (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.55–0.82) and 221 (odds ratio, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.11–0.79) fewer in-hospital deaths per 1000 treated patients compared with slow and very slow correction, respectively. Low-certainty evidence suggested that rapid correction was associated with 61 (risk ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.45–0.67) and 134 (risk ratio, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.28–0.44) fewer deaths per 1000 treated patients at 30 days and with a reduction in LOS of 1.20 (95% CI, 0.51–1.89) and 3.09 (95% CI, 1.21–4.94) days, compared with slow and very slow correction, respectively. Rapid correction was not associated with a statistically significant increased risk of ODS.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, slow correction and very slow correction of severe hyponatremia were associated with an increased risk of mortality and hospital LOS compared to rapid correction.

### A step-by-step guide for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia in patients with stroke [^114pTHrV]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Caveats in treatment of hyponatraemia in patients with stroke

Current guidelines for the management of hyponatraemia do not refer specifically to patients with stroke. Thus, physicians should pay attention to some crucial points. First, any fluid resuscitation used for the restoration of low sodium levels should consider the type of stroke. Cerebral perfusion is important in the setting of acute ischemic stroke, but control and reduction of blood pressure is crucial in patients with hemorrhagic stroke. Nevertheless, a close monitoring of patients' volume status and a vigilant fluid balance management are strongly recommended in both conditions. Second, any intervention aiming fluid restriction may be inappropriate in stroke patients due to increased risk for deteriorating an already impaired cerebral circulation. In addition, fluid restriction is also contra-indicated in hypovolemic states such as CSW, which can be misdiagnosed as SIADH. On the contrary, isotonic saline administration, commonly used in stroke patients, should be avoided in patients with SIADH-related hyponatraemia as it can aggravate hyponatraemia. Considering its neuroprotective effects and lower ODS risk compared with other therapies, urea may be an attractive option in treating stroke patients with hyponatraemia due to SIADH. It should be emphasized, however, that the clinical experience with urea administration is limited, especially in patients with stroke. Despite the evidence showing that conivaptan diminishes the cerebral edema and blood–brain barrier disruption in an experimental stroke model, studies evaluating the role of vaptans in hyponatraemic patients with stroke are lacking. On the contrary, the neuroprotective effects along with the well-established cardiorenal benefits of glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors cast them a promising therapy of non-hypovolemic chronic hyponatraemia. Finally, the presented algorithms for the restoration of sodium levels herein could also be used in patients with brain injuries, considering the increased prevalence of hyponatremia and its common aetiologies, such as SIADH and CSW, in the latter. Nevertheless, intracerebral haemorrhage is a separate disease with different causes and pathophysiology than stroke and thus any intervention should be personalized.

### Management of hyponatremia in the ICU [^114zXmxm]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is common in critical care units. Avoidance of neurologic injury requires a clear understanding of why the serum sodium (Na) concentration falls and why it rises, how the brain responds to a changing serum Na concentration, and what the goals of therapy should be. A 4 to 6 mEq/L increase in serum Na concentration is sufficient to treat life-threatening cerebral edema caused by acute hyponatremia. In chronic (> 48 h), severe (< 120 mEq/L) hyponatremia, correction by > 8 to 10 mEq/L/d risks iatrogenic osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS); therefore, a 4 to 6 mEq/L daily increase in serum Na concentration should be the goal in most patients. With the possible exception of hyponatremia caused by heart failure or hepatic cirrhosis, a rapid initial increase in serum Na for severe symptoms and avoidance of overcorrection are best achieved with 3% saline given in either a peripheral or central vein. Inadvertent overcorrection can be avoided in high-risk patients with chronic hyponatremia by administration of desmopressin to prevent excessive urinary water losses. In patients with hyponatremia with oliguric kidney failure, controlled correction can be achieved with modified hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapies. ODS is potentially reversible, even in severely affected patients who are quadriplegic, unresponsive, and ventilator dependent. Supportive care should be offered several weeks before concluding that the condition is hopeless.

Hyponatremia after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) — fluid and endocrine measures are directed as follows: Fluid restriction should not be used to treat hyponatremia (weak quality evidence; strong recommendation). Early treatment with hydrocortisone or fludrocortisone may be used to limit natriuresis and hyponatremia (moderate quality evidence; weak recommendation). Mild hypertonic saline solutions can be used to correct hyponatremia (very low quality evidence; strong recommendation). Extreme caution to avoid hypovolemia is needed if vasopressin-receptor antagonists are used for treatment of hyponatremia (weak quality evidence; strong recommendation). Free water intake via intravenous and enteral routes should be limited (very low quality evidence; strong recommendation).

### Hyponatremia in neurosurgical patients: clinical guidelines development [^116oJfFF]. Neurosurgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Neurosurgical patients have a high risk of hyponatremia and associated complications. We critically evaluated the existing literature to identify the determinants for the development of hyponatremia and which management strategies provided the best outcomes.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel in the areas of neurosurgery, nephrology, critical care medicine, endocrinology, pharmacy, and nursing summarized and classified hyponatremia literature scientific studies published in English from 1950 through 2008. The panel's recommendations were used to create an evaluation and treatment protocol for hyponatremia in neurosurgical patients at the University of Florida.

Results

Hyponatremia should be further investigated and treated when the serum sodium level is less than 131 mmol/L (class II). Evaluation of hyponatremia should include a combination of physical examination findings, basic laboratory studies, and invasive monitoring when available (class III). Obtaining levels of hormones such as antidiuretic hormone and natriuretic peptides is not supported by the literature (class III). Treatment of hyponatremia should be based on severity of symptoms (class III). The serum sodium level should not be corrected by more than 10 mmol/L/d (class III). Cerebral salt wasting should be treated with replacement of serum sodium and intravenous fluids (class III). Fludrocortisone may be considered in the treatment of hyponatremia in subarachnoid hemorrhage patients at risk of vasospasm (class I). Hydrocortisone may be used to prevent natriuresis in subarachnoid hemorrhage patients (class I). Hyponatremia in subarachnoid hemorrhage patients at risk of vasospasm should not be treated with fluid restriction (class II). Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone may be treated with urea, diuretics, lithium, demeclocycline, and/or fluid restriction (class III).

Conclusion

The summarized literature on the evaluation and treatment of hyponatremia was used to develop practice management recommendations for hyponatremia in the neurosurgical population. However, the practice management recommendations relied heavily on expert opinion because of a paucity of class I evidence literature on hyponatremia.

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^117M8SDu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Severity

Hyponatremia is considered as severe if [Na] is < 115 or 110 mmol/L. In addition, all cases of hyponatremia treated with hypertonic or isotonic saline infusion, including hypovolemia with hyponatremia and absence of overt neurological manifestations, should be considered as severe because of the risks from saline infusion. Saline infusion for hypovolemic hyponatremia carries arguably the highest risk of inadvertently rapid rise in[Na].

Target Serum Sodium Concentration

The targeted rise in [Na] depends on the perceived urgency of treatment. In patients with pronounced hyponatremic symptoms, regardless of chronicity, a rapid rise of 4 to 6 mEq/L is recommended. Further rises may be required if symptoms persist after the initial rise in [Na]. For chronic hyponatremia, previous recommendations set a maximal rate of rise in [Na] at 12 mEq/L in the first 24 hours and a maximal final [Na] of 125 to 130 mEq/L. Because osmotic myelinolysis was observed in patients achieving the desired rate of rise in [Na], the current target rise in [Na] is set at 6 to 8 mEq/L in 24 hours, 12 to 14 mEq/L in 48 hours, and 14 to 16 mEq/L in 72 hours. Prevention of hypernatremia during treatment of hyponatremia is imperative.

### Disorders of sodium and water balance [^111nVwLA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Dysnatremias occur simultaneously with disorders in water balance. The first priority is to correct dehydration; once the patient is euvolemic, the sodium level can be reassessed. In unstable patients with hyponatremia, the clinician should rapidly administer hypertonic saline. In unstable patients with hypernatremia, the clinician should administer isotonic intravenous fluid. In stable patients with either hyponatremia or hypernatremia, the clinician should aim for correction over 24 to 48 hours, with the maximal change in serum sodium between 8 to 12 mEq/L over the first 24 hours. This rate of correction decreases the chances of cerebral edema or osmotic demyelination syndrome.

### Hyponatremia in neurotrauma: the role of vasopressin [^1145uhZg]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2016). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is frequent in patients suffering from traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or following intracranial procedures, with approximately 20% having a decreased serum sodium concentration to < 125mmol/L. The pathophysiology of hyponatremia in neurotrauma is not completely understood, but in large part is explained by the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). The abnormal water and/or sodium handling creates an osmotic gradient promoting the shift of water into brain cells, thereby worsening cerebral edema and precipitating neurological deterioration. Unless hyponatremia is corrected promptly and effectively, morbidity and mortality increases through seizures, elevations in intracranial pressure, and/or herniation. The excess mortality in patients with severe hyponatremia (< 125mmol/L) extends beyond the time frame of hospital admission, with a reported mortality of 20% in hospital and 45% within 6 months of follow-up. Current options for the management of hyponatremia include fluid restriction, hypertonic saline, mineralocorticoids, and osmotic diuretics. However, the recent development of vasopressin receptor antagonists provides a more physiological tool for the management of excess water retention and consequent hyponatremia, such as occurs in SIADH. This review summarizes the existing literature on the pathophysiology, clinical features, and management of hyponatremia in the setting of neurotrauma.

### Where Do the salt and water Go? A case of profound hyponatremia [^112PdBSU]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment of profound hyponatremia is challenging. Severe symptoms mandate correction by 4 to 6 mEq/L within hours, but with risk factors for osmotic demyelination, daily correction should be < 8 mEq/L. With a therapeutic window this narrow, clinicians would like to know how serum sodium (SNa) concentration will respond to their therapy. Based on isotopic measurements, Edelman showed SNa level to be a function of exchangeable sodium and potassium divided by total-body water. Edelman defined this relationship with linear regression yielding an equation of the form y = mx + b, where y is SNa level, x is exchangeable sodium and potassium divided by total-body water, m is the slope, and b is the intercept. Edelman said that the intercept of his regression "probably is a measure of the quantity of osmotically inactive exchangeable sodium and potassium per unit of body water". Predictive formulas are derived from Edelman's original linear regression, some including and some omitting the regression's intercept. We illustrate the performance and limitations of these formulas using comprehensive data for electrolyte and fluid balance obtained during the treatment of a critically patient who presented with an SNa concentration of 101 mEq/L.

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^116yEj9k]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

### Hyponatremia: clinical diagnosis and management [^114nfxLE]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common clinical problem in hospitalized patients and nursing home residents. It also may occur in healthy athletes after endurance exercise. The majority of patients with hyponatremia are asymptomatic and do not require immediate correction of hyponatremia. Symptomatic hyponatremia is a medical emergency requiring rapid correction to prevent the worsening of brain edema. How fast we should increase the serum sodium levels depends on the onset of hyponatremia and still remains controversial. If the serum sodium levels are corrected too rapidly, patients may develop central pontine myelinolysis, but if they are corrected too slowly, patients may die of brain herniation. We review the epidemiology and mechanisms of hyponatremia, the sensitivity of women to hyponatremic injury, the adaptation and maladaptation of brain cells to hyponatremia and its correction, and the practical ways of managing hyponatremia. Because the majority of hyponatremia is caused by the non-osmotic release of vasopressin, the recent approval of the vasopressin receptor antagonist conivaptan for euvolemic hyponatremia may simplify hyponatremia management. However, physicians should be aware of the risk of rapid correction of hyponatremia, hypotension, and excessive fluid intake.

### A step-by-step guide for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia in patients with stroke [^113C7rZs]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite the evidence above, it has not been elucidated whether causality between hyponatraemia and these complications really exists, or low Na + levels are just an indicator of concomitant disease burden leading to adverse outcomes. In this context, it will be of paramount importance to know whether the appropriate restoration of Na + level improves the outcomes in patients with acute stroke. To the best of our knowledge, only one observational study including 464 consecutive patients with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage has shown that restoration of serum Na + levels did not improve mortality rates.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of severely symptomatic patients, initial management, AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend to consider administering bolus or continuous infusions of 3% hypertonic saline in patients with a sodium concentration of < 125 mEq/L and moderate or severe symptoms. Recognize that bolus infusion improves sodium concentration more quickly with less overcorrection.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^111Qzmkn]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — acute in-hospital treatment recommendations — Oral and IV hypotonic or isotonic hydration should be avoided early in the management of EAH, although it may be appropriate in certain clinical contexts once sodium correction has been initiated or hypovolemia is confirmed. Recommendation grade: 1C. With suspected EAH, and particularly in those with altered mental status, sodium estimation should be obtained as rapidly as possible after hospital arrival. Recommendation grade: 1A. A rapid assessment for signs and symptoms of cerebral edema or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema should be done in all patients with possible EAH. Recommendation grade: 1A. Severe EAH biochemically confirmed or symptomatic EAH should be treated with a 100-mL bolus of IV HTS, which can be repeated twice at 10-min intervals (3 doses in total) or until improvement of neurologic symptoms, with the aim of acutely increasing serum sodium concentration by about 4 to 5 mmol·L−1 and reversing cerebral edema. Recommendation grade: 1A.

### Causes and management of hyponatremia [^113xgAdy]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review clinical information on the incidence and causes of hyponatremia (defined as a serum sodium level < 130 mEq/L), the most common electrolyte abnormality seen in general hospital patients, and to discuss the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia in relation to these factors.

Data Sources

Primary sources and review articles were identified via MEDLINE (1981-July 2003) for entries on hyponatremia. We limited the search to specific topics including incidence, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and clinical disorders and medications associated with hypotonic hyponatremia.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All of the articles identified were evaluated, and relevant and representative information was included in this review.

Data Synthesis

Hyponatremia can result from several disease states, injury, surgery, physical exercise, or the administration of certain drugs (e.g., antidepressants, antiepileptics) and is associated with advanced age. Drug-induced hyponatremia is often asymptomatic and usually resolves following water restriction and monitoring of medication. Symptoms of hyponatremia are primarily neurologic; the principal danger of hyponatremia relates to effects on central nervous system function due to changes in brain size.

Conclusions

Although hyponatremia can be a serious condition, appropriate measures for the management of at-risk and affected patients will lead to full recovery in most cases.

### Signs and symptoms… [^117Cyw5q]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Central pontine myelinolysis and osmotic demyelination syndrome present most commonly as a complication of treatment of patients with profound hyponatremia, which can result from a varied spectrum of conditions, based on different mechanisms. It occurs as a consequence of a rapid rise in serum tonicity following treatment in individuals with chronic, severe hyponatremia who have made intracellular adaptations to the prevailing hypotonicity. Signs and symptoms Symptoms depend on the regions of the brain involved. Before its onset, patients may present with the neurological signs and symptoms of hyponatraemic encephalopathy such as nausea and vomiting, confusion, headache and seizures. These symptoms may resolve with normalisation of the serum sodium concentration. Three to five days later, a second phase of neurological manifestations occurs, correlating with the onset of myelinolysis.

Observable immediate precursors may include seizures, disturbed consciousness, gait changes, and decrease or cessation of respiratory function. In schizophrenic patients with psychogenic polydipsia, inadequate thirst reception leads to excessive water intake, severely diluting serum sodium. With this excessive thirst combined with psychotic symptoms, brain damage such as central pontine myelinolysis may result from hyperosmolarity caused by excess intake of fluids, although this is difficult to determine because such patients are often institutionalised and have a long history of mental health conditions. Pathophysiology The currently accepted theory states that the brain cells adjust their osmolarities by changing levels of certain osmolytes like inositol, betaine, and glutamine in response to varying serum osmolality.

In the context of chronic low plasma sodium, the brain compensates by decreasing the levels of these osmolytes within the cells, so that they can remain relatively isotonic with their surroundings and not absorb too much fluid. The reverse is true in hypernatremia, in which the cells increase their intracellular osmolytes so as not to lose too much fluid to the extracellular space. With correction of the hyponatremia with intravenous fluids, the extracellular tonicity increases, followed by an increase in intracellular tonicity. When the correction is too rapid, not enough time is allowed for the brain's cells to adjust to the new tonicity, namely by increasing the intracellular osmoles mentioned earlier. If the serum sodium levels rise too rapidly, the increased extracellular tonicity will continue to drive water out of the brain's cells. This can lead to cellular dysfunction and central pontine myelinolysis.

Prevention and Treatment To minimise the risk of this condition developing from its most common cause, overly rapid reversal of hyponatremia, the hyponatremia should be corrected at a rate not exceeding 10 mmol/L/24 h or 0. 5 mEq/L/h; or 18 mEq/L/48hrs; thus potentially avoiding demyelination although ODS can still occur with rises in osmolality within recommended ranges. No large clinical trials have been performed to examine the efficacy of therapeutic re-lowering of serum sodium, or other interventions sometimes advocated, such as steroids or plasma exchange. Alcoholic patients should receive vitamin supplementation and a formal evaluation of their nutritional status. The effect of therapeutic saline, in particular hypertonic saline, is often implicated in rapid rises in serum Na and osmolality when treating patients with hyponatraemia. The effect of saline is twofold. There is an initial redistribution/dilution that rarely causes an unsafe rise in Na/osmolality.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia: conventional and novel aspects [^113us68x]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a frequent electrolyte disorder. A hyponatremia is called acute severe (< 115 mM) when the duration has been < 36 to 48 h. Such patients often have advanced symptoms as a result of brain edema. Acute severe hyponatremia is a medical emergency. It should be corrected rapidly to approximately 130 mM to prevent permanent brain damage. In contrast, in chronic severe hyponatremia (> 4 to 6 d), there is no brain edema and symptoms are usually mild. In such patients, a number of authors have recommended a correction rate < 0.5 mM/h to approximately 130 mM to minimize the risk of cerebral myelinolysis. Sometimes it is not possible to diagnose whether a severe hyponatremia is acute or chronic. In such cases, an initial imaging procedure is helpful in deciding whether rapid or slow correction should be prescribed. The modalities of treatment of severe hyponatremia have so far consisted of infusions of hypertonic saline plus fluid restriction. In the near future, vasopressin antagonists will become available. Preliminary experience has already demonstrated their efficiency of inducing a sustained water diuresis and a correction of hyponatremia.

### Sodium and its impact on outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in patients with and without delayed cerebral ischemia [^112szv8y]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Because previous studies have shown that fluid restriction and excessive fluid intake are risk factors for DCI and poor outcome, and our findings suggest that sodium is associated with poor outcome, future research should focus on sodium fluctuations while taking volemic status, underlying etiology of dysnatremia, medication and cardiac function into account. Monitoring sodium levels more than once a day in patients will provide a more accurate reflection of the sodium trajectory after aSAH. Furthermore, recording fluid balances prospectively may improve its reliability. If the importance of sodium and fluid balance is established, it might create incentive to record fluid balances accurately on the wards despite its labor-intensive nature or new ways to assess this. This study shows a robust signal and could serve as a prequel to future trials with a rigorous preselection of patients targeting the underlying causes of dysnatremia while controlling for confounders such as hypertension or hypotension and DCI. This could fill the gaps in knowledge and future directions.

Strengths of our study include the prospective registry use with standardized/structured outcome assessment, large sample size, and taking the day of DCI onset into account. Limitations are the retrospective collection of sodium levels resulting in missing and variation in available sodium levels between patients (ascertainment bias), conducting multiple statistical analyses (type 1 error), an underestimation or overestimation of the occurrence of hyponatremia and imprecise determination of the timing of hyponatremia occurrence. Oral/IV fluid intake, medications affecting sodium/water balance, and fluid balances were not included as it is often improperly recorded and unreliable when collected retrospectively. Lastly, patients who died within 3 days were excluded, which could affect the generalizability of our findings.

### Sodium and its impact on outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in patients with and without delayed cerebral ischemia [^111884we]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

We show that lower sodium levels, including hyponatremia, hypernatremia, and greater sodium fluctuations are not predictive of the development of DCI. Rather, significantly lower sodium levels are observed in patients after DCI occurs compared to patients without DCI, and the presence of DCI seems to be predictive of developing hyponatremia, lower sodium levels, and smaller sodium fluctuations. This can be partially explained as DCI patients received hypertension induction, which is standard treatment of DCI in our institution. Hypertension can cause natriuresis, resulting in lower sodium levels, while noradrenalin is associated with reduced natriuresis. However, enhanced salt loss due to cerebral salt wasting or a more pronounced syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (,–) due to DCI, can further contribute to lower sodium levels. Of note, from our data it is not possible to differentiate the underlying mechanisms of reduced sodium levels. Interestingly, we find that higher sodium levels, hypernatremia, and greater sodium fluctuations (independently) are associated with poor outcome in DCI and no-DCI patients. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been demonstrated before in this manner. Although, sodium levels, including changes, seem to be the result of DCI, our results suggest that changes or any deviation from the physiologic state of sodium levels of the patient could have a negative impact on the clinical outcome. However, the influence of other medication, (excessive) fluid intake or cardiac dysfunction, which could affect the sodium/water balance and volemic status, could not be ruled out except for hypertonic saline use. Since relatively great sodium fluctuations can occur within the clinically accepted normal range of sodium, a single measurement of sodium may fail to capture these relevant changes. Therefore, the focus should perhaps shift to sodium fluctuations, or even osmolality. Minimizing sodium fluctuations to maintain a stable sodium trajectory and osmolality might be of more importance than sodium levels and correcting hyponatremia. To minimize sodium fluctuations, a narrower range of "normal" sodium levels could be considered with the upper limit being lowered as patients with poor outcome had higher sodium levels than patients with good outcome. This should be considered carefully as the management of sodium may have limited influence on outcome due to the multifactorial and not-fully comprehended nature of the pathophysiology triggered by aSAH.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^114bTxzD]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

International guidelines designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia have been widely accepted for a decade. On the basis of the results of a recent large retrospective study of patients hospitalized with hyponatremia, it has been suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of rise of the serum sodium concentration; the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration has been questioned. These assertions are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. After reviewing the history of that controversy, the evidence supporting the guidelines, and the validity of data challenging them, we conclude that current safeguards should not be abandoned. To do so would be akin to discarding your umbrella because you remained dry in a rainstorm. The authors of this review, who represent 20 medical centers in nine countries, have all contributed significantly to the literature on the subject. We urge clinicians to continue to treat severe hyponatremia cautiously and to wait for better evidence before adopting less stringent therapeutic limits.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia [^111V9Y4A]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with severe (serum sodium ≤ 120 mEq/L), symptomatic hyponatremia can develop life-threatening or fatal complications from cerebral edema if treatment is inadequate and permanent neurologic disability from osmotic demyelination if treatment is excessive. Unfortunately, as is true of all electrolyte disturbances, there are no randomized trials to guide the treatment of this challenging disorder. Rather, therapeutic decisions rest on physiologic principles, animal models, observational studies, and single-patient reports. European guidelines and recommendations of an American Expert panel have come to similar conclusions on how much correction of hyponatremia is enough and how much is too much, but there are important differences. We review the evidence supporting these recommendations, identifying areas that rest on relatively solid ground and highlighting areas in greatest need of additional data.

### Mortality and serum sodium: do patients die from or with hyponatremia? [^1171sKiR]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Severe hyponatremia (< 120 mEq/L) in hospitalized patients has a high mortality rate. We hypothesized that underlying diseases causing hyponatremia attribute to mortality rather than hyponatremia itself.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

The relationship between mortality and serum sodium (sNa) was examined in 45,693 patients admitted to a single community teaching hospital between January 1996 and December 2007. We conducted a comprehensive retrospective review of the medical records of 53 patients who died after developing sNa < 120 mEq/L before or after admission and of 32 patients who survived after developing sNa < 110 mEq/L.

Results

Mortality rates tended to increase as the sNa fell from 134 to 120 mEq/L, rising above 10% for patients with sNa of 120 to 124 mEq/L. However, below sNa of 120 mEq/L, the trend reversed, such that the mortality rate progressively decreased as sNa fell. More than two thirds of patients who died after sNa < 120 mEq/L had at least two additional acute severe progressive illnesses, most commonly sepsis and multiorgan failure. Three deaths (5.6%) in 12 years could plausibly be related to adverse consequences of hyponatremia, and one (1.8% of the fatal cases and 0.15% of all patients with sNa < 120 mEq/L) was from cerebral edema. Most patients who survived with sNa < 110 mEq/L had medication-induced hyponatremia. Severe underlying illnesses were uncommon in this group.

Conclusions

The nature of underlying illness rather than the severity of hyponatremia best explains mortality associated with hyponatremia. Neurologic complications from hyponatremia are uncommon among patients who die with hyponatremia.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^116JUkNn]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Practice Guidelines

After weighing the evidence, the European Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended that correction of hyponatremia be limited to 10 mmol/L in the first day of treatment and 8 mmol/L for every subsequent day thereafter. An expert panel that included six physicians from the United States and one from Ireland (which we will call the "US/Irish expert panel") came to similar conclusions, but with some added nuance (expressed in italics). For chronically hyponatremic patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L (for example, outpatients drinking conventional volumes of water or treated with thiazides and hospital-acquired hyponatremia with a known duration > 48 hours) who were at normal risk of developing osmotic demyelination, the panel recommended a correction limit of 10–12 mmol/L in any 24-hour period and 18 mmol/L in any 48-hour period and a minimum correction of 4–8 mmol/L. The panel recommended increased vigilance for patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L at heightened risk of osmotic demyelination. Factors reported to be associated with a higher risk of osmotic demyelination include sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L, alcohol use disorder, hypokalemia, malnutrition, or advanced liver disease. In these high-risk patients, the US/Irish expert panel recommended that correction should not exceed 8 mmol/L in any 24-hour period and that the minimum daily correction goal should be 4–6 mmol/L. In patients without major risk factors for osmotic demyelination, the panel noted that correction by 8–12 mmol/L in the first day of therapy was greater than necessary, but unlikely to cause harm as long as the 2-day increment does not exceed 18 mmol/L.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: expert panel recommendations [^111WX8Kf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious, but often overlooked, electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema, and excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death as a result of osmotic demyelination. The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder. In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations that defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the 6 years since the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients. Therefore, additional guidance was deemed necessary and a panel of hyponatremia experts (which included all of the original panel members) was convened to update the previous recommendations for optimal current management of this disorder. The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia that are based on both consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent published data in this field.

Variables and audit standards

Hyponatraemic periods were defined from measurement of serum sodium < 135 mmol/L until a subsequent serum sodium measurement of ≥ 135 mmol/L was recorded.

We defined audit standards using ESOand ESEguidance (table 1). We used the best postresuscitation findings recorded within 48 hours of admission to define Glasgow Coma Score and World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) grade.WFNS grade was dichotomised as poor (IV–V) or good grade (I–III). A neurosurgical registrar or consultant determined the modified Fisher score on diagnostic CT brain. This was subsequently dichotomised as those with thin or no visible SAH (grade 0–1) or those with thick SAH or intraventricular haemorrhage (grade 2–4). Neurosurgeons and neuroradiologists determined the probable causative lesion. Aneurysms were classified as anterior circulation if they occurred at, or anterior to, the posterior communicating artery. Lesion management was trichotomised as conservative, endovascular or open surgical.

Table 1
Audit standards derived from ESO and ESE guidelines

We categorised preadmission use of medications associated with risk of hyponatraemia as none, one or more than one. These included antihypertensives, antipsychotics, antidepressants, antiepileptic medications and proton pump inhibitors. We recorded pre-existing diagnoses of diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, polycystic kidney disease, heart failure, adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism or hyponatraemia. Diagnoses of SIADH, CSW or other causes of hyponatraemia were recorded as determined by the treating team.

For each day of admission, volume status assessment was categorised as a bedside clinical assessment alone, or as fluid balance. Fluid balance was categorised as: positive (> 500 mL), neutral (0–500 mL, to account for insensible losses) or negative (< 0 mL). Target intake was similarly classified as high (target intake > 3 L or > 500 mL balance), neutral (intake 2–3 L or 0–500 mL balance), low (target intake < 2 L or balance < 0 mL). We included all measurements of serum sodium. We collected serum cortisol measurements if sampled prior to 09:00. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was determined at discharge and dichotomised for our primary outcome as slight or no dependency (0–2) versus dependency or death (3–6).

### Hyponatremia… [^111fGejk]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Treatment is based on the underlying cause. Correcting hyponatremia too quickly can lead to complications. Rapid partial correction with 3% normal saline is only recommended in those with significant symptoms and occasionally those in whom the condition was of rapid onset. Low volume hyponatremia is typically treated with intravenous normal saline. SIADH is typically treated by correcting the underlying cause and with fluid restriction while high volume hyponatremia is typically treated with both fluid restriction and a diet low in salt. Correction should generally be gradual in those in whom the low levels have been present for more than two days. Neurological symptoms typically occur with very low levels of plasma sodium. When sodium levels in the blood become very low, water enters the brain cells and causes them to swell. This results in increased pressure in the skull and causes hyponatremic encephalopathy.

As pressure increases in the skull, herniation of the brain can occur, which is a squeezing of the brain across the internal structures of the skull. This can lead to headache, nausea, vomiting, confusion, seizures, brain stem compression and respiratory arrest, and non-cardiogenic accumulation of fluid in the lungs. This is usually fatal if not immediately treated. Symptom severity depends on how fast and how severe the drop in blood sodium level is. A gradual drop, even to very low levels, may be tolerated well if it occurs over several days or weeks, because of neuronal adaptation. The presence of underlying neurological disease such as a seizure disorder or non-neurological metabolic abnormalities, also affects the severity of neurologic symptoms. Hyponatremia, by interfering with bone metabolism, has been linked with a doubled risk of osteoporosis and an increased risk of bone fracture.

Normal homeostasis There is a hypothalamic-kidney feedback system which normally maintains the concentration of the serum sodium within a narrow range. This system operates as follows: in some of the cells of the hypothalamus, there are osmoreceptors which respond to an elevated serum sodium in body fluids by signalling the posterior pituitary gland to secrete antidiuretic hormone. ADH then enters the bloodstream and signals the kidney to bring back sufficient solute-free water from the fluid in the kidney tubules to dilute the serum sodium back to normal, and this turns off the osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus. Also, thirst is stimulated. Normally, when mild hyponatremia begins to occur, that is, the serum sodium begins to fall below 135 mEq/L, there is no secretion of ADH, and the kidney stops returning water to the body from the kidney tubule. Also, no thirst is experienced. These two act in concert to raise the serum sodium to the normal range.

Sodium is the primary positively charged ion outside of the cell and cannot cross from the interstitial space into the cell. This is because charged sodium ions attract around them up to 25 water molecules, thereby creating a large polar structure too large to pass through the cell membrane: "channels" or "pumps" are required. Cell swelling also produces activation of volume-regulated anion channels which is related to the release of taurine and glutamate from astrocytes. Diagnosis The history, physical exam, and laboratory testing are required to determine the underlying cause of hyponatremia. A blood test demonstrating a serum sodium less than 135 mmol/L is diagnostic for hyponatremia. The history and physical exam are necessary to help determine if the person is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic, which has important implications in determining the underlying cause. An assessment is also made to determine if the person is experiencing symptoms from their hyponatremia.

### Management of hyponatremia and volume contraction [^113iXiFV]. Neurocritical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte imbalance seen in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, occurring in one-third to one-half of patients. Hyponatremia may be caused by cerebral salt wasting and by the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone or a combination of both. Limited data are available describing hyponatremia treatment in subarachnoid hemorrhage patients. A Medline search was performed for English-language manuscripts describing original research in the treatment for hyponatremia in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Seven appropriate articles were identified as followed: three testing fludrocortisone, two hydrocortisone, and one each for hypertonic saline and 5% albumin. Data quality for treatment efficacy and safety were moderate for corticosteroid studies and low or very low for hypertonic saline and 5% albumin. Available data, although limited, support early treatment with corticosteroids to limit hyponatremia, with fludrocortisone causing fewer side effects.

### Sodium and water perturbations in patients who had an acute stroke: clinical relevance and management strategies for the neurologist [^112ph1vU]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

For acute symptomatic hyponatraemia, increasing serum sodium levels by 4–6 mmol/L can decrease the risk of herniation and stop seizure activity. Larger increases should be avoided and can be harmful to patients with chronic hyponatraemia. European guidelines in non-stroke patients recommend rapid hypertonic 3% saline infusion depending on severity of symptoms, with two 150 mL boluses over 20 min with a sodium level assessment between boluses, whereas US expert panels recommend 100 mL hypertonic 3% saline bolus over 10 min and repeated as needed for symptom management in severe clinical cases. We recommend that the rate of correction for acute, symptomatic hyponatraemia to be 8–10 mmol/L in the first 24 hours. Serum sodium levels need to be monitored closely to minimise the risk of overcorrection (ie, no faster than 10–12 mmol/L/day for the first 24 hours), and avoid the administration of isotonic fluids and large volumes of hypertonic fluids to patients with underlying congestive heart failure or chronic renal failure (two common comorbidities in patients who had an acute stroke), as this may lead to cardiac decompensation and pulmonary oedema. In hypovolaemic hyponatraemic patients who had an acute stroke, it is imperative to avoid an overly rapid rise in serum sodium levels when volume depletion is restored as an abrupt decrease in AVP secretion and a rapid diuresis may occur. Large volumes of urine excretion at this juncture indicates an inappropriate overcorrection of hypovolaemia.

Because most hyponatraemia cases are chronic, when there is doubt of the duration of hyponatraemia, the presumption should be that the patient has chronic hyponatraemia. In this setting, large increases in serum sodium levels (10 mmol/L in 24 hours or 18 mmol/L in 48 hours) should be avoided, unless the patient is actively seizing. In patients at high risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome (eg, hypokalaemia, alcoholism, liver disease and malnutrition), correction should not exceed 4–6 mmol/L/day, whereas in patients with low risk, target maximum rise of 4–8 mmol/L/day with a target maximum limit not to exceed 10–12 mmol/L in any 24 hours or 18 mmol/L in any 48 hours is recommended.

### Urea for hyponatremia? [^113wC389]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Once the standard of care for cerebral edema, urea can also be used to treat hyponatremia. The 2014 European Clinical Practice Guidelines recommend urea for the treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, while discouraging use of vasopressin antagonists. Although there is evidence that urea can diminish hypertonic injury to brain cells caused by rapid correction of hyponatremia, clinical trials are needed that include patients at high risk to develop complications from overcorrection.

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage hyponatremia and corticosteroids — hyponatremia (with or without polyuria or natriuresis) is prominent and, when clinically significant with uncontrolled natriuresis, can cause intravascular volume depletion requiring high-intensity ICU interventions; several moderately sized RCTs found fludrocortisone reduced excess sodium excretion, urine volume, hyponatremia, and intravenous fluid use during acute aSAH but did not consistently reduce DCI or affect outcome, with hypokalemia requiring potassium supplementation noted, whereas high-dose hydrocortisone produced similar natriuretic effects but more complications including hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and congestive heart failure.

Hypernatremia, also spelled hypernatraemia, is a high concentration of sodium in the blood. Early symptoms may include a strong feeling of thirst, weakness, nausea, and loss of appetite. Severe symptoms include confusion, muscle twitching, and bleeding in or around the brain. Normal serum sodium levels are 135–145 mmol/L. Hypernatremia is generally defined as a serum sodium level of more than 145 mmol/L. Severe symptoms typically only occur when levels are above 160 mmol/L. Hypernatremia is typically classified by a person's fluid status into low volume, normal volume, and high volume. Low volume hypernatremia can occur from sweating, vomiting, diarrhea, diuretic medication, or kidney disease. Normal volume hypernatremia can be due to fever, extreme thirst, prolonged increased breath rate, diabetes insipidus, and from lithium among other causes.

High volume hypernatremia can be due to hyperaldosteronism, excessive administration of intravenous normal saline or sodium bicarbonate, or rarely from eating too much salt. Low blood protein levels can result in a falsely high sodium measurement. The cause can usually be determined by the history of events. Testing the urine can help if the cause is unclear. The underlying mechanism typically involves too little free water in the body. If the onset of hypernatremia was over a few hours, then it can be corrected relatively quickly using intravenous normal saline and 5% dextrose in water. Otherwise, correction should occur slowly with, for those unable to drink water, half-normal saline. Hypernatremia due to diabetes insipidus as a result of a brain disorder, may be treated with the medication desmopressin. If the diabetes insipidus is due to kidney problems the medication causing the problem may need to be stopped or the underlying electrolyte disturbance corrected.

Hypernatremia affects 0. 3–1% of people in hospital. It most often occurs in babies, those with impaired mental status, and the elderly. Hypernatremia is associated with an increased risk of death, but it is unclear if it is the cause. Signs and symptoms The major symptom is thirst. The most important signs result from brain cell shrinkage and include confusion, muscle twitching or spasms. With severe elevations, seizures and comas may occur. Severe symptoms are usually due to acute elevation of the plasma sodium concentration to above 157 mmol/L. Values above 180 mmol/L are associated with a high mortality rate, particularly in adults. However, such high levels of sodium rarely occur without severe coexisting medical conditions. Serum sodium concentrations have ranged from 150 to 228 mmol/L in survivors of acute salt overdosage, while levels of 153–255 mmol/L have been observed in fatalities.

Vitreous humor is considered to be a better postmortem specimen than postmortem serum for assessing sodium involvement in a death. Cause Common causes of hypernatremia include: Low volume In those with low volume or hypovolemia:

- Inadequate intake of free water associated with total body sodium depletion. Typically in elderly or otherwise disabled patients who are unable to take in water as their thirst dictates and also are sodium depleted. This is the most common cause of hypernatremia.
- Excessive losses of water from the urinary tract – which may be caused by glycosuria, or other osmotic diuretics – leads to a combination of sodium and free water losses.
- Water losses associated with extreme sweating.
- Severe watery diarrhea watery diarrhea resulting in significant loss of free water and a higher concentration of sodium in the blood; this type of water loss can also be seen with viral gastroenteritis).
