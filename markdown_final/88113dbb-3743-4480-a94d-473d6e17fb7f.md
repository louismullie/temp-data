## Question

What recommendations would you make for a man with low testosterone?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing a man with low testosterone, including when to initiate testosterone therapy and how to monitor it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the biochemical diagnosis correctly. Then, I should classify the hypogonadism phenotype and look for reversible causes. Next, I will screen for contraindications and prioritize lifestyle modification where appropriate. After that, I will engage in shared decision-making about whether to start therapy, select a preparation, and establish a monitoring plan. Finally, I need to address special populations and summarize core recommendations, ensuring I verify any areas of controversy as I go [^111zq8AY] [^1124R92x].

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis carefully because a single low value is not enough. I should obtain two separate early morning fasting total testosterone measurements, using a validated, harmonized assay, given diurnal and day-to-day variability and the fact that up to 30% of initially low results normalize on repeat testing; if total testosterone is borderline or SHBG is altered, I need to measure or accurately calculate free testosterone and avoid direct analog immunoassays, which are unreliable [^111zq8AY] [^115LrmTB] [^116yTpN9] [^1124R92x].

> Hold on, let me not jump to conclusions about symptoms because pretest probability matters. Sexual symptoms such as decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and reduced morning erections correlate more consistently with low testosterone, whereas fatigue and low mood are nonspecific; I should also screen for depression and other mimics to avoid misattribution of symptoms to testosterone deficiency alone [^114XKuPY].

> Next, I should review gonadotropins to phenotype the disorder. Measuring LH and FSH helps distinguish primary from secondary hypogonadism and guides pituitary evaluation when secondary causes are suspected; at the same time, I need to check for functional suppression of the HPT axis due to obesity, diabetes, sleep apnea, chronic illness, or medications, recognizing pseudohypogonadism patterns with low SHBG where total testosterone looks low but free testosterone is preserved; I will keep in mind the ongoing debate over the clinical value and analytic robustness of free testosterone assessments and interpret them cautiously in context [^112UQRiA] [^1132LYjC] [^1138udww] [^114kbPD3] [^115qUems].

> I will now categorize the hypogonadism, since that shapes treatment urgency. Organic hypogonadism with intrinsic HPT–testicular pathology typically warrants testosterone replacement to induce and maintain secondary sexual characteristics and treat deficiency symptoms, whereas functional or age-related low testosterone often calls for addressing underlying conditions first and using shared decision-making given modest and variable benefits [^112XtTwV] [^1132LYjC] [^111WJUkJ].

> Before any therapy, I should double-check for absolute and relative contraindications to avoid harm. I must exclude active prostate or breast cancer, unexplained prostate nodules or induration, PSA greater than 4 ng/mL or greater than 3 ng/mL in higher-risk men without urologic evaluation, severe lower urinary tract symptoms, recent myocardial infarction or stroke within 6 months, uncontrolled heart failure, untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea, elevated hematocrit or polycythemia, and thrombophilia; I also need to assess fertility goals because exogenous testosterone suppresses spermatogenesis and may require alternatives such as hCG or SERMs with urologic or reproductive endocrinology input [^112uJAkp] [^111EwMYk] [^114SABhW] [^115frEKF] [^111SoYaH].

> Let me consider reversibility and start with lifestyle first where appropriate. In men with functional or obesity-related low testosterone, weight loss, exercise, and dietary improvement often raise testosterone by about 10 to 30 percent and may normalize values over 6 to 12 months; even if testosterone therapy is later used, lifestyle change remains foundational and may preserve overall health gains, though the evidence quality and generalizability vary by age and frailty [^113BAEvt] [^114W9Cp4] [^1131nGsM].

> Now I should engage in shared decision-making for therapy initiation, verifying the strength of evidence. For organic hypogonadism, treatment is generally indicated; for age-related low testosterone with sexual dysfunction, I should explain that benefits on libido and erectile function are modest and other domains like energy, mood, cognition, and physical function may show little to no improvement, then set a plan to reassess and discontinue if sexual function does not improve by 12 months, while counseling that cardiovascular and prostate risks remain uncertain due to limited trial power and selection, and that erythrocytosis is a known, monitorable risk [^113PZwiR] [^117Ubn9i] [^113esc8W] [^114KgtLi] [^116p4z6a].

> I need to choose a formulation through shared decision-making, but wait, let me verify the nuance here. I initially think transdermal routes are preferred for physiologic profiles and flexibility, yet the ACP suggests intramuscular preparations are substantially less costly with similar effectiveness and harms for sexual outcomes; the EAA prefers transdermal in functional hypogonadism, so I should align choice with patient preferences, cost, adherence, and monitoring, and I must avoid using testosterone to improve glycemic control, dyslipidemia, or general cardiometabolic outcomes where it is not indicated [^11592cGr] [^111zXZFJ] [^114ahYUk] [^116d4Cvz] [^114NGeLQ].

> I should confirm a rigorous baseline and follow-up monitoring protocol. Baseline assessment includes PSA with digital rectal examination, hematocrit and hemoglobin, liver function, cardiovascular risk appraisal, and bone density when indicated; after initiation, I will reassess symptoms, serum testosterone aiming for mid-normal levels, PSA, hematocrit, and liver enzymes at 3 to 6 months and then every 6 to 12 months, referring for urologic evaluation if PSA rises suspiciously and holding or reducing therapy if hematocrit exceeds 54 percent [^112uJAkp] [^111SoYaH] [^11618rAB].

> Let me verify the target range and assay considerations. The practical goal is to restore testosterone into the mid-normal physiologic range using a reliable, harmonized assay, with some societies citing a working target of approximately 15 to 30 nmol/L, and I should ensure the laboratory method aligns with standardized reference ranges to permit meaningful interpretation and titration [^111HqSMM] [^115LrmTB].

> I will now examine special populations and scenarios. In men older than 65, I almost said to avoid therapy outright, but wait, I should verify this; although one Endocrine Society statement cautions against routine initiation in older men, the same guideline emphasizes individualized consideration for symptomatic men over 65 with unequivocally low testosterone after careful risk assessment, including prostate monitoring discussions; for prostate cancer survivors, restricting therapy to those at low risk with stable, undetectable PSA after at least a year and in collaboration with urology is prudent; for men desiring fertility, I must avoid testosterone and consider alternatives; for cardiovascular disease, I should optimize risk factors and monitor closely, as contemporary evidence does not show clear increased events but is not definitive [^113oiG16] [^114PXEUq] [^114WLcGt] [^114KgtLi].

> I should confirm a plan for reassessment and possible discontinuation. For age-related low testosterone treated primarily for sexual symptoms, it is reasonable to trial therapy with explicit goals and discontinue if benefits are not realized by 12 months, recognizing that some patients report no symptom decline after cessation and that periodic drug holidays can help reassess ongoing need and net benefit in shared decision-making [^114TwRZc] [^115QEYwb].

> But wait, what about diagnostic thresholds and repeats across guidelines; I need to check those carefully. Many North American sources use a practical total testosterone cutoff around 300 ng/dL with repeat measurement, whereas the EAU cites 12 nmol/L as a threshold for late-onset hypogonadism; to reduce misclassification, I should use laboratory- and assay-specific reference ranges, repeat morning fasting tests on two occasions, and incorporate SHBG and calculated free testosterone when indicated by borderline values or altered binding proteins [^113ss2Ag] [^1115QkK5] [^111zq8AY] [^1145zyce] [^114mNUJU].

> In summary, I need to rigorously confirm biochemical hypogonadism aligned with symptoms, classify etiology, and address reversible contributors first; I must screen meticulously for contraindications, use shared decision-making to set realistic expectations about modest sexual benefits and uncertain long-term risks, select a preparation tailored to patient preferences and cost, and monitor closely for efficacy and safety with a low threshold to discontinue if goals are unmet, especially in age-related cases [^112uJAkp] [^111zXZFJ].

In men with low testosterone, **confirm the diagnosis with two separate fasting morning total testosterone measurements** [^1124R92x] [^111zq8AY], and measure LH/FSH to distinguish primary from secondary hypogonadism [^112UQRiA]. Address reversible causes (obesity, sleep apnea, medications) [^114W9Cp4] and implement lifestyle changes (weight loss, exercise, reduced alcohol) [^113BAEvt] [^1131nGsM]. Reserve testosterone therapy for **symptomatic men with confirmed low levels**, after discussing risks and benefits [^112XtTwV], and avoid TRT in men with prostate/breast cancer [^112uJAkp], severe cardiovascular disease, or elevated hematocrit. Monitor hematocrit, PSA, and testosterone at regular intervals [^115frEKF] [^11618rAB], and discontinue TRT if no symptom improvement occurs [^114TwRZc].

---

## Diagnostic confirmation and evaluation

- **Confirm diagnosis**: Measure fasting morning total testosterone on two separate days [^1124R92x] [^111zq8AY] confirm if < 300 ng/dL (10.41 nmol/L).

- **Differentiate etiology**: Measure LH and FSH [^112UQRiA] to distinguish primary (testicular) from secondary (pituitary/hypothalamic) hypogonadism.

- **Free testosterone**: Assess when total testosterone is borderline [^114mNUJU] or SHBG is abnormal [^116yTpN9].

- **Additional tests**: Evaluate prolactin, iron studies, and consider pituitary imaging if secondary hypogonadism is suspected [^112uJAkp].

---

## Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle changes can **increase testosterone by 10–30%** [^113BAEvt] and may normalize levels in some men [^114W9Cp4].

- **Weight loss**: Aim for BMI < 25 kg/m² [^113BAEvt] through caloric restriction and regular exercise [^1131nGsM].

- **Exercise**: Engage in resistance and aerobic training to improve testosterone and overall health [^113BAEvt].

- **Alcohol**: Limit intake, as excess alcohol lowers testosterone.

- **Sleep**: Treat obstructive sleep apnea and ensure adequate sleep [^114W9Cp4].

---

## Medical management

### Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT)

TRT is indicated for **symptomatic men with confirmed low testosterone** after shared decision-making [^112XtTwV].

- **Indications**: Symptomatic hypogonadism with confirmed low testosterone [^112XtTwV] [^113DZd9u].

- **Contraindications**: Prostate/breast cancer [^112uJAkp], severe cardiovascular disease, elevated hematocrit, severe LUTS [^114SABhW], untreated sleep apnea.

- **Formulations**: Intramuscular injections [^111zXZFJ], transdermal gels/patches [^11592cGr], subcutaneous pellets; choose based on patient preference and cost [^112VWYRz].

- **Monitoring**: Check hematocrit, PSA, and testosterone at 3–6 months, then annually [^115frEKF]; discontinue if no symptom improvement [^114TwRZc].

---

### Alternative pharmacologic options

Alternative pharmacologic options include **Clomiphene citrate** for secondary hypogonadism, especially if fertility is desired, and **Aromatase inhibitors** for select cases with elevated estradiol [^116ksMPB].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Patient education and counseling should cover **potential benefits** (sexual function, mood, bone density) [^113esc8W] and **risks** (erythrocytosis, prostate effects, cardiovascular concerns) [^114KgtLi] [^112XtTwV]. Because TRT can suppress spermatogenesis, discuss fertility goals and consider alternatives if fertility is desired [^112uJAkp]. Emphasize adherence to therapy and regular monitoring.

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

For follow-up, **regular monitoring** includes hematocrit, PSA, and testosterone levels [^111SoYaH] at 3–6 months, then annually [^115frEKF]. Discontinue if ineffective: **stop TRT if no symptom improvement within 12 months** [^114TwRZc] [^117Ubn9i].

---

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^113BAEvt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

In addition to providing general health benefits, there is evidence that lifestyle changes might increase mean serum testosterone by 10% to 30%, which might normalize testosterone concentrations in our patient and improve many of his symptoms that overlap with hypogonadism. However, the data mostly come from cohort studies of supervised lifestyle interventions. These studies had small numbers of participants who were typically younger (30–50 years of age), with relatively short follow-up periods (< 1–2 years), and variable methodologies in the assessment of serum testosterone concentrations.

Some evidence suggests that lifestyle interventions might be less successful at normalizing serum testosterone concentrations and improving function in older, frailer men. The degree to which the increase in serum testosterone is responsible for the improvement seen with androgen deficiency-like features (e.g. erectile function, physical performance) is not certain. Whether concomitant testosterone treatment improves the efficacy of lifestyle interventions requires further study, but preliminary evidence suggests that testosterone therapy preserves lean mass compared to placebo during caloric restriction.

In summary, the single most important intervention for our patient and many older men with a high BMI and low serum testosterone concentration might be lifestyle changes. This includes increased exercise, caloric restriction, and improved diet to reduce weight.

The decision to treat medical conditions always involves an analysis of the benefits and risks; that analysis is particularly important in the decision to initiate testosterone therapy in men ≥ 50 years. Although testosterone replacement for men with organic hypogonadism is uncontroversial irrespective of age, men ≥ 50 years old with nonspecific symptoms, reproducibly low serum testosterone concentrations, normal serum gonadotropins, and no evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary disease often have improved health and well-being. This can be achieved through optimization of weight and comorbidities and stopping or reducing the dosage of medications that affect the HPT axis.

In addition, therapies other than testosterone should be considered for symptoms and signs that might be attributed to hypogonadism: PDE5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction; treatment of sleep apnea, depression, obesity, and diabetes mellitus with proven effective therapies; and medications that reduce fractures for osteoporosis. It is reasonable to add testosterone treatment to men ≥ 50 years with persistent symptoms of hypogonadism and reproducibly low serum testosterone (measured fasted in the morning when the man is at baseline health) and normal serum gonadotropin concentrations despite lifestyle measures for 6–12 months to lose weight (if BMI > 25 kg/m²) and optimization of management of comorbidities. This decision must be individualized and is not algorithmic, and there should be no contraindication.

Regarding medical management for male hypogonadism, particularly with respect to testosterone therapy, the Endocrine Society's 2018 guidelines recommend initiating testosterone replacement therapy in patients aged 55–69 years with hypogonadism and a life expectancy greater than 10 years. This should occur only after discussing the potential benefits and risks, including evaluating prostate cancer risk and monitoring. It is crucial to engage the patient in shared decision-making regarding prostate cancer monitoring. Prostate cancer risk should be assessed before starting testosterone therapy and again 3–12 months after initiation in patients who choose monitoring.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^115QEYwb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

He began transdermal testosterone therapy at a typical replacement dosage, and the dosage was adjusted to achieve a serum total testosterone in the normal range. At 3- and 6-month follow-up evaluations, he reported improved sense of well-being and sexual function. His serum hemoglobin and hematocrit had increased 5% above baseline, but both remained in the normal range. He had lost another 4.3 kg (and now weighs 93.0 kg) with diet and exercise; total weight loss was 6.3 kg, approximately 6% of body weight since his initial evaluation. At 12 months of follow-up, he reported that the "testosterone therapy does not seem to be working as well for sexual function". His bone density (2 years after the last bone densitometry) was not significantly changed.

After discussion, he agreed to discontinue testosterone therapy and reassess serum testosterone. Two months after discontinuation, his serum total testosterone was 260 ng/dL (9.02 nmol/L; reference range, 264–916 ng/dL or 9.16–31.8 nmol/L) in a validated, harmonized assay, and his serum free T was 75 pg/mL (259 pmol/L; reference range, 66–272.3 pg/mL or 229–710 pmol/L). Repeat testing 3 months after discontinuation demonstrated a serum total testosterone of 266 ng/dL (9.2 nmol/L), and a serum calculated free T of 77 pg/mL (267 pmol/L). He noticed no change in symptoms after discontinuation of testosterone therapy and enquired about a higher dosage of testosterone.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^115LrmTB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Reproducibly low serum total testosterone concentrations measured by an accurate testosterone assay on a sample drawn in the early morning (7–10 a.m.) in the fasting state are a cornerstone of the diagnosis of male hypogonadism. It is optimal to use a total testosterone assay that has been validated by an accuracy-based standardization or quality control program with a normal range of 264–916 ng/dL (9.16–31.8 nmol/L) in healthy, young men. The use of such an assay facilitates application of findings of the T-Trials, the largest randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing testosterone vs. placebo with clinically important outcomes in men with low serum testosterone concentrations, and the soon-to-be-reported TRAVERSE study, a large RCT with cardiovascular outcomes; these trials used a standardized, harmonized total testosterone assay with this normal range.

If the initial serum total testosterone is low, confirmation is required. Without compelling evidence (e.g. specific clinical features, such as very small testes and high serum gonadotropin concentrations), androgen deficiency should not be diagnosed with a single low testosterone concentration because of significant diurnal and day-to-day variation. Up to 30% of older men with a low serum testosterone concentration have a normal value on repeat testing. Overnight fasting increases serum testosterone by 9% to 16% and reduces the significant diurnal variability of serum testosterone concentrations. Most experts prefer to err in underdiagnosing.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^114XKuPY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

The evaluation of a patient for clinically evident androgen deficiency starts by determining the pretest probability of hypogonadism. Due to the overlap of nonspecific symptoms of hypogonadism and depression, it is important to differentiate between the two conditions. For instance, in this case, the patient's reported depressed mood and fatigue were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, which screened negative for major depression.

A careful assessment of symptoms and signs more specific to hypogonadism is crucial. In the European Male Ageing Study, three sexual symptoms — low libido, erectile dysfunction, and reduced morning erections — were consistently associated with a low serum testosterone level. Notably, diminished libido had the highest odds ratio for low serum testosterone concentrations. It is essential to remember that this study's cross-sectional nature means causality cannot be established. The association between sexual symptoms and low serum testosterone could be due to reverse causation, where reduced sexual activity might contribute to lower testosterone levels. In fact, even men with normal serum testosterone levels in the study reported these sexual symptoms at a prevalence of 25% to 35%.

The symptoms of fatigue and low mood, on the other hand, are nonspecific and hold low diagnostic value, as they might be caused by systemic diseases. The presence of sexual dysfunction symptoms along with low serum testosterone concentrations should alert healthcare professionals to the possibility of androgen deficiency.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1132LYjC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Men with low serum testosterone concentrations can be characterized as having classic hypogonadism (sometimes called organic hypogonadism) due to an identifiable pathology or disorder of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT, gonadal) axis, or they can be characterized as eugonadal with suppression of the gonadal axis due to a systemic disorder or condition. A low serum testosterone due to suppression of the gonadal axis by a systemic disorder is analogous to the changes in thyroid function seen in euthyroid sick syndrome and is sometimes described as functional hypogonadism. Similar to euthyroid sick syndrome (or nonthyroidal illness), men with low serum testosterone due to suppression of the HPT axis by systemic disease might have underlying normal HPT function.

Because the serum testosterone might normalize if the underlying disorder is treated and health is restored, eugonadal sick syndrome or nongonadal illness might be more accurate terms than functional hypogonadism. These terms have the advantage of identifying the underlying gonadal axis as normal and not conflating functional with reversible; pathologies and disorders associated with classic hypogonadism are also potentially reversible (e.g. hyperprolactinemia, iron overload syndromes). Classic pathologic hypogonadism is relatively uncommon with an estimated lifetime prevalence of less than 1%. Low serum testosterone due to suppression of the HPT axis is common and increases with age and body mass index (BMI). Some experts use the term late-onset hypogonadism for functional hypogonadism in older men.

### Testosterone therapy in adult men with androgen deficiency syndromes: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^113EYWFv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

The objective was to provide guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of androgen deficiency syndromes in adult men.

- **Participants**: The Task Force was composed of a chair selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, five additional experts, a methodologist, and a professional writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

- **Evidence**: The Task Force used systematic reviews of available evidence to inform its key recommendations. Consistent language and graphical descriptions of both the strength of recommendation and the quality of evidence were employed, following the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation group's guidelines.

- **Consensus process**: Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions during three group meetings, several conference calls, and email communications. Drafts prepared by the panelists with the help of a professional writer were successively reviewed by The Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee, Clinical Affairs Committee, and Council. The version approved by the Council was posted on The Endocrine Society's website for comments by members. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated necessary changes.

- **Conclusions**: We recommend making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency only in men with consistent symptoms and signs and unequivocally low serum testosterone levels. We suggest measuring the morning total testosterone level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic step.

- **Gonadal insufficiency**: Boys and men should not be screened for gonadal insufficiency. If symptoms manifest, gonadal insufficiency should be evaluated with biochemical testing (early morning testosterone, LH, FSH). In boys, delayed progression to puberty could indicate gonadal insufficiency (testicular volume < 4 mL and/or no signs of puberty by the age of 14 years).

	- Abnormal hormone levels indicating gonadal insufficiency have been described in boys and men with ALD. The clinical relevance of these findings remains unclear. For instance, erectile dysfunction may reflect primary gonadal insufficiency or can be caused by spinal cord disease. Testing (gonadotrophins and testosterone measured in the early morning) is only recommended if there are symptoms.

- **Treatment of gonadal insufficiency**: Treatment of gonadal insufficiency is restricted to endocrinologists. Transdermal testosterone or long-acting testosterone ester injections can be used to treat gonadal insufficiency if levels are below normal and symptoms are present.

- **Dietary therapy**: Data to support the efficacy of Lorenzo's oil as a disease-modifying treatment in patients with ALD is insufficient. Lorenzo's oil (oleic acid [C18:1] and erucic acid [C22:1]) in combination with a low-fat diet reduces plasma C26:0 levels to near-normal values in most patients, but controlled clinical trials showing improved outcomes are lacking.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1136CcxY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Although testosterone replacement in men with classic hypogonadism due to an identified pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is uncontroversial, the role of testosterone treatment for men with age-related declines in circulating testosterone is unclear. This is due to the lack of large, long-term testosterone therapy trials assessing definitive clinical endpoints. However, men ≥ 50 years of age, particularly those who have a body mass index > 25 kg/m² and multiple comorbidities, commonly present with clinical features of androgen deficiency and low serum testosterone concentrations. Clinicians face the question of whether to initiate testosterone therapy, a difficult dilemma that entails a benefit-risk analysis with limited evidence from clinical trials. Using a case scenario, we present a practical approach to the clinical assessment and management of such men.

### Clinical practice update on testosterone therapy for male hypogonadism: Contrasting perspectives to optimize care [^111WJUkJ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

The US Endocrine Society (ES) published a clinical practice guideline on testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism, and the Endocrine Society of Australia (ESA) released a position statement on the management of male hypogonadism. Both emphasize the importance of diagnosing men who are androgen deficient due to organic (classical or pathological) hypogonadism arising from disorders of the hypothalamus, pituitary, or testes, who assuredly benefit from testosterone therapy.

Both recognize that men with an intact gonadal axis may have low testosterone concentrations, for instance, older men or men with obesity or other medical comorbidities. ES guidelines classify such symptomatic men as having organic (advanced age) or functional (obesity, medical comorbidities) hypogonadism, providing an option for testosterone therapy as a shared decision between clinicians and individual patients. ESA did not recommend testosterone therapy in these men.

ES offers a reference range for total testosterone established in young men, while ESA cites age-standardized reference ranges. ES recommends using free testosterone as well as total testosterone to identify men with hypogonadism in conditions where sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is altered, or when total testosterone is borderline. ESA recommends confirmatory biochemical testing with total testosterone, recognizing that this may be lower than expected if SHBG concentrations are low.

Both emphasize the importance of identifying pre-existing prostate and cardiovascular disease prior to initiating testosterone therapy, with ES providing specific recommendations.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^115TWE1i]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

The international panel concluded that the only evidence-based indication for testosterone therapy for women is for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), with available data supporting a moderate therapeutic effect. There are insufficient data to support the use of testosterone for the treatment of any other symptom or clinical condition, or for disease prevention.

Meta-analyses of the available data show no severe adverse events during physiological testosterone use, with the caveat that women at high cardiometabolic risk were excluded from study populations. The safety of long-term testosterone therapy has not been established.

It was considered of utmost importance that the diagnosis of HSDD involves a full clinical assessment and that other factors contributing to female sexual dysfunction (FSD) must be identified and addressed before testosterone therapy is initiated. A blood total testosterone level should not be used to diagnose HSDD. Treatment should only be with formulations that achieve blood concentrations of testosterone that approximate premenopausal physiological concentrations. Because no approved female product is presently approved by a national regulatory body, male formulations can be judiciously used in female doses, and blood testosterone concentrations must be monitored regularly. The panel recommended against the use of compounded testosterone.

The panel highlighted the pressing need for more research into testosterone therapy for women and the development and licensing of products indicated specifically for women.

### Approach to the patient: Low testosterone concentrations in men with obesity [^114kbPD3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Free testosterone, whether measured or calculated using equilibrium binding or empirical equations, is advocated by some experts to appraise androgen status in certain circumstances. However, such recommendations are based on observational data and received wisdom rather than objective evidence from controlled clinical testing and, therefore, in our opinion, add nothing useful to the clinical evaluation. The free testosterone hypothesis, which asserts that free testosterone is the most biologically active moiety of testosterone, is conceptually flawed. Unbound testosterone is equally accessible to sites of degradation as it is to target tissues, so there is no logical basis to claim it is more, rather than less, biologically active.

In addition, reference laboratory dialysis-based measurements of free testosterone are nonrobust, costly, and rarely available. Most laboratories report calculations based on formulae incorporating serum testosterone and SHBG measurements. However, such calculations are consistently inaccurate relative to dialysis-based measurements due to assumptions such as using SHBG mass as a substitute for SHBG binding capacity, the use of four different nonharmonized SHBG immunoassays, and the use of five different empirical estimates of testosterone-SHBG binding affinity. Furthermore, free testosterone is not a valid analytical variable, as it lacks a certified reference standard, violating a fundamental principle of analytical chemistry requiring comparison of like with like. As a result, free testosterone lacks sufficient quality control.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1176zTxe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

In this article, we use a case-based approach to outline the assessment and management of men older than 50 years presenting with features of androgen deficiency and a low testosterone level, based on a review of the literature (PubMed), using the search terms "male hypogonadism", "testosterone deficiency", "androgen deficiency", "functional hypogonadism", and "late onset hypogonadism", as well as the clinical experience of the authors. We focus on the diagnosis and management of possible androgen deficiency. Fertility will not be discussed. Many of the principles and recommendations that we discuss are pertinent to men under age 50. However, we focus on men ≥ 50 years old in this manuscript because of the following:

- **Significant prevalence increase**: The prevalence of low serum testosterone concentrations without identifiable HPT pathology increases significantly in men starting at age 40–50.

- **Research focus**: Most of the high-quality epidemiological and randomized controlled studies of men with low serum testosterone concentrations without identifiable HPT pathology were performed in men ≥ 50 years old.

- **Diagnostic differences**: The diagnostic evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years old differ from younger men because:
	- Evaluation for hypothalamic and pituitary disease with sellar imaging and evaluation for iron overload syndromes is often unnecessary in older men.
	- Infertility due to HPT dysfunction is less commonly important for men ≥ 50 years old.
	- Long-term suppression of the HPT axis (iatrogenic androgen deficiency) is much more likely to occur with exogenous testosterone therapy in men ≥ 50 years old.

### Testosterone replacement in men with sexual dysfunction [^111cn3Tq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines recommend testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) for men with sexual dysfunction and testosterone deficiency. However, TRT is commonly promoted in men without testosterone deficiency, and existing trials often do not clearly report participants' testosterone levels or testosterone-related symptoms. This review assesses the potential benefits and harms of TRT in men presenting with complaints of sexual dysfunction.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of testosterone replacement therapy compared to placebo or other medical treatments in men with sexual dysfunction.

- **Search methods**: We performed a comprehensive search of CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the trials registries ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, with no restrictions on language of publication or publication status, up to 29 August 2023.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in men (40 years or over) with sexual dysfunction. We excluded men with primary or secondary hypogonadism. We compared testosterone or testosterone with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5I) to placebo or PDE5I alone.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently screened the literature, assessed the risk of bias, extracted data, and rated the certainty of evidence (CoE) according to GRADE using a minimally contextualized approach. We performed statistical analyses using a random-effects model and interpreted them according to standard Cochrane methodology.

### Update in testosterone therapy for men [^114z4BLz]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Male hypogonadism is a condition characterized by inadequate testicular production of sex steroids and sperm; however, the term is more commonly used to identify testosterone (T) deficiency. When fertility is not desired, T replacement therapy (TRT) is the gold standard.

- **Aim**: To review the pathogenesis of male hypogonadism and the available preparations for TRT, along with the main clinical outcomes.

- **Methods**: A systematic search of published evidence was performed using Medline (1969 to September 2010). Data from a consecutive series of subjects attending our Andrology Unit were also provided to stress the clinical correlates of low T. Inventories available for detecting hypogonadism, including ANDROTEST, were overviewed.

- **Main outcome measures**: The most important studies regarding the pathogenesis of male hypogonadism and the preparations for its treatment were reviewed. To review TRT outcomes, only meta-analytic studies were considered.

- **Results**: The goals of TRT are to alleviate clinical symptoms and restore serum T levels to the mid-normal range without significant side effects or safety concerns. Different T formulations have been approved. TRT is associated with a reduction in fat mass, an increase in lean mass, and a possible positive effect on lipid profile and glycometabolic control. Bone density and depressive symptoms are improved by TRT, while effects on cardiovascular risk and frailty are more controversial. No increase in prostate cancer and prostate-related problems has been reported so far. TRT, alone or in combination with phosphodiesterase inhibitors, can be effective for hypogonadal men with erectile dysfunction.

The exploration of these outcomes underscores the multifaceted benefits and ongoing debates regarding TRT application in clinical practice.

Recommendations

- **Measurement of testosterone, female sexual dysfunction, and endogenous androgen levels**:

	(1) Recommendations pertaining to the measurement of circulating testosterone in women: Testosterone may act directly via the androgen receptor/nongenomic androgenic action, or by reduction to the more potent androgen dihydrotestosterone and/or aromatization to estradiol and their metabolites. Testosterone concentrations decline during the reproductive years (Level IIB). Testosterone concentrations appear to be maintained in women beyond the age of 65 years; however, whether this confers a benefit is yet to be understood (Level IIB). Total testosterone can be measured with high accuracy and reproducibility using liquid/gas chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry assays (Grade B). Direct assays for the measurement of total and free testosterone are highly unreliable in the female range (Grade A). Reference laboratories should be "harmonized" with biological standards in coordination with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Expert Opinion). Measurement of testosterone using direct assays in clinical practice is appropriate if liquid/gas chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry assays are not available, to exclude high baseline concentrations and also to exclude supraphysiological concentrations during treatment (Expert Opinion). Research into testosterone physiology and clinical effects should mainly focus on measuring total testosterone as the main biomarker, rather than "free" testosterone, because evidence that "free" testosterone is the biological marker is lacking.

---

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^115qUems]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

A free testosterone result is most useful in the assessment of a man with intermediate pretest probability of hypogonadism, a condition associated with low serum SHBG and a serum total testosterone that is moderately low to low-normal (i.e. 200–275 ng/dL or 6.94–9.55 nmol/L). Some experts discourage the measurement of free testosterone because of the limitations discussed above, and these experts recommend focusing on the interpretation of total testosterone concentrations in conjunction with SHBG concentrations. However, this approach is congruent with assessment of serum free testosterone with an accurate method. Overall, there is no consistent evidence that free testosterone concentrations are a better measure of androgen status than total testosterone. Further studies are needed to help establish more accurate and uniform methods of assessing free testosterone concentrations and to determine its clinical utility for the diagnosis of hypogonadism. For further discussion about the debate over the clinical value of free testosterone and the accuracy of its calculation/measurement, there are several recent reviews.

Some hypogonadal men with markedly elevated serum SHBG concentrations may have normal or even high serum total testosterone concentrations. Significantly elevated serum SHBG concentrations occur most commonly in the setting of anti-epileptic treatment, chronic liver disease, or chronic daily ingestion of large quantities of alcohol (even in the absence of significant elevation of serum hepatic transaminases).

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116yTpN9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for male hypogonadism, specifically in relation to testosterone levels, the ES 2018 guidelines recommend determining free testosterone concentrations either directly through equilibrium dialysis assays or by calculations using total testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, and albumin concentrations. This is particularly important for patients with conditions altering sex hormone-binding globulin, such as:

- **Metabolic and endocrine conditions**: obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, acromegaly, hyperthyroidism
- **Genetic and age-related factors**: SHBG gene polymorphisms, older age
- **Medication and substance use**: corticosteroid use, certain anticonvulsants, estrogens
- **Infectious and liver conditions**: HIV, cirrhosis, hepatitis
- **Kidney and urinary conditions**: nephrotic syndrome

Additionally, for those with initial total testosterone concentrations at or near the lower limit of the normal range (200–400 ng/dL), accurate assessment of free testosterone is crucial. It is advised not to use direct analog-based free testosterone immunoassays.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1138udww]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Accurate assessment of serum free testosterone might be helpful when serum total testosterone concentration approximates the lower limit of normal or when abnormalities in sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) are suspected (Table 2; Fig. 1). A fasting early morning total testosterone concentration of > 350 ng/dL (12 nmol/L) measured by a reliable assay is generally consistent with a normal serum free testosterone and typically does not require assessment of free testosterone, except in men with suspected or proven high SHBG concentrations.

The most common causes of the constellation of a low serum total testosterone, low serum SHBG, and normal free serum testosterone (i.e. pseudohypogonadism; Fig. 1) are obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D).

- **Causes of high and low circulating SHBG**:
	- There are no well-validated, outcome-based normal reference ranges for serum free testosterone concentration in older men. In addition, there is wide variation in the quality and the various methods used to measure or calculate serum free testosterone concentrations. Direct methods of measurement of free testosterone are inaccurate and should not be used.

### Testosterone deficiency: A review and comparison of current guidelines [^112oQ6mF]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

There is much controversy regarding the appropriate evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency (TD).

- **Aim**: To compare guidelines on the evaluation and management of TD to provide clarity for patients and clinicians, as well as to highlight areas of controversy.

- **Methods**: A literature search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and various association websites was performed to identify guidelines for TD.

- **Outcomes**: Key aspects in the approach were compared, with a focus on the biochemical definition (cutoff) for low testosterone (T), principles of management, and recommendations for testosterone therapy (TTh) in special patient populations.

- **Results**: Guidelines from the Canadian Medical Association Journal, American Urological Association, European Association of Urology, Endocrine Society, International Society for Sexual Medicine, and British Society for Sexual Medicine were included for review. Recommendations were generally consistent across guidelines. Key differences include the biochemical cutoff for low T, and recommendations for patients with low to normal T, prostate cancer, or cardiovascular disease. We highlight several case scenarios in which management differs depending on the guideline adopted.

- **Clinical implications**: Although general diagnostic and management principles are in agreement across the guidelines, notable differences may impact patient diagnosis and eligibility for TTh.

- **Strengths & limitations**: Only guidelines written in English were included. The quality of the included guidelines was not evaluated.

### Characteristics of men undergoing testosterone replacement therapy and adherence to follow-up recommendations in metropolitan multicenter health care system [^111yWEbE]. Urology (2015). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to identify the frequencies of treatment and recommended laboratory follow-up for men with low serum testosterone levels.

- **Methods**: The electronic data warehouse was queried to identify men aged 18–85 years who underwent testing for serum total testosterone levels from 2009 to 2012. Data on the frequency of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), patient demographics, and clinical characteristics were collected. The frequency of follow-up with serum total testosterone and complete blood count levels was documented.

- **Results**: Among 9,176 men tested for low testosterone levels, 3,320 (36%) were hypogonadal, with a mean serum total testosterone level of 194.3 ± 64.9 ng/dL. Of these, 17.7% were treated with TRTs. The treatment frequency significantly increased from 8.3% in 2009 to 24% in 2012. A total of 4.8% of men of reproductive age (18–35 years) were placed on TRTs. Within 180 days of initial testing, only 40% of treated men received follow-up with liver function tests and/or complete blood count, and only 49% had a follow-up serum testosterone level.

- **Conclusion**: Although the frequency of TRT is increasing, only a small percentage of hypogonadal men are actively undergoing treatment. A significant proportion of men of reproductive age are being treated, with significant impacts on potential fertility. Less than half of the patients treated are being monitored appropriately after testosterone replacement. This highlights the importance of further education for providers prescribing testosterone replacement.

### The practical management of testosterone deficiency in men [^114Hq3p8]. Nature Reviews Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Despite increased global interest in testosterone deficiency in men and its treatment with testosterone therapy, practical aspects of care remain confusing to many practitioners. Testosterone deficiency can result from testicular dysfunction (primary hypogonadism) or hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction (secondary hypogonadism), and may be congenital or acquired. Sexual and nonsexual symptoms of testosterone deficiency can negatively affect quality of life and lead to considerable general health concerns.

Investigation of testosterone deficiency should be undertaken in men with symptoms of reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, depression, fatigue, poor concentration, and poor memory. Total and free testosterone are the most frequently used tests, and evaluating serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone aids in determining primary versus secondary testosterone deficiency.

Multiple formulations of testosterone therapy are available, but symptomatic benefits might not manifest for several weeks to many months; long-acting formulations are convenient and improve compliance. Concerns regarding cardiovascular and prostate cancer risks are not supported by evidence; however, monitoring during therapy is mandatory. On balance, testosterone therapy can be considered a safe and effective treatment for testosterone deficiency.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^112rVxjX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

Although testosterone replacement in men with classic hypogonadism due to an identified pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is uncontroversial, the role of testosterone treatment for men with age-related declines in circulating testosterone is unclear. This is due to the lack of large, long-term testosterone therapy trials assessing definitive clinical endpoints.

However, men ≥ 50 years of age, particularly those who have a body mass index > 25 kg/m² and multiple comorbidities, commonly present with clinical features of androgen deficiency and low serum testosterone concentrations. Clinicians are faced with the question of whether to initiate testosterone therapy, a difficult dilemma that entails a benefit-risk analysis with limited evidence from clinical trials. Using a case scenario, we present a practical approach to the clinical assessment and management of such men.

### Testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone: A clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^117Ubn9i]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to provide clinical recommendations based on the evidence of the benefits and harms of testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone. This guideline is endorsed by the American Academy of Family Physicians.

- **Methods**: The ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee based these recommendations on a systematic review on the efficacy and safety of testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system and included sexual function, physical function, quality of life, energy and vitality, depression, cognition, serious adverse events, major adverse cardiovascular events, and other adverse events.

- **Target audience and patient population**: The target audience includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adult men with age-related low testosterone.

- **Recommendation 1a**: ACP suggests that clinicians discuss whether to initiate testosterone treatment in men with age-related low testosterone and sexual dysfunction who want to improve sexual function (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). The discussion should include the potential benefits, harms, costs, and patient's preferences.

- **Recommendation 1b**: ACP suggests that clinicians should reevaluate symptoms within 12 months and periodically thereafter. Clinicians should discontinue testosterone treatment in men with age-related low testosterone and sexual dysfunction.

Empirical pharmacological treatment for men with hypogonadism and/or idiopathic infertility has featured in the medical literature for more than five decades; however, evidence on effective and safe treatment strategies remains inconclusive. In contrast to previously published pairwise meta-analyses of observational and randomized evidence, our network meta-analysis showed limited efficacy for all evaluated treatment options over placebo. The decision to start such treatments depends on the underlying cause of infertility, patient characteristics, and overall treatment objectives.

Most of the included trials evaluated these treatments in men with idiopathic infertility. However, it is important to distinguish the perceived benefit among men with hypogonadism compared to those with normal testosterone levels. Specifically, men with a reduced testosterone/estradiol ratio may see more benefit associated with clomiphene and aromatase inhibitor therapy. Similarly, men with high BMI or advanced age may also demonstrate more benefit following SERMs/AIs therapy compared to those with no other predisposing factors.

The magnitude of benefit may also vary depending on the degree of semen abnormality. While most of the included trials in our review demonstrated some improvement in sperm concentration, the magnitude of changes was smaller among men with very low sperm count. Due to limited reporting, we were unable to further explore the mechanistic effect of the evaluated treatment on varied semen abnormalities (e.g. low vs. very low sperm count).

### Efficacy and safety of testosterone treatment in men: An evidence report for a clinical practice guideline by the American College of Physicians [^113esc8W]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Testosterone treatment rates in adult men have increased in the United States over the past two decades.

- **Purpose**: To assess the benefits and harms of testosterone treatment for men without underlying organic causes of hypogonadism.

- **Data sources**: English-language searches of multiple electronic databases (January 1980 to May 2019) and reference lists from systematic reviews.

- **Study selection**: 38 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of at least six months' duration that evaluated transdermal or intramuscular testosterone therapies versus placebo or no treatment and reported prespecified patient-centered outcomes. Additionally, 20 long-term observational studies, U.S. Food and Drug Administration review data, and product labels reported harms information.

- **Data extraction**: Data extraction by a single investigator was confirmed by a second. Two investigators assessed the risk of bias, and evidence certainty was determined by consensus.

- **Data synthesis**: Studies enrolled mostly older men who varied in age, symptoms, and testosterone eligibility criteria. Testosterone therapy improved sexual functioning and quality of life in men with low testosterone levels, although effect sizes were small (low- to moderate-certainty evidence). Testosterone therapy had little to no effect on physical functioning, depressive symptoms, energy and vitality, or cognition. Harms evidence reported in trials was judged to be insufficient or of low certainty for most harm outcomes. No trials were powered to assess cardiovascular events or prostate cancer, and trials often excluded men at increased risk.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^116p4z6a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

- **Prostate health**: Testosterone therapy increases serum prostate-specific antigen concentrations in hypogonadal men to that of age-matched controls. Although there is no evidence that testosterone treatment increases the risk of de novo prostate cancer, clinical trials have not had enough participants or long enough follow-up to be conclusive. Testosterone stimulates metastatic and high-grade prostate cancer, but it is not known whether testosterone treatment stimulates the growth of pre-existing subclinical lower-grade prostate cancer.

	- Testosterone treatment has not been shown to have a significant effect on lower urinary tract symptoms; however, clinical trials have generally excluded men with severe benign prostatic hypertrophy. Testosterone should generally not be prescribed for men with prostate cancer, with possible exceptions in carefully selected men such as those with a history of treated low-risk, Gleason 4 ng/mL. Follow-up of prostate health during testosterone treatment should be individualized. Individualized prostate cancer screening should be offered with a nuanced discussion of the potential benefits (possible early detection of prostate cancer that might improve mortality and decrease the risk of metastatic disease) and the potential harm of increased prostate biopsies and prostate cancer therapies that may cause erectile dysfunction and incontinence and might not always improve long-term outcomes.

### Society for Endocrinology guidelines for testosterone replacement therapy in male hypogonadism [^116pqrx4]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

Male hypogonadism (MH) is a common endocrine disorder. However, uncertainties and variations in its diagnosis and management exist. There are several guidelines on testosterone replacement therapy that have been driven predominantly by single disciplines. The Society for Endocrinology commissioned this new guideline to provide all care providers with a multidisciplinary approach to treating patients with MH. This guideline has been compiled using expertise from endocrine (medical and nursing), primary care, clinical biochemistry, urology, and reproductive medicine practices. These guidelines also provide a patient perspective to help clinicians best manage MH.

### Testosterone therapy in men with androgen deficiency syndromes: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114N7HCt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Our objective was to update the guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of androgen deficiency syndromes in adult men, which were previously published in 2006.

- **Participants**: The Task Force comprised a chair selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, five additional experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The Task Force did not receive any corporate funding or remuneration.

- **Conclusions**: We recommend making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency only in men with consistent symptoms, signs, and unequivocally low serum testosterone levels. We suggest the measurement of morning total testosterone level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. Confirmation of the diagnosis should be done by repeating the measurement of morning total testosterone. In some men, where total testosterone is near the lower limit of normal or where an SHBG abnormality is suspected, measurement of free or bioavailable testosterone level using validated assays is recommended. Testosterone therapy is recommended for men with symptomatic androgen deficiency to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and to improve their sexual function, sense of well-being, muscle mass and strength, and bone mineral density. We recommend against starting testosterone therapy in patients with breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration, or prostate-specific antigen greater than 4 ng/ml, or greater than 3 ng/ml in men at high risk for prostate cancer, such as African-Americans or men with first-degree relatives with prostate cancer, without further urologic evaluation.

### Diagnosis and treatment of testosterone deficiency: Recommendations from the Fourth International Consultation for Sexual Medicine (ICSM 2015) [^115ZjqfJ]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Testosterone deficiency (TD), also known as hypogonadism, is a condition affecting a substantial proportion of men as they age. The diagnosis and management of TD can be challenging, and clinicians should be aware of the literature on this condition.

- **Aim**: To review the available literature concerning the diagnosis and management of TD and to provide clinically relevant recommendations from the Fourth International Consultation for Sexual Medicine (ICSM) meeting.

- **Methods**: A literature search was performed using the PubMed database for English-language original and review articles published or e-published up to January 2016.

- **Main outcome measures**: Levels of evidence (LoEs) and grades of recommendations are provided based on a thorough analysis of the literature and committee consensus.

- **Results**: Recommendations were given for 12 categories of TD, including definition, clinical diagnosis, routine measurement, screening questionnaires, laboratory diagnosis, threshold levels for the biochemical diagnosis of TD, prostate cancer, cardiovascular disease, fertility, testosterone (T) formulations, alternatives to T therapy, and adverse events and monitoring. A total of 42 recommendations were made: of these, 16 were unchanged from the Third ICSM, and 26 new recommendations were made during this Fourth ICSM. Most of these recommendations were supported by LoEs 2 and 3. Several key new recommendations include the following: (i) the clinical manifestations of TD occur as a result of decreased serum androgen concentrations or activity.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for male hypogonadism, specifically concerning testosterone levels, the EAA 2020 guidelines recommend measuring or calculating free testosterone in addition to total testosterone. This is particularly advised in patients with conditions that alter sex hormone-binding globulin and when total testosterone concentrations are in the borderline range (~8–12 nmol/L), if the clinical suspicion of hypogonadism is strong.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^112SLFvX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

There are no clearly established indications for testosterone therapy for women; nonetheless, clinicians have treated women with testosterone for decades, intending to alleviate a variety of symptoms with uncertain benefits and risks. In most countries, testosterone therapy is prescribed off-label, meaning women are using either testosterone formulations approved for men with dose modification or compounded therapies. Because of these issues, there is a compelling case for a global consensus position statement on testosterone therapy for women based on the available evidence from placebo/comparator randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

This position statement was developed by consensus between the participating organizations to inform health care professionals of the known benefits and potential risks of testosterone therapy for women. The aims were to provide clear guidance on which women might benefit from testosterone therapy, to identify symptoms, signs, and conditions for which evidence does not support the prescribing of testosterone, to explore areas of uncertainty, and to identify any prescribing practices that have the potential to cause harm.

### Gaps in patient knowledge about risks and benefits of testosterone replacement therapy [^116SXzHE]. Urology (2017). Low credibility.

To assess patient knowledge of the symptoms of testosterone deficiency, and the benefits and risks associated with testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), an anonymous, 10-question multiple-choice survey was administered to consecutive patients presenting for urologic evaluation at an academic medical center from December 2015 to April 2016. The survey included questions about perceived symptoms of testosterone deficiency, perceived benefits and risks associated with TRT, whether respondents had a diagnosis of testosterone deficiency, and whether they were interested in receiving TRT.

The survey response rate was 88% (97/110), with a median age group of 41–50 years. Although 43% of all respondents reported an interest in TRT, only half of them had a clinical diagnosis of hypogonadism. The most commonly reported symptoms of low testosterone were "low energy" (54%), "decreased libido" (51%), "weak erections" (52%), and "decreased strength" (42%). Perceived benefits of TRT most commonly reported were "improved sexual function" (54%), "increased energy" (53%), and "feeling better" (51%). Half of the respondents were unsure of the risks associated with TRT. Of the respondents, 16%, 10%, and 8% acknowledged the association between TRT and heart attack, TRT and stroke, and TRT and blood clots, respectively.

There is disproportionate knowledge about the benefits versus the risks associated with TRT among patients. Although 43% of the respondents were interested in receiving TRT, half of them were unsure of the associated risks.

### How does obesity affect fertility in men - and what are the treatment options [^117Uhwi5]. Clinical Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Adiposity is associated with reduced fertility in men. The aetiology is multifactorial, with obese men at greater risk of suffering from impaired spermatogenesis, reduced circulating testosterone levels, erectile dysfunction, and poor libido. The diagnosis and treatment of reduced fertility observed in obese men therefore require insight into the underlying pathology, which has hormonal, mechanical, and psychosocial aspects. This article summarizes the epidemiological, experimental, and clinical trial evidence from the perspective of a practicing clinician.

- **Conclusions and recommendations**: Obesity is associated with low serum testosterone concentrations, but treatment with exogenous testosterone is likely to adversely impact fertility. It is important to discuss this with men prior to the initiation of testosterone therapy. Obesity adversely affects sperm concentration and may affect sperm quality. However, whether or not weight loss will correct these factors remains to be established. Oestrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors are unlicensed in the treatment of male hypogonadism and/or infertility. These treatments should hence be considered experimental approaches until ongoing clinical trials report their outcomes.

### British society for sexual medicine guidelines on adult testosterone deficiency, with statements for UK practice [^116AjNSy]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Testosterone deficiency (TD) is an increasingly common problem with significant health implications, but its diagnosis and management can be challenging.

- **Aim**: To review the available literature on TD and provide evidence-based statements for UK clinical practice.

- **Methods**: Evidence was derived from Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane searches on hypogonadism, testosterone (T) therapy, and cardiovascular safety from May 2005 to May 2015. Further searches continued until May 2017.

- **Outcomes**: To provide a guideline on diagnosing and managing TD, with levels of evidence and grades of recommendation, based on a critical review of the literature and consensus of the British Society of Sexual Medicine panel.

- **Results**: Twenty-five statements are provided, relating to five key areas: screening, diagnosis, initiating T therapy, benefits and risks of T therapy, and follow-up. Seven statements are supported by level 1 evidence, eight by level 2, five by level 3, and five by level 4 evidence.

- **Clinical implications**: To help guide UK practitioners on effectively diagnosing and managing primary and age-related TD.

- **Strengths and limitations**: A large amount of literature was carefully sourced and reviewed, presenting the best evidence available at the time. However, some statements provided are based on poor-quality evidence. This is a rapidly evolving area of research, and recommendations are subject to change. Guidelines can never replace clinical expertise when making treatment decisions for individual patients but rather help to focus decisions and take into account personal values, preferences, and individual circumstances.

### Debate about the free testosterone hypothesis: Useful tool or misguided mirage [^117GN7s7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

In this debate, two clinicians discuss the merits and demerits of the free testosterone hypothesis. Although most clinical guidelines recommend the measurement of free testosterone in the evaluation for male hypogonadism, at least in men with suspected low serum sex hormone binding globulin, there remains controversy about the underlying hypothesis that serum free testosterone is a significant contributor to androgen effect. Dr. Anawalt presents evidence to support the free testosterone hypothesis and advocates for the usefulness of accurate assessment of free testosterone in the evaluation of male hypogonadism. Conversely, Dr. Handelsman argues that the evidence is unconvincing, the hypothesis is flawed and biologically invalid, and free testosterone cannot be accurately assessed in clinical practice.

Regarding the medical management for male hypogonadism, particularly concerning testosterone therapy, the EAA 2020 guidelines specifically recommend against initiating testosterone replacement therapy for the following purposes:

- **Prevention of bone fracture**: For patients with a high fracture risk, testosterone should not be used as monotherapy.

- **Improvement of muscle strength**: Initiating therapy with the clinically meaningful aim of enhancing muscle strength in frail patients is discouraged.

- **Improvement of major depressive symptoms**: Testosterone should not be used as monotherapy to address severe depressive symptoms.

- **Improvement of cognitive function**: There is no recommendation for the use of testosterone to enhance cognitive abilities.
