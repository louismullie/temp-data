## Question

A 28-year-old woman who has never been pregnant presents to the physician for a follow-up examination. She has had 5 months of deep pain during sexual intercourse and pelvic pain that intensified prior to her menses. The pain has not subsided despite taking oral contraceptives. She denies any vaginal discharge or foul smell. She is in a monogamous relationship with her husband of 2 years. She has no history of any serious illnesses. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows tenderness on deep palpation of the hypogastrium. A speculum examination of the vagina and cervix shows no abnormalities or discharge. Serum studies show a beta hCG of 6 mIU/mL. A transabdominal ultrasound shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is most likely to establish a diagnosis?
A. Abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) scan
B. Cancer antigen 125 (CA-125)
C. Laparoscopy
D. Dilation and curettage

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which test is most likely to establish a definitive diagnosis in a 28-year-old woman with deep dyspareunia, cyclic pelvic pain, and failure of oral contraceptives, where transabdominal ultrasound is normal and endometriosis is suspected. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely diagnosis and why. Then, I should verify the limitations of the current imaging and the correct next imaging step. Next, I will review the role of CA-125 and CT and why they are not appropriate here. After that, I need to check when laparoscopy becomes indicated and whether it is the definitive test in this scenario. Finally, I will synthesize the evidence-based diagnostic pathway and select the best answer with clear justification.

> Let me first confirm the clinical diagnosis. Deep dyspareunia, pelvic pain that worsens before menses, and failure of hormonal suppression strongly suggest endometriosis, which affects up to 10% of reproductive-age women and classically presents with pelvic pain and dyspareunia; importantly, normal examination and imaging do not exclude the diagnosis, and diagnosis is often delayed for years, so I should not be reassured by negative initial tests [^115wpZYk] [^113y1aRp] [^116SJhqY].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging that was done. A transabdominal ultrasound alone is insufficient for endometriosis; guidelines recommend transvaginal ultrasound as first-line imaging for suspected endometriosis, with MRI as the preferred modality when deep infiltrating disease is suspected or when ultrasound is negative but clinical suspicion remains high, so the next step should be transvaginal ultrasound or MRI rather than jumping to invasive testing [^111MguHP] [^111Zdafi] [^117CEkk2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about CA-125. I initially thought CA-125 might help, but I should double-check its utility; CA-125 lacks specificity and sensitivity for endometriosis and is not recommended as a diagnostic test for endometriosis, so it would not establish the diagnosis in this context.

> I need to ensure I am not overusing CT. CT is not recommended as a primary imaging modality for suspected endometriosis and offers no advantage over ultrasound or MRI for lesion detection; it is reserved for acute pain scenarios unrelated to endometriosis, so CT would be inappropriate here [^1148Tdbc] [^111MguHP].

> Let me consider the role of dilation and curettage. D&C is a uterine sampling procedure and would not visualize or biopsy extrauterine endometriotic lesions, so it cannot establish the diagnosis of endometriosis in this patient [^notfound].

> Now, I should review when laparoscopy is indicated. Although many patients can be managed clinically and with imaging, laparoscopy with visualization and histology remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis when noninvasive evaluation is inconclusive and suspicion remains high; in this case, with persistent symptoms despite OCPs and a negative transabdominal ultrasound, proceeding to laparoscopy is appropriate to establish the diagnosis and potentially treat lesions at the same time [^115wpZYk] [^116SJhqY] [^116saC94].

> But wait, what if we could avoid surgery with better imaging first? That is reasonable; in practice, I would obtain a high-quality transvaginal ultrasound or pelvic MRI before laparoscopy to look for endometriomas or deep infiltrating disease, recognizing that a negative imaging study does not exclude superficial peritoneal disease; if imaging is negative and symptoms persist, laparoscopy remains the definitive next step to confirm endometriosis and guide management [^111MguHP] [^117CEkk2] [^111Zdafi].

> Synthesizing this, the most likely test to establish a definitive diagnosis in this scenario is laparoscopy, because it allows direct visualization and histopathologic confirmation of endometriotic lesions when noninvasive evaluation is nondiagnostic and clinical suspicion remains high; while MRI or expert transvaginal ultrasound should precede surgery for mapping and to optimize operative planning, they cannot replace laparoscopy as the diagnostic gold standard in this context [^115wpZYk] [^116SJhqY] [^111MguHP].

> Final answer: C. Laparoscopy [^115wpZYk] [^116SJhqY].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **endometriosis** [^111XNbYN], given the classic triad of deep dyspareunia, cyclic pelvic pain, and failure of hormonal therapy [^111XNbYN]. The next best step is **laparoscopy** [^115wpZYk] because it is the gold standard for definitive diagnosis and allows direct visualization and biopsy of lesions [^116SJhqY]. CT is not recommended for endometriosis [^1148Tdbc], CA-125 lacks specificity [^notfound], and D&C is not indicated. If laparoscopy is unavailable, pelvic MRI is the preferred alternative [^notfound].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for chronic pelvic pain with deep dyspareunia in a reproductive-age woman includes:

- **Endometriosis**: Characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue causing chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and deep dyspareunia [^115wpZYk].

- **Adenomyosis**: Endometrial tissue within the myometrium, causing heavy menstrual bleeding and pelvic pain [^1175hk2o].

- **Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)**: Typically presents with lower abdominal pain, cervical motion tenderness, and vaginal discharge [^115GfmCT].

- **Ovarian cysts or masses**: May cause pelvic pain and dyspareunia [^1168TB1B].

- **Pelvic congestion syndrome**: Chronic pelvic pain associated with pelvic venous insufficiency [^114iw6m6].

- **Functional or psychogenic pain**: Often associated with psychological factors or chronic pain syndromes [^113ESTm2].

Given the patient's clinical presentation — deep dyspareunia, pelvic pain intensifying before menses, and failure of hormonal therapy — **endometriosis is the most likely diagnosis** [^115wpZYk] [^113y1aRp].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Initial evaluation

Initial evaluation should include a thorough history, physical examination, and basic laboratory tests. A pelvic examination may reveal **tenderness, nodularity, or a fixed uterus**, suggesting endometriosis [^1146ibXg]. A negative pelvic examination does not exclude endometriosis [^115wpZYk]. Basic laboratory tests include a **pregnancy test** (already performed and negative) and, if indicated, tests for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) [^115GfmCT].

---

### Imaging studies

Transabdominal ultrasound, as performed in this patient, is **insensitive for detecting endometriosis**, particularly superficial peritoneal lesions [^117CEkk2]. Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is more sensitive for detecting ovarian endometriomas and deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) but may still miss superficial lesions [^114UfQA6] [^115fukeA]. MRI is superior to ultrasound for detecting DIE and is recommended when ultrasound is inconclusive or suspicion remains high [^111Zdafi].

---

### Role of laparoscopy

Laparoscopy is the **gold standard** for definitive diagnosis of endometriosis [^115fukeA]. It allows direct visualization of endometriotic lesions and enables biopsy for histopathological confirmation [^116SJhqY]. Laparoscopy is particularly indicated when:

- Clinical suspicion for endometriosis remains high despite negative or inconclusive imaging studies [^113BMYL4].

- Empiric medical therapy fails to alleviate symptoms [^115wpZYk].

- Definitive diagnosis is required for treatment planning or fertility preservation [^115vv2wu].

Given the patient's persistent symptoms and negative transabdominal ultrasound, **diagnostic laparoscopy is the most appropriate next step** to establish a definitive diagnosis [^116saC94].

---

## Alternative diagnostic options

While laparoscopy is the gold standard, **alternative diagnostic options** include:

- **Pelvic MRI**: Recommended when ultrasound is inconclusive or suspicion for deep infiltrating endometriosis remains high [^117KFxMB] [^111Zdafi].

- **CA-125**: A tumor marker that may be elevated in endometriosis but lacks specificity and is not recommended as a standalone diagnostic test [^notfound].

- **CT scan**: Not recommended as a primary imaging modality for endometriosis due to limited sensitivity and specificity [^1148Tdbc].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Based on the patient's clinical presentation and the limitations of noninvasive imaging, **laparoscopy is the most appropriate next diagnostic step** to definitively diagnose endometriosis [^115wpZYk]. It provides direct visualization of lesions and allows for histopathological confirmation, guiding subsequent management and treatment planning [^116SJhqY].

Patient Selection

Diagnosis

Historically, a definitive diagnosis of endometriosis required laparoscopic lesion visualization and excision with histologic confirmation of endometrial gland, endometrial stroma, and/or hemosiderin-laden macrophage presence. However, even in the absence of a definitive diagnosis, many professional society treatment recommendations permit the use of empiric therapy when there is a strong suspicion or clinical evidence of endometriosis. For example, guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) give a Level B recommendation to empiric therapy with a 3-month course of a GnRH agonist in women with chronic pelvic pain who have undergone an appropriate pretreatment evaluation and in whom oral contraceptives and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have failed, noting the patient should be informed that treatment response does not confirm an endometriosis diagnosis.

The criteria for suspecting endometriosis differ among guidelines, but generally include the presence of pelvic pain symptoms (progressively worsening dysmenorrhea [particularly when severe and unresponsive to NSAIDs and/or hormonal-based therapies], NMPP, and deep dyspareunia), which may be augmented by physical findings (e.g. pelvic tenderness and nodularity on palpation of the uterosacral ligaments and rectovaginal septum), imaging results, and/or cyclical nongynecologic symptoms (dyschezia, dysuria, hematuria and rectal bleeding, diarrhea/irritable bowel syndrome, and shoulder pain). When symptoms are cyclic in nature and progressive over time, endometriosis is by far the most likely clinical diagnosis.

It is increasingly recognized that identification of endometriosis can be achieved with reasonable certainty using nonsurgical methodologies (i.e. a clinical diagnosis), which include evaluation of pelvic pain symptoms, patient history, physical examination findings, and appropriately performed imaging studies. Although there has yet to be identified a replacement test or tests for diagnostic surgery, clinicians with expertise in endometriosis diagnosis and management have suggested that symptoms, patient history, and clinical assessments taken in totality provide a basis for clinical diagnosis.

The benefits of undertaking a clinical diagnosis approach are that it does not require surgery and the attendant risks thereof, utilizes assessment tools that are readily available to most clinicians, and may reduce the delay frequently observed in endometriosis diagnosis. In clinical practice, presumptive diagnosis of endometriosis is often made without laparoscopy or other surgical procedure, and can facilitate early and effective management of patients' symptoms.

### Endometriosis: a review [^115wpZYk]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Endometriosis is a chronic, estrogen-dependent, inflammatory disease defined by endometrial-like tissue (lesions) outside the uterine lining. It affects up to 10% of women worldwide, and 9 million women in the US, during reproductive years.

Observations

Endometriosis has varying clinical presentations; however, 90% of people with endometriosis report pelvic pain, including dysmenorrhea, nonmenstrual pelvic pain, and dyspareunia, and 26% report infertility. Risk factors for endometriosis include younger age at menarche, shorter menstrual cycle length, lower body mass index, nulliparity, and congenital obstructive müllerian anomalies such as obstructed hemivagina. Although definitive diagnosis requires surgical visualization of lesions, a suspected clinical diagnosis can be made based on symptoms, supported by physical examination findings and imaging with transvaginal ultrasound and/or pelvic magnetic resonance imaging; normal physical examination and imaging do not exclude the diagnosis. The diagnosis is often delayed, averaging 5 to 12 years after onset of symptoms, with most women consulting 3 or more clinicians prior to diagnosis. Hormonal medications, such as combined oral contraceptives and progestin-only options, are first-line treatment and should be offered to symptomatic premenopausal women who do not currently desire pregnancy. In a network meta-analysis (n = 1680, 15 clinical trials), hormonal treatments including combined oral contraceptives, progestins, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists led to clinically significant pain reduction compared with placebo, with mean differences ranging between 13.15 and 17.6 points (0–100 visual analog scale) with little difference in effectiveness among options. However, 11% to 19% of individuals with endometriosis have no pain reduction with hormonal medications and 25% to 34% experience recurrent pelvic pain within 12 months of discontinuing hormonal treatment. Surgical removal of lesions, usually with laparoscopy, should be considered if first-line hormonal therapies are ineffective or contraindicated. Second-line hormone therapies include GnRH agonists and antagonists, and third-line treatments include aromatase inhibitors. Hysterectomy with surgical removal of lesions may be considered when initial treatments are ineffective. However, approximately 25% of patients who undergo hysterectomy for endometriosis experience recurrent pelvic pain and 10% undergo additional surgery, such as lysis of adhesions, to treat pain.

Conclusions and Relevance

Endometriosis is a common cause of pelvic pain affecting approximately 10% of reproductive-age women. Hormonal suppression with combined estrogen-progestin contraceptives or progestins is first-line treatment for women who are not seeking immediate pregnancy. Surgical removal of endometriosis lesions may be performed if hormonal therapies are ineffective or contraindicated, and hysterectomy may be considered if medical treatments and surgical removal of lesions do not relieve symptoms.

### Should a diagnosis of endometriosis be sought in all symptomatic women? [^115mknWv]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

A tool is needed to enable clinicians to determine whether women wish to seek a pathology-based explanation for chronic pelvic pain or whether they just want symptom relief. Such an approach might reduce the number of unnecessary laparoscopies without adversely affecting outcomes.

### Endometriosis and infertility: a committee opinion [^116SJhqY]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis — diagnosis and staging emphasize that laparoscopy is required for a definitive diagnosis and histologic evaluation is warranted when visual inspection is inconclusive; history and physical findings suggestive of endometriosis include cyclic or chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, a fixed retroverted uterus, an adnexal mass, and uterosacral ligament nodularity, thickening, or tenderness; ultrasound can help establish a presumptive diagnosis of an ovarian endometrioma but cannot reliably image peritoneal implants; the therapeutic benefit of laparoscopy to increase fecundity in mild disease is minimal and, accordingly, laparoscopy of asymptomatic women with infertility simply to rule out or confirm disease is unwarranted; disease heterogeneity ranges from a single 1 mm peritoneal implant to ≥ 10 cm endometriomas.

### Dyspareunia [^1139Y6DM]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Dyspareunia, better termed women's sexual pain, is a poorly understood disorder once believed to be purely psychologic. Thanks to cooperative research efforts from several specialties toward defining subsets of the disorder, understanding the etiology of subsets and their comorbidities and new concepts for diagnosis and management are being validated or are being put into practice. This review describes the surprising prevalence of sexual pain, outlines new definitions for subtypes of sexual pain and diagnostic criteria for them, and applies these diagnoses to the task of selecting treatment options.

### Postmenopausal dyspareunia [^112VeoDz]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

Dyspareunia in the postmenopausal woman is often multifactorial and requires a thorough history, a targeted physical examination, and coordination of multiple disciplines, including medical professionals, pelvic floor physical therapists, and sex therapists. Although we have come a long way since early assessments of painful sex, evaluation and treatment of dyspareunia remain an unmet need. This is particularly true in postmenopausal women in whom it is commonly assumed that pain with penetrative sex is solely a consequence of atrophy.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^115GfmCT]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Episodes of PID often go unrecognized. Although certain cases are asymptomatic, others are not diagnosed because the patient or the health care provider do not recognize the implications of mild or nonspecific symptoms or signs (e.g. abnormal bleeding, dyspareunia, and vaginal discharge). Even women with mild or asymptomatic PID might be at risk for infertility. Because of the difficulty of diagnosis and the potential for damage to the reproductive health of women, health care providers should maintain a low threshold for the clinical diagnosis of PID. The recommendations for diagnosing PID are intended to assist health care providers to recognize when PID should be suspected and when additional information should be obtained to increase diagnostic certainty. Diagnosis and management of other causes of lower abdominal pain (e.g. ectopic pregnancy, acute appendicitis, ovarian cyst, ovarian torsion, or functional pain) are unlikely to be impaired by initiating antimicrobial therapy for PID. Presumptive treatment for PID should be initiated for sexually active young women and other women at risk for STIs if they are experiencing pelvic or lower abdominal pain, if no cause for the illness other than PID can be identified, or if one or more of the following three minimum clinical criteria are present on pelvic examination: cervical motion tenderness, uterine tenderness, or adnexal tenderness.

More specific criteria for diagnosing PID include endometrial biopsy with histopathologic evidence of endometritis; transvaginal sonography or magnetic resonance imaging techniques demonstrating thickened, fluid-filled tubes with or without free pelvic fluid or tubo-ovarian complex, or Doppler studies indicating pelvic infection (e.g. tubal hyperemia); and laparoscopic findings consistent with PID. A diagnostic evaluation that includes some of these more extensive procedures might be warranted in certain cases. Endometrial biopsy is warranted for women undergoing laparoscopy who do not have visual evidence of salpingitis because endometritis is the only sign of PID for certain women.

Requiring that all three minimum criteria be present before the initiation of empiric treatment can result in insufficient sensitivity for a PID diagnosis. After deciding whether to initiate empiric treatment, clinicians should also consider the risk profile for STIs. More elaborate diagnostic evaluation frequently is needed because incorrect diagnosis and management of PID might cause unnecessary morbidity. For example, the presence of signs of lower genital tract inflammation (predominance of leukocytes in vaginal secretions, cervical discharge, or cervical friability), in addition to one of the three minimum criteria, increases the specificity of the diagnosis. One or more of the following additional criteria can be used to enhance the specificity of the minimum clinical criteria and support a PID diagnosis:

### Celiac disease as a cause of chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and deep dyspareunia [^111HzhZ1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Celiac disease may be subclinical and difficult to diagnose in adults. It has been associated with infertility and miscarriage but rarely with other gynecologic symptoms.

Case

A 43-year-old woman complaining of chronic abdominal and pelvic pain, deep dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, diarrhea, and a 5-kg weight loss during the last 6 months was referred to our institution. Laboratory and clinical examinations were negative. At laparoscopy, numerous small leiomyomata were seen. A few filmy adhesions between the small bowel and the abdominal wall were lysed. With the exception of deep dyspareunia, all symptoms remitted after surgery, only to recur at 6 months of follow-up. A diagnostic work-up for celiac disease revealed the presence of antigliadin and antiendomysial antibodies. The diagnosis was confirmed at gastroduodenoscopy including biopsy. A gluten-free diet was prescribed, and the patient is now free of symptoms.

Conclusion

Celiac disease should be considered in women presenting with unexplained chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and deep dyspareunia.

### Does nomegestrol acetate plus 17 β-estradiol oral contraceptive improve endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain in women? [^114EntYL]. Journal of Women's Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

The departmental institutional review board approved the study. The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Helsinki Declaration. Informed written consent was obtained from each woman before entering the study, and they did not receive payment of any kind. The time of enrollment was from October 2017 to March 2019.

Two hundred fifty-five women aged 18–39 years old (mean age 26.7 ± 7.6), affected by chronic pelvic pain, were invited to participate in a comparative, open-label prospective study at the Chronic Pelvic Pain Clinic of the Gynecological Unity, Department of General Surgery and Medical Surgical Specialties, University of Catania, Italy. Each woman had been using on-demand NSAIDs from 15 months to 8 years. Before enrollment, medical, surgical, and medication history were assessed to ensure study eligibility based on inclusion and exclusion criteria for combined oral contraceptive (COC) usage. Moreover, women under gonadotropin releasing hormone analog treatment within the last 6 months or hormonal contraceptive treatment within the last 3 months were excluded.

Furthermore, women had to be sexually active, having had at least one sexual activity during the month before counseling, without desiring procreation in the following 6 months after the start of the study. Women with a history of nonorganic sexual dysfunction or having a partner affected by sexual dysfunction were excluded. A psychosexual investigation was performed by S.C.

Moreover, physical and gynecological examinations and transvaginal sonography (TVS), to rule out rectovaginal endometriosis ovarian endometria or adenomyosis, were performed. Based on the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology guidelines, only women affected by chronic pelvic pain with a clinical suspicion of endometriosis, such as dysmenorrhea, noncyclical chronic pelvic pain, or deep dyspareunia, were included. Consequently, 93 (36.4%) women with ultrasound-based evidence of endometriosis were excluded from participating in the study. Of these 33 (12.9%), 31 (12.2%) and 29 (11.3%) women were diagnosed by TVS to have rectovaginal endometriosis, ovarian endometrioma, or adenomyosis, respectively. Finally, 162 (63.6%) women participated in the study.

### Evaluation and treatment of dyspareunia [^1168vFHy]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Dyspareunia affects 8–22% of women at some point during their lives, making it one of the most common pain problems in gynecologic practice. A mixture of anatomic, endocrine, pathologic, and emotional factors combine to challenge the diagnostic, therapeutic, and empathetic skills of the physician. New understandings of pain in general require new interpretations concerning the origins of pain during intercourse, but also provide new avenues of treatment. The outcomes of medical and surgical treatments for common gynecologic problems should routinely go beyond measures of coital possibility, to include assessment of coital comfort, pleasure, and facilitation of intimacy. This review will discuss aspects of dyspareunia, including anatomy and neurophysiology, sexual physiology, functional changes, pain in response to disease states, and pain after gynecologic surgical procedures.

Methods

The full methods for the study are described elsewhere. Women aged ≥ 16 years who presented to the Centre for Sexual Health at Leeds for a new visit were invited to participate. Exclusion criteria were having taken antibiotics in the preceding 28 days and being unable or unwilling to take a vulvovaginal swab or to have the standard examination and swabs performed by a clinician. We collected details of the women's age, ethnicity, history of sexually transmitted infections, and being in contact with a sexually transmitted infection. During the medical history, symptoms in keeping with a bacterial sexually transmitted infection (vaginal discharge, dysuria, intermenstrual or postcoital bleeding, deep dyspareunia, and lower abdominal pain) were recorded. During the examination the presence of cervicitis and pain or tenderness on bimanual pelvic examination in keeping with a clinical diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease were noted.

### A systematic literature review on patient-reported outcome domains and measures in nonsurgical efficacy trials related to chronic pain associated with endometriosis: an urgent call to action [^116ZNJpy]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Endometriosis, affecting approximately 10% of women of reproductive age worldwide, is a chronic inflammatory disease of uncertain etiology and a common cause of chronic pelvic pain (CPP). The prevalence may be underestimated because symptoms are very heterogeneous and complex, and surgical confirmation is necessary for definitive diagnosis with severity of symptoms not being related to the extent or location of disease found at surgery. Hence, patients often face diagnostic delays of up to 7 to 9 years. Typical symptoms, such as chronic noncyclical pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and many other associations (including infertility), drastically affect physical and mental function, quality of life, as well as social and sexual well-being in the affected women. Treatment options, both medical and surgical, are often insufficient or even fail in up to 50% of patients. Ineffective treatment of chronic pain contributes to the burden of suffering for those affected.

To update the scientific evidence published in 2004, from the 2nd International Consultation on Sexual Medicine pertaining to the diagnosis and treatment of women's sexual pain disorders.

Methods

An expert committee, invited from six countries by the 3rd International Consultation, was comprised of eight researchers and clinicians from biological and social science disciplines, for the purpose of reviewing and grading the scientific evidence on nosology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of women's sexual pain disorders.

Main Outcome Measure

Expert opinion was based on grading of evidence-based medical literature, extensive internal committee discussion, public presentation, and debate. Results. A comprehensive assessment of medical, sexual, and psychosocial history is recommended for diagnosis and management. Indications for general and focused pelvic genital examination are identified. Evidence-based recommendations for assessment of women's sexual pain disorders are reviewed. An evidence-based approach to management of these disorders is provided.

Conclusions

Continued efforts are warranted to conduct research and scientific reporting on the optimal assessment and management of women's sexual pain disorders, including multidisciplinary approaches.

### Patient-physician interactions regarding dyspareunia with endometriosis: online survey results [^112bWSLc]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The observed disconnect between patients and their practitioners in discussing, diagnosing, and managing dyspareunia underlines the importance of additional medical training in these areas. Arming practitioners with effective strategies to discuss sensitive subjects with patients could be one method to improve overall healthcare. For example, questions should be asked several times and in different ways to ensure that accurate answers are collected from patients because the taboo surrounding sexual health may make patients initially less forthcoming in their responses. Listening to how patients describe their pain is also important, including its description, duration, localization, and timing. For example, women in our study most frequently localized their pain to the abdomen/pelvis and said that their pain was connected to their menstrual cycle, which are recognized clues of dyspareunia linked to endometriosis.

Although most women in this study said their practitioners included a pelvic examination in the process of identifying the source of their pain, a notable 13% of women said that they did not receive a pelvic examination. This is troubling since pelvic examinations are a critical step to identify the source of women's pain during sexual intercourse. When educational pelvic examinations are done correctly, they can also build rapport between patients and practitioners and empower patients by teaching them about their condition. Conversely, negative experiences with pelvic examinations that are rushed or painful can be traumatic for patients and may cause some women to avoid seeking future medical care and treatment. Furthermore, these pelvic examinations can help differentiate dyspareunia that may be directly related to endometriosis or a concurrent condition, such as provoked vestibulodynia or pelvic floor myalgia. Dyspareunia linked to endometriosis is most often deep in contrast to the superficial dyspareunia related to provoked vestibulodynia. Most women (82%) in our study said they felt their pain deep in their vagina while 32% felt pain at the entrance of their vagina. The ability to identify dyspareunia early through ongoing patient discussions and a targeted physical examination, complemented by ultrasound imaging, could provide pain relief for patients sooner and improve their overall healthcare experience.

### Common questions about the evaluation of acute pelvic pain [^1136Hdzq]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Acute pelvic pain is defined as lower abdominal or pelvic pain of less than three months' duration. It is a common presentation in primary care. Evaluation can be challenging because of a broad differential diagnosis and because many associated signs and symptoms are nonspecific. The most common diagnoses in reproductive-aged women with acute pelvic pain are idiopathic pelvic pain, pelvic inflammatory disease, acute appendicitis, ovarian cysts, ectopic pregnancy, and endometriosis. Among postmenopausal women, cancer must be considered. Findings from the history and physical examination can point to likely diagnoses, and laboratory testing and imaging can help confirm. Women of reproductive age should take a pregnancy test. In early pregnancy, transvaginal ultrasonography and beta human chorionic gonadotropin levels can help identify ectopic pregnancy and spontaneous abortion. For nonpregnant women, ultrasonography or computed tomography is indicated, depending on the possible diagnosis (e.g., ultrasonography is preferred when ovarian pathology is suspected). If ultrasonography results are nondiagnostic, magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful in pregnant women when acute appendicitis is suspected. If magnetic resonance imaging is unavailable, computed tomography may be indicated.

### Sonographic evaluation for endometriosis in routine pelvic ultrasound [^115fukeA]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To show how the evaluation for endometriosis can be included in the routine pelvic ultrasound examination.

Design

Stepwise narrated video demonstration of the sonographic evaluation for endometriosis in routine pelvic ultrasound following the recommended sonographic approach published in the 2016 consensus paper by the International Deep Endometriosis Analysis (IDEA) group [1].

Setting

Endometriosis is a common and often debilitating gynecological disorder that affects 5–10% of women [2]. The prevalence is even higher among women with symptoms of endometriosis [2], which include chronic pelvic pain, acquired dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dyschezia, menorrhagia, abnormal bleeding, and infertility. Approximately 80% of women who have endometriosis have superficial lesions, whereas 20% have deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE; [3]). Laparoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing endometriosis, because it allows the diagnosis of all forms of endometriosis and often immediate removal of superficial endometriosis. The removal of DIE is considerably more complicated and usually cannot be completed unless it was diagnosed preoperatively. The technique to diagnose DIE with transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) was first described in detail in 2009 [4]. Since then, the accuracy of TVUS for the prediction of DIE has been well established in the literature [5–7]. TVUS is widely used as a first-line investigation for women with gynecological symptoms. The inclusion of an assessment for endometriosis in the routine pelvic ultrasound allows earlier diagnosis and better surgical outcomes for all women with DIE.

Interventions

The evaluation for endometriosis in routine pelvic ultrasound based on the IDEA consensus promotes a 4-step dynamic ultrasound approach [1]: (1) routine evaluation of uterus and adnexa with particular attention for sonographic signs of adenomyosis and the presence or absence of endometriomas; (2) evaluation of transvaginal sonographic 'soft markers' such as site-specific tenderness and ovarian mobility; (3) assessment of status of pouch of Douglas using the real-time ultrasound-based "sliding sign"; and (4) assessment of DIE nodules in the anterior and posterior compartments, which involves assessment of the bladder, vaginal vault, uterosacral ligaments, and bowel, including rectum, rectosigmoid junction, and sigmoid colon. Because 5–10% of women with DIE also have ureteric endometriosis, it is useful to assess the kidneys. Silent hydronephrosis is easily identified in 50–60% of patients with ureteric involvement. Although it is possible to identify DIE involving the ureters more directly, this requires more advanced skills, and further studies are still needed to better define the accuracy of ureteric DIE detection by TVUS [8–10].

Conclusion

Traditionally, only pathologies of the uterus and ovaries are assessed during a routine pelvic ultrasound. Here we demonstrate that the routine ultrasound examination can easily be extended beyond the uterus and ovaries into the posterior and anterior pelvic compartments to evaluate structural mobility and to look for deep infiltrating endometriotic nodules, wherewith women suffering from DIE can benefit from a preoperative diagnosis and subsequently, a single, well-planned procedure in the hands of a well-prepared team.

### Endometriosis: evaluation and treatment [^115vv2wu]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is an inflammatory condition caused by the presence of endometrial tissue in extra-uterine locations and can involve bowel, bladder, and all peritoneal structures. It is one of the most common gynecologic disorders, affecting up to 10% of people of reproductive age. Presentation of endometriosis can vary widely, from infertility in asymptomatic people to debilitating pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and period-related gastrointestinal or urinary symptoms. Diagnosis of endometriosis in the primary care setting is clinical and often challenging, frequently resulting in delayed diagnosis and treatment. Although transvaginal ultrasonography is used to evaluate endometriosis of deep pelvic sites to rule out other causes of pelvic pain, magnetic resonance imaging is preferred if deep infiltrating endometriosis is suspected. Laparoscopy with biopsy remains the definitive method for diagnosis, although several gynecologic organizations recommend empiric therapy without immediate surgical diagnosis. Combined hormonal contraceptives with or without nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are first-line options in managing symptoms and have a tolerable adverse effect profile. Second-line treatments include gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor agonists with add-back therapy, GnRH receptor antagonists, and danazol. Aromatase inhibitors are reserved for severe disease. All of these treatments are effective but may cause additional adverse effects. Referral to gynecology for surgical management is indicated if empiric therapy is ineffective, immediate diagnosis and treatment are necessary, or patients desire pregnancy. Alternative treatments have limited benefit in alleviating pain symptoms but may warrant further investigation.

### Magnetic resonance imaging for deep infiltrating endometriosis: current concepts, imaging technique and key findings [^113Xahfr]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Management of deep endometriosis: current concepts

Endometriosis is a complex and heterogeneous disease that may manifest with three clinical patterns with increasing severity. Superficial peritoneal lesions are characterized by superficial implants of the pelvic peritoneum; ovarian endometriomas (OMA) are hemorrhagic cysts arising from ectopic endometrial tissue growing within the ovaries and less frequently outside the ovaries; and DIE leads to the most severe clinical pattern and is characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue penetrating deeper than 5 mm under the peritoneal surface, thus leading to local inflammation and consequently to fibrosis and muscular hyperplasia. DIE is usually found as a multifocal disease simultaneously involving multiple pelvic sites such as the Douglas pouch, the utero-sacral ligaments (USL), pelvic nerves, the rectum, the bladder, and the ureters (Table 1). The pathophysiology of such lesions is widely unknown; the type of lesion may vary over the life course, with no evidence supporting an ordered progression of endometriotic lesions. Similarly, the heterogeneity of symptoms is high. Women with endometriosis may experience dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dysuria, constipation, chronic pelvic pain and infertility; however, a clear characterization of the pain types and topologies of implants is lacking. Consequently, some women with minimal disease may report severe pelvic pain and infertility, whereas others with diffuse pelvic lesions can be almost asymptomatic. The heterogeneity of the disease and the uncertainties about its pathogenesis make its diagnosis challenging. For decades, laparoscopic visualization with histologic verification of lesions was considered the golden standard for diagnosis. However, laparoscopy, even if diagnostic, is not a risk-free surgery. Furthermore, deep infiltrating endometriosis may not be clearly seen in some cases during diagnosis laparoscopy. In fact, the diagnosis of adenomyosis and deep endometriosis involving retroperitoneal structures, particularly ureters and nerve roots, is extremely challenging, particularly when performed by non-experienced gynecologists. False negative procedures may result, thus significantly delaying the start of appropriate management and potentially leading to major complications. Symptoms and clinical findings of endometriosis can result in clinical diagnoses that may be strongly supported by imaging techniques even without histological confirmation. Transvaginal ultrasound, because of its non-invasiveness, dynamicity, ease of use, availability, cost-effectiveness and reproducibility, is currently considered by many endometriosis experts as the best first-line method for assessment of DIE. A systematic sonographic approach as defined by International Deep Endometriosis Analysis (IDEA) consensus was shown to improve detection rates of pelvic lesions. MRI is also considered a highly accurate imaging modality in the evaluation of DIE, particularly when involvement of the rectum, ureters and nerve roots is suspected; these areas are highly important for both the patient and the surgeon and may be poorly visualized even with laparoscopy. MRI is also increasingly used to assess the anatomic response to medical or surgical treatment and to differentiate endometriosis from adenomyosis; the latter is a specific and heterogeneous disease contributing, independently of endometriosis to symptoms, defined as the invasion of endometrial tissue into the myometrium occurring in different forms (diffuse, focal, cystic or superficial). Adenomyosis may exist on its own but in about 30% of cases it is associated with DIE. The shift toward clinical and imaging-based diagnosis shortens the time between the first consultation and the final diagnosis, but the use of non-invasive methods requires a rigorous approach to ensure meaningful and consistent results.

### Postmenopausal endometriosis: a challenging condition beyond menopause [^1161Asmf]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

Importance and Objective

Postmenopausal endometriosis is a complex condition that challenges the conventional belief that endometriosis resolves with menopause. Despite the cessation of menstruation, a subset of women continues to experience or develop endometriosis-related symptoms during the postmenopausal period. Thus, this review aimed to shed light on postmenopausal endometriosis, exploring its clinical features, diagnostic considerations, management approaches, and the potential impact on women's health.

Methods

PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were used for the research, with only articles in English language, using the following terms: "postmenopausal endometriosis", "menopause", "management", "treatment", and "quality of life", from inception to 2023.

Discussion and Conclusion

The clinical features of postmenopausal endometriosis include persistent or recurrent pelvic pain, dyspareunia, bowel, or urinary symptoms and, occasionally, abnormal vaginal bleeding. The absence of menstrual cycles presents a diagnostic challenge, as the traditional diagnostic criteria for endometriosis rely on menstrual patterns. Visual cues may be less evident, and the symptoms often overlap with other gynecological conditions, necessitating a thorough evaluation to differentiate postmenopausal endometriosis from other potential causes. Management approaches for postmenopausal endometriosis encompass surgical intervention, hormonal therapies, pain management, and individualized care. Postmenopausal endometriosis significantly impacts the quality of life, sexual health, and long-term well-being of women. Understanding the clinical features, diagnostic challenges, and management approaches of postmenopausal endometriosis is crucial for healthcare professionals to provide effective care and to improve the quality of life of women affected by this condition.

Materials and methods

Study Population

The WHSS was a two-phase (model development/validation), clinic-based study in 19 hospitals in 13 countries. Between September 2008 and January 2010, we prospectively recruited 1,396 consecutive pre-menopausal women, aged 18–45, undergoing diagnostic laparoscopy because of at least one of the following symptoms: dysmenorrhoea (34.0% in phase I vs. 31.8% in phase II), dyspareunia (12.3% in phase I vs. 14.5% in phase II), nonmenstrual pelvic pain (36.1% in phase I vs. 37.0% in phase II), menstrual dyschezia (6.9% in phase I vs. 8.0% in phase II), or infertility (56.5% in phase I vs. 47.5% in phase II). Women with a previous surgical diagnosis of endometriosis, amenorrhoea or current pregnancy, or who had taken hormonal medication (including combined oral contraception) within the previous 3 months, were excluded.

During the model generating phase I (September 2008 to June 2009), consenting women who met the inclusion criteria completed, prior to their scheduled surgery, a 25-item self-administered questionnaire in their own language. During the model validating phase II (July 2009 to January 2010), premenopausal women, aged 18–45 years, were recruited using the same inclusion and exclusion criteria as in phase I; they completed the same 25-item questionnaire before their surgery. The questionnaire incorporated items to elicit women's past medical, obstetric, and family histories, as well as items to evaluate the intensity and frequency of pelvic pain. Pelvic pain intensity was assessed on 11-point numerical pain rating scalesranging in possible values from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). The questionnaire also included standardized questions previously validated in women with pelvic pain or other symptom groups. These instruments included [1] the IBS Rome III questionnaire to identify women with pelvic pain symptoms due to irritable bowel syndromeand [2] standardized pelvic pain symptom assessment used in earlier studies in Oxford. The questionnaire also asked for sociodemographic, lifestyle, and physical attributes. Experienced gynecol-ogists recorded the laparoscopic findings in a standard manner. For those women who had preoperative pelvic ultrasound (84.7% and 92.2% of women in phases I and II, respectively), imaging findings were recorded on the surgical sheet.

### Evaluation and differential diagnosis of dyspareunia [^1168TB1B]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Dyspareunia is genital pain associated with sexual intercourse. Although this condition has historically been defined by psychologic theories, the current treatment approach favors an integrated pain model. Identification of the initiating and promulgating factors is essential to reaching a successful diagnosis. The differential diagnoses include vaginismus, inadequate lubrication, atrophy and vulvodynia (vulvar vestibulitis). Less common etiologies are endometriosis, pelvic congestion, adhesions or infections, and adnexal pathology. Urethral disorders, cystitis and interstitial cystitis may also cause painful intercourse. The location of the pain may be described as entry or deep. Vulvodynia, atrophy, inadequate lubrication and vaginismus are associated with painful entry. Deep pain occurs with the other conditions previously noted. The physical examination may reproduce the pain, such as localized pain with vulvar vestibulitis, when the vagina is touched with a cotton swab. The involuntary spasm of vaginismus may be noted with insertion of an examining finger or speculum. Palpation of the lateral vaginal walls, uterus, adnexa and urethral structures helps identify the cause. An understanding of the present organic etiology must be integrated with an appreciation of the ongoing psychologic factors and negative expectations and attitudes that perpetuate the pain cycle.

### Pelvic floor rehabilitation in the treatment of women with dyspareunia: a randomized controlled clinical trial [^112gxHCj]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dyspareunia is the complaint of persistent or recurrent pain or discomfort associated with attempted or complete vaginal penetration. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V-text revision (DSM-V-T), dyspareunia is sub-classified in genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorders in which a woman experiences recurrent genital pain before, during, or after vaginal penetration. In the United States, the reported prevalence of dyspareunia was 8% to 21% of women. However, because of cultural differences, the prevalence of dyspareunia is very different in undeveloped or developing countries. In these countries, most women with dyspareunia experience pain during sexual intercourse in their lifetimes, but they do not report their pain or seek treatment because of shame or other cultural factors such as gender superiority. For example, in a study in Iran of 319 women between the reproductive ages of 15 and 49 years, 54.5% of the women had dyspareunia.

### A practical guide to the clinical evaluation of endometriosis-associated pelvic pain [^114m7dhN]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis-associated pain (EAP) has a significant impact on the quality of life of those affected and their families. Recognizing that endometriosis is a chronic condition associated with an impairment in function and negative social impact, there is a shift toward reducing diagnostic delays and initiating timely management. This article provides a comprehensive and practical approach to the clinical diagnosis of EAP, which can subsequently facilitate prompt and directed treatment. The key components of the history, physical examination, and high-quality imaging to evaluate suspected EAP and related pain conditions are presented. Currently, biomarkers have limited utility in the diagnosis of endometriosis, but research in this area continues; development of a reliable noninvasive test for endometriosis may further improve early identification of this condition.

### Role of a symptom-based algorithmic approach to chronic pelvic pain [^1165ot5m]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a disorder that has a significant impact on the patient's quality of life. Laparoscopic diagnosis can be disappointing, and recurrence is common after surgical treatment. A symptom-based algorithmic approach to treatment of CPP is presented that is safe and cost-effective.

Methods

This approach is oriented towards making a potential clinical diagnosis of endometriosis. It relies on a structured evaluation of the patient and administration of medical therapy including GnRH agonists to selected patients. Evaluation begins with a history and physical examination; selected cases receive specific therapy. Non-responders undergo appropriate laboratory and imaging studies. If results remain negative, it is possible to make a clinical diagnosis of endometriosis and begin empiric treatment.

Results

Early results strongly indicate that using this approach allowed clinicians to make highly accurate diagnoses (correct in 85–90% of cases).

Conclusion

Use of this approach will minimize the need for surgery.

### Imaging of pelvic venous disorders (PeVD); should every patient get an MRI? [^114iw6m6]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Pelvic venous disease (PeVD) is part of the broad differential diagnosis of chronic pelvic pain with a challenging diagnosis and clinical workup to identify those patients that are most likely to benefit from intervention. Ultrasound, MRI, CT, venography, and intravascular ultrasound can all provide information to aid in the diagnostic algorithm. The purpose of this article is to review imaging as a component of the outpatient workup of patients with chronic pelvic pain to guide appropriate understanding and use of imaging modalities to accurately identify patients suffering from PeVD. A favored approach is to begin with transabdominal sonography with selective use of MRI/MRV in specific patient populations.

Early (dating) ultrasound — The Work Group advises a first-trimester ultrasound to establish or confirm the gestational age and estimated birth date and to confirm the presence of cardiac activity; for pregnant patients who present after the first trimester, we advise performing a dating and anatomical ultrasound at the earliest opportunity, preferably before 22 weeks. The estimated due date is initially established by calculating 280 days from the first day of the last normal menstrual period, but only about 50% of patients accurately recall the date of the last menstrual period and menstrual cycles might be shorter or longer than 28 days, supporting ultrasound confirmation. Beyond dating, early ultrasound indications include evaluation of vaginal bleeding, confirmation of an intrauterine location, presence and chronicity of multiple gestations, presence of uterine anomalies, or presence of other pelvic pathology, and patients with complaints of bleeding or pain should be referred for immediate ultrasound on presentation.

### Effects of long-term treatment with dienogest on the quality of life and sexual function of women affected by endometriosis-associated pelvic pain [^1128n4yj]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Ninety-two women aged 18–37 (mean age 28 ± 8) where enrolled in this prospective study. All the women underwent physical and gynecological examinations and transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) to identify or rule out rectal endometriosis, deep endometriosis, ovarian endometrioma, or adenomyosis. On the basis of ESHRE guidelines, women affected by chronic pelvic pain with a clinical diagnosis of endometriosis (dysmenorrhea, noncyclical chronic pelvic pain, deep dyspareunia, and dyschezia) confirmed with gynecological examination and TVS, were enrolled.

Sexual life and function were also assessed: sexually active women having at least one sexual event during the month before the counselling were included.

Women with a history of non-organic sexual dysfunction, or having a partner affected by sexual dysfunction were excluded. Women under GnRH analog treatment during the last 6 months, or hormonal contraceptive treatment less than 3 months before, or choosing a surgical approach were excluded.

After having received counselling on the effects and benefits of DNG, 54 (58.7%) women accepted to take 2 mg DNG once-daily and constituted the study group. The remaining 38 (41.3%) women refused the use of DNG and any other hormonal treatment, preferring to continue their previous NSAIDs on-demand therapy. They were enrolled as the control group after receiving a counseling on the therapy they chose and having signed a new informed consent form.

All the women were asked the names of the NSAIDs they were usually taking to relieve their pelvic pain: paracetamol, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, ketorolac, diclofenac by oral route were the only medication used; patients were allowed to take only NSAIDs contained in this list. No opioids or other types of NSAIDs were used or prescribed.

The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Department of General Surgery and Medical Surgical Specialties of University of Catania. Informed written consent was obtained from each woman before entering the study, and they did not receive payment of any kind.

### Diagnosing diagnostic error of endometriosis: a secondary analysis of patient experiences from a mixed-methods survey [^114q4Q6H]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Follow-up and referral

Often, patients reported being prescribed oral contraception with no response and often for much longer than the recommended 6 months by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for the management of their symptoms in lieu of having their symptoms investigated, which is reflected in the diagnostic pitfalls taxonomy subcategory of failure to monitor, note or respond to evolving/continuing/persistent symptoms (monitoring/follow-up main category of diagnostic pitfalls taxonomy). This is a reported demonstration of clinicians' not engaging in diagnostic practices consistent with care guidelines. In the case of GPs, this included failure to refer patients to OB/GYNs. This finding is supported by focus group studies of GPs who have commented on not knowing when to refer patients. In the case of misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis by OB/GYNs, there were frequent reported failures to investigate patients' symptoms after a failed trial of oral contraception — a recommended first-line treatment for endometriosis. Furthermore, there was a reported failure to refer patients to OB/GYNs with specialised training in endometriosis. It is the recommendation of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that for patients with dysmenorrhoea, for those who do not experience clinical improvement within 3–6 months after initiation of oral contraception, OB/GYNs should investigate for underlying pathological reasons for the pain, which includes endometriosis, including offering a diagnostic laparoscopy. Thus, it is noteworthy that despite patients being symptomatic for years, being switched from one type of oral contraception to another without improvement, OB/GYNs reportedly failed to investigate symptoms beyond empiric treatment with oral contraception, a trial of which is recommended to be used for a maximum of 6 months.

A 37-year-old woman with a previous diagnosis of Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome at 18 years of age was referred from a primary healthcare physician to a gynaecology appointment in our centre. She presented with a 2-year worsening pelvic pain and dyspareunia, symptoms that were previously absent and, at the time, with inadequate relief with oral analgesia. Physical examination showed absent uterine cervix and hypoplastic superior vagina. Transvaginal ultrasound and MRI suggested the presence of an hypoplasic uterus in left rotation. Laparoscopically, two asymmetric rudimentary horns were found, united by a fibrous central band, with an enlarged and congestive left horn. The three structures were removed as a whole. Histopathological examination reported the presence of multiple adenomyotic foci along the full thickness of the left rudimentary horn. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery and full remission of her symptoms.

Secondary amenorrhea — approach to evaluation emphasizes first excluding pregnancy and then using a stepwise workup: The possibility of pregnancy must be at the forefront of differential diagnoses for secondary amenorrhea, and once pregnancy has been ruled out, a stepwise approach to evaluation is recommended, as outlined in Figure 2; in contrast to primary amenorrhea, the diagnostic yield of physical examination alone is less; a thorough history and reproductive hormone profile constitute the backbone of diagnostic evaluation, and pelvic ultrasound, if accessible and available, can help streamline evaluation early in the process; in many cases, only a few of the tests listed in Figure 2 are necessary, and the temporal pattern of menses since the onset of menarche is informative.

A 23-year-old Japanese woman, previously a commercial sex worker, presented with a 2-day history of right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain, worse on deep inspiration. She had noticed increased vaginal discharge 2months earlier and had developed dull, lower abdominal pain 3weeks prior to presentation. Although pelvic examination and transvaginal ultrasonography revealed neither a tubal nor ovarian pathology, abdominal CT scan with contrast demonstrated early enhancement of the hepatic capsule, a finding pathognomonic for Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome (FHCS). Cervical discharge PCR assay confirmed Chlamydia trachomatis infection. This case highlights that normal gynaecological evaluation may be insufficient to rule out FHCS, for which physicians should have a high index of suspicion when seeing any woman of reproductive age with RUQ pain.

### Endometriosis: current concepts and therapy [^113WDPMv]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2002). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is the growth of endometrial tissue in ectopic locations. The clinical picture is extremely pleiomorphic, which can make the diagnosis difficult. Despite 70 years of theories and experimentation, the cause is not clear, and it is likely that more than one mechanism is at work in most patients. Both medical and surgical treatments are available. In each case, the woman and her physician should formulate a comprehensive treatment plan that addresses the primary complaint as well as the patient's reproductive desires.

### A scoping review of scores or grading systems for pelvic venous disorders [^112tpGXG]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Pelvic venous disorders (PeVD) represent a range of clinical entities with a multifactorial etiology often associated with chronic pelvic pain (CPP), especially in women of reproductive age. This complex group of disorders, initially reported in the late 1800s, has gained increasing recognition during the past few decades. However, due to the heterogeneity of symptoms, overlapping clinical presentations, and absence of universally accepted diagnostic criteria, they remain largely underdiagnosed.

CPP is thought to account for 10% of all outpatient gynecological visits. PeVD are estimated to account for 6% to 30% of cases of CPP. Patients typically present with symptoms of chronic, dull lower abdominal pain, often accompanied by other symptoms such as dyspareunia, postcoital pain, lower back pain, bladder irritability, and urinary urgency. These symptoms are generally exacerbated by increases in intra-abdominal pressure, prolonged standing, or menstruation. Classification of PeVD is challenging, given their diverse symptomatology and complex pathophysiology. Moreover, their multiformity and wide differential diagnosis spanning multiple specialties, makes establishing a diagnostic pathway challenging, often leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment.

Despite the relatively high prevalence of PeVD and their significant impact on the quality of life of those affected, gaps remain in the diagnostic pathway, mainly due to the lack of a standardized and validated scoring or grading systems. Recognizing this, the Society of Interventional Radiology Foundation funded a research consensus panel to prioritize a research agenda to address these gaps in 2019. The panel prioritized developing (1) consensus on the clinical and imaging criteria for PeVD; (2) a discriminative tool to categorize patients with PeVD; and (3) quality of life (QOL) tools to measure the health burden for women affected by PeVD and its change after treatment. This scoping review seeks to identify all existing scores or grading systems used in any step of the PeVD management pathway, providing a foundation for the development of robust, universally acceptable clinical scoring tools.

### Dyspareunia in a teenager reveals a rare occurrence: retroperitoneal cervical leiomyoma of the left pararectal space [^113hRsUM]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Retroperitoneal uterine leiomyoma is a very rare occurrence and to discover it as a cause of female sexual dysfunction in a teen is unusual.

Case

An 18-year-old black woman reported deep dyspareunia, resulting in severe distress. Gynecological and instrumental examinations showed a pelvic mass of 7 cm in diameter. The preoperative diagnosis was uterine fibroid, but the exact location of the leiomyoma was uncertain. Laparoscopic examination showed a pedunculated retroperitoneal cervical leiomyoma in the left pararectal space. After surgical excision of the mass, normal sexual activity was restored.

Summary and Conclusion

When a teen experiences pain with intercourse, pelvic masses should be part of differential diagnosis of dyspareunia.

### Diagnosis and management of chronic pelvic pain [^116TT42r]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain is difficult to diagnose and to treat [81] because of the multiple and often overlapping causes [82]. A systematic approach aids in the thorough evaluation and appropriate therapy. At the initial visit(s), a thorough history should be taken and complete physical examination performed. Screening for co-existing conditions, such as depression, narcotic dependency, and physical, sexual, or emotional abuse is crucial so these issues may be addressed immediately while additional causes for pelvic pain are evaluated. The relative likelihood of gastrointestinal, urologic, musculoskeletal, or gynecologic etiology must be considered to guide a more thorough initial evaluation. With gynecologic chronic pelvic pain, differentiation between hormonally responsive and nonresponsive conditions is helpful for diagnosis and treatment. Therapy can then be instituted or an appropriate referral made.

### Early noninvasive diagnosis of endometriosis: dysmenorrhea and specific ultrasound findings are important indicators in young women [^1164Mz1i]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To diagnose endometriosis in young patients ≤ 25y with severe dysmenorrhea through specific ultrasonographic examination findings and to correlate the symptoms to its different forms: ovarian, deep infiltrating endometriosis, and adenomyosis.

Design

A retrospective observational study.

Setting

University Hospital.

Patient(S)

Women aged 12–25 years with severe dysmenorrhea and a visual analog scale score ≥ 7.

Intervention(S)

This study included 371 women aged 12–25 years referred to our gynecological ultrasound (US) Unit between January 2016 and December 2021 with severe dysmenorrhea and a visual analog scale score ≥ 7. Two dimensional, 3 dimensional, and power Doppler US pelvic examinations (transvaginal or transrectal in presexually active girls) were performed on all patients. Medical history and symptoms were collected routinely for each patient before the scan.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

All possible locations of endometriosis, isolated or combined occurrence, were evaluated, and recorded using an US dedicated mapping sheet. Painful symptoms were evaluated by visual analog scale and correlated to the different endometriosis forms.

Result(S)

At least one US endometriosis feature was identified in 131 (35.3%) patients, whereas the US findings of 170 (45.8%) were normal despite the referred dysmenorrhea. Of the 131 patients with endometriosis, ovarian endometrioma was found in 54 (41.2%), and 22 (16.8%) had an isolated endometrioma. Adenomyosis was detected in 67 (51.1%) patients, and 28 (21.4%) showed its isolated indications. Posterior deep infiltrating endometriosis was found in 70 (53.4%) patients, and uterosacral ligament (USL) fibrotic thickening was found in 63 (48.1%). In 23 patients, the USL lesion was completely isolated. The combined occurrence of dysmenorrhea with dyspareunia, bowel symptoms, and heavy menstrual bleeding increases the presence of endometriosis up to 59%, 63%, and 45%, respectively.

Conclusion(S)

In young patients with severe dysmenorrhea, the US-based detection rate of pelvic endometriosis was one-third. USL fibrotic thickening and mild adenomyosis are often the only findings, so an accurate pelvic US scan can provide an early diagnosis by identifying small endometriotic lesions. Young patients with dysmenorrhea should be referred to an expert sonographer to minimize the delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis.

### Evaluation and management of women with endometriosis [^113MzMa7]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is a condition that often leads to a variety of symptoms that range from pain complaints to infertility. Endometriosis is also found in women who are asymptomatic. The diagnosis of endometriosis can be made clinically with reliability similar to that of one made surgically. Medical treatment options are effective, as are surgical treatment options. Complications associated with surgery, however, push the balance in favor of medical therapy whenever possible. Based on the body of evidence available at present, women with endometriosis-related complaints should be treated with a first-line medical therapy. If that fails, a second-line medical therapy is warranted under most conditions. Laparoscopic surgery should be reserved for patients in whom second-line medical therapy has failed or is contraindicated by desire to conceive immediately or as soon as possible.

### Fertility evaluation of infertile women: a committee opinion [^114TwpuY]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Infertility history assessment — history elements include current conception attempts (length of time of unprotected intercourse, coital frequency, use of ovulation monitoring, partner status, and presence of sexual dysfunction) and prior fertility history; gynecologic history includes menstrual history (age at menarche; cycle length, duration, and amount of bleeding; intermenstrual bleeding; dysmenorrhea; molimina) and general gynecologic history (cervical screening history, contraceptive use including type and duration, sexually transmitted infections and/or pelvic inflammatory disease, dyspareunia or chronic pelvic pain, and history of abnormal cervical screening). Obstetrical history records total number of pregnancies and outcomes, including biochemical miscarriage, clinical miscarriage, pregnancy of unknown location, terminations, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, and live birth, plus whether conception was with current versus prior partner(s), details of any fertility treatment, obstetrical complications (gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders, preterm delivery, placental disease, intrauterine growth restriction), and congenital disease or birth defects in offspring. Medical history covers past medical and surgical history — medical disorders with particular attention to endocrine, autoimmune, genetic, psychiatric, or malignant disorders; endocrine history "should include evaluation of the thyroid, and the presence of galactorrhea and hirsutism" — as well as prior hospitalizations, surgical procedures, and medications and allergies (use of gonadotoxic medications or radiotherapy, current medications including supplements, and drug allergies with reaction type). Additional considerations specify that "Patient may incorrectly identify attempts at pregnancy as only conscientious efforts for conception, rather than periods of active sexual activity without contraception", that "Coital frequency may change over time", and to "assess whether patient has been successful in detecting ovulatory surges" if using urine LH kits and to "discuss its limitations in accurately predicting the fertile window" when using a fertility tracking app. For menstrual history, "If menses onset < 8 years of age or > 14 years of age, was evaluation performed and were menses ever achieved spontaneously?" and "If menstrual interval < 21 days or > 35 days or there is a significant variation in range, perform a review of systems including: Thyroid symptoms, Hirsutism, Visual field defects, Galactorrhea, Stressors, Dietary and exercise habits, Vasomotor symptoms". Also ask, "If abnormal menstrual bleeding, were any investigations performed and was a diagnosis made?" and "Have any surgical cervical excision procedures been performed?"; "If outcome other than live birth, inquire about related evaluations"; and "If diagnosed with an endocrine disease, what is the status of the disease, including medications and last hormonal testing?".

### ACOG committee opinion no. 760: dysmenorrhea and endometriosis in the adolescent [^115eEvNn]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Dysmenorrhea, or menstrual pain, is the most common menstrual symptom among adolescent girls and young women. Most adolescents experiencing dysmenorrhea have primary dysmenorrhea, defined as painful menstruation in the absence of pelvic pathology. When the patient's history suggests primary dysmenorrhea, empiric treatment should be initiated. When a patient does not experience clinical improvement for her dysmenorrhea within 3–6 months of therapy initiation, her obstetrician-gynecologist should investigate for possible secondary causes and for treatment adherence. Secondary dysmenorrhea refers to painful menses due to pelvic pathology or a recognized medical condition. Endometriosis is the leading cause of secondary dysmenorrhea in adolescents. Endometriosis should be considered in patients with persistent, clinically significant dysmenorrhea despite treatment with hormonal agents and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, particularly if no other etiology for chronic pelvic pain or secondary dysmenorrhea has been identified based on history, physical examination, and pelvic ultrasonography. The appearance of endometriosis may be different in an adolescent than in an adult woman. In adolescents, endometriotic lesions are typically clear or red and can be difficult to identify for gynecologists unfamiliar with endometriosis in adolescents. Endometriosis in adolescents is considered a chronic disease with potential for progression if left untreated. The goals of therapy include symptom relief, suppression of disease progression, and protection of future fertility. Therapy must be individualized, and obstetrician-gynecologists should consider patient choice, the need for contraception, contraindications to hormone use, and potential adverse effects and counsel the adolescent and her family on treatment options.

8 A CALL TO ACTION ON CHRONIC PELVIC PAIN

CPP inflicts significant suffering and economic burden upon millions of women worldwide, yet it remains a neglected area of health research and policy. This disparity between impact and resource allocation is unacceptable. This consensus statement calls for urgent action to prioritize CPP by promoting the following key actions:
Establishing a consensus definition of chronic pelvic pain: the first step must be to obtain a consensus on the definition of CPP, agreed upon by multiple societies and advocacy groups. A clear definition paves the way for the development of a classification system, akin to PALM‐COEINfor abnormal uterine bleeding, which will enable clinicians to accurately diagnose CPP and enhance trainee and health professional education. An established definition will also assist researchers to precisely identify study populations, promote standardized data collection, and aid with the interpretation of results across studies, including systematic reviews and meta‐analyses. A clear definition empowers patients by giving them a name for their condition, validating their experience, and facilitating communication with healthcare professionals. Finally, a consensus definition provides policymakers with a focus for understanding the scope of the problem and allocating resources appropriately.
Empower women and reduce stigma: women with CPP play a vital role in changing the landscape of care for this condition. Their lived experiences are invaluable in identifying gaps in care, developing more effective and compassionate treatment approaches, and driving improvements in access to care. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) and International Pelvic Pain Society (IPPS) call on affiliated societies to partner with women with CPP and patient advocacy groups to develop and implement strategies that not only remove stigma and create a supportive environment where women feel empowered to seek help, but also actively engage them in promoting education and advancing research on this condition. Their participation in studies, sharing of experiences, and input on research priorities are vital for enhancing our understanding of CPP mechanisms, developing innovative diagnostic tools, discovering more effective treatments, and developing policies that improve care. This type of collaboration with patients can be fostered through research, awareness campaigns, educational initiatives, and open dialogue.
Expand access to quality transdisciplinary care: increasing access to transdisciplinary care for women with CPP requires a multifaceted approach. First, improving physician education is essential, ensuring that healthcare professionals across various specialties (e.g. gynecology, primary care, physical therapy, mental health) are well‐versed in the complexities of CPP and the benefits of collaborative care. Simultaneously, developing practical tools and resources, such as standardized assessment protocols, referral pathways, and patient education materials, can facilitate coordinated care delivery. Disseminating evidence‐based clinical guidelines will ensure consistent, high‐quality care across different healthcare settings. Integrating CPP care into primary care settings will enable early diagnosis, timely referral to specialized services, and improved care coordination. Importantly, these resources must be adaptable to countries with varied cultures and socioeconomic means. It is imperative that healthcare professionals and models of care shift away from treating CPP as an acute condition to a chronic care model that prioritizes long‐term management, physical and emotional rehabilitation, and mental well‐being. Policies should encourage the establishment of transdisciplinary pain clinics or networks, where specialists can work together, to provide comprehensive and integrated care. Finally, an evidence‐based biopsychosocial and trauma‐informed approach must be incorporated into all aspects of evaluation and management. This approach recognizes that women with CPP come from diverse backgrounds and varying socioeconomic statuses, and may have experienced traumatic events such as war, poverty, or abuse, all of which can significantly influence their pain experience and response to treatment. By acknowledging these factors and shifting the focus from "curing" an acute problem to managing a long‐term health condition, healthcare providers can promote well‐being and create a safe and supportive environment, foster trust, and facilitate more effective, patient‐centered care.
Enhance education and awareness: CPP is often misunderstood, with many women suffering in silence. To address this, public awareness campaigns are needed to educate women, their families, and communities about CPP symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment options. These campaigns must challenge the harmful notion that pelvic pain is an acceptable or normal part of being a woman. By reducing stigma and encouraging help‐seeking behavior, we can empower women to take control of their health and seek timely care. Simultaneously, healthcare providers need comprehensive education and training to effectively diagnose and manage CPP. This includes promoting a transdisciplinary approach, utilizing the biopsychosocial model, and ensuring cultural sensitivity in all patient interactions. Providing women with culturally relevant educational resources will further empower them to actively participate in their care and navigate the healthcare system with confidence.
Prioritizing research and funding: there are multifactorial causes for CPP and all of them are under‐studied. FIGO and IPPS emphasize the urgent need to recognize the underestimated impact of CPP. This underestimation leads to inadequate funding, limited recognition within healthcare systems, and ultimately, suboptimal care for millions of women. To address this, a rigorous assessment of CPP's full economic burden, including the often‐overlooked costs of unpaid work and lost productivity, is crucial. This comprehensive understanding will inform resource allocation and prioritize effective interventions. Furthermore, research efforts must explore the knowledge gaps, stigma, and barriers to care that perpetuate the cycle of neglect. Increased investment in transdisciplinary CPP research is essential. This research should prioritize innovative diagnostic tools, non‐surgical interventions that are more easily accessible, tailoring treatments to individual needs, and therapies that improve all aspects of physical, mental, and emotional health. Including CPP in global health agendas and research funding priorities is not only a matter of justice for women but is also essential for the well‐being and economic prosperity of societies worldwide.
Developing dedicated CPP sections within healthcare societies: all relevant healthcare societies, including those representing gynecology, urology, gastroenterology, primary care, pain management, physical therapy, and behavioral and mental health, are strongly encouraged to develop dedicated sections, committees, or working groups specifically focused on CPP.
FIGO and IPPS are committed to universal gynecologic health coverage and work as hard on creating preventive care strategies as they do on access to the best medical, surgical, and emergency gynecologic care.

### Hidden in plain sight: a malpositioned intrauterine device as the culprit of acute pelvic pain-a case report [^111rAKYn]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Malpositioned intrauterine devices (IUDs) are not yet a well recognized cause of acute pelvic pain. Correct identification relies on recognizing key imaging findings such as low-lying or endocervical positioning, and an understanding that acute pelvic pain may be the result of a malpositioned IUD. We report the case of a 28-year-old sexually active female (she/her/hers) with a history of a malpositioned IUD, who presented with sudden onset, unprovoked, right sided pelvic pain. She denied hematuria, dysuria, vaginal discharge, or vaginal bleeding. On physical examination she noted right-sided pelvic tenderness below McBurney's point; however, a pelvic examination was deferred. Ultrasound revealed an IUD in the endocervical canal. A CT confirmed a low-lying IUD. These findings were initially interpreted as normal. Only after follow-up with primary care, the IUD was removed and the patient reported complete resolution of her symptoms. This case highlights the importance of recognizing malpositioned IUDs on imaging. As in this case, misdiagnosis can result in overtesting and delays in patient care. Emergency providers should be familiar with radiographic findings and include malpositioned IUDs on their differential diagnosis.
