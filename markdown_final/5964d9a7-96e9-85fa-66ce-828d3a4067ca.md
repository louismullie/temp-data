## Question

When wind speeds up as it blows over the top of a hill, atmospheric pressure there

Answer Choices:
A. increases
B. decreases
C. isn't affected
D. reduces to zero

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what happens to atmospheric pressure when wind speeds up as it flows over the top of a hill. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the physical principle that relates wind speed and pressure. Then, I should verify whether that principle applies to airflow over topography. Next, I will consider the specific geometry of flow over a hill and what that implies for speed and pressure changes. Finally, I will review real-world examples to confirm the direction of the pressure change and select the correct answer among the options provided.

> Let me first confirm the core principle. Faster fluid flow corresponds to lower static pressure, a consequence of Bernoulli's principle and conservation of energy in inviscid, incompressible flow; this is precisely why airplane wings generate lift and why Venturi devices work, and it is also reflected in atmospheric wind–pressure relationships in storms, where higher wind speeds are associated with larger pressure deficits, as shown in tropical cyclone physics and empirical models of the wind–pressure relationship.

> Wait, let me verify that this applies to airflow over hills and not just to engineered devices or large storms. When wind encounters a hill, the streamlines compress and the flow accelerates over the crest to conserve mass, which is a classic example of constricted flow; by Bernoulli's logic, that acceleration should lower the static pressure at the crest relative to the upwind side, and this is consistent with observed wind–pressure scaling in atmospheric systems where pressure deficits scale with velocity and storm size, reinforcing the physical plausibility of lower pressure where winds are stronger.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check the direction of the effect. The question is whether pressure increases or decreases as wind speeds up over the hilltop. Given the principle and the geometry, the correct inference is a decrease in static pressure at the crest where the wind is fastest, not an increase, and certainly not a reduction to zero; options A and D are therefore inconsistent with basic fluid dynamics, and option C would imply no change, which would contradict the speed–pressure trade-off embodied by Bernoulli's principle and observed in atmospheric flows.

> I should confirm with a concrete example. In tropical cyclones, the central pressure deficit grows with increasing peak wind speed and storm size, illustrating that higher winds correspond to lower pressures; while a hill is not a cyclone, the same wind–pressure physics underlies both, supporting the expectation that faster winds over a hillcrest coincide with lower local pressure, not higher or unchanged pressure.

> Putting this together, the correct answer is B, decreases, because as wind accelerates over the hilltop, static pressure drops in accordance with Bernoulli's principle and the observed wind–pressure relationship in atmospheric science.

---

The correct answer is **B. decreases**. As wind speeds up over a hilltop, the **Bernoulli effect** lowers atmospheric pressure there. This pressure drop is relative — not to zero — and reflects the conversion of static pressure to kinetic energy as the flow accelerates.

---

## Physical explanation

- **Bernoulli's principle**: In steady, incompressible, inviscid flow, an increase in fluid speed corresponds to a decrease in static pressure, while total energy along a streamline remains constant.

- **Flow over a hill**: Air accelerates over the crest because the hill constricts the flow, increasing speed and decreasing static pressure at the summit.

- **Pressure gradient**: The resulting low-pressure zone over the hilltop creates a pressure gradient that helps steer the flow and can enhance lift or generate turbulence.

---

## Quantitative relationship

The Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow is:

P + ½ρv² + ρgh = constant

Where:

- P = static pressure
- ρ = air density
- v = wind speed
- g = gravitational acceleration
- h = elevation

As v increases over the hilltop, the **½ρv² term rises**, so P must fall to keep the total constant, assuming small elevation changes.

---

## Real-world examples

- **Wind over hills**: Observations and models show lower surface pressure on hilltops where winds are stronger, consistent with Bernoulli's principle.

- **Aircraft wings**: The same principle explains lift: faster flow over the curved upper surface lowers pressure and generates upward force.

---

## Common misconceptions

Option A ("increases") is incorrect because **higher speed lowers static pressure**, not raises it. Option D ("reduces to zero") is physically impossible; pressure can drop but will not reach zero in ordinary atmospheric conditions.

---

## Conclusion

When wind speeds up over a hill, **atmospheric pressure decreases** due to the Bernoulli effect, making option B correct.

### Net zero is not enough: ratcheting ambition for sustainable health systems through reduce and support [^3f1a709b]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Net Zero is the dominant framework for organising health system decarbonisation. Yet throughout Net Zero's rise to prominence, greenhouse gas emissions have remained on a dangerous trajectory. In this analysis, we synthesise strands of Net Zero critique from the climate policy literature, examine their implications for health systems and briefly present an alternative framework for decarbonisation. We begin by reviewing three families of Net Zero critique which have, to date, received little attention in the sustainable healthcare space: unambitious and inequitable pledges, accounting failures, and structural problems with the framework itself. Together, these critiques challenge the idea that the Net Zero agenda is best positioned to deliver upon the Paris Agreement commitment to limit temperature rise to below 1.5°C-2°C. We then consider how each challenge manifests in the health sector with examples from state and non-state actors. Finally, we briefly introduce an alternative 'reduce and support' approach which aims to address some of Net Zero's weaknesses. Reduce-and-support represents a conceptual pivot that would extend current best practices in science-based mitigation targets while exchanging the atomised trading of problematic carbon offsets for resource pooling towards collective efforts at deep decarbonisation. We discuss the moral, political and practical advantages of this framework and identify areas for future work. By considering the adoption of reduce-and-support, health systems can provide leadership for ratcheting climate ambition at this pivotal moment of accelerating climate breakdown.

### Offshore wind and wave energy can reduce total installed capacity required in zero-emissions grids [^cf20125b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Results

Total installed capacity of the zero-carbon grid decreases

In general, as offshore wind and wave energy 2050 cost targets decrease, and consequently their deployment in the grid in 2050 increases, the total installed zero-emissions generation capacity in the Western Interconnection decreases (Fig. 2 a). The overall installed capacity decreases by a maximum of 133 GW between scenario 1 (most expensive offshore wind and wave energy cost targets) and scenario 24 (very advanced offshore wind energy cost target and wave energy cost parity with land-based wind in 2050). This corresponds to a 17% decrease in total installed capacity in the grid, which is mostly driven by decreased cost targets of offshore wind energy, and, thus, increased deployment of offshore wind energy, as seen in Fig. 2 a. When wave energy cost target decreases from the most conservative to the most optimistic wave energy cost target, we see a maximum decrease in total installed capacity of 3%.

Scenario numbers are displayed at the top of each bar. a Total 2050 installed zero-emissions generation capacity (GW) in the Western Interconnection in each scenario. Total installed capacity decreases with decreasing offshore wind energy cost targets and mostly decreases with decreasing wave energy cost targets until offshore wind energy costs decline beyond the NREL ATB moderate scenario. b 2050 solar energy installed capacity (GW) in each scenario. Solar energy installed capacity decreases with decreasing offshore wind and wave energy cost targets. c 2050 energy storage installed capacity (GW) in each scenario. Energy storage installed capacity decreases with decreasing offshore wind and wave energy cost targets. d 2050 total land-based transmission capacity (GW) in the Western Interconnection for each scenario. Transmission capacity decreases with decreasing wave energy cost targets and increases with decreasing offshore wind energy cost targets. Note that the x and y axes are flipped in plot (d). This is done so that the trend is fully visible. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

### Frequency stabilization and noise-induced spectral narrowing in resonators with zero dispersion [^d7b5b03a]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

Our findings show that the spectral width of micromechanical resonators is determined by the interplay of damping, nonlinearity, and additive noise. In a conventional nonlinear oscillator, where the transformed backbone line is monotonic, the fluctuation spectrum peak widens as the noise intensity increases. For a resonator with zero dispersion, where the transformed backbone line is non-monotonic, the spectral peak undergoes narrowing as the noise intensity is increased in some range related to E zd, in agreement with theoretical calculations.

For the zero-dispersion resonator, the optimal frequency stability of self-sustained oscillations shows a considerable improvement as compared to conventional nonlinear resonator. One advantage of such an approach to stabilize the frequency in the presence of strong nonlinearity is that only a single vibrational mode is involved. Matching the frequency of other modesis therefore unnecessary, potentially simplifying the operation.

The zero dispersion in our resonator is obtained by tuning the negative electrostatic nonlinearity relative to the positive intrinsic nonlinearity of the springs. Non-monotonicity of a transformed backbone line can also be achieved using other methods, such as the coupling of two nanomechanical resonatorsor the negative nonlinear friction induced by dynamical backaction from a photon or phonon cavity. Thus, zero dispersion is a rather generic feature of mechanical resonators and such resonators provide a well-controlled platform to investigate and exploit zero-dispersion phenomena reported in the present work as well as others that have not yet been experimentally observed.

The improvement of frequency stability for resonators driven into self-sustained vibrations using feedback was demonstrated for applied noise that is additive. Such noise plays a role similar to thermal–mechanical noise that leads to both phase and amplitude fluctuations. At small vibration amplitudes, the direct contribution to phase fluctuations dominates. As the amplitude increases, conventional nonlinearity converts amplitude noise into phase noise. The effect of such a conversion is substantially reduced in the zero-dispersion regime with d ω /d E = 0 so that amplitude fluctuations do not affect the phase stability even at large vibration amplitudes. If, instead, the phase noise is dominated by fluctuations in the eigenfrequency of the resonator –, operating the feedback loop in the regime of zero dispersion does not yield improvement in phase stability because amplitude fluctuations are not involved.

### Vitamin D supplementation for prevention of mortality in adults [^ff858a5d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The available evidence on vitamin D and mortality is inconclusive.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of vitamin D for prevention of mortality in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, the Science Citation Index Expanded, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (to January 2011). We scanned bibliographies of relevant publications and asked experts and pharmaceutical companies for additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials that compared vitamin D at any dose, duration, and route of administration versus placebo or no intervention. Vitamin D could have been administered as supplemental vitamin D (vitamin D(3) (cholecalciferol) or vitamin D(2) (ergocalciferol)) or an active form of vitamin D (1α-hydroxyvitamin D (alfacalcidol) or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol)).

Data Collection and Analysis

Six authors extracted data independently. Random-effects and fixed-effect model meta-analyses were conducted. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratios (RR). To account for trials with zero events, meta-analyses of dichotomous data were repeated using risk differences (RD) and empirical continuity corrections. Risk of bias was considered in order to minimise risk of systematic errors. Trial sequential analyses were conducted to minimise the risk of random errors.

Main Results

Fifty randomised trials with 94,148 participants provided data for the mortality analyses. Most trials included elderly women (older than 70 years). Vitamin D was administered for a median of two years. More than one half of the trials had a low risk of bias. Overall, vitamin D decreased mortality (RR 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 1.00, I(2) = 0%). When the different forms of vitamin D were assessed separately, only vitamin D(3) decreased mortality significantly (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.98, I(2) = 0%; 74,789 participants, 32 trials) whereas vitamin D(2), alfacalcidol, or calcitriol did not. Trial sequential analysis supported our finding regarding vitamin D(3), corresponding to 161 individuals treated to prevent one additional death. Vitamin D(3) combined with calcium increased the risk of nephrolithiasis (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.34, I(2) = 0%). Alfacalcidol and calcitriol increased the risk of hypercalcaemia (RR 3.18, 95% CI 1.17 to 8.68, I(2) = 17%). Data on health-related quality of life and health economics were inconclusive.

Authors' Conclusions

Vitamin D in the form of vitamin D(3) seems to decrease mortality in predominantly elderly women who are mainly in institutions and dependent care. Vitamin D(2), alfacalcidol, and calcitriol had no statistically significant effect on mortality. Vitamin D(3) combined with calcium significantly increased nephrolithiasis. Both alfacalcidol and calcitriol significantly increased hypercalcaemia.

### Vitamin D supplementation for prevention of mortality in adults [^58c7c73b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Available evidence on the effects of vitamin D on mortality has been inconclusive. In a recent systematic review, we found evidence that vitamin D3 may decrease mortality in mostly elderly women. The present systematic review updates and reassesses the benefits and harms of vitamin D supplementation used in primary and secondary prophylaxis of mortality.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of vitamin D supplementation for prevention of mortality in healthy adults and adults in a stable phase of disease.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, the Science Citation Index-Expanded and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (all up to February 2012). We checked references of included trials and pharmaceutical companies for unidentified relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials that compared any type of vitamin D in any dose with any duration and route of administration versus placebo or no intervention in adult participants. Participants could have been recruited from the general population or from patients diagnosed with a disease in a stable phase. Vitamin D could have been administered as supplemental vitamin D (vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) or vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol)) or as an active form of vitamin D (1α-hydroxyvitamin D (alfacalcidol) or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol)).

Data Collection and Analysis

Six review authors extracted data independently. Random-effects and fixed-effect meta-analyses were conducted. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratios (RRs). To account for trials with zero events, we performed meta-analyses of dichotomous data using risk differences (RDs) and empirical continuity corrections. We used published data and data obtained by contacting trial authors. To minimise the risk of systematic error, we assessed the risk of bias of the included trials. Trial sequential analyses controlled the risk of random errors possibly caused by cumulative meta-analyses.

Main Results

We identified 159 randomised clinical trials. Ninety-four trials reported no mortality, and nine trials reported mortality but did not report in which intervention group the mortality occurred. Accordingly, 56 randomised trials with 95,286 participants provided usable data on mortality. The age of participants ranged from 18 to 107 years. Most trials included women older than 70 years. The mean proportion of women was 77%. Forty-eight of the trials randomly assigned 94,491 healthy participants. Of these, four trials included healthy volunteers, nine trials included postmenopausal women and 35 trials included older people living on their own or in institutional care. The remaining eight trials randomly assigned 795 participants with neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory or rheumatoid diseases. Vitamin D was administered for a weighted mean of 4.4 years. More than half of the trials had a low risk of bias. All trials were conducted in high-income countries. Forty-five trials (80%) reported the baseline vitamin D status of participants based on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Participants in 19 trials had vitamin D adequacy (at or above 20 ng/mL). Participants in the remaining 26 trials had vitamin D insufficiency (less than 20 ng/mL). Vitamin D decreased mortality in all 56 trials analysed together (5,920/47,472 (12.5%) vs 6,077/47,814 (12.7%); RR 0.97 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 0.99); P = 0.02; I(2) = 0%). More than 8% of participants dropped out. 'Worst-best case' and 'best-worst case' scenario analyses demonstrated that vitamin D could be associated with a dramatic increase or decrease in mortality. When different forms of vitamin D were assessed in separate analyses, only vitamin D3 decreased mortality (4,153/37,817 (11.0%) vs 4,340/38,110 (11.4%); RR 0.94 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.98); P = 0.002; I(2) = 0%; 75,927 participants; 38 trials). Vitamin D2, alfacalcidol and calcitriol did not significantly affect mortality. A subgroup analysis of trials at high risk of bias suggested that vitamin D2 may even increase mortality, but this finding could be due to random errors. Trial sequential analysis supported our finding regarding vitamin D3, with the cumulative Z-score breaking the trial sequential monitoring boundary for benefit, corresponding to 150 people treated over five years to prevent one additional death. We did not observe any statistically significant differences in the effect of vitamin D on mortality in subgroup analyses of trials at low risk of bias compared with trials at high risk of bias; of trials using placebo compared with trials using no intervention in the control group; of trials with no risk of industry bias compared with trials with risk of industry bias; of trials assessing primary prevention compared with trials assessing secondary prevention; of trials including participants with vitamin D level below 20 ng/mL at entry compared with trials including participants with vitamin D levels equal to or greater than 20 ng/mL at entry; of trials including ambulatory participants compared with trials including institutionalised participants; of trials using concomitant calcium supplementation compared with trials without calcium; of trials using a dose below 800 IU per day compared with trials using doses above 800 IU per day; and of trials including only women compared with trials including both sexes or only men. Vitamin D3 statistically significantly decreased cancer mortality (RR 0.88 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.98); P = 0.02; I(2) = 0%; 44,492 participants; 4 trials). Vitamin D3 combined with calcium increased the risk of nephrolithiasis (RR 1.17 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.34); P = 0.02; I(2) = 0%; 42,876 participants; 4 trials). Alfacalcidol and calcitriol increased the risk of hypercalcaemia (RR 3.18 (95% CI 1.17 to 8.68); P = 0.02; I(2) = 17%; 710 participants; 3 trials).

Authors' Conclusions

Vitamin D3 seemed to decrease mortality in elderly people living independently or in institutional care. Vitamin D2, alfacalcidol and calcitriol had no statistically significant beneficial effects on mortality. Vitamin D3 combined with calcium increased nephrolithiasis. Both alfacalcidol and calcitriol increased hypercalcaemia. Because of risks of attrition bias originating from substantial dropout of participants and of outcome reporting bias due to a number of trials not reporting on mortality, as well as a number of other weaknesses in our evidence, further placebo-controlled randomised trials seem warranted.

Vitamin D supplementation — falls outcomes: In 16 trials assessing participants with any fall as the unit of measure, the risk ratio (RR) was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.91–1.03), with an absolute effects size of 16 fewer people with falls per 1000 (from 48 fewer to 16 more); when the number of falls was the unit, the IRR was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.81–0.99), with no effect in low–risk-of-bias studies (IRR 1.03 [95% CI, 0.92, 1.11]) and greater reductions in institutional-based studies (IRR 0.82 [95% CI, 0.69–0.94]) than community-based studies (IRR 0.96 [95% CI, 0.83–1.05]); among participants with low vitamin D status (< 20 ng/ mL [50 nmol/L]), the RR for fall with vitamin D was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.40–1.05).

2.3	Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of XANAX

To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue XANAX or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].

Reduced the dosage by no more than 0.5 mg every 3 days. Some patients may benefit from an even more gradual discontinuation. Some patients may prove resistant to all discontinuation regimens.

In a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients which compared the recommended taper schedule with a slower taper schedule, no difference was observed between the groups in the proportion of patients who tapered to zero dose; however, the slower schedule was associated with a reduction in symptoms associated with a withdrawal syndrome.

2.4	Dosage Recommendations in Geriatric Patients

In geriatric patients, the recommended starting oral dosage of XANAX is 0.25 mg, given 2 or 3 times daily. This may be gradually increased if needed and tolerated. Geriatric patients may be especially sensitive to the effects of benzodiazepines. If adverse reactions occur at the recommended starting dosage, the dosage may be reduced [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.5	Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Hepatic Impairment

In patients with hepatic impairment, the recommended starting oral dosage of XANAX is 0.25 mg, given 2 or 3 times daily. This may be gradually increased if needed and tolerated. If adverse reactions occur at the recommended starting dose, the dosage may be reduced [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.6	Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions

XANAX should be reduced to half of the recommended dosage when a patient is started on ritonavir and XANAX together, or when ritonavir administered to a patient treated with XANAX. Increase the XANAX dosage to the target dose after 10 to 14 days of dosing ritonavir and XANAX together. It is not necessary to reduce XANAX dose in patients who have been taking ritonavir for more than 10 to 14 days.

XANAX is contraindicated with concomitant use of all strong CYP3A inhibitors, except ritonavir [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

### Frequency stabilization and noise-induced spectral narrowing in resonators with zero dispersion [^2ab43045]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Frequency stabilization in the zero-dispersion regime

The reduced spectral width in the zero-dispersion regime offers new opportunities for frequency stabilization in applications of frequency standards. In the linear regime, the spectral width directly determines the frequency stability when the resonator is driven into self-sustained oscillations via active feedback, where the mechanical resonator serves as the frequency-selecting element. To evade thermal noise or noise from the feedback amplifier, it is beneficial to maximize the vibration amplitude of the mechanical resonator, provided that the response of the mechanical element remains linear. In practice, however, as the vibration amplitude increases, nonlinear effects become more prominent. Fluctuations in the vibration amplitude are converted via the nonlinearity into frequency fluctuations. Increasing the vibration amplitude eventually leads to a degradation of phase stability of self-sustained oscillations. To demonstrate this phenomenon, we drive our resonator into self-sustained vibrations using a phase-locked loop (see Methods). We then record the frequency and amplitude of this oscillator as a function of time, using an averaging time of ~160 ms. Figure 4b plots the distributions of the measured frequency and amplitude in the conventional nonlinear case as the purple circles for different driving amplitudes of the feedback loop. The phase delay Δ φ between the oscillations and the drive of the phase-locked loop is adjusted for maximum vibration amplitude, so that the center of the distributions coincides with the peaks of the corresponding resonance response curves measured when the driving frequency is swept with the feedback turned off (blue circles). The width of the distributions along the frequency axis, which is related to the standard deviation σ ω of the frequency, display a non-monotonic dependence on the amplitude of the active drive. As shown in Fig. 4b for a monotonic backbone curve, a stronger drive initially improves the phase stability for small oscillation amplitudes. The frequency standard deviation σ ω decreases when the driving amplitude F ac is increased from 9.5 to 63.35 pN. However, at large vibration amplitudes, the nonlinear effects convert amplitude noise into phase noise, leading to an increase in σ ω when the driving amplitude is increased to 158.4 pN. The blue curve in Fig. 4d plots σ ω versus the driving amplitude of the feedback loop for the case when the transformed backbone line is monotonic, showing an optimal driving amplitude that yields the minimum standard deviation: rad s⁻¹ at F ac ≈63 pN. Here, the data are taken in a separate cool down compared to Figs. 1–3. The noise intensity D w is fixed at 6800 pN² Hz⁻¹ for self-sustained oscillations and set to zero for the resonance response curves without feedback.

### Evolutionary instability of zero-determinant strategies demonstrates that winning is not everything [^598866e5]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

We can check that Pavlov is the ESS by following the population fractions as determined by the replicator equations, which describe the frequencies of strategies in a population

where π i is the population fraction of strategy i, w i is the fitness of strategy i, andis the average fitness in the population. In our case, the fitness of strategy i is the mean payoff for this strategy, so

and. We show π ZD and π All-D (with π ZD + π All-D = 1) in Fig. 2 as a function of time for different initial conditions, and confirm that Pavlov drives ZD to extinction regardless of initial density.

Evolutionary dynamics of ZD in agent-based simulations

It could be argued that an analysis of evolutionary stability within the replicator equations ignores the complex game play that occurs in populations where the payoff is determined in each game, and where two strategies meet by chance and survive based on their accumulated fitness. We can test this by following ZD strategies in contest with Pavlov in an agent-based simulation with a fixed population size of N pop = 1,024 agents, a fixed replacement rate of 0.1% and using a fitness-proportional selection scheme (a death-birth Moran process, see Methods).

In Fig. 3, we show the population fractions π ZD and π PAV for two different initial conditions (π ZD (0) = 0.4 and 0.6), using a full agent-based simulation (solid lines) or using the replicator equations (dotted lines). Although the trajectories differ in detail (likely because in the agent-based simulations generations overlap, the number of encounters is not infinite but dictated by the replacement rate, and payoffs are accumulated over eight opponents randomly chosen from the population), the dynamics are qualitatively the same. (This can also be shown for any other stochastic strategyplaying against a ZD strategy.) Note that in the agent-based simulations, strategies have to play the first move unconditionally. In the results presented in Fig. 3, we have set this 'first move' probability to p C = 0.5 for both Pavlov and ZD.

### Quality improvement to reduce neonatal CLABSI: the journey to zero [^c830db2e]. American Journal of Perinatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Neonatal infections, including those associated with central lines, continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality despite many other improvements in neonatal outcomes. Over the past decades, significant advances have been made to reduce central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) using quality improvement methodology. This article will review pertinent studies that used both the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Model for Improvement and other innovative techniques such as orchestrated testing and health care failure mode and effects analysis. These studies, by applying best practices, have demonstrated substantial and sustainable reductions in CLABSI. Some initiatives have been able to achieve rates of zero CLABSI for prolonged periods of time. While neonates often require prolonged central venous access and suffer from impaired immunity which increases the risk of CLABSI, this review demonstrates the journey to zero is feasible. KEY POINTS: · Quality improvement methods are effective to reduce CLABSI. · Improvement strategies vary by setting. · Achieving zero CLABSI rates is possible.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

AHA/ACC 2018 cholesterol guideline — risk stratification and LDL-C reduction targets in primary prevention specify that adults 40 to 75 years can be classified as borderline risk (10-year ASCVD risk 5% to < 7.5%), intermediate-risk (7.5% to < 20%), and high-risk (≥ 20%); for intermediate-risk patients, moderate- to high-intensity statin therapy should be considered, and if a statin is given, LDL-C should be reduced by ≥ 30% and optimally by ≥ 50%. When uncertainty exists, CAC scoring is especially useful in older adults, and a CAC score of zero revises ASCVD risk downward and selects adults who show reduced benefit from starting a statin.

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^a962976e]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

2006 consensus guidelines — General comments — For certain clinical situations there is limited high-quality evidence, and in these cases the guidelines have been based on consensus expert opinion. Acceptable management strategies reflect an acceptable level of risk of failing to detect high-grade neoplasia or cancer, and it is unreasonable to expect this risk can be reduced to zero; attempts to achieve zero risk could result in greater harm than good, including overtreatment. The guidelines should never substitute for clinical judgment, and clinical judgment should always be used when applying a guideline to an individual patient because it is impossible to develop guidelines that apply to all clinical situations.

### Fluoroscopy usage in contemporary interventional electrophysiology: insights from a European registry [^07818be3]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

4.4 Dose of fluoroscopy — low, near zero, and zero

The goal of reducing exposure to ionizing radiation as much as possible is well accepted. Considering the stochastic effects of radiation it is not likely that there will ever be a recommendation for a radiation dose that is considered "safe", as very low doses may still be harmful. Thus, current best practice is to get close to ("near zero") or ideally achieve zero fluoroscopy. After numerous single‐center experience papers and feasibility studies the first prospective randomized trial (NO‐PARTY trial) showed that a minimally fluoroscopic approach significantly reduces radiation exposure during electrophysiology procedures while it does not compromise procedure time and does not affect safety and efficacy. 15

Obviously, "near zero" and zero fluoroscopy involves an expense both in terms of time (learning) as well as equipment, as additional imaging modalities such as electroanatomical mapping systems or intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) are typically used in these cases.

Of note, a zero (or near zero) fluoro approach requires individual training but the learning curve can be relatively short especially if the physician is familiar with the use of electroanatomical mapping systems and/or ICE. Nowadays all types of procedures can be performed with a (near) zero fluoroscopy approach, even complex ablations such as pulmonary vein isolation — although some form of imaging such as ICE or transesophageal echo might be necessary to perform specific procedural steps such as transseptal puncture. 16

### Surgical site infection reduction program: challenges and opportunities [^7d62e4f2]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2015). Low credibility.

Surgical site infections (SSIs) make up about 23% of hospital-acquired infections and may cost up to 10 billion dollars annually in direct medical expenses. St. Luke's Health System of Boise, Idaho implemented a committee to reduce its incidence of SSIs, focusing on the orthopaedic and neurosurgical departments. After identifying risk factors associated with patient medical comorbidities, operating room practices, and type of procedure, Project Zero recommended changes. The implementation of a preoperative clinic and protocol management of environmental and procedural factors reduced the hospitals rate by 50%. Project Zero continues to research best practices for clean room management and preventative care, striving to reach the overall goal of zero infections.

### Unwarranted variation and the goal of net zero for the NHS in england: exploring the link between efficiency working, patient outcomes and carbon footprint [^79741e46]. Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

In 2020 the NHS in England set a target of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2040. Progress has already been made towards this goal, with substantial reductions in the use of environmentally harmful anaesthetic gases, such as desflurane, in recent years. Where an effective replacement already exists, changing practice to use low carbon alternatives is relatively easy to achieve, but much greater challenges lie ahead. The Getting It Right First Time (GIRFT) programme is a clinically-led, data-driven clinical improvement initiative with a focus on reducing unwarranted variation in clinical practice and patient outcomes. Reducing unwarranted variation can improve patient care and service efficiency, and can also support the drive to net zero. In this article we set out what the GIRFT programme is doing to support sustainable healthcare in England, why it is uniquely positioned to support this goal and what the future challenges, barriers, enablers and opportunities are likely to be in the drive to net zero.

### Vitamin D: extraskeletal health [^110c9d1c]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency and likely the most common medical condition in the world. The major cause of vitamin D deficiency has been the lack of appreciation that the body requires 5- to 10-fold higher intakes than is currently recommended by health agencies. There is now overwhelming and compelling scientific and epidemiologic data suggesting that the human body requires a blood level of 25(OH)D above 30 ng/mL for maximum health. To increase the blood level to the minimum 30 ng/mL requires the ingestion of at least 1000 IU of vitamin D per day for adults. In general, there is no downside to increasing either a child's or adult's vitamin D intake.

### Frequency stabilization and noise-induced spectral narrowing in resonators with zero dispersion [^d266027d]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

For the non-monotonic backbone curves, the optimal phase stability for self-sustained oscillations is achieved at the vibration amplitude A zd at which d ω /d E = 0. By eliminating the extra contributions to phase noise converted from amplitude noise, the phase stability becomes comparable to an oscillator undergoing purely linear vibrations at amplitude A zd. It is well known that for linear resonators, the frequency standard deviation for self-sustained vibrations is inversely proportional to the vibration amplitude. Therefore, the optimal frequency standard deviation for an oscillator in the zero-dispersion regime is expected to follow a similar dependence on A zd, that is. Ideally, the phase stability can be improved by choosing A zd to be as large as possible. The upper limit in our experiment is given by the gap g between the movable plate and the fixed electrode. In practice, operating close to this upper limit could lead to the plate touching the electrode when occasional large fluctuations occur. In Figs. 3, 4, A zd is ~400 nm, about a factor of 5 smaller than g. Assuming that A zd can be increased to 80% of the upper limit, the ratio of the optimal frequency standard deviation in the zero-dispersion regime to that in the conventional regime could reach ~12, a factor of ~4 larger than in Fig. 4d. Demonstrating such best-case scenario in our device, however, is not the main goal of this paper. Instead, we choose A zd to be smaller than g to show the general features of zero-dispersion phenomena. For example, to reveal the local minimum of the spectral width as a function of the noise intensity in Fig. 3d, it is necessary to go beyond the zero-dispersion regime using vibration amplitude that approaches the maximum displacement. Promising future research directions for phase stabilization using zero dispersion include new approaches to yield large A zd, as well as the effect on the phase stability due to other phenomena that emerges when the vibration amplitude becomes large, such as nonlinear friction.

### Climate change and children's health: building a healthy future for every child [^7eea2d20]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Recommendations to government — consistent with scientific assessments, policies should be put in place that reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to net-zero by 2050, and policies also must be enacted that promote climate resilience, especially for children; stakeholders can act to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy production at the federal, state, and local levels (including preserving essential public health protections in the Clean Air Act and establishing an effective and equitable carbon pricing regimen), end federal subsidies and tax incentives for production and consumption of carbon-intensive fuels, establish laws or regulations that transition on road vehicles (the leading source of GHG emissions in the United States) to zero carbon emission while expanding public transportation and active transit infrastructure, promote more plant-based diets with reduced red meat and sugar consumption and improve food security through agricultural and livestock measures, increase urban green space and invest in heat island reduction while prioritizing historically underinvested communities, positively incentivize the health care sector to improve energy efficiency and support resilience of hospitals and health systems to climate shocks, expand and develop pediatric research and climate change related public health adaptation/mitigation and deploy early-warning and surveillance systems, promote localized community resilience and environmental justice including green building investments in public housing and schools, and advance global actions to decarbonize through sound domestic policies and support for international emission reduction efforts.

### Predicting the first steps of evolution in randomly assembled communities [^06aaf363]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Equation (5) shows that the community influences the DFE of a focal strain primarily through the degree of niche saturation. The magnitude of the typical fitness effect approaches zero asincreases (Fig. 2 d), which is consistent with the idea that the rate of evolution will be slower in communities where more niches are already filled, since the establishment probability of a beneficial mutant is proportional to its fitness effect. However, since the mean of the DFE is still centered at s = 0, the overall fraction of beneficial mutations remains constant as the niche saturation increases (Fig. 2 c), even though a smaller number are likely to survive genetic drift. This implies that surviving organisms are not necessarily at a local evolutionary optimum, where any change to their resource consumption strategy tends to be deleterious.

However, this symmetry between the frequency of beneficial and deleterious mutations critically depends on the assumption of perfect trade-offs (Δ X = 0), which will not always hold in practice. For example, a beneficial mutation could halt the production of an enzyme which is used for metabolizing a low-availability resource, while leaving the expression of other enzymes in that now-defunct pathway intact–resulting in a net cost to pure fitness. If all mutations carried such a direct cost (Δ X < 0), then Eq. (3) implies that the entire DFE would shift to the left by a constant amount, -∣ Δ X ∣. If this shift is larger than the typical spread of the DFE (∣ Δ X ∣ ≫ σ inv), then the beneficial tail of ρ μ (s) will approach an exponential shape, whose height and width will both strongly decline with the degree of niche saturation. Thus, the availability of beneficial mutations can sensitively depend on the genetic architecture of the strain's resource consumption rates.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^0bfb779e]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetes

Despite observational studies consistently confirming lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations in patients with T2D or metabolic syndrome, most MR studies have not supported these conclusions. In a small subgroup of individuals with obesity and prediabetes, supplementation provided some modest benefit, albeit lower than lifestyle modifications or metformin. Of note, daily vitamin D supplementation (4000 IU) in the large D2d trial did not retard the progression of prediabetes into T2D. A post hoc and meta-analysis, however, suggested a possible beneficial effect in individuals with vitamin D deficiency (< 30 nmol/L) at baseline or in participants who were able to achieve consistently high (≥ 100 nmol/L) serum 25(OH)D levels. Furthermore, analysis of the combined results of the D2d (US), Tromsø (Norway), and DPVD (Japan) RCTs — which were specifically designed and conducted to test whether vitamin D reduces the risk of diabetes in adults with prediabetes — showed that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of developing T2D in people with prediabetes not selected for vitamin D deficiency. In all 3 trials, the risk for diabetes was reduced in the group assigned to vitamin D compared to the placebo group, which did so in a remarkably similar way. The observed differences missed statistical significance in any trial because the reported risk reductions were smaller than each trial was powered to detect. An updated individual participant data meta-analysis of the same trials showed that vitamin D reduced the risk of progression from prediabetes to diabetes by 15%. Also, vitamin D increased the likelihood of regression to normal glucose regulation by 30%, with no evidence of risk. In additional analyses, participants in the vitamin D group who maintained intratrial blood 25(OH)D of 50 ng/mL or greater (≥ 125 nmol/L) had a 76% risk reduction in new-onset diabetes compared to those who maintained blood 25(OH)D of 20 to 29 ng/mL (50–75 nmol/L). All participants received and were encouraged to follow the current lifestyle-based advice for diabetes prevention. Based on the results of this meta-analysis, the benefit-to-risk ratio of vitamin D to lower the risk of developing T2D in adults with prediabetes is favorable. These results should not be extrapolated to the general population at low or average risk for diabetes, as the benefit-to-risk ratio of high doses for diabetes prevention may not be favorable. Despite these promising results, some questions remain, that is, the optimal vitamin D dose or formulation and the specific blood 25(OH)D level to maximize benefit with little or no risk of any side effects.

### Systemwide energy return on investment in a sustainable transition towards net zero power systems [^3778e73d]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Enormous efforts have been poured into altering modern power systems to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. The Russian war in Ukraine has clearly shown that despite all efforts, fossil fuel dependency is still a sore point of present power systems considering the immense turbulence in commodity markets due to the gas crisis and despite the depotentiation of fossil fuel consumption. This has further steered the overlong debate regarding the extent to which the dependency on fossil fuels can be reduced through energy efficiency and the rapid deployment of renewable energy (RE) sources. The Glasgow Climate Pactelucidated that the efforts to fulfil nationally determined contributions (NDCs) targets remain ineffective and the chance of keeping the global warming below 2.0 o C is less than 50%. Prior NDCs targets were updated and a few countries including China pledged to accelerate their energy transition (ET) to achieve net-zero CO 2 or net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. However, the long-term transition towards net-zero CO 2 emissions is a path full of obstacles affected by biophysical, economic, political, and technological limitations, as reducing the current emissions to almost zero requires a radical decarbonisation for all sectors. The eminent impact of diverging transition pathsrequires various tools to narrow the path selection.

### Spirometry in occupational health-2020 [^8fd61518]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Spirometry zero-flow error — over-recorded flows describes a consistent zero-flow reference error set only once per test before a complete set of maneuvers, for which the instruction is DELETE THIS TEST. The left test shows the zero-flow error while the right shows valid results despite being from the same subject, and the error elevates the FVC more than the FEV1 and falsely reduces the FEV1/FVC, which may erroneously indicate an "obstructive impairment" pattern. Detection cues include extended tails to the right on flow-volume curves and volume-time curves that climb at a constant rate without reaching a plateau until the spirometer terminates data collection, and prevention is to block the sensor when the spirometer is zeroed and hold the sensor still during subject testing.

### The precautionary principle: what is the risk of reusing disposable drops in routine ophthalmology consultations and what are the costs of reducing this risk to zero? [^8227e5a8]. Eye (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Instilling eye drops is a ubiquitous procedure in eye clinics. This audit aimed to assess the risk of contamination of disposable droppers and to quantify the financial and waste implications of reducing this risk to zero by using disposable droppers only once.

Methods

A total of 100 disposable Minims were used to place one drop in each eye of 70 patients. The dropper tip was then cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microbes.

Results

Coagulase-negative staphylococcus was cultured from five samples. The contamination rate per drop application was 2.5%. The risk of cross-contamination with coagulase-negative staphylococcus would be between 1: 400 and 1: 80 if the bottle was reused once or six times. Reducing this risk to zero costs between pound2.75 and pound4.6 million per annum and generates between 6.85 and 11.42 more tonnes of paper waste and between 12.69 and 21.15 more tonnes of plastic waste than a strategy that reuses the disposable dropper.

Conclusion

Reducing the risk of dropper contamination and subsequent cross infection has financial and environmental costs. As exposure to coagulase-negative staphylococcus is not necessarily associated with infection, it would be useful to decide acceptable risk levels for a given cost to maximise both cost-effectiveness and patient safety.

### Vitamin D: extraskeletal health [^42091167]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency and likely the most common medical condition in the world. There is a multitude of causes of vitamin D deficiency, but the major cause has been the lack of appreciation that the body requires 5- to 10-fold higher intakes than is currently recommended by the Institute of Medicine and other health agencies. It is likely that our hunter gatherer fore-fathers being exposed to sunlight on a daily basis were making several thousand IU of vitamin D a day. The fact that 100 IU of vitamin D prevented overt signs of rickets led to the false security that ingesting twice this amount was more than adequate to satisfy the body's vitamin D requirement. Although this may be true for preventing overt skeletal deformities associated with rickets, there is now overwhelming and compelling scientific and epidemiologic data suggesting that the human body requires a blood level of 25(OH)D above 30 ng/mL for maximum health. The likely reason is that essentially every tissue and cell in the body has a VDR and thus, to have enough vitamin D to satisfy all of these cellular requirements, the blood level of 25(OH)D needs to be above 30 ng/mL. It has been estimated that for every 100 IU of vitamin D ingested that the blood level of 25(OH)D increases by 1 ng/mL. Thus to theoretically achieve a blood level above 30 ng/mL requires the ingestion of 3000 IU of vitamin D a day. There is evidence, however, that when the blood levels of 25(OH)D are less than 15 ng/mL, the body is able to more efficiently use vitamin D to raise the blood level to about 20 ng/mL. To raise the blood level of 25(OH)D above 20 ng/mL requires the ingestion of 100 IU of vitamin D for every 1-ng increase; therefore to increase the blood level to the minimum 30 ng/mL requires the ingestion of at least 1000 IU of vitamin D a day for adults. There is a great need to significantly increase the recommended adequate intakes of vitamin D. All neonates during the first year of life should take at least 400 IU/d of vitamin D, and increasing it to 1000 IU/d may provide additional health benefits. Children 1 year and older should take at least 400 IU/d of vitamin D as recently recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, but they should consider increasing intake up to 2000 IU/d derive maximum health benefits from vitamin D. Prepubertal and teenage girls who received 2000 IU of vitamin D per day for a year showed improvement in their musculoskeletal health with no untoward toxicity. All adults should be taking 2000 IU of vitamin D per day. A recent study reported that adults who took 50,000 IU of vitamin D once every 2 weeks, which is equivalent to taking 3000 IU of vitamin D a day, for up to 6 years was effective in maintaining blood levels of 25(OH)D of between 40 and 60 ng/mL without any toxicity. There is no downside to increasing either a child's or adult's vitamin D intake, with the exception of acquired disorders such as granulomatous diseases including sarcoidosis and tuberculosis, as well as some lymphomas with activated macrophages that produce 1,25(OH)2D3 in an unregulated fashion.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^17ef9153]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D dosing in adults aged 50 years and older with indications for supplementation or treatment: Recommendation 11 states, "we suggest, daily, lower-dose vitamin D instead of non-daily, higher-dose vitamin D. (2 | ⊕⊕⊕◯)". The evidence base included 2 trials with 537 participants directly comparing intermittent high-dose vs daily lower-dose regimens, and an expanded review of 19 manuscripts from 15 studies involving 53 527 participants. Daily vitamin D doses ranged from 400 to 800 IU (10–20 µg), while non-daily regimens included 50 000 IU (1250 µg) every 2 weeks, 60 000–100 000 IU (1500–2500 µg) monthly, and 96 000–150 000 IU (2400–3750 µg) every 2 to 4 months. There was a trend for intermittent high-dose vitamin D to increase fracture risk (RR 1.08 [95% CI, 0.98–1.19]), with an estimated absolute effect of 5 more participants with a fracture per 1000 (1 fewer to 11 more). We did not identify evidence related to individuals younger than age 50 years.

### Assessing the economic value of maintained improvements in type 1 diabetes management, in terms of HbA, weight and hypoglycaemic event incidence [^9afcc7af]. Diabetic Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

In people with no more than five severe hypoglycaemic events, the per‐person cost saving was £344 for every severe hypoglycaemic event avoided. Complete avoidance of severe hypoglycaemia was associated with a 0.01 QALY gain over one year; thus, incremental NMB ranged between £544 (reduction from one to zero events) and £1921 (reduction from five to zero events) (Fig. S7). In an average UK person with HbA 1c of 75 mmol/mol (9.0%), maintained avoidance of severe hypoglycaemia over a lifetime would translate to 0.167 QALYs gained, and incremental NMB between £9104 (reduction from one to zero events) and £32 136 (reduction from five to zero events).

Value of reduced BMI

Costs associated with weight change were not applied in model analyses; thus, the predicted value of reduced BMI was driven entirely by monetized utility gains. Reducing BMI by 1 kg/m² was associated with a 0.006 QALY gain over one year, which corresponded to an incremental NMB of £120 for each unit reduction in BMI. Therefore, reducing BMI from 35 kg/m² to 25 kg/m² equated to an incremental NMB of £1200 per year, at a willingness‐to‐pay threshold of £20 000 per QALY. If modelled weight change was maintained in an average UK person with HbA 1c of 75 mmol/mol (9.0%), each unit reduction in BMI would translate to a lifetime QALY gain of 0.100, and associated incremental NMB of £2007.

Moderate certainty of evidence suggests an estimated 0.5% absolute increase in fracture risk.

### Notes from the field: elevated atmospheric… [^cecfc839]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Altmetric: Figure On January 7, 2025, the Eaton Canyon and Palisades fires blazed across the Los Angeles region, driven by exceptionally dry conditions and Santa Ana wind gusts approaching 100 mph. The fires spread rapidly into densely populated neighborhoods along the wildland-urban interface, destroying approximately 16, 000 structures. As of February 10, 2025, a total of 29 deaths had been identified. In addition to the deaths and destruction of property, wildfires emit a complex mixture of air pollutants and contribute to elevated concentrations of fine particulate matter, degrading air quality many miles downwind. Exposure to wildfire PM 2. 5 has been linked to adverse health effects including increased asthma cases, respiratory symptoms, aggravated respiratory diseases, and increased overall mortality.

The Los Angeles ASCENT site in Pico Rivera, approximately 14 miles south of the Eaton Canyon fire, has been operating since July 2023. During and immediately after the Los Angeles fires, southward winds transported the fire plume to the ASCENT site. Hourly PM 2. 5 lead measurements recorded during and after the fires were reviewed to assess their contribution to atmospheric lead levels.

### Strongly reducing magnesium (0) complexes [^d289ed3e]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

A complex of a metal in its zero oxidation state can be considered a stabilized, but highly reactive, form of a single metal atom. Such complexes are common for the more noble transition metals. Although rare examples are known for electronegative late-main-group p-block metals or semimetals 1–6, it is a challenge to isolate early-main-group s-block metals in their zero oxidation state 7–11. This is directly related to their very low electronegativity and strong tendency to oxidize. Here we present examples of zero-oxidation-state magnesium (that is, magnesium(0)) complexes that are stabilized by superbulky, monoanionic, β-diketiminate ligands. Whereas the reactivity of an organomagnesium compound is typically defined by the nucleophilicity of its organic groups and the electrophilicity of Mg 2+ cations, the Mg 0 complexes reported here feature electron-rich Mg centres that are nucleophilic and strongly reducing. The latter property is exemplified by the ability to reduce Na + to Na 0. We also present a complex with a linear Mg 3 core that formally could be described as a Mg I -Mg 0 -Mg I unit. Such multinuclear mixed-valence Mg n clusters are discussed as fleeting intermediates during the early stages of Grignard reagent formation. Their remarkably strong reducing power implies a rich reactivity and application as specialized reducing agents.

### Environmental assessment and exposure reduction of cockroaches: a practice parameter [^6534c2ff]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Classification of recommendations and evidence — recommendation rating scale defines Strong recommendation (StrRec), Recommendation (Rec), Option (Opt), and No recommendation (NoRec) with corresponding implications. Strong recommendation (StrRec): A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms (or that the harms clearly exceed the benefits in the case of a strong negative recommendation) and that the quality of the supporting evidence is excellent (grade A or B).* In some clearly identified circumstances, strong recommendations might be made based on lesser evidence when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain and the anticipated benefits strongly outweigh the harms. Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Recommendation (Rec): A recommendation means the benefits exceed the harms (or that the harms clearly exceed the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation) but the quality of evidence is not as strong (grade B or C).* In some clearly identified circumstances, recommendations might be made based on lesser evidence when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain and the anticipated benefits outweigh the harms. Clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and be sensitive to patient preferences. Option (Opt): An option means that either the quality of evidence that exists is suspect (grade D)* or that well-done studies (grade A, B, or C)* show little clear advantage to one approach versus another. Clinicians should be flexible in their decision-making regarding appropriate practice, although they might set bounds on alternatives; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. No recommendation (NoRec): No recommendation means there is both a lack of pertinent evidence (grade D)* and an unclear balance between benefits and harms. Clinicians should feel little constraint in their decision-making and be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit versus harm; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.

### Leakage does not fully offset soy supply-chain efforts to reduce deforestation in Brazil [^e695238d]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Scaling up zero-deforestation regulations for Brazil's soy entering the EU is not without risks. While China's share of Brazil's total soybean exports grew from 68% in 2011 to 82% in 2017, the EU's share declined from 18% to 9%, reducing its overall market power (Fig. 3b). In the next decade most growth in soybean demand will come from China (Fig. 3c), which is projected to be satisfied almost entirely with additional exports from Brazil (Fig. 3d). The dependency of Brazil's soybeans on China's market may be exacerbated by the onset of the US-China trade war in early 2018, which could trigger significant increases in deforestation. Traders may choose to drop out of the EU markets or segregate their supply chains into compliant and non-compliant streams if the benefits of selling to regulated EU markets exceed the costs of implementing zero-deforestation supply chain policies across Brazil. This would reduce gross avoided deforestation relative to our analysis and could also weaken the influence of EU-based traders on state-led forest governance in Brazil. Stringent zero-deforestation supply chain approaches may substantially impact rural livelihoods in deforestation risk areasif excluding non-compliant actors is cheaper than engaging with them. Moreover, a focus on protecting forests may generate spillovers to non-forest ecosystems. Building capacity among producers (via financing and training) to address non-compliance and improve existing agricultural practices, coupled with reducing incentives for firms to avoid non-compliant actors, may help reduce such negative spillovers from zero-deforestation supply chain policies.

### Non-selective distribution of infectious disease prevention may outperform risk-based targeting [^59e24c23]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Optimal distribution of prevention

Community-level prevalence can be written as a function of the quantities in Eq. (1): We now wish to derive the impact that increasing prevention among a specific degree class has on decreasing community-level prevalence, for different values of efficacy ϵ. Optimizing the distribution strategy is relevant when large-scale distribution and adoption is not possible. We thus start from the configuration of no prevention (g = 0), and study the impact of providing prevention to a small number of individuals, in degree class k, by means of the following linear response function:(see Methods for a detailed explanation). If protecting hubs is the best-performing strategy, then f will be a monotonously increasing function of k. The existence of the trade-off will instead be marked by the existence of maximum of f, at finite k. At the endemic equilibrium, we derive the expression of f from Eq. (1) (see Methods): f has two terms. F d i r (k) quantifies the direct reduction in risk of infection among those receiving prevention. F i n d i r (k) quantifies the indirect effect of the prevention campaign: the reduction in risk of infection among those who did not receive prevention, due to the presence of those who did. We derive the expression of both terms:wheredepend on the degree distribution and the epidemic parameters, but do not depend on ϵ, k. Their detailed expressions are provided in the Methods, along with the details of the calculation (see also Supplementary Note 4). Supplementary Note 5 shows the agreement of the analytical derivation with the numerical counterpart. We first examine the direct effect. F d i r has a maximum when. If protection is perfect (ϵ = 1), then F d i r is monotonously increasing, meaning that highly connected individuals should always be prioritized, as the current theory mandates. If ϵ < 1, is finite (Fig. 1 a), and above it, the high chance of breakthrough infection among high-risk individuals offsets the direct gain in protecting those who are most likely to get infected. We now turn to the indirect effect. F i n d i r increases monotonously for any value of efficacy ϵ (Fig. 1 a). This means that providing prevention to highly connected individuals always induces the largest indirect benefit on those who are not using prevention. The combination of F d i r and F i n d i r gives the following optimal degree for degree-prioritized prevention strategies: k * is always greater than, as it is the result of the effect of direct protection, which is optimal at, and indirect protection, which increases with k (Fig. 1 b, c). Furthermore, whileis finite whenever protection is non perfect (ϵ < 1), k * is finite if ϵ < ϵ c ≤ 1, withEquation (6) is our main theoretical result: There exists a value of critical efficacy, which is analytically computable, and which discriminates between the two following parameter regions. In the high-efficacy region (ϵ ≥ ϵ c) you should prioritize those at risk of causing superspreading events. In the low-efficacy region (ϵ < ϵ c), instead, targeting individuals in degree class k = k * < ∞ has the strongest impact on community prevalence.

### Efficient use of cement and concrete to reduce reliance on supply-side technologies for net-zero emissions [^048a7aff]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The role of CCS

Although CCS belongs to the lowest tier of mitigation strategies, it remains one of the central strategies in industry. With this in mind, the role of CCS in achieving net-zero emissions is investigated by conducting a sensitivity analysis to better understand how demand-side strategies can reduce reliance on CCS (Fig. 6). If no demand-side strategy is implemented, then 70% of the kiln capacity will need to be equipped with CCS to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Such reliance on CCS can be reduced to 30% by implementing a demand-side strategy of just 50% of the maximum technical potential. When the demand-side strategy is implemented at more than 80% of the technical potential, the need for CCS in achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 is completely eliminated. These results reflect the complementary relationship between CCS and demand-side strategies in decarbonizing this hard-to-abate sector.

### Analysis of the pressure requirements for silk spinning reveals a pultrusion dominated process [^a24ffc46]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Viscosity effects

The variation in models using the Carreau-Yasuda method lies primarily in the value of the zero shear viscosity, with the rate of shear thinning shown to be similar across previous studies (Supplementary Fig. 2). This effectively provides a single variable whose effect can be readily explored through simulation. Figure 6 shows the effect of varying the zero shear viscosity across the range detailed in Laity's 2015 studyin relation to the biological extrusion domain. It is clear that reduced zero shear viscosity reduces the pressure required for spinning, yet silk feedstocks across this range of viscosities are all viable spinning feedstocks in vivo, suggesting that zero shear viscosity has little effect on the spinning process. However, reducing zero shear viscosity alone is clearly not sufficient to enter the biological extrusion domain, and thus factors must play a role in reducing the pressure required to spin.

Since geometry was earlier shown to have little effect on the pressure requirements, this study employed the same geometry as Breslauer et al.to allow comparison with previously published work. The biological extrusion domain is split into natural (dark green dashes) and forced (pale green dashes) spinning domains

### Fall prevention with supplemental and active forms of vitamin D: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^c43781ea]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

The pooled relative risk for the two trials with a dose of less than 700 IU (200–600 IU) vitamin D a day was 1.10 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.35; Q test: P = 0.42) indicating that less than 700 IU vitamin D a day did not reduce fall risk (table 3, fig 2).

Table 3
Primary pooled analysis for low doses of supplemental vitamin D (< 700 IU) and the prevention of falls

Q test: P < 0.100 indicates heterogeneity.

I 2 estimates above 25% are considered to represent modest heterogeneity, and values above 50% represent large heterogeneity beyond chance.

ns = not significant.

Achieved serum 25(OH)D concentrations of 60 nmol/l or more resulted in a 23% fall reduction (pooled relative risk 0.77, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.90), whereas concentrations of less than 60 nmol/l had no effect on number of falls (pooled relative risk 1.35, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.84).

Figure 3shows the relationship between vitamin D and falls, and suggests that fall prevention begins with a daily dose of 700 IU supplemental vitamin D. This threshold was confirmed in a meta-regression of 2426 individuals, in which a significant inverse relationship was found between dose and the risk of sustaining at least one fall (beta estimate for dose: ≥ 700 IU v < 700 IU = −0.337; P = 0.02). Figure 3 also suggests that a 25(OH)D concentration of 60 nmol/l is required for fall prevention. This possibility was likewise confirmed by a meta-regression of 1447 individuals (two trials did not provide 25(OH)D data w4 w8), which indicated a significant inverse relationship between 25(OH)D serum concentration and the risk of sustaining at least one fall (beta estimate for 25(OH)D concentration: ≥ 60 nmol/l v < 60 nmol/l = −0.586; P = 0.005).

### The potential of emerging bio-based products to reduce environmental impacts [^aa47d542]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Comparing prospective LCAs of emerging bio-based products to their fossil-based counterparts reveals a significant potential for the bio-economy to reduce GHG emissions. However, the large variability in GHG benefits and burdens of bio-based products compared to their fossil alternatives, with none of the products reaching net-zero emissions, asks for nuanced conclusions when designing and evaluating the sustainability of individual bio-based products. In the end, a combination of mitigation options like biomass utilization, increasing recycling rate and low carbon electrification of the industry, alongside reducing product demand, will be required to reach net-zero emissions in the chemical and plastic industry.

### Quinidine gluconate [^3d46eb7d]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS

Before prescribing quinidine gluconate as prophylaxis against recurrence of atrial fibrillation, the physician should inform the patient of the risks and benefits to be expected (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Discussion should include the facts:

that the goal of therapy will be a reduction (probably not to zero) in the frequency of episodes of atrial fibrillation; and
that reduced frequency of fibrillatory episodes may be expected, if achieved, to bring symptomatic benefit; but
that no data are available to show that reduced frequency of fibrillatory episodes will reduce the risks of irreversible harm through stroke or death; and in fact
that such data as are available suggest that treatment with quinidine gluconate is likely to increase the patient's risk of death.

Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility

Animal studies to evaluate quinidine's carcinogenic or mutagenic potential have not been performed. Similarly, there are no animal data as to quinidine's potential to impair fertility.

Pregnancy

Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproductive studies have not been conducted with quinidine. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Quinidine should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.

In one neonate whose mother had received quinidine throughout her pregnancy, the serum level of quinidine was equal to that of the mother, with no apparent ill effect. The level of quinidine in amniotic fluid was about three times higher than that found in serum.

Labor and Delivery

Quinine is said to be oxytocic in humans, but there are no adequate data as to quinidine's effects (if any) on human labor and delivery.

Nursing mothers

Quinidine is present in human milk at levels slightly lower than those in maternal serum; a human infant ingesting such milk should (scaling directly by weight) be expected to develop serum quinidine levels at least an order of magnitude lower than those of the mother. On the other hand, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of quinidine in human infants have not been adequately studied, and neonates' reduced protein binding of quinidine may increase their risk of toxicity at low total serum levels. Administration of quinidine should (if possible) be avoided in lactating women who continue to nurse.

Geriatric use

Safety and efficacy of quinidine in elderly patients have not been systematically studied.

### Offshore wind and wave energy can reduce total installed capacity required in zero-emissions grids [^cf6cfb2a]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Overview

First, we identify sites with high potential of offshore wind and wave energy along the coast of the Western Interconnection. We next model candidate generation projects at these sites, (i) filtering out sites that are in marine protected areas (MPAs) with strict classifications, military danger zones and restricted military activity areas, and (ii) calculating the hourly capacity factors for each candidate project for one year of data. Finally, we use SWITCH, a power system capacity expansion model, to study the role and impacts of these offshore wind and wave energy candidate projects under 25 scenarios with different cost targets.

A more detailed overview of the methodology for this study is summarized in Fig. 9.

Fig. 9
Methodology.

Overview of methodology used for this study.

Data acquisition and processing

The sites of industry interest represent high-potential wave farm sites along the U.S. West Coast. They are calculated as the result of a scoring framework developed by CalWave. Each site considered by CalWave receives a score between 0 and 100, based on a weighted sum of the following six quantitative parameters: wave energy resource density, distance to shore, water depth, wind resource, bathymetry, and local population density. The parameters are weighted based on CalWave's assessment of their relative importance to the development of utility-scale wave energy infrastructure. CalWave uses NREL's report on Marine Hydrokinetic Energy Site Identification and Rankingas a guideline for their own ranking framework. The parameters that CalWave considers which coincide with NREL's report are wave resource density and water depth. Some differences between the parameters considered by CalWave and NREL are as follows:
While NREL considers market size and distance to transmission connection, CalWave considers local population density and distance to shore
NREL considers energy price and shipping cost, but CalWave does not
CalWave considers bathymetry and wind resource, while NREL does not
NREL assigns equal ranking to each of the parameters considered, while CalWave assigns different weights to each parameter empirically based on their experience as a wave energy developer and input from wave energy industry and academic ocean energy experts. The parameters in order of assigned weight from highest weight to lowest weight is as follows: Wave resource Distance to shore Water depth Wind resource Bathymetry Local population density

### Biomechanical comparison of different surgical strategies for skip-level cervical degenerative disc disease: a finite element study [^61ae6938]. Spine (2024). Medium credibility.

The zero-profile (Zero-P) device is a novel device suitable for ACDF surgery because it reduces the use of plates and has the advantage of reduced exposure and simplified multilevel procedures. In a previous biomechanical study of the Zero-P device by Li et al, it was shown that in a single-segment ACDF, the stress increment of the endplate and intervertebral disk in the Zero-P fusion model was slightly lower than that in a cage plate (CP). However, the CP provided better segmental stability than Zero-P. Furthermore, the plate can be used as a framework to resist axial compression, connecting multiple vertebrae and instruments as one unit and reducing subsequent loss of intervertebral height and lordosis, thereby reducing the occurrence of progressive cervical degeneration.

In recent years, more and more clinical workers have paid attention to patients with skip-level CDDD and compared the clinical efficacy of different surgical methods. However, the evidence of biomechanical manifestations is still under investigation. Thus, in this study, we constructed a finite element (FE) model of the cervical spine consisting of C2-C7 and predicted the biomechanical effects of different surgical procedures and instruments on adjacent segments, internal fixation systems, and the overall cervical spine through FE analysis.

### Physical understanding of the tropical cyclone wind-pressure relationship [^eacdfb26]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

We now extend this analysis to our solution forgiven by Eq. (12). We first separate β itself into the product of the same storm parameter identified from the wind structure model (now including the factor), and the environmental parameter R d T ρ 0. Thus, Eq. (12) dictates thatdepends principally on V m, and; it depends secondarily on the environmental parameters, and R d T ρ 0. Variations in, which represents density variations relative to the ambient environment, are small relative to the much larger variations in intensity (V m), latitude (f), and storm size (r 0) exhibited by tropical cyclones on Earth, and thusmay be taken as constant (shown below). Finally, translation of the non-dimensional central pressure deficit, to the traditional dimensional central pressure deficit, Δ P = P 0 − P m depends only on the environmental pressure P 0. Because Δ P is typically at least an order of magnitude smaller than P 0 (10–100 hPa and 1000 hPa, respectively), variations inand Δ P are approximately equivalent. A credible estimate of P 0 is important specifically for the precise estimation of P m, though space-time variation of P 0 is relatively small compared to that of P m. Similarly, space-time variation in T ρ 0 may also be assumed to be relatively small, though its variation due to changes in sea surface temperature (e.g. in space or under climate change) could in principle be accounted for externally assuming constant boundary layer relative humidity within the tropics.

Thus, theoretically the central pressure deficit should depend principally on the velocity scales V m and, i.e. Specifically, the central pressure deficit increases with increasing intensity, size, and Coriolis parameter, though the precise quantitative dependence lacks an analytical solution and so is the subject of the remainder of this manuscript. This result is consistent with the prevailing empirical model, which takes intensity, size, and latitude as predictors for the central pressure deficit. This also provides a physical basis for understanding why particularly large storms in nature have been observed to possess abnormally large central pressure deficits despite modest peak wind speeds.

### Vitamin D supplementation for women during pregnancy [^957ab66c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy may be needed to protect against adverse pregnancy outcomes. This is an update of a review that was first published in 2012 and then in 2016.

Objectives

To examine whether vitamin D supplementation alone or in combination with calcium or other vitamins and minerals given to women during pregnancy can safely improve maternal and neonatal outcomes.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (12 July 2018), contacted relevant organisations (15 May 2018), reference lists of retrieved trials and registries at clinicaltrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (12 July 2018). Abstracts were included if they had enough information to extract the data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials evaluating the effect of supplementation with vitamin D alone or in combination with other micronutrients for women during pregnancy in comparison to placebo or no intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently i) assessed the eligibility of trials against the inclusion criteria, ii) extracted data from included trials, and iii) assessed the risk of bias of the included trials. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 30 trials (7033 women), excluded 60 trials, identified six as ongoing/unpublished trials and two trials are awaiting assessments. Supplementation with vitamin D alone versus placebo/no interventionA total of 22 trials involving 3725 pregnant women were included in this comparison; 19 trials were assessed as having low-to-moderate risk of bias for most domains and three trials were assessed as having high risk of bias for most domains. Supplementation with vitamin D alone during pregnancy probably reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia (risk ratio (RR) 0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 0.79; 4 trials, 499 women, moderate-certainty evidence) and gestational diabetes (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; 4 trials, 446 women, moderate-certainty evidence); and probably reduces the risk of having a baby with low birthweight (less than 2500 g) (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.87; 5 trials, 697 women, moderate-certainty evidence) compared to women who received placebo or no intervention. Vitamin D supplementation may make little or no difference in the risk of having a preterm birth < 37 weeks compared to no intervention or placebo (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.30; 7 trials, 1640 women, low-certainty evidence). In terms of maternal adverse events, vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of severe postpartum haemorrhage (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.91; 1 trial, 1134 women, low-certainty evidence). There were no cases of hypercalcaemia (1 trial, 1134 women, low-certainty evidence), and we are very uncertain as to whether vitamin D increases or decreases the risk of nephritic syndrome (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.06; 1 trial, 135 women, very low-certainty evidence). However, given the scarcity of data in general for maternal adverse events, no firm conclusions can be drawn. Supplementation with vitamin D and calcium versus placebo/no interventionNine trials involving 1916 pregnant women were included in this comparison; three trials were assessed as having low risk of bias for allocation and blinding, four trials were assessed as having high risk of bias and two had some components having a low risk, high risk, or unclear risk. Supplementation with vitamin D and calcium during pregnancy probably reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.78; 4 trials, 1174 women, moderate-certainty evidence). The effect of the intervention is uncertain on gestational diabetes (RR 0.33,% CI 0.01 to 7.84; 1 trial, 54 women, very low-certainty evidence); and low birthweight (less than 2500 g) (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.10 to 4.55; 2 trials, 110 women, very low-certainty evidence) compared to women who received placebo or no intervention. Supplementation with vitamin D and calcium during pregnancy may increase the risk of preterm birth < 37 weeks in comparison to women who received placebo or no intervention (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.28; 5 trials, 942 women, low-certainty evidence). No trial in this comparison reported on maternal adverse events. Supplementation with vitamin D + calcium + other vitamins and minerals versus calcium + other vitamins and minerals (but no vitamin D)One trial in 1300 participants was included in this comparison; it was assessed as having low risk of bias. Pre-eclampsia was not assessed. Supplementation with vitamin D + other nutrients may make little or no difference in the risk of preterm birth < 37 weeks (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.59; 1 trial, 1298 women, low-certainty evidence); or low birthweight (less than 2500 g) (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.51; 1 trial, 1298 women, low-certainty evidence). It is unclear whether it makes any difference to the risk of gestational diabetes (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.73) or maternal adverse events (hypercalcaemia no events; hypercalciuria RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.02 to 3.97; 1 trial, 1298 women,) because the certainty of the evidence for both outcomes was found to be very low.

Authors' Conclusions

We included 30 trials (7033 women) across three separate comparisons. Our GRADE assessments ranged from moderate to very low, with downgrading decisions based on limitations in study design, imprecision and indirectness. Supplementing pregnant women with vitamin D alone probably reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, low birthweight and may reduce the risk of severe postpartum haemorrhage. It may make little or no difference in the risk of having a preterm birth < 37 weeks' gestation. Supplementing pregnant women with vitamin D and calcium probably reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia but may increase the risk of preterm births < 37 weeks (these findings warrant further research). Supplementing pregnant women with vitamin D and other nutrients may make little or no difference in the risk of preterm birth < 37 weeks' gestation or low birthweight (less than 2500 g). Additional rigorous high quality and larger randomised trials are required to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy, particularly in relation to the risk of maternal adverse events.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1e20ff47]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (daily requirements), ES 2011 guidelines recommend to ensure vitamin D intake of at least 400 IU/day in 0–1 year old infants and children, and at least 600 IU/day in ≥ 1 year old children, to maximize bone health. Insufficient evidence of whether 400 and 600 IU/day in 0–1 and 1–18 years old children, respectively, are enough to provide all the potential nonskeletal health benefits associated with vitamin D to maximize bone health and muscle function. Recognize that at least 1,000 IU/day of vitamin D may be required to raise the serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D consistently > 30 ng/mL.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^3ca0fba3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D — empiric supplementation in high‑risk prediabetes: For adults with high-risk prediabetes, in addition to lifestyle modification, we suggest empiric vitamin D supplementation to reduce the risk of progression to diabetes. Lifestyle modification must be a routine management component for adults with prediabetes. Trials informing this recommendation primarily related to adults identified as meeting 2 or 3 American Diabetes Association glycemia criteria (fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], 2-hour glucose after a 75-gram oral glucose challenge) for prediabetes and those with impaired glucose tolerance. In the trials, vitamin D dosages ranged from 842 to 7543 IU (21 to 189 μg) daily equivalent, with an estimated weighted average of approximately 3500 IU (88 μg) per day, and some trials allowed routine supplements including up to 1000 IU (25 μg) of vitamin D daily.

### Zero-sum beliefs and the avoidance of political conversations [^75bcb1e1]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Finally, future research could further explore the distal and proximal causes of zero-sum beliefs about politics which may prove critical for encouraging more political conversations. For instance, since deliberation reduces zero-sum beliefs, prompting people to consider how the political arena can benefit large swaths of the electorate may weaken their resistance to interacting with ideologically opposed others. And, since financial vulnerability increases zero-sum beliefs, relieving financial hardships may similarly reduce the avoidance of such conversations. Thus, future research could motivate political conversations by examining ways to reduce zero-sum beliefs about politics.

The fact that zero-sum beliefs statistically predict the avoidance of political conversations in two distinct political systems is noteworthy. Whereas the political landscape in the U.S. is dominated by an increasingly sectarian two-party system, the Israeli multi-party system necessitates coalition-building across parties. Yet, despite these differences (and building on cross-cultural research on the topic,), we found that both Israelis and Americans who see politics as zero-sum avoided talking about it.

It is similarly noteworthy that zero-sum beliefs statistically predicted people's actual avoidance of political conversations rather than their intentions to do so or their beliefs about hypothetical scenarios. Given our interest in real-world conversations, and due to the difficulty of manipulating zero-sum beliefs in ecologically valid manners, we focused on measuring (rather than manipulating) participants' zero-sum beliefs about politics. And, while correlational data should always be taken with a grain of salt, the longitudinal findings of Study 2 suggest that zero-sum beliefs better predict the avoidance of political conversations than vice-versa. Future research could test the effect of such beliefs in more controlled settings, examining the causal impact of such beliefs on the avoidance of political conversations.

### Offshore wind and wave energy can reduce total installed capacity required in zero-emissions grids [^b86170d2]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

While offshore wind and wave energy have faced many cost challenges associated with the hostility of ocean environments, their costs are expected to decline as supply chain infrastructure becomes more developed, designs become more efficient and refined, and markets adapt to compensate offshore wind and wave energy developers appropriately for the ancillary services that these technologies may provide to the grid (such as base-load support, reactive power support, etc.). Wave energy in particular has a long way to go when it comes to reducing costs by designing standardized WECs that can be manufactured with streamlined techniques, a problem further complicated by the fact the optimal WEC design can vary depending on the dominant wave frequency at a given site. Standardization may still take place to create main categories of commonly used WEC designs which can be refined individually and deployed in areas with corresponding ocean conditions. Hence, there is still significant room for improvement of these technologies and the physical, economic, regulatory, and political infrastructure to support them.

Because the benefits that offshore wind and wave energy may provide for the future zero-emissions grid are so significant, we recommend that policy makers design incentives to stimulate investment, research, and development of these technologies that will drive their overnight and O&M costs sufficiently down to ensure that they become cost competitive with other renewable resources. For wave energy to reach cost parity with land-based wind by 2050, its overnight and O&M costs would need to decline by ~80% and 70%, respectively, over the next three decades. For offshore wind energy to align with the NREL 2022 ATB advanced scenario costs by 2050, fixed-bottom and floating offshore wind energy overnight and O&M costs would need to decline by ~43% over the next three decades. Although these declines seem drastic, solar and land-based wind energy have demonstrated momentous cost declines in the past decade. Solar energy costs have decreased 80% and land-based wind energy costs have decreased almost 40% since 2010. Hence, significant drops in renewable energy costs are not unprecedented.

### Solar and wind energy enhances drought resilience and groundwater sustainability [^e7928def]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Groundwater pumping lift adds another layer of complexity to the relative revenue loss. Higher pumping lift indicates higher pumping cost associated with more severe groundwater depletion. In the plane with zero revenue loss, higher pumping lift would require more stringent groundwater regulations in order to achieve the optimal trade-offs as described in Fig. 1. We note that future penetration of SWE pushes the boundary toward a smaller groundwater cap (is shifted to), which implies that we can set relatively strict regulations for groundwater sustainability with a higher percentage mix of SWE in the energy portfolio. Ideally, society would like to move toward the black point in Fig. 2 b with lower revenue loss and higher groundwater storage recovery (smaller pumping lift). Our results highlight the difficulty in recovering groundwater storage once it has depleted to a certain extent even with extremely strict regulations (e.g. near zero allowance). This is because a small reduction of pumping lift (slightly recovery of groundwater storage) would result in a significant increase in revenue loss (i.e.increases dramatically along the direction ofwith a slight decrease of). Asis defined as a relative term, it shows how much total revenue will be reduced if groundwater regulation policy is added as a constraint relative to the situation without such constraint. Given that people tend to be loss averse (e.g. minimize relative revenue losses compared to the optimal situation) and prefer to make decisions based on losses rather than gains, the system will tend to move back to its initial state of larger pumping lift with lower revenue loss (moving towardrather than). This could be reasonable assuming that government aims for a sustainability-oriented policy, which may not be fully based on economic revenue. In addition to these effects, even when groundwater storage is recovered (reduces), the reduced groundwater pumping cost will create incentives for people to extract more groundwater (EP in Fig. 1 b is shifted to the left in Fig. 1 a), which again will eventually exacerbate groundwater depletion. This implies that once we are trapped in the situation with severe groundwater depletion, it will be difficult to move out of it. However, this negative effect can be potentially offset to some degree with higher penetration of SWE, which shiftsdown to. Our results further demonstrate that if groundwater use is not regulated and the depletion keeps getting worse (pumping lift increases), then the benefits of higher SWE penetration is limited as the distance between the two wedge-shaped surfaces (and) decreases. This suggests that the combined effect of more stringent control on groundwater abstraction plus SWE penetration is key to ameliorate revenue loss as well as benefit groundwater recovery. In summary, the results indicate that groundwater depletion can potentially diminish the added sustainable outcomes of SWE and we cannot merely assume that the positive effect of solar and wind penetration will persist indefinitely. Policy makers therefore have to take the long-term outlook of groundwater depletion into consideration when planning further deployment of SWE.

### Delta inflation: a bias in the design of randomized controlled trials in critical care medicine [^7f75231a]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Plot of observed versus predicted delta (with associated 95% confidence intervals for observed delta) of 38 trials included in the analysis. Point estimates of treatment effect (deltas) are represented by green circles for non-statistically significant trials and red triangles for statistically significant trials. Numbers within the circles and triangles refer to the trials as referenced in Additional file 1. The blue 'unity line' with a slope equal to one indicates perfect concordance between observed and predicted delta; for visual clarity and to reduce distortions, the slope is reduced to zero (and the x-axis is horizontally expanded) where multiple predicted deltas have the same value and where 95% confidence intervals cross the unity line. If predictions of delta were accurate and without bias, values of observed delta would be symmetrically scattered above and below the unity line. If there is directional bias, values will fall predominately on one side of the line as they do in the figure.

Among all trials, 17 of 38 (44.7%) had an observed delta with a negative value (that is, the treatment was numerically worse than the comparator). Three of these trials showed a statistically significant increase in mortality with the therapy, and all of these trials were stopped early for harm. The seven trials showing a statistically significant difference favoring the therapy had a smaller delta-gap compared with non-significant trials and those demonstrating harm (delta-gap 0.9% versus 10.5%; P < 0.0001). In Figure 1, these seven trials are represented by red triangles above zero on the Y-axis; as can be seen graphically, the deltas associated with these trials fall closer to the blue unity line than the other trials.

For the eight trials that showed a non-statistically significant point estimate for delta that exceeded the smallest predicted delta of all trials (3%), we calculated the sample size that would be required to repeat the study using the observed delta of the index study as the predicted delta for the repeat study. Repeating these trials in this fashion would require increases in sample size from 380% to 1,100% compared with the sample size of the index study (data not shown).

### Improved depiction of small anatomic structures in MR images using gaussian-weighted spirals and zero-filled interpolation [^1333a97b]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2003). Low credibility.

Partial-volume artifacts reduce the contrast and continuity of small structures in magnetic resonance images. Zero-filled interpolation (ZFI) has been known for some time as a useful technique to reduce partial-volume artifacts and improve the appearance of small structures and edges. However, its use is limited by the fact that ZFI can exacerbate image artifacts. For example, it can exacerbate Gibbs ringing, also known as the truncation artifact, which manifests itself as spurious ringing around sharp edges. Currently, the most common technique to address this problem is post-acquisition filtering, which causes blurring in the image. Using ZFI in conjunction with a variable-density sampling method designed to reduce ringing is proposed as a possible solution to this problem. This approach is demonstrated with a Gaussian-weighted spiral and is compared to conventional spiral sampling both with and without the application of a filter used to reduce ringing. The two spiral sampling techniques are compared using simulations, phantom images, and in vivo brain images. The Gaussian-weighted spiral demonstrates reduced ringing without the loss of spatial resolution commonly associated with post-acquisition filtering. Additionally, this sampling technique is shown to work well in conjunction with ZFI to reduce partial-volume artifacts without the apparent increase in Gibbs ringing usually associated with zero-filled reconstruction. This approach will be most useful for imaging techniques such as MR angiography which are known to be sensitive to partial-volume effects, as well as when imaging anatomic regions associated with more severe Gibbs ringing.

### Vitamin D supplementation for prevention of cancer in adults [^d6f14ce0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The evidence on whether vitamin D supplementation is effective in decreasing cancers is contradictory.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of vitamin D supplementation for prevention of cancer in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded, and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science to February 2014. We scanned bibliographies of relevant publications and asked experts and pharmaceutical companies for additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials that compared vitamin D at any dose, duration, and route of administration versus placebo or no intervention in adults who were healthy or were recruited among the general population, or diagnosed with a specific disease. Vitamin D could have been administered as supplemental vitamin D (vitamin D₃ (cholecalciferol) or vitamin D₂ (ergocalciferol)), or an active form of vitamin D (1α-hydroxyvitamin D (alfacalcidol), or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol)).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors extracted data independently. We conducted random-effects and fixed-effect model meta-analyses. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratios (RRs). We considered risk of bias in order to assess the risk of systematic errors. We conducted trial sequential analyses to assess the risk of random errors.

Main Results

Eighteen randomised trials with 50,623 participants provided data for the analyses. All trials came from high-income countries. Most of the trials had a high risk of bias, mainly for-profit bias. Most trials included elderly community-dwelling women (aged 47 to 97 years). Vitamin D was administered for a weighted mean of six years. Fourteen trials tested vitamin D₃, one trial tested vitamin D₂, and three trials tested calcitriol supplementation. Cancer occurrence was observed in 1927/25,275 (7.6%) recipients of vitamin D versus 1943/25,348 (7.7%) recipients of control interventions (RR 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 1.06); P = 0.88; I² = 0%; 18 trials; 50,623 participants; moderate quality evidence according to the GRADE instrument). Trial sequential analysis (TSA) of the 18 vitamin D trials shows that the futility area is reached after the 10th trial, allowing us to conclude that a possible intervention effect, if any, is lower than a 5% relative risk reduction. We did not observe substantial differences in the effect of vitamin D on cancer in subgroup analyses of trials at low risk of bias compared to trials at high risk of bias; of trials with no risk of for-profit bias compared to trials with risk of for-profit bias; of trials assessing primary prevention compared to trials assessing secondary prevention; of trials including participants with vitamin D levels below 20 ng/mL at entry compared to trials including participants with vitamin D levels of 20 ng/mL or more at entry; or of trials using concomitant calcium supplementation compared to trials without calcium. Vitamin D decreased all-cause mortality (1854/24,846 (7.5%) versus 2007/25,020 (8.0%); RR 0.93 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.98); P = 0.009; I² = 0%; 15 trials; 49,866 participants; moderate quality evidence), but TSA indicates that this finding could be due to random errors. Cancer occurrence was observed in 1918/24,908 (7.7%) recipients of vitamin D₃ versus 1933/24,983 (7.7%) in recipients of control interventions (RR 1.00 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.06); P = 0.88; I² = 0%; 14 trials; 49,891 participants; moderate quality evidence). TSA of the vitamin D₃ trials shows that the futility area is reached after the 10th trial, allowing us to conclude that a possible intervention effect, if any, is lower than a 5% relative risk reduction. Vitamin D₃ decreased cancer mortality (558/22,286 (2.5%) versus 634/22,206 (2.8%); RR 0.88 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.98); P = 0.02; I² = 0%; 4 trials; 44,492 participants; low quality evidence), but TSA indicates that this finding could be due to random errors. Vitamin D₃ combined with calcium increased nephrolithiasis (RR 1.17 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.34); P = 0.02; I² = 0%; 3 trials; 42,753 participants; moderate quality evidence). TSA, however, indicates that this finding could be due to random errors. We did not find any data on health-related quality of life or health economics in the randomised trials included in this review.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no firm evidence that vitamin D supplementation decreases or increases cancer occurrence in predominantly elderly community-dwelling women. Vitamin D₃ supplementation decreased cancer mortality and vitamin D supplementation decreased all-cause mortality, but these estimates are at risk of type I errors due to the fact that too few participants were examined, and to risks of attrition bias originating from substantial dropout of participants. Combined vitamin D₃ and calcium supplements increased nephrolithiasis, whereas it remains unclear from the included trials whether vitamin D₃, calcium, or both were responsible for this effect. We need more trials on vitamin D supplementation, assessing the benefits and harms among younger participants, men, and people with low vitamin D status, and assessing longer duration of treatments as well as higher dosages of vitamin D. Follow-up of all participants is necessary to reduce attrition bias.

Continuous-flow LVAD speed testing and anticoagulation during recovery assessment — In a prospective study reducing HeartMate II speed from baseline to 6,000 rpm and then to 5,000 or 4,000 rpm, reducing the speed to less than 6,000 rpm did not have a significant effect on LVEDD, LVESD, or EF, and this testing has been widely used without adverse events and is considered safe. For testing, a continuous flow pump should be reduced to a speed which produces just enough forward flow to counteract backflow (usually around 1 L/min), approximating net‑zero flow. Device-specific targets are: Heartware 1,800 rpm; HeartMate II 6,000rpm; HeartMate III around 4,000 rpm; and a speed below 3,800 has limited study and may put the patient at higher risk for a thrombotic event. During such testing, patients anticoagulated with warfarin only require supplemental heparin (5,000–10,000 u) if the international normalized ratio (INR) is subtherapeutic; if > 2 that day or > 2.5 from the previous days measurement there is no need for additional anticoagulation.

### A quality improvement initiative to reduce central line-associated bloodstream infections in a neonatal intensive care unit in a low-and-middle-income country [^6171d4f9]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Background

Premature and sick neonates in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are in need of central lines placing them at high risk of contracting a central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). CLABSI extends length of stay to 10–14 days post negative cultures and increases morbidity, use of multiple antibiotics, mortality and hospital cost. To reduce CLABSI rate at the American University of Beirut Medical Center NICU, the National Collaborative Perinatal Neonatal Network developed a quality improvement project to reduce CLABSI rate by 50% over a 1-year period and to sustain reduced CLABSI rate.

Methods

Central line insertion and maintenance bundles were implemented for all infants admitted to the NICU necessitating central lines placement. Bundles included hand washing, wearing protective material and sterile drapes during central lines insertion and maintenance.

Results

CLABSI rate decreased by 76% from 4.82 (6 infections; 1244 catheter days) to 1.09 (2 infection; 1830 catheter days) per 1000 CL days after 1 year. Following the bundles' success in reducing CLABSI rate, they were incorporated permanently to NICU standard procedure and bundle checklists were added to the medical sheets. CLABSI rate was maintained at 1.15 per 1000 CL days during the second year. It then decreased to 0.66 per 1000 CL days in the third year before reaching zero in the fourth year. In total, zero CLABSI rate was sustained for 23 consecutive months.

Conclusion

Reducing CLABSI rate is necessary to improving newborn quality of care and outcome. Our bundles were successful in drastically reducing and sustaining a low CLABSI rate. It was even successful in achieving a zero CLABSI unit for 2 years.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^92b2b2f1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — vitamin D for adults with prediabetes: In adults with prediabetes, in addition to lifestyle modification, we suggest vitamin D supplementation to reduce the risk of progression to diabetes. Technical remarks specify that lifestyle modification must be a routine management component for adults with prediabetes, and that trials primarily related to adults with high-risk prediabetes identified as meeting 2 or 3 American Diabetes Association glycemia criteria (fasting glucose, HbA1c, 2-hour glucose after a 75-gram oral glucose challenge). Across trials, vitamin D dosages ranged from 842 to 7543 IU (21 to 189 μg) daily equivalent with an estimated weighted average of approximately 3500 IU (88 μg) per day, and some trials allowed routine supplements up to 1000 IU (25 μg) of vitamin D daily. Baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels reported that the baseline mean 25(OH)D level in the 11 trials was 12 to 28 ng/mL (30–70 nmol/L), and among trials without baseline 25(OH)D as an eligibility criterion the baseline mean level of 25(OH)D was 18 to 28 ng/mL (45–70 nmol/L).

### Impact of alternative approaches to accelerated measles control: experience in the African region, 1996–2002 [^50051001]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

From 1996 to 2000, several African countries accelerated measles control by providing a second opportunity for measles vaccine through supplemental campaigns. Fifteen countries completed campaigns in children aged 9 months to 14 years. Seven countries completed campaigns in children aged 9–59 months. In almost all countries that conducted campaigns in children aged 9 months to 14 years, measles deaths were reduced to near zero. In six countries, near-zero measles mortality has been maintained for 4–6 years. Supplemental immunization in children < 5 years old was only partially effective (range, 0–67%) in reducing mortality. Measles cases decreased by 50% when routine vaccination coverage increased from 50% to 80%. Initial measles campaigns in children aged 9 months to 14 years, follow-up campaigns in those aged 9–59 months every 3–5 years, and increased routine coverage to 80% will be needed to reduce and maintain measles deaths in African countries at near zero.

### Early treatment with fluvoxamine among patients with COVID-19: a cost-consequence model [^782812c5]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Fluvoxamine decision analysis.

The primary results of our decision analysis are presented in Table 3, reflecting substantial cost-savings and reductions in hospital resource requirements associated with the use of fluvoxamine in the target population. The results suggest that the use of fluvoxamine reduces total days of hospitalization by 0.15 days per person, comprising 0.7 days of regular admission and 0.8 days of ICU care. Overall costs were reduced by $231.69 across the study population when compared with standard of care.

Table 3
Results of primary analysis

Fluvoxamine threshold analyses.

To inform resource allocation decisions in other settings and determine the values at which the use of fluvoxamine would be expected to be cost-neutral, we conducted two threshold analyses for the cost of hospital admission and the cost of ICU admission. The values were tested independently, and thus, there were no positive values for either parameter that would make fluvoxamine use cost-neutral. In fact, even with both values set to zero, fluvoxamine's effect on ED costs still yielded cost savings. However, setting the costs for both extended ED visits and ICU admissions to zero yielded a threshold value of $328 for hospital admissions; setting the costs for both extended ED visits and hospital admissions to zero yielded a threshold value of $1475 for ICU admissions.

To account for the role of vaccination in reducing rates of hospitalization, we also estimated the relative effect of fluvoxamine when the overall likelihood of hospitalization was reduced. Holding other values constant, the baseline risk of hospitalization (0.123 for SOC and 0.100 for fluvoxamine), would have to be reduced by > 99% for fluvoxamine to become cost neutral.

### Non-selective distribution of infectious disease prevention may outperform risk-based targeting [^f2bec905]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Methods

The linear response function f

Definition

The goal of f (k) is to measure the impact that providing prevention to a few individuals in degree class k has on community-level baseline prevalence. We assume a population of N individuals, and define f as the change in the number of infected individuals in the population (N I), due to a small change in the amount of prevention provided in degree class k (N p k g k):where the minus sign is due to the fact that prevention will bring prevalence down. Here I is community-level prevalence as defined previously. Then, the population size N correctly cancels out (the final result does not depend on population size), and we get to the final definition of the response function:

Derivation of F d i r

At the endemic equilibrium, one can use Eq. (1) to write y k as a function of x k :Also, given that x k has to be evaluated at g = 0, we can use its recursive form, which comes from setting g = 0 in the first line of Eq. (1):where. Angle brackets denote expectation values on the degree distribution, so in this case this would mean z has a clear epidemiological interpretation, as it measures the expected number of at-risk contacts that an individual makes. Specifically, where l is the probability that a given contact is with an infected individual. This measure is sensitive to the amount of heterogeneity in the network. Indeed, if the network had a homogeneous degree distribution (i.e. all individuals had degree close to), then(I is the prevalence as usual). Broad degree distributions give instead, meaning that the probability of establishing a contact with an infected individual is higher than the probability of finding an infected individual at random in the population.

Plugging Eqs. (9)–(10) into Eq. (2), one gets Eq. (3).

### Optimal features for auditory categorization [^3182446c]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Feature complexity

We characterized feature complexity using the reduced kurtosis of the activity distribution of all auditory nerve fibers contained within a feature. Briefly, if the feature was an empty region of the cochleagram, or a region of uniform activity, the activity of all nerve fibers in all time bins would be about equal. This activity would thus be normally distributed, and show a reduced kurtosis value of zero. At the other extreme, for entire calls, there would be many bins of high activity, and a large number of bins with zero activity, resulting in an activity distribution with very high reduced kurtosis. We hypothesized that mid-level features that represent aspects of calls such as frequency-modulated sweeps or combinations of phrases over time would show intermediate reduced kurtosis values, and be more informative than low-level (tones) or high-level (entire calls) features.

### Vitamin D toxicity, policy, and science [^7ce57bff]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2007). Low credibility.

The serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration that is the threshold for vitamin D toxicity has not been established. Hypercalcemia is the hazard criterion for vitamin D. Past policy of the Institute of Medicine has set the tolerable upper intake level (UL) for vitamin D at 50 mug (2000 IU)/d, defining this as "the highest level of daily nutrient intake that is likely to pose no risks of adverse health effects to almost all individuals in the general population". However, because sunshine can provide an adult with vitamin D in an amount equivalent to daily oral consumption of 250 mug (10,000 IU)/d, this is intuitively a safe dose. The incremental consumption of 1 mug (40 IU)/day of vitamin D(3) raises serum 25(OH)D by approximately 1 nM (0.4 ng/ml). Therefore, if sun-deprived adults are to maintain serum 25(OH)D concentrations > 75 nM (30 ng/ml), they will require an intake of more than the UL for vitamin D. The mechanisms that limit vitamin D safety are the capacity of circulating vitamin D-binding protein and the ability to suppress 25(OH)D-1-alpha-hydroxylase. Vitamin D causes hypercalcemia when the "free" concentration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is inappropriately high. This displacement of 1,25(OH)(2)D becomes excessive as plasma 25(OH)D concentrations become higher than at least 600 nM (240 ng/ml). Plasma concentrations of unmetabolized vitamin D during the first days after an acute, large dose of vitamin D can reach the micromolar range and cause acute symptoms. The clinical trial evidence shows that a prolonged intake of 250 mug (10,000 IU)/d of vitamin D(3) is likely to pose no risk of adverse effects in almost all individuals in the general population; this meets the criteria for a tolerable upper intake level.

The characteristic velocity and length scales for the Phillip's solution are, and, whereis that gravitational acceleration, andare the dynamic fluid viscosity and salt diffusivity, andis the slope of the background density field (all assumed to be constant in this work). The length scaledefines the thickness of the boundary layer above the tilted flat plane and the velocity scaledefines its strength. We use this velocity scale to nondimensionalize the equations of motion for the velocity field, pressure, density(varying only through the evolution of the salt concentration), position, and time, (for a single sphere of radiusfor brevity in exposition) via,… The resulting non-dimensional PDE system (dropping tildes and primes) for the incompressible fluid velocity and concentration field is, respectively:where the Reynolds number isand the Peclet number is. For all the experiments we have run, and, as such, the so-called Stokes approximation may be employed, which sets the left hand side of Eq. (1) to zero while retaining nonlinear effects through non-zeroin the advection-diffusion of the salt concentration. As such, the only remaining parameter in the system is the Peclet number (of course, when the object is non-spherically symmetric, then its aspect ratio provides an additional non-dimensional parameter). The boundary conditions are assumed to be no-slip for the velocity and no-flux for the tracer on any physical boundary (see Supplementary Note 6 and Supplementary Fig. 7 for exact solutions derived with these as well as other boundary conditions).

### Prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia: the multimodal approach of the Spanish ICU "Pneumonia zero" program [^66c01840]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The prevalence rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common indicator for safety and quality of care in critically ill patients admitted to the ICU. Morbidity and mortality attributed to VAP have been extensively documented in the literature. Specific programs for the prevention of this infection have been included in national campaigns promoted in the United States with the objective to reduce mortality (The 100,000 lives campaign).

In Spain, healthcare-associated infection rates in critical care are collected in the database of the National ICU-Acquired Infection Surveillance Study (ENVIN-HELICS registry) in which clinical data of patients admitted to Spanish ICUs from April 1 to June 30 each year are captured. From 2000 to 2008, Spanish national VAP rates have remained stable at around 15 episodes per 1,000 ventilator days. In recent years, benefits of the implementation of sets of different preventive measures or bundles to reduce healthcare-associated infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) or VAP, have been reported. In Spain, a multifaceted intervention to prevent CRBSI was implemented during 2009–2010, the so-called "Bacteremia Zero" project, resulted in a 50% risk reduction of bloodstream infections. Based on the organizational structure of "Bacteremia Zero", a new nationwide project, called "Pneumonia Zero", was designed to implement a bundle of VAP-specific preventive measures. It was hypothesized that implementation of the intervention would result in a significant reduction of VAP rates. The main objective of this study was to assess the impact of the "Pneumonia Zero" project in reducing the rates of VAP in Spanish ICUs.

### Offshore wind and wave energy can reduce total installed capacity required in zero-emissions grids [^ebaf03e7]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

We design 101 offshore wind candidate projects to occupy the same areas as the wave energy candidate projects to allow the potential for collocation of these technologies. We create an interpolation function using the power curve of the turbine while considering the turbine's operating limits to determine the power generated by the turbine at any given wind speed in m/s. We assign a time series to each offshore wind candidate project by taking the average time series of the NREL coordinates within each project area. A total of 9207 coordinates lie within the project areas. We separate them based on which project area they fall within and use them to calculate an average time series for each area. We compute the hourly offshore wind energy capacity factors as the ratio between the available generating power and the rated power capacity of the turbine (Eq. (1)).

In order to determine the maximum possible installed offshore wind energy capacity at each site, we assume the packing density of the offshore wind turbines to be 4.3 MW/km 2. This value is based on the average theoretical capacity density of the Morro Bay Wind Energy Area, which is a current offshore wind leasing area on the U.S. West Coast. There is no standard for offshore wind turbine spacing because packing density can vary based on site-specific conditions or farm designs. Thus, for simplicity, we assume the same packing density for all fixed-bottom and floating turbines. Furthermore, we do not consider wake effects of offshore wind turbines given that this is a variable dependant on specific farm array design that can be minimized by developers through strategic design.

EFFECTS OF CSF FLOW STRESS

Shear, shear rate, and strain

Any time that an aqueous liquid flows in a confined space, it will be subjected to shear flow. Since the liquid wets the wall, the velocity of the innermost water surface layer during flow is zero. However, with flow this generates a liquid velocity gradient as one moves away from the wall. A typical result is represented by the laminar flow profile shown in Fig. 1. As indicated in this figure, the action brought about by laminar flow interacting with a flexible molecule has two components. It is both rotated and distorted. The nature of the molecular distortion is determined by the relative velocities of the different water layers within this profile and the molecule's resistance to distortion. In a complex system, such as an in vivo fluid like brain CSF, a particular velocity field can be very complex since the fluid flow path wall geometry may also be complex. Shear rates, generally given in s⁻¹, are related to the fractional distortion of the molecule's dimension per unit time. The local shear rate depends on the flow system's geometry. Changes in any part of this geometry can change the shear rates at relatively distant points. Input flow rates help determine both the flow and shear rates at any given point of an entire closed flow system. Thus, sometimes shear rate information about complex flow systems can only be determined by experimental measurements and computer calculations.

Strain is defined as the dimensionless magnitude of an object's deformation, equal to the change in the dimension of the object such as a molecule divided by its original dimension. The strain rate is the rate of change of strain per unit time, generally given in units s⁻¹.

### A quality improvement initiative to reduce central line-associated bloodstream infections in a neonatal intensive care unit in a low-and-middle-income country [^e3eae940]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Background

Premature and sick neonates in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are in need of central lines placing them at high risk of contracting a central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). CLABSI extends length of stay to 10-14days post negative cultures and increases morbidity, use of multiple antibiotics, mortality and hospital cost. To reduce CLABSI rate at the American University of Beirut Medical Center NICU, the National Collaborative Perinatal Neonatal Network developed a quality improvement project to reduce CLABSI rate by 50% over a 1-year period and to sustain reduced CLABSI rate.

Methods

Central line insertion and maintenance bundles were implemented for all infants admitted to the NICU necessitating central lines placement. Bundles included hand washing, wearing protective material and sterile drapes during central lines insertion and maintenance.

Results

CLABSI rate decreased by 76% from 4.82 (6 infections; 1244 catheter days) to 1.09 (2 infection; 1830 catheter days) per 1000 CL days after 1 year. Following the bundles' success in reducing CLABSI rate, they were incorporated permanently to NICU standard procedure and bundle checklists were added to the medical sheets. CLABSI rate was maintained at 1.15 per 1000 CL days during the second year. It then decreased to 0.66 per 1000 CL days in the third year before reaching zero in the fourth year. In total, zero CLABSI rate was sustained for 23 consecutive months.

Conclusion

Reducing CLABSI rate is necessary to improving newborn quality of care and outcome. Our bundles were successful in drastically reducing and sustaining a low CLABSI rate. It was even successful in achieving a zero CLABSI unit for 2 years.

### Reducing injection-related safety events in retina clinics [^4c22e41f]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

At the Kellogg Eye Center, we identified a series of injection-related patient safety events that led to a systematic review and redesign of our intravitreal injection protocol. The objective was to reduce injection-related patient safety events to zero.

Methods

A retroactive review, using the Healthcare Failure Mode and Effect Analysis model as a guide, was performed on our process for delivering intravitreal injections to identify potential failure modes and their impact.

Results

The total number of injection-related safety events was 1 in 2017 and 16 in 2018 at baseline. Potential vulnerabilities identified included errors in communication, patient identification, clinical documentation, and medication orders. The injection protocol was redesigned. After implementation, there were zero injection-related safety events in all Kellogg Eye Center Retina clinics for the subsequent 18-month follow-up period.

Conclusion

It is possible to redesign and implement an intravitreal injection protocol to reduce the rate of safety events in a large academic eye center.

### Recommendations abstracted from the American Geriatrics Society consensus statement on vitamin D for prevention of falls and their consequences [^46b53c87]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). Medium credibility.

Consensus statement on vitamin D — falls prevention in older adults summarizes evidence and target serum 25(OH)D levels as follows: The Institute of Medicine reported that there was "no benefit to 25(OH)D above 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) in older adults", but the workgroup's review found that trials with higher starting levels had lower fall rates, with "four trials with starting serum levels of 24 ng/mL (60 nmol/L), or greater" showing benefit and "three trials with serum levels below 25 ng/mL (60 nmol/L)" showing higher fall risk. In studies with fewer falls/fractures, "average concentrations of 25(OH)D achieved were consistently greater than 26 ng/mL (65 nmol/L)", and the workgroup concluded that "serum levels of 25(OH)D of 25 ng/mL (60 nmol/L) or greater provide protection". The target level recommended is " ≥ 30 ng/mL, 75 nmol/L", and with recommended supplementation "the highest level reached will not exceed 60 ng/mL (150 nmol/L)", which remains "well below toxicity levels, even in the 5% of older adults with the highest baseline vitamin D levels".

### Decadal changes in wind speed have offset and then aggravated the impact of warming on maize production in China since 1980 [^49deb5e8]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

We performed three tests to assess the robustness of this wind-yield relationship (Fig. 2b–d). First, we examined the scale effect by building the statistical model at the different scales of country, agro-climatic region, and province (Fig. 2b). The average effects from these models ranges from 8.2 to 9.4% yield decrease with 1 m s −1 increase of wind speed, demonstrating that our results are robust across different spatial scales. For simplicity, we reported the results from the agro-climatic region scale hereafter. Second, we examined the uncertainty induced by perturbing variable terms of the statistical model, as well as an extended model incorporating solar radiation, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and CO 2 concentration (Fig. 2c). After testing all potential combinations of the model terms and the extended model, we found the yield response to wind was moderately stable, ranging from 8.9 to 15.0% yield decrease with 1 m s −1 increase of wind speed. The main results are from the baseline model (Eq. 4 in Methods). Finally, we conducted placebo checks to determine if the yield response could have occurred by chance. We generated the distribution of model coefficients from the county-and-year mismatched model inputs (Fig. 2d), which did not overlap with the ones obtained from the original data, indicating a low probability (< 0.01%) that the results have occurred by chance.

Cumulative impacts of wind stilling and reversal on production

Using the statistical model built above, we estimated the impact of climate conditions on maize production in China since 1980. We attributed this impact to the contributions from wind, temperature, and precipitation changes (Figs. 3–5). This attribution allowed for a quantitative comparison of the understudied impacts of changing winds with the well-known impacts of rising temperatures on maize production. Overall, the production-enhancing effect of decreasing wind speeds can compensate for the production-reducing effect of rising temperature (Fig. 3). Throughout the entire study period (1980−2017), more than 47% of maize-growing areas exhibited a compensation ratio (W cum / T cum) below −1, indicating that the positive effects of wind stilling fully offset the negative effects of rising temperatures (Fig. 3b). In about 91% of maize-growing areas, the compensation ratio was below zero, suggesting that the wind effect partially compensated for the adverse effects of warming (Fig. 3b).

### Biomechanical comparison of different surgical strategies for skip-level cervical degenerative disc disease: a finite element study [^a109e51d]. Spine (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Noncontiguous ACDF with Zero-P provides more reliable biomechanical stability for patients because of its minimal impact on the cervical biomechanical environment. In addition, the use of Zero-P devices can reduce the stress on adjacent intervertebral disks and endplates, resulting in a reduced risk of ASD development. However, the high cortical bone stress caused by the Zero-P device may influence the risk of fractures.

Key Points

Noncontiguous anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with Zero-P provides reliable stability.
The use of Zero-P can reduce the stress on adjacent intervertebral disks and endplates.
The use of Zero-P devices results in a reduced risk of ASD. However, the high cortical bone stress caused by the zero-profile device cannot exclude the risk of fractures.

### Finite element analysis of zonular forces [^6c108eb2]. Experimental Eye Research (2023). Medium credibility.

To determine the effect of zonular forces on lens capsule topography, a finite element (FE) analyses of lens capsules with no lens stroma and constant and variable thickness with anterior capsulotomies of 1.5 mm-6.5 mm were evaluated when subjected to equatorial (Ez), anterior (Az) and posterior (Pz) zonular forces. The lens capsule was considered in the unaccommodated state when the total initial zonular force was 0.00075 N or 0.3 N. From the total 0.00075 N zonular force, the Ez force was increased in 0.000125 N steps for a maximum force of 0.03 N and simultaneously the Az plus Pz force was reduced in 0.000125 N steps to zero. In addition, the force of all the zonules was reduced from 0.00075 N and separately from 0.3 N in 0.000125 N steps to zero. Only when Ez force was increased as Az and Pz force was reduced did the capsule topography simulate in vivo observations with the posterior capsule pole bowing posteriorly. The posterior bowing was directly related to Ez force and capsulotomy size. Whether the total force of all the zonules in the unaccommodated state was 0.00075 N or 0.3 N and reduced in steps to zero, the lens capsule topography did not emulate the in vivo observations. The FE analysis demonstrated that Ez tension increases while the Az and Pz tension decreases and that all the zonules do not relax during ciliary muscle contraction.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^a16bcc93]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Randomized trials — all-cause mortality with vitamin D supplementation: All-cause mortality was reported in 13 RCTs (81 695 participants); estimated daily vitamin D dosage varied between 400 IU (10 μg) and 4800 IU (120 μg), with a median of 2000 IU (50 μg), and most trials allowed supplemental vitamin D between 400 to 800 IU/d. The RR for mortality was 1.07 (95% CI, 0.95–1.20), translating to 2 more per 1000 (2 fewer to 6 more). Mortality risk appeared lower with calcium co-administration (RR 0.90 [95% CI, 0.79–1.01]) than with vitamin D alone (RR 1.12 [95% CI, 1.01–1.24]) (P for heterogeneity = .021), and higher with high dosages (RR 1.22 [95% CI, 1.06–1.39]) compared with standard dosages (RR 0.95 [95% CI, 0.86–1.04]) (P for heterogeneity = .003).

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^7ecb7502]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Prediabetes — vitamin D effects on glycemia and safety are as follows: Compared with placebo, vitamin D lowered fasting blood glucose and post–oral glucose tolerance test values, with mean difference −5.3 mg/dL [95% CI, −7.9 to −2.7] and mean difference −7.6 mg/dL [95% CI, −12.6 to −2.7], respectively, and there was a trend toward HbA1c lowering (mean difference −0.05% [95% CI, −0.10 to 0.01]). Meta-analyses found no clear differences for all-cause mortality (RR 0.75 [95% CI, 0.26–2.18]; estimated absolute effect size of 1 fewer per 1000 [4 fewer to 6 more]) or cardiovascular disease events (RR 1.08 [95% CI, 0.33–3.57]; estimated absolute effect size of 1 more per 1000 [1 fewer to 31 more]). Nephrolithiasis showed no clear difference (RR 1.02 [95% CI, 0.71–2.03]; estimated absolute effect size of 3 more per 1000 [5 fewer to 17 more]), there were no cases of symptomatic hypercalcemia, and in the DPVD study there was 1 case of new-onset kidney disease in the vitamin D group and 2 cases in placebo (RR 0.50 [95% CI, 0.05–5.51]). In D2d, adverse events were overall less frequent with vitamin D 4000 IU/day [100 μg/day] cholecalciferol versus placebo (IRR 0.94 [95% CI, 0.90–0.98]). Based on these point estimates, the panel judged that anticipated desirable effects for diabetes prevention are likely moderate, while anticipated undesirable effects are likely trivial.

### A topological fluctuation theorem [^a4612427]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Fluctuation theorems specify the non-zero probability to observe negative entropy production, contrary to a naive expectation from the second law of thermodynamics. For closed particle trajectories in a fluid, Stokes theorem can be used to give a geometric characterization of the entropy production. Building on this picture, we formulate a topological fluctuation theorem that depends only by the winding number around each vortex core and is insensitive to other aspects of the force. The probability is robust to local deformations of the particle trajectory, reminiscent of topologically protected modes in various classical and quantum systems. We demonstrate that entropy production is quantized in these strongly fluctuating systems, and it is controlled by a topological invariant. We demonstrate that the theorem holds even when the probability distributions are non-Gaussian functions of the generated heat.

### Frequency stabilization and noise-induced spectral narrowing in resonators with zero dispersion [^07bd8e40]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The frequency stability can be significantly improved when V dc is adjusted to yield zero-dispersion behavior. Figure 4c shows measurements for the case of a non-monotonic backbone line using four driving amplitudes (22.2, 71.3, 182, and 269 pN). For force vibrations without feedback, the driving amplitude of 182 pN (yielding the third resonance curve from bottom) marks the transition of the resonance curves from bending towards high frequency to the mixed behavior. For self-sustained oscillations with feedback, the distribution of measured frequencies (plotted in purple) shows a remarkable narrowing for this driving amplitude as the system approaches the zero-dispersion regime, where the eigenfrequency of the resonator is locally independent of the vibration amplitude. In Fig. 4d, the dependence of σ ω on driving amplitude for this case is plotted in red, showing that the initial drop of σ ω with driving amplitude largely coincides with the blue curve for a nonlinear resonator with a monotonic transformed backbone line. As the driving amplitude continues to increase beyond 60 pN, the two oscillators behave differently. Instead of a sharp increase with the driving amplitude, σ ω for the resonator with non-monotonic backbone exhibits only a slight increase followed by a gentle drop. The drop becomes steeper as the driving amplitude further increases. σ ω eventually attains the absolute minimum rad s⁻¹ at driving amplitude of 182 pN (same as the driving amplitude for the second highest resonance response curve in Fig. 4c), beyond which σ ω increases sharply. Remarkably, the minimal σ ω for the zero-dispersion regime at 182 pN is about 3 times smaller compared to the minimal σ ω in the conventional regime. Further improvements appear feasible if the zero-dispersion energy can be pushed higher.

In analyzing the frequency stability of oscillators and clocks, the Allan deviation is often used to eliminate systematic errors such as long-term frequency drifts. For the results shown in Fig. 4d, the frequency of the phase-locked loop is recorded for only 120 s for each driving amplitude. Over such a short duration, the effect of frequency drift is negligible in our system. In Supplementary Note 4, we show that the improvement of the minimal Allan deviation in the zero-dispersion regime over its counterpart in the conventional regime is about 3.6 for averaging time of 1 s, close to the improvement in σ ω in Fig. 4d.

### Quinidine sulfate [^88d9ec47]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Mechanisms of Action

In patients with malaria, quinidine acts primarily as an intra-erythrocytic schizonticide, with little effect upon sporozites or upon pre-erythrocytic parasites. Quinidine is gametocidal to and but not to Plasmodium vivax P. malariae, P. falciparum.

In cardiac muscle and in Purkinje fibers, quinidine depresses the rapid inward depolarizing sodium current, thereby slowing phase-0 depolarization and reducing the amplitude of the action potential without affecting the resting potential. In normal Purkinje fibers, it reduces the slope of phase-4 depolarization, shifting the threshold voltage upward toward zero. The result is slowed conduction and reduced automaticity in all parts of the heart, with increase of the effective refractory period relative to the duration of the action potential in the atria, ventricles, and Purkinje tissues. Quinidine also raises the fibrillation thresholds of the atria and ventricles, and it raises the ventricular fibrillation threshold as well. Quinidine's actions fall into class 1A in the Vaughan-Williams classification. de

By slowing conduction and prolonging the effective refractory period, quinidine can interrupt or prevent reentrant arrhythmias and arrhythmias due to increased automaticity, including atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.

In patients with the sick sinus syndrome, quinidine can cause marked sinus node depression and bradycardia. In most patients, however, use of quinidine is associated with an increase in the sinus rate.

Quinidine prolongs the QT interval in a dose-related fashion. This may lead to increased ventricular automaticity and polymorphic ventricular tachycardias, including (see). torsades de pointes WARNINGS

In addition, quinidine has anticholinergic activity, it has negative inotropic activity, and it acts peripherally as an α-adrenergic antagonist (that is, as a vasodilator).

### Standardizing vitamin D assays: the way forward [^ebe81861]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2014). Low credibility.

For a number of years it has been widely assumed that measurement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration is the best approach to assessing an individual's vitamin D status. However, it has also been recognized that there is substantial within-assay variation in 25(OH)D measurement and even greater between-assay variability. Such assay variation clearly confounds attempts to define what constitutes the diagnosis of hypovitaminosis D. Importantly, assay variability makes pooling of 25(OH)D results from different studies in systematic reviews for the specific purpose of determining dose-response and/or clinical cut points at best problematic. Therefore, to develop and implement evidence-based clinical guidelines, it is essential that 25(OH)D measurement be standardized in both clinical and research laboratories. In this Perspective we outline a way forward toward achieving this goal-the Vitamin D Standardization Program (VDSP).

### A general derivation and quantification of the third law of thermodynamics [^314e2820]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We hope the present work puts the third law on a footing more in line with those of the other laws of thermodynamics. These have already been long established, although they've recently been reformulated within the context of other resource theories. Namely, as described in ref. the first law (energy conservation), and unitarity (or microscopic reversibility) describe the class of operations which are allowed within thermodynamics. The zeroth law, is the fact that the only state which one can add to the theory without making it trivial, are the equivalence class of thermal states at temperature T. This allows the temperature to emerge naturally. The second law(s), tells us which state transformations are allowed under the class of operations. For macroscopic systems with short-range interactions, there is only one function, the entropy, which tells you whether you can go from one state to another, but in general there are many constraints. The third law quantifies how long it takes to cool a system. We propose to generalize it further: While the second laws tell us which thermodynamical transitions are possible, generalized third laws quantify the time of these transitions. In this context, it would be interesting to explore the time and resource costs of other thermodynamical transitions. It would also be interesting to explore the third law in more restricted physical settings, as well as to other resource theory frameworks, in particular, those discussed in ref.

It is worth noting that scaling we find, for example, the inverse polynomial of equation (1), is more benign than what one might have feared, and does not exclude obtaining lower temperatures with a modest increase of resources. However, it is also stronger than that envisioned when the third law was original formulated. Consider for example, the cooling protocol of Fig. 1 proposed by Nernst. It is unphysical, since it requires an infinite number of heat baths, each one at a lower and lower temperature, and with the final heat baths at close to zero temperature. However, it allows the temperature of the system to decrease exponentially in the number of steps, something which we are able to rule out when one doesn't have colder and colder reservoirs.

### Bench assessment of work of breathing during a spontaneous breathing trial on zero pressure support and zero PEEP compared to T-Piece [^f31a21d1]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Analysis of observational data suggests that both a T-piece and zero pressure support ventilation (PSV) and zero PEEP impose work of breathing (WOB) during a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) similar to what a patient experiences after extubation. The aim of our study was to compare the WOB imposed by the T-piece with zero PSV and zero PEEP. We also compared the difference in WOB when using zero PSV and zero PEEP on 3 different ventilators.

Methods

This study was conducted by using a breathing simulator that simulated 3 lung models (ie, normal, moderate ARDS, and COPD). Three ventilators were used and set to zero PSV and zero PEEP. The outcome variable was WOB expressed as mJ/L of tidal volume.

Results

An analysis of variance showed that WOB was statistically different between the T-piece and zero PSV and zero PEEP on all the ventilators (Servo-i, Servo-u, and Carescape R860). The absolute difference was lowest for the Carescape R860, which increased WOB by 5–6%, whereas the highest for Servo-u, which reduced the WOB by 15–21%.

Conclusions

Work may be imposed or reduced during spontaneous breathing on zero PSV and zero PEEP when compared to T-piece. The unpredictable nature of how zero PSV and zero PEEP behaves on different ventilators makes it an imprecise SBT modality in the context of assessing extubation readiness.
