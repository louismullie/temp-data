## Question

Preferred sglt-2 high cardiovascular risk type 2 diabetes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which glucose-lowering therapy should be preferred for a patient with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk, and how to implement that choice in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how "high cardiovascular risk" is defined in contemporary guidelines. Then, I should review head-to-head evidence and meta-analyses comparing SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists for cardiorenal outcomes. Next, I will examine guideline positions to identify where they converge and where they diverge. After that, I need to consider comorbidity-specific modifiers such as heart failure and chronic kidney disease that could sway the choice. Finally, I will translate this into a practical, stepwise recommendation with dosing, monitoring, and safety checks, while double-checking renal thresholds and labeling nuances that could affect drug selection and titration.

> Let me first confirm what "high cardiovascular risk" means in current guidance so I don't misclassify the patient. High risk includes established ASCVD, heart failure, or CKD, as well as those without overt disease but with multiple risk factors or end-organ damage such as left ventricular hypertrophy or retinopathy. Importantly, risk is independent of baseline HbA1c and the decision to use cardiorenal-protective agents should be made irrespective of glycemic control, with some guidelines explicitly endorsing initiation in people whose 10-year CVD risk is at least 10 percent [^116MXcjn] [^114CAaUz] [^116hpbxk].

> Wait, let me verify the comparative effectiveness signals before I jump to a conclusion. High-certainty evidence from a large BMJ network meta-analysis shows both SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce cardiovascular and renal events, but with meaningful differences: SGLT2 inhibitors are superior for heart failure hospitalization reduction, whereas GLP-1 receptor agonists are stronger for nonfatal stroke reduction; this pattern is consistent across multiple meta-analyses and is clinically important for risk tailoring [^115F2kxs] [^115Jyy7d] [^112aF4eM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about primary versus secondary prevention heterogeneity. I initially thought the MACE benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors might be confined to secondary prevention, but I should double-check that assumption. A comprehensive Bayesian meta-analysis and multiple subsequent analyses suggest comparable relative risk reductions across baseline CVD strata, indicating benefits are not limited to those with established disease; absolute benefits are greater in higher-risk patients, but the relative effect appears broadly similar, which supports broader use when risk is elevated [^112RR1jB] [^113Xenjd].

> Next, I should review how major guidelines position SGLT2 inhibitors versus GLP-1 receptor agonists so I don't overstate a preference that isn't supported. The ADA Standards consistently recommend either class for established ASCVD or high risk, while prioritizing SGLT2 inhibitors when HF or CKD is present and allowing GLP-1 receptor agonists when ASCVD predominates; ESC 2023 aligns by recommending either class when ASCVD or CKD is present, with a threshold-based approach in primary prevention when 10-year CVD risk is at least 10 percent; AACE and Canadian Cardiovascular Society similarly endorse both classes, often tailoring to the dominant comorbidity [^116MXcjn] [^116hpbxk] [^1131Mn96] [^113Zdmc2].

> I will now examine comorbidity-specific modifiers that can tip the balance in real patients. In the presence of HF or CKD, SGLT2 inhibitors have the most robust and consistent benefits for HF hospitalization and kidney outcomes, and current standards elevate them as preferred; conversely, when the dominant concern is atherothrombotic events such as stroke or MI without HF/CKD, GLP-1 receptor agonists may offer relatively stronger protection and could be favored; combination therapy can be considered in those with established ASCVD and high residual risk after shared decision-making [^116MXcjn] [^112TtxQw] [^115rHFfo].

> But wait, what if neither HF nor CKD is present and the patient simply has multiple risk factors without established ASCVD? The BMJ Rapid Recommendations provide a risk-stratified approach: with more than three cardiovascular risk factors, there is a weak recommendation to initiate an SGLT2 inhibitor and avoid starting a GLP-1 receptor agonist; with three or fewer risk factors, the recommendation is weak against either class; these are weak recommendations that should be individualized using validated risk tools and patient preferences, acknowledging smaller absolute benefits at lower baseline risk [^1176mNos] [^112w16JV].

> Let me consider real-world corroboration and practical prescribing details to ensure my recommendation is actionable. Observational data in moderate-risk populations show both SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce MACE compared with DPP-4 inhibitors, supporting their preferential use in appropriately selected higher-risk patients; for SGLT2 inhibitors, start at the trial-proven cardiovascular dose and do not titrate for cardiorenal benefit, for example empagliflozin 10 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, or canagliflozin 100 mg, with attention to eGFR thresholds for initiation and continuation per agent labeling [^112SdqQA] [^115JdpUi] [^116hMxBK].

> I should double-check safety and renal considerations before finalizing. SGLT2 inhibitors increase genital mycotic infections but have low hypoglycemia risk and can be continued down to eGFR about 20–30 mL/min/1.73 m² depending on the agent and indication, with dose adjustments or restrictions below certain thresholds; GLP-1 receptor agonists have gastrointestinal adverse effects and may be preferred in advanced CKD when eGFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² because their glycemic effect persists and hypoglycemia risk remains low, which can guide selection when kidney function is severely reduced [^112TtxQw] [^114Qx47f] [^116hMxBK].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line and make sure it aligns with the totality of evidence. For adults with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk — especially those with established ASCVD, heart failure, or CKD — an SGLT2 inhibitor is generally the preferred initial cardiorenal agent because of consistent reductions in HF hospitalization, progression of kidney disease, and cardiovascular death; a GLP-1 receptor agonist is an excellent alternative when the clinical priority is atherothrombotic event reduction, particularly stroke, or when SGLT2 inhibitors are contraindicated or not tolerated; in patients with very high risk or multiple comorbidities, sequential or combination therapy can be considered after shared decision-making and reassessment of risk and preferences [^115F2kxs] [^116MXcjn] [^114rAFAo].

> Final recommendation: I need to ensure this is precise and actionable. Preferentially initiate an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven cardiovascular benefit such as empagliflozin 10 mg daily, dapagliflozin 10 mg daily, or canagliflozin 100 mg daily in patients with T2D and high cardiovascular risk, independent of HbA1c, while addressing contraindications and eGFR thresholds. If SGLT2 inhibitors are unsuitable or the dominant risk is atherothrombotic, select a GLP-1 receptor agonist with proven cardiovascular benefit such as dulaglutide, liraglutide, or injectable semaglutide, titrated to the trial dose or maximally tolerated. Reassess at 3–6 months to consider adding the complementary class if residual risk remains high and the patient agrees, and continue comprehensive risk factor optimization in parallel [^115JdpUi] [^116MXcjn] [^114rAFAo].

---

SGLT-2 inhibitors are the **preferred glucose-lowering therapy** for patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk because they **reduce cardiovascular death, heart failure hospitalization, and chronic kidney disease progression** independent of glycemic control [^114rAFAo] [^114F9w54]. They are **recommended by major guidelines** (ADA, ESC, ACC) as first-line after metformin or even as initial therapy in high-risk patients, with benefits extending to those without established CVD but with multiple risk factors [^114v9fYd] [^116hpbxk] [^116MXcjn]. GLP-1 receptor agonists are appropriate alternatives when SGLT-2 inhibitors are contraindicated or not tolerated, but SGLT-2 inhibitors remain the preferred choice for cardiorenal risk reduction in this population [^112VEpub] [^1121Q2XQ].

---

## Cardiovascular benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors

SGLT-2 inhibitors have **consistent and robust cardiovascular benefits**, including:

- **Reduction in cardiovascular death**: Empagliflozin significantly reduced cardiovascular death by 38% in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [^112Hmg2c].

- **Reduction in heart failure hospitalization**: SGLT-2 inhibitors significantly reduced heart failure hospitalizations by approximately 35% across major trials [^115Jyy7d].

- **Reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE)**: Canagliflozin reduced MACE by 14% in the CANVAS program [^115PYFTr].

- **Renal benefits**: SGLT-2 inhibitors slow CKD progression and reduce renal events, as demonstrated in the CREDENCE trial [^114HNX4G].

These benefits are **largely independent of glycemic control**, indicating direct cardiorenal protective effects [^114F9w54].

---

## Comparative effectiveness with GLP-1 receptor agonists

GLP-1 receptor agonists also provide cardiovascular benefits — particularly for MACE and stroke reduction — but are less consistent in reducing heart failure hospitalizations [^115F2kxs]. SGLT-2 inhibitors have a **more pronounced effect on heart failure and renal outcomes**, making them particularly suitable for patients with high cardiovascular risk, especially those with heart failure or chronic kidney disease [^115Jyy7d].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major guidelines consistently **recommend SGLT-2 inhibitors** as the preferred glucose-lowering therapy for high-risk patients:

- **American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2025**: Recommends SGLT-2 inhibitors for patients with established ASCVD, multiple ASCVD risk factors, or CKD, irrespective of HbA1c levels [^notfound].

- **European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2023**: Recommends SGLT-2 inhibitors for patients with T2DM and ASCVD, or at high cardiovascular risk, to reduce cardiovascular events [^115bxTv3].

- **American College of Cardiology (ACC) 2020**: Recommends SGLT-2 inhibitors for patients with T2DM and established ASCVD, heart failure, or CKD [^114v9fYd].

---

## Patient populations benefiting from SGLT-2 inhibitors

SGLT-2 inhibitors are **particularly beneficial** in the following populations:

| **Patient population** | **Evidence of benefit** |
|-|-|
| Established ASCVD | Reduced MACE, cardiovascular death, and heart failure hospitalization [^114rAFAo] [^112Hmg2c] |
| Heart failure (HFrEF and HFpEF) | Reduced heart failure hospitalization and cardiovascular death [^115KUzAa] [^114kk5GW] |
| Chronic kidney disease | Slowed CKD progression and reduced renal events [^112TtxQw] [^114HNX4G] |
| Multiple cardiovascular risk factors | Reduced cardiovascular events and mortality [^114rAFAo] [^113Zdmc2] |

---

## Safety considerations and contraindications

SGLT-2 inhibitors are **generally well-tolerated**, but clinicians should consider the following:

- **Genital infections**: Increased risk of mycotic infections, manageable with standard care [^112zRrW6].

- **Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis**: Rare but serious; monitor for symptoms, especially in patients with low insulin levels [^notfound].

- **Renal function**: Use cautiously in patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²; dose adjustments may be necessary [^116hMxBK].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

Given their robust cardiovascular and renal benefits, SGLT-2 inhibitors should be **initiated early** in patients with T2DM and high cardiovascular risk, either as first-line therapy or as an add-on to metformin. Clinicians should consider patient-specific factors — including renal function, risk of genital infections, and patient preferences — when selecting and dosing SGLT-2 inhibitors.

---

SGLT-2 inhibitors are the **preferred glucose-lowering therapy** for patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk because they significantly reduce cardiovascular death, heart failure hospitalization, and chronic kidney disease progression. Major guidelines consistently recommend their use, and their benefits extend across various high-risk populations, making them a cornerstone of diabetes management in this context [^114rAFAo] [^1144ha62].

### Association of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors with cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease: a meta-analysis [^112aF4eM]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

The cardiovascular outcome in selected populations when sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2-Is) are emerging as standard therapy is not clearly understood. It is important to learn the magnitude of cardiovascular benefit using SGLT2-Is across the select subgroups that include both sexes and multiple age and racial and ethnic groups.

Objectives

To evaluate the association between use of SGLT2-Is and cardiovascular benefits in a prespecified group in a larger sample size using data obtained from randomized clinical trials.

Data Sources

Search of electronic databases PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Cochrane from inception to January 10, 2021, with additional studies identified through conference papers and meeting presentations, ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists of published studies.

Study Selection

Placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials in which participants had atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or risk factors for ASCVD, diabetes, or heart failure and which reported the primary outcome were included in this study. Multicenter observational and nonobservational studies and those with different outcomes of interest were excluded.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Medical Subject Heading search terms included SGLT2-I and multiple cardiovascular outcomes in different combinations. The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. The analysis of all outcomes was performed using a Mantel-Haenszel equation and the random-effects model.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Six efficacy outcomes of SGLT2-I use (cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure [HHF] as the primary outcome and major adverse cardiovascular event, HHF, cardiovascular death, acute myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality as secondary outcomes), were evaluated. Subgroup analysis was performed for the primary outcome of cardiovascular death or HHF. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were used to compare 2 interventions.

Results

Ten studies with71 553 participants were included, among whom 39 053 received SGLT2-Is; among studies that reported these data, 28 809 were men and 15 655 were women (mean age, 65.2 [range, 61.9–70.0] years). Race and ethnicity were defined in the original trials and were categorized as Asian, Black, or other (6900 participants) and White (26 646 participants) for the purposes of this analysis (the category "other" was not specified consistently). In terms of age, 16 793 were younger than 65 years and 17 087 were 65 years or older. At a mean follow-up 2.3 (range, 0.8–4.2) years, the SGLT2-I group favored reduction in primary outcome (3165 of 39 053 [8.10%] vs 3756 of 32 500 [11.56%]; OR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.55–0.80]; P < .001). No difference was noted in the rate of acute myocardial infarction compared with the placebo group (1256 of 26 931 [4.66%] vs 958 of 20 373 [4.70%]; OR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.87–1.03]; p = 0.22). Subgroup analysis favored SGLT2-I use for the primary outcome in both sexes, age groups, and racial and ethnic groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

This meta-analysis supports that SGLT2-Is have emerged as an effective class of drugs for improving cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in selected patients. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors were not associated with reduced risk of acute myocardial infarction. Future long-term prospective studies are warranted to understand the long-term cardiovascular benefits.

Discussion

These data provide strong evidence of cardiovascular and mortality benefits with SGLT2 inhibition, with limited evidence that effects vary between patient subgroups or across completed trials. In conjunction with reductions in total SAEs in every individual trial, these findings indicate that a broad range of patients with T2DM are likely to achieve important net benefits from use of this drug class.

A key strength of these analyses is the inclusion of new data from the recently completed CREDENCE trial, which enrolled large numbers of individuals who were at high vascular risk but free of CVD at baseline. In contrast to previous reports suggesting that the benefits of SGLT2 inhibition on MACE are restricted to those with established CVD, 12, 13 our updated analyses suggest comparable benefits for those with and without CVD. The prior interpretations were based on marginal evidence for an interaction by baseline CVD (P = 0.0501), 12 which was probably a chance finding. We found no evidence of an interaction in either our primary analysis or a series of sensitivity analyses and conclude that there is little evidence that effects in the primary versus secondary prevention subgroups differ by more than chance for the MACE outcome. Furthermore, with clear and separately significant evidence of protection against HF, and the composite of HF or vascular death, in the primary prevention subset, there is a strong case for the use of these agents in the primary prevention setting. Our results call for a reevaluation of current guideline recommendations for SGLT2 inhibitor therapy, with a view to include those with and without established CVD. A recent update to the European Guidelines (European Society of Cardiology/European Association for the Study of Diabetes) 31 has partially addressed this issue, recommending that SGLT2 inhibition or glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists may be used as first‐line therapy in those with T2DM and high risk of atherosclerotic CVD, irrespective of whether they are treatment naïve or already on metformin.

### Individual SGLT-2 inhibitors and cardiovascular and safety outcomes… [^112Grtvh]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Question Do individual sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors differ in their risks of cardiovascular and safety outcomes in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Findings This comparative effectiveness study using a target trial emulation found that, compared with empagliflozin, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin at clinically effective doses demonstrated comparable cardiovascular effectiveness; however, low-dose dapagliflozin showed reduced effectiveness in preventing heart failure hospitalization. The safety profile of individual SGLT-2 inhibitors varied. Meaning Although all 3 SGLT-2 inhibitors were equally effective in reducing cardiovascular risk, findings of this study supported the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors at doses recommended for cardiovascular benefits in individuals at higher risk of heart failure. Importance Evidence on cardiovascular benefits and safety of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors is mainly from placebo-controlled trials.

Therefore, the comparative effectiveness and safety of individual SGLT-2 inhibitors remain unknown. Results: Across the databases, 232 890 patients receiving canagliflozin, 129 881 patients receiving dapagliflozin, and 295 043 patients receiving empagliflozin were identified. Compared with empagliflozin initiators, those receiving canagliflozin or dapagliflozin were less likely to have diabetes-related conditions or a history of CVD at baseline. For heart failure hospitalization, dapagliflozin initiators had a higher risk, particularly at the low dose of 5 mg. These findings were consistent across subgroups of CVD history. For safety events, compared with empagliflozin, canagliflozin initiators had a lower risk of genital infections but a higher risk of severe UTIs (HR, 1. 13;.

Conclusions and Relevance This study found that individual SGLT-2 inhibitors demonstrated comparable cardiovascular effectiveness at clinically effective doses, though low-dose dapagliflozin showed a reduced benefit for heart failure hospitalization compared with empagliflozin.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors and cardiorenal outcomes in patients with or without type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis of 11 CVOTs [^111JVL2A]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Search strategy and study selection

This systematic review was based on PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. The protocol has not been registered in any platform. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify all eligible trials comparing the efficacy of SGLT-2 inhibitors with that of placebo in adult patients with or without T2D. The terms used for the research were "sodium–glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors", "empagliflozin", "canagliflozin", "dapagliflozin", "ertugliflozin", "sotagliflozin", "placebo", "cardiorenal outcomes", "kidney outcomes", "MACE", "heart failure", and "randomized controlled trials". The search was filtered to include only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or meta-analyses of human data. Searches were done up until September 30, 2021. We excluded observational non-randomized studies, registries, ongoing trials without results, duplicate series, meta-analysis, abstracts, and oral communications. Data were extracted by D.G. and M.L. with conflicts over study inclusion resolved by consensus. The prespecified selection criteria included: (1) randomized controlled trials comparing any SGLT-2 inhibitor with placebo; (2) RCTs reporting desired cardiovascular or renal outcomes; (3) RCTs completed before the FDA guidance of 2008 and (4) follow-up duration of at least 6 months.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Results in trial reports (primary trial results and subsequent secondary publications), and their accompanying supplementary materials, were used as the primary source of information. The retrieved data included study characteristics, characteristics of patients, interventions, and outcome measures, that included the hazard ratios (HR) and confidence intervals (CI) for cardiorenal outcomes. In more recent trials examining the effects of some SGLT-2 inhibitors (dapagliflozin or empagliflozin) independent of the presence of T2D, we did subgroups analysis assessing the effect of the SGLT-2 inhibitors on the primary outcome (CV death or hospitalization for HF) in subjects with T2D vs subjects without T2D, or in subjects > 65 years vs. subjects ≤ 65 years of age. The Cochrane Collaboration Risk-of-Bias tool was used for quality assessment of the RCTs, including sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting. Risk of bias was graded as unclear, high, or low.

### Cardiovascular protection with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes: does it apply to all patients? [^115uVTWd]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

TABLE 3
Key subgroup analyses of primary endpoints in cardiovascular outcomes trials with sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitors 11, 32, 33, 42, 61

A further subgroup analysis of EMPA‐REG OUTCOME investigated the treatment effect on hHF when patients were stratified by 5‐year risk of HF at baseline as 'low‐to‐average risk' (5‐year HF occurrence < 10%), 'high risk' (10%‐20%) and 'very high risk' (> 20%). 43 This analysis showed that empagliflozin consistently reduced hHF in patients across baseline HF risk. The HR for hHF was 0.65 in the total population, 0.59 in patients without prior HF, and 0.75 in patients with a history of HF; no heterogeneity was observed with regards to CV death or all‐cause mortality. 43 A meta‐analysis of seven trials with empagliflozin, including EMPA‐REG OUTCOME, showed that the CV benefit of this SGLT2 inhibitor seen in the high‐risk population may be extended to those at lower CV risk, although many of the phase 3 trials included in the analysis were not designed to study CV outcomes. 64 Patients in this meta‐analysis were considered to be at low‐to‐medium risk, with MACE occurring at a rate of 4.6‐28.7 per 1000 patient‐years, compared with 43.9 per 1000 patient‐years in EMPA‐REG OUTCOME; reductions in MACE were reported in these low‐risk patients (3P‐MACE HR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.73, 0.96; 4P‐MACE HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.76, 0.98).

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular outcomes in adults with type 2 diabetes: a Bayesian meta-analysis and meta-regression [^112RR1jB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines recommend the use of SGLT‐2 inhibitors in adults with established CVD or at high cardiovascular risk. This recommendation is in part informed by meta‐analyses noting that the benefit of SGLT‐2 inhibitors for cardiovascular outcomes was limited to this patient subgroup. For instance, in the meta‐analysis by Zelniker et al,3 cardiovascular outcome trials were pooled to derive summary estimates for several outcomes, stratified by established CVD. Of note, in adults without established CVD, SGLT‐2 inhibitors did not decrease the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events. Our study is the most comprehensive analysis to date, including 10 cardiovascular and renal outcome trials. In contrast to prior analyses, we estimated the effects of individual drugs, while carefully examining whether treatment effects were associated with the control group event rates as a combined proxy measure for the underlying percentage of patients with established CVD, their disease severity, and other comorbidities. With this approach, we found positive to strong evidence that empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin reduced the incidence of all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality. In contrast, there was little evidence for ertugliflozin or sotagliflozin for reducing mortality outcomes.

There was no association between treatment effects and the control group event rate for all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality, resulting in negligible differences in the predicted treatment effect for a primary and secondary prevention population. The implications of these findings are 2‐fold. First, given the comparable relative treatment effect across baseline risk, SGLT‐2 inhibitors warrant consideration as the preferred second‐line treatment for primary prevention of CVD in adults with T2DM and a baseline risk comparable to participants in the cardiovascular outcome trials. This finding may inform future iterations of guidelines in identifying adults in whom the use of SGLT‐2 inhibitors should be preferred. Second, given a similar relative treatment effect across baseline risk, adults at the highest absolute risk of all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality will derive a greater absolute benefit from SGLT‐2 inhibitors. The potential for a large absolute benefit of SGLT‐2 inhibitors in adults with established CVD lends support to the existing European Society of Cardiology guidelines, which recommend SGLT‐2 inhibitors as the first‐line treatment for the secondary prevention of CVD.

Type 2 diabetes renal outcomes with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors — efficacy — show that in CREDENCE, patients randomized to canagliflozin 100 mg had a 30% relative risk reduction in the primary composite endpoint with HR 0.70 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.82) versus placebo, and similar benefits were seen in CANVAS (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.77), DECLARE-TIMI 58 (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.66), and EMPA REG OUTCOME (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.75).

### Cardiorenal disease management in type 2 diabetes: an expert consensus [^116NCJFc]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aim

The interplay between cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) is well established. We aim at providing an evidence-based expert opinion regarding the prevention and treatment of both heart failure (HF) and renal complications in people with T2D.

Method

ology: The consensus recommendations were developed by subject experts in endocrinology, cardiology, and nephrology. The criteria for consensus were set to statements with ≥ 80% of agreement among clinicians specialized in endocrinology, cardiology, and nephrology. Key expert opinions were formulated based on scientific evidence and clinical judgment.

Results

Assessing the risk factors of CVD or CKD in people with diabetes and taking measures to prevent HF or kidney disease are essential. Known CVD or CKD among people with diabetes confers a very high risk for recurrent CVD. Metformin plus lifestyle modification should be the first-line therapy (unless contraindicated) for the management of T2D. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists can be preferred in people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or with high-risk indicators, along with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), whereas SGLT2i are the first choice in HF and CKD. The GLP-1 agonists can be used in people with CKD if SGLT2i are not tolerated.

Conclusion

Current evidence suggests SGLT2i as preferred agents among people with T2D and HF, and for those with T2D and ASCVD. SGLT2i and GLP-1RA also lower CV outcomes in those with diabetes and ASCVD, and the treatment choice should depend on the patient profile.

Empagliflozin — cardiovascular outcomes in EMPA-REG OUTCOME — produced a 14% relative risk reduction in 3-point MACE versus placebo (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.99), with a 32% reduction in all-cause mortality (HR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.57 to 0.82) driven predominantly by a 38% reduction in CV death (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.77). Effects on fatal or nonfatal MI were more modest (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.70 to 1.09) and there was no significant difference for fatal or nonfatal stroke (HR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.89 to 1.56). Hospitalization for heart failure was reduced by 35% (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.50 to 0.85), and empagliflozin is specifically approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to reduce the risk of CV death in adults with T2D and established CV disease.

The American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes have briefly updated their 2018 recommendations on management of hyperglycemia, based on important research findings from large cardiovascular outcomes trials published in 2019. Important changes include: 1) the decision to treat high-risk individuals with a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), hospitalization for heart failure (hHF), cardiovascular death, or chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression should be considered independently of baseline HbA 1c or individualized HbA 1c target; 2) GLP-1 receptor agonists can also be considered in patients with type 2 diabetes without established cardiovascular disease (CVD) but with the presence of specific indicators of high risk; and 3) SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended in patients with type 2 diabetes and heart failure, particularly those with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, to reduce hHF, MACE, and CVD death, as well as in patients with type 2 diabetes with CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate 30 to ≤ 60 mL min -1 [1.73 m] -2 or urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 30 mg/g, particularly > 300 mg/g) to prevent the progression of CKD, hHF, MACE, and cardiovascular death.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) cardiovascular risk reduction — SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists have been demonstrated to significantly reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and SGLT2 inhibitors also substantially diminish the risks of heart failure (HF) hospitalization and progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Although the exact mechanisms of cardiovascular and renal benefits remain uncertain and appear to exceed direct glucose-lowering effects, data proving that SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs improve outcomes in patients with T2D and cardiovascular disease have triggered a paradigm shift beyond glucose control toward comprehensive cardiovascular risk reduction.

Dapagliflozin — DECLARE–TIMI 58 trial scope — was the largest SGLT2 inhibitor trial to date, enrolled a population in which more than half did not have established ASCVD and the overwhelming majority had normal kidney function with no significant albuminuria, and used two primary endpoints: MACE and the composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure.

Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk reduction — initiation and titration of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) should follow trial-tested dosing. SGLT2 inhibitors with CV benefit should be initiated at the lowest dose tested in CV and renal outcomes trials (e.g., 100 mg for canagliflozin, 10 mg for dapagliflozin, 10 mg for empagliflozin), and no further dose titration is needed for CV or renal risk reduction. Among GLP-1RAs, dulaglutide, liraglutide, or injectable semaglutide have demonstrated CV benefit to reduce the risk of MACE, and a GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit should be initiated at the lowest dose and up-titrated stepwise to the doses used in the trials or the otherwise maximal tolerated dose. Prior to initiating T2D therapies aimed at CV disease risk reduction, a detailed patient-clinician risk discussion is recommended, including risks, benefits, drug-drug interactions, safety, patient preferences, and cost considerations.

Glucose-centric algorithm for glycemic control (persons without established or high ASCVD/HF/stroke/TIA/CKD risk) — initial therapy and escalation: Metformin should be initiated if there is no contraindication (eg, eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) and started at a low dose titrated over a few weeks to the maximally tolerated dose. Given T2D progression, many will need a second antihyperglycemic medication to reach targets, which usually occurs within 3 months. Agents such as GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i are associated with low risk of hypoglycemia unless combined with insulin or sulfonylureas. Patients often present with > 1 treatment-shaping factor; in those with overweight/obesity and a weight-loss goal, oral GLP-1 RA, GLP-1 RA, or SGLT2i are preferred options. For cost/access constraints, a TZD, SU, or glinide would be more economical. Patients with symptomatic hyperglycemia and/or an A1C > 10% should start basal insulin; basal can be initiated with or without a GLP-1 RA, and some may need simultaneous bolus insulin.

Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk reduction — initiation of sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA): We recommend initiating a patient-clinician discussion about SGLT2 inhibitor and/or GLP-1RA therapy at a follow-up visit for patients with T2D who have or who are at very high risk for clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure (HF), and/or diabetic kidney disease (DKD). An SGLT2 inhibitor with demonstrated cardiovascular (CV) benefit is recommended for patients with T2D and HF, especially heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), or who are at high risk of developing HF, DKD, clinically evident ASCVD, or combinations of these. A GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit is recommended for patients with established or at very high risk for ASCVD. Patients with T2D may become eligible for these therapies if they are subsequently hospitalized or diagnosed with ASCVD, HF, and/or DKD, although hospitalized patients were not included in most CV outcome trials and inpatient formularies may not include these agents. Outpatient adherence after an acute CV event can be favorably influenced by initiation at discharge. CV specialists should consider periodic screening for T2D by measuring HbA1c at guideline-recommended intervals (e.g., annually in patients with prediabetes). Patients with ASCVD or at high risk of ASCVD and/or HF should consider initiation of an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit irrespective of HbA1c levels. Although canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin have differences in FDA-approved CV indications, they appear to have broadly similar CV and renal benefits, and the choice of an individual agent should be made after appropriate patient-clinician discussion of benefits and potential risks.

SGLT2 inhibitors with demonstrated cardiovascular (CV) benefit — indications — are specified by agent. Canagliflozin indications are to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) as an adjunct to diet and exercise, reduce the risk of MI, stroke, or CV death in adults with T2D and CV disease, and reduce the risk of end-stage kidney disease, doubling of serum creatinine, CV death, and hospitalization for heart failure (HF) in patients with T2D and diabetic nephropathy with albuminuria. Dapagliflozin indications are to improve glycemic control in adults with T2D as an adjunct to diet and exercise, reduce the risk of hospitalization for HF in adults with T2D and established CV disease or multiple CV risk factors, and reduce the risk of CV death and hospitalization for HF in adults with HFrEF. Empagliflozin indications are to improve glycemic control in adults with T2D as an adjunct to diet and exercise and reduce risk of CV death in adults with T2D and established CV disease.

Clinically important improvements in cardiovascular risk factors and adverse cardiovascular, heart failure and renal outcomes have been observed in numerous cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) investigating the use of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors over the last 5 years. However, differences in study outcomes between the various SGLT2 inhibitor CVOTs are often challenging to interpret because of differences in the study design, participant characteristics and primary outcomes of the various trials. In clinical practice, this frequently challenges the clinician when choosing between the different SGLT2 inhibitors for a patient with type 2 diabetes and various cardiovascular or renal comorbidities. Discussion around the choice of SGLT2 inhibitor has been again revived by the recent publication of results from the VERTIS-CV, EMPEROR-reduced and DAPA-CKD trials investigating cardiovascular, heart failure and renal outcomes associated with various SGLT2 inhibitors. This narrative review gives an overview of the mechanism of action and differences in the underlying pharmacology of the various SGLT2 inhibitors and discusses the key cardiovascular, heart failure and renal outcomes from completed CVOTs for SGLT2 inhibitors. Discussion highlights important differences in the study design and participant characteristics which limit the comparison of trials and medications within this drug class.

RWE as a complement to CVOTs

SGLT2 inhibitor CVOTs such as EMPA-REG OUTCOME have yielded impressive results, with HHF reductions across the class and CV death outcomes with empagliflozin carrying sufficient weight to influence major international diabetology and cardiology guidelines. New recommendations guided by CVOTs include an early consideration of CV risk and preference for an agent with proven CV benefit as a first-add on to metformin in an atherosclerotic CVD setting (preferring empagliflozin or liraglutide) or an SGLT2 inhibitor as a first add-on to metformin in a HF setting (Fig. 1). However, numerous gaps in our knowledge of CV outcomes in T2D remain, and we believe that RWE studies can have a role here, by complementing CVOTs with supporting evidence where data generation in a RCT would not be feasible. It is welcome that several completed and ongoing studies are now providing such opportunities to complement CVOTs with RWE on SGLT2 inhibitors.

In patients with T2D and CV risk factors, an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 RA is recommended as an early add-on to metformin.

Abstract

Objective

To evaluate sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes at varying cardiovascular and renal risk.

Design

Network meta-analysis.

Data sources

Medline, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL up to 11 August 2020.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies

Randomised controlled trials comparing SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists with placebo, standard care, or other glucose lowering treatment in adults with type 2 diabetes with follow up of 24 weeks or longer. Studies were screened independently by two reviewers for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias.

Main outcome measures

Frequentist random effects network meta-analysis was carried out and GRADE (grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation) used to assess evidence certainty. Results included estimated absolute effects of treatment per 1000 patients treated for five years for patients at very low risk (no cardiovascular risk factors), low risk (three or more cardiovascular risk factors), moderate risk (cardiovascular disease), high risk (chronic kidney disease), and very high risk (cardiovascular disease and kidney disease). A guideline panel provided oversight of the systematic review.

Results

764 trials including 421 346 patients proved eligible. All results refer to the addition of SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists to existing diabetes treatment. Both classes of drugs lowered all cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and kidney failure (high certainty evidence). Notable differences were found between the two agents: SGLT-2 inhibitors reduced admission to hospital for heart failure more than GLP-1 receptor agonists, and GLP-1 receptor agonists reduced non-fatal stroke more than SGLT-2 inhibitors (which appeared to have no effect). SGLT-2 inhibitors caused genital infection (high certainty), whereas GLP-1 receptor agonists might cause severe gastrointestinal events (low certainty). Low certainty evidence suggested that SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists might lower body weight. Little or no evidence was found for the effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists on limb amputation, blindness, eye disease, neuropathic pain, or health related quality of life. The absolute benefits of these drugs vary substantially across patients from low to very high risk of cardiovascular and renal outcomes (eg, SGLT-2 inhibitors resulted in 3 to 40 fewer deaths in 1000 patients over five years; see interactive decision support tool for all outcomes.

Conclusions

In patients with type 2 diabetes, SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists reduced cardiovascular and renal outcomes, with some differences in benefits and harms. Absolute benefits are determined by individual risk profiles of patients, with clear implications for clinical practice, as reflected in the BMJ Rapid Recommendations directly informed by this systematic review.

Summary and Practical Considerations

Recent evidence from CVOTs and real-world studies provides robust support for the initiation of SGLT2i medication in people with T2DM and who either have established CVD or are at risk of developing CVD, and HF in particular, or at risk of renal decline and progression into CKD. It has been demonstrated that SGLT2i treatment in T2DM is efficacious in reducing HbA1c and is well tolerated. In addition, SGLT2i treatment has secondary benefits in terms of weight loss and lowering BP and has minimal risk of increased incidence of hypoglycaemia.

In selecting efficacious treatment for people with T2DM and risk of CVD, the ADA/EASD consensus statement notes that both SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA interventions may be appropriate, and recommend determining the existence of established CVD, or the probable risk of developing CVD or CKD. In people with T2DM and established ASCVD, either a GLP-1 RA or SGLT2 inhibitor, with demonstrated efficacy in improving CV outcomes, can be selected, post metformin. Where the risk of developing CKD or HF is the HCP's main concern, the initiation of SGLT2i therapy is recommended. If SGLT2i treatment is not tolerated or not appropriate (the patient has an eGFR outside of the licensed range, for example), then a GLP-1 RA with demonstrated CV outcome benefit should be used.

Here, the Improving Diabetes Steering Committee provides practical advice on the use of SGLT2i treatment in four major groups of people with T2DM: people with established CVD, people at high risk for developing CVD, people at lower risk of developing CVD and frail people. Level of evidence was graded according to ADA standards (Table 1). A simple 'traffic light' approach to clinical considerations in these populations is provided in Table 2.

### Managing cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes: what Do the cardiovascular outcome trials mean for Australian practice? [^115ps7po]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Understanding the implications of cardiovascular (CV) outcomes data of glucose-lowering agents on the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus can be challenging for many primary practitioners. Amongst different classes of diabetes medications assessed for CV safety, several agents within the sodium-glucose transport protein-2 inhibitor and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists classes have demonstrated CV risk reduction. Applying the trial findings to patients typically seen in clinical practice, such as those with established CV disease and those with multiple CV risk factors without established CV disease, requires further clarity. To bridge this gap in our current knowledge, the aim of this review was to utilise expert-driven opinions on common case scenarios and practical recommendations on the most appropriate choice of agents, according to an individual patient's clinical risk profile (CV and kidney disease), treatment preference and reimbursement environment from an Australian perspective.

### 2020 expert consensus decision pathway on novel therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^112xRKQX]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Unresolved questions for sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) — key uncertainties and cautions include: Several important clinical questions regarding the use of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs remain unanswered, including what are the benefits and risks of using both classes of medications simultaneously, as current guidelines do suggest the use of both classes of medications in some patient groups, but whether combination therapy leads to further improvements in outcome is unknown. It is also uncertain whether an SGLT2 inhibitor or a GLP-1RA should be the initial therapy in drug-naïve patients with T2D and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and what is the role for these medications in patients who do not have diabetic kidney disease (DKD) or established ASCVD but are at high risk, although we and others recommend their use in patients with a high burden of risk factors for CV disease. Finally, prioritization and sequencing among novel therapies are highlighted, and the writing committee emphasizes the importance of these drugs to CV specialists on the basis of their effects on CV risk reduction rather than a direct effect through glucose lowering; however, increased vigilance to avoid hypoglycemia in patients with HbA1c near or below target levels at SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA initiation is warranted, especially if the patient's existing T2D therapies include sulfonylureas, glinides, or insulin.

### Prescribing paradigm shift? Applying the 2019 European Society of Cardiology-led guidelines on diabetes, prediabetes, and cardiovascular disease to assess eligibility for sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists as first-line monotherapy (or add-on to metformin monotherapy) in type 2 diabetes in scotland [^112D9wDL]. Diabetes Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

In 2019, the European Society of Cardiology led and released new guidelines for diabetes cardiovascular risk management, reflecting recent evidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) reduction with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) and some glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) in type 2 diabetes (T2D). A key recommendation is that all those with T2D who are (antihyperglycemic) drug naïve or on metformin monotherapy should be CVD risk stratified and an SGLT-2i or a GLP-1RA initiated in all those at high or very high risk, irrespective of glycated hemoglobin. We assessed the impact of these guidelines in Scotland were they introduced as is.

Research Design and Methods

Using a nationwide diabetes register in Scotland, we did a cross-sectional analysis, using variables in our register for risk stratification at 1 January 2019. We were conservative in our definitions, assuming the absence of a risk factor where data were not available. The risk classifications were applied to people who were drug naïve or on metformin monotherapy and the anticipated prescribing change calculated.

Results

Of the 265,774 people with T2D in Scotland, 53,194 (20.0% of those with T2D) were drug naïve, and 56,906 (21.4%) were on metformin monotherapy. Of these, 74.5% and 72.4%, respectively, were estimated as at least high risk given the guideline risk definitions.

Conclusions

Thus, 80,830 (30.4%) of all those with T2D (n = 265,774) would start one of these drug classes according to table 7 and figure 3 of the guideline. The sizeable impact on drug budgets, enhanced clinical monitoring, and the trade-off with reduced CVD-related health care costs will need careful consideration.

### Pharmacological treatment for type 2 diabetes integrating findings from cardiovascular outcome trials: an expert consensus in the UK [^114ALJGY]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In people with Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Thus, as well as controlling glucose, reducing the risk of cardiovascular events is a key goal. The results of cardiovascular outcome trials have led to updates for many national and international guidelines. England, Wales and Northern Ireland remain exceptions, with the most recent update to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines published in 2015. We reviewed current national and international guidelines and recommendations on the management of people with Type 2 diabetes. This article shares our consensus on clinical recommendations for the use of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) in people with Type 2 diabetes and established or at very high risk of cardiovascular disease in the UK. We also consider cost-effectiveness for these therapies. We recommend considering each person's cardiovascular risk and using diabetes therapies with proven cardiovascular benefits when appropriate to improve long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness.

Chronic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes — sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are prioritized based on kidney and cardiovascular benefits: SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended for people with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m² and type 2 diabetes to slow chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and reduce heart failure risk independent of glucose management, while GLP-1 RAs are suggested for cardiovascular risk reduction if such risk is predominant. Selection of glucose-lowering medications should also consider an individual's cardiovascular and kidney risks, effects on weight, adverse effects, preferences, and cost, and both SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs have shown cardiovascular and kidney protection.

### Guideline recommendations and the positioning of newer drugs in type 2 diabetes care [^113ayVRd]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

Cardiovascular outcome trials in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk have led to remarkable advances in our understanding of the effectiveness of GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce cardiorenal events. In 2019, the American Diabetes Association (ADA), European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) published updated recommendations for the management of such patients. We are concerned that ongoing discussions focusing on the differences between the endocrinologists' consensus report from the ADA and EASD and cardiologists' guidelines from the ESC are contributing to clinical inertia, thereby effectively denying evidence-based treatments advocated by both groups to patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiorenal disease. A subset of members from the writing groups of the ADA-EASD consensus report and the ESC guidelines was convened to emphasise where commonalities exist and to propose an integrated framework that encompasses the views incorporated in management approaches proposed by the ESC and the ADA and EASD. Coordinated action is required to ensure that people with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease are treated appropriately with an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist. In our opinion, this course should be initiated independent of background therapy, current glycaemic control, or individualised treatment goals.

*Other options are thiazolidinediones, DPP-4 inhibitors if not on GLP RA, basal insulin, sulfonylureas

† Based on the flowchart of treatment of patients with T2D in the ADA 2022 guidelines, "first-line therapy depends on comorbidities, patient-centred treatment factors, including cost and access considerations, and management needs and generally includes metformin and comprehensive lifestyle modification", and treatment choices are subsequently shown on the flowchart according to the presence/absence of ASCVD, indicators of high risk, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease

The purpose of this review is to provide an expert summary that will help clinicians navigate the overwhelming wealth of CVOT data. We discuss how CVOTs can provide valuable insights for management in clinical practice, and consider remaining gaps in knowledge, as well as how diabetes CVOTs have led to further cardiorenal-focussed studies that seek to understand more about how some GLDs may improve outcomes for our patients.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^114BWcSj]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

The management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is becoming increasingly complex. Sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) are the newest antidiabetic agents for T2DM. By targeting the kidney, they have a unique mechanism of action, which results in enhanced glucosuria, osmotic diuresis and natriuresis, thereby improving glucose control with a limited risk of hypoglycaemia and exerting additional positive effects such as weight loss and the lowering of blood pressure. Several outcome studies with canagliflozin, dapagliflozin or empagliflozin reported a statistically significant reduction in major cardiovascular events, hospitalization for heart failure and progression to advanced renal disease in patients with T2DM who have established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, several cardiovascular risk factors, albuminuric mild to moderate chronic kidney disease or heart failure. Current guidelines proposed a new paradigm in the management of T2DM, with a preferential place for SGLT2is, after metformin, in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure and progressive kidney disease. Ongoing trials might extend the therapeutic potential of SGLT2is in patients with, but also without, T2DM. This Review provides an update of the current knowledge on SGLT2is, moving from their use as glucose-lowering medications to their new positioning as cardiovascular and renal protective agents.

### Cardiovascular protection with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes: does it apply to all patients? [^112zRrW6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Cardiovascular risk in these patients should be considered as a continuum, and comprehensive treatment strategies should aim to target multiple disease risk factors. Large-scale clinical trials of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have shown an impact on cardiovascular outcomes, including heart failure hospitalization and cardiovascular death, which appears to be independent of their glucose-lowering efficacy. Reductions in major cardiovascular events appear to be greatest in patients with established CVD, particularly those with prior myocardial infarction, but are independent of heart failure or renal risk. Most large-scale trials of SGLT2 inhibitors predominantly include patients with T2D with pre-existing CVD and high cardiovascular risk at baseline, limiting their applicability to patients typically observed in clinical practice. Real-world evidence from observational studies suggests that there might also be beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on heart failure hospitalization and all-cause mortality in various cohorts of lower risk patients. The most common adverse events reported in clinical and observational studies are genital infections; however, the overall risk of these events appears to be low and easily managed. Similar safety profiles have been reported for elderly and younger patients. There is still some debate regarding the safety of canagliflozin in patients at high risk of fracture and amputation. Outstanding questions include specific patterns of cardiovascular protection according to baseline risk.

### Glucose-lowering pharmacotherapies in Chinese adults with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease. An expert consensus reported by the Chinese diabetes society and the Chinese society of endocrinology [^115A46AG]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), which are important causes of disabling and death in patients with T2DM. For the prevention and management of ASCVD or CKD, cardiovascular risk factors should be systematically evaluated, and ASCVD and CKD should be screened in patients with T2DM. In this consensus, we recommended that metformin should be used as the first-line therapy for patients with T2DM and ASCVD or very high cardiovascular risk, heart failure (HF) or CKD, and should be retained in the treatment regimen unless contraindicated or not tolerated. In patients with T2DM and established ASCVD or very high cardiovascular risk, addition of a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) or sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor with proven cardiovascular benefits should be considered independent of individualised glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1C) targets. In patients with T2DM and HF, an SGLT2 inhibitor should be preferably added regardless of HbA 1C levels. In patients with T2DM and CKD, SGLT2 inhibitors should be preferred for the combination therapy independent of individualised HbA 1C targets, and GLP-1RAs with proven renal benefits would be alternative if SGLT2 inhibitors are contraindicated. Moreover, the prevention of hypoglycaemia and management of multiple risk factors by comprehensive regimen, including lifestyle intervention, antihypertensive therapies, lipid-lowering treatment and antiplatelet therapies, should be kept in mind in treating patients with T2DM and ASCVD, HF or CKD.

### Practical guide to prescribing sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors for cardiologists [^1151z6DZ]. JACC: Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a class of glucose-lowering therapies that have been shown to reduce risks of heart failure (HF) events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) at high-risk for or with cardiovascular disease. The United States Food and Drug Administration has expanded the regulatory label for empagliflozin and canagliflozin for use to lower cardiovascular risk in patients with T2DM and cardiovascular disease. SGLT2 inhibitors are being actively studied in the treatment of patients with HF, including in those without diabetes mellitus. Despite the accumulating data supporting this class of therapies in HF prevention, cardiologists infrequently prescribe SGLT2 inhibitors, potentially due to lack of familiarity with their use. We provide an up-to-date practical guide highlighting important elements for treatment initiation, dosing, anticipated adverse effects, and barriers to uptake.

5.1 Current guidelines for the use of SGLT‐2 inhibitors

The European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)/American College of Endocrinology (ACE), the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and Diabetes Canada guidelines recommend SGLT‐2 inhibitors at any stage of T2DM as a combination therapy with other glucose‐lowering therapies. 59, 60, 61, 62 The guidelines also recommend SGLT‐2 inhibitors as an acceptable alternative to metformin as initial therapy when metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated. Similar recommendations have been made in clinical practice guidelines for T2DM in Asian countries. 63, 64, 65 In 2019, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standard of Care provided a treatment algorithm based on the presence of established CVD or chronic kidney disease (CKD). 66 In patients with predominant atherosclerotic CVD, GLP‐1 analogues or SGLT‐2 inhibitors are recommended as add‐on therapy to metformin. In patients with predominant HF or CKD, an SGLT‐2 inhibitor is the recommended therapy after metformin. 66

The 2016 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for CVD prevention recommend that SGLT‐2 inhibitors should be considered early on in the clinical course to reduce all‐cause and CV death in patients with T2DM and CVD (Class IIa recommendation). 67 The 2016 ESC guidelines for the management of chronic HF recommend that empagliflozin should be considered in patients with T2DM to prevent or delay the onset of HF and to prolong survival (Class IIa recommendation). 68 It should be noted that these guidelines require an update following the availability of evidence from the CANVAS and DECLARE‐TIMI 58 trials. The more recent Canadian practice guidelines recommend the addition of SGLT‐2 inhibitors to reduce the risk of major CV events, HF hospitalization, and progression of nephropathy in patients with T2DM. 69, 70, 71

### GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2-is to lower glucose and reduce the risk of cardiovascular and diabetic kidney disease [^117RjMBF]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The landscape of diabetes management has changed, such that the goal of pharmacotherapy extends beyond glucose-lowering to prioritize risk reduction of cardiovascular disease and diabetic kidney disease. Two newer classes of medications, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2-Is), have become first line therapies for many patients with type 2 diabetes to reduce cardiovascular and renal complications of type 2 diabetes. This review article will describe the mechanism of action, evidence for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, contraindications, adverse effects, and risk mitigation strategies for the GLP-1 RA and SGLT2-I drug classes. In addition, we will provide a practical approach for primary care clinicians to prescribe, adjust, and combine these medication classes, while considering patient preference, tolerability, comorbidities, cost, and availability.

2 COMPLEXITY AND DIVERGENCE OF GUIDELINES MAY REPRESENT A BARRIER TO THE INITIATION OF‐2 INHIBITORS BY CLINICIANS

Several inconsistencies lie within the current clinical guidelines for second‐line therapy in T2D. The 2019 ADA/EASD consensus report recommends SGLT‐2 inhibitors or glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1 RAs) for: patients with CKD; those with established — or at high risk of developing — atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; or heart failure. For individuals without these conditions, five non‐insulin second‐line therapy options are listed, without a suggested hierarchy of use. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology 2019 consensus statement suggests that SGLT‐2 inhibitors and GLP‐1 RAs may be preferred as first‐line therapy in patients with recent‐onset T2D. Despite the shown cardioprotective benefits of GLP‐1 RAs and SGLT‐2 inhibitors, overall usage in UK clinical practice remains low in adults with T2D and slightly lower in those with pre‐existing CVD history, based on data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Four oral treatment options (sulphonylureas, thiazolidinediones, SGLT‐2 inhibitors, or dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 [DPP‐4] inhibitors) are recommended by the American College of Physicians.

Guidelines on when to initiate SGLT‐2 inhibitors may benefit from further clarity. The ADA guidelines suggest that SGLT‐2 inhibitors and GLP‐1 RAs should be considered for patients with T2D and CKD who require another agent in conjunction with metformin to target HbA1c levels or those who cannot tolerate or use metformin. The lowering of HbA1c associated with SGLT‐2 inhibitors has been shown to be limited in patients with T2D with an eGFR of less than 45 ml/min/1.73 m². However, emerging evidence from clinical trials suggests that SGLT‐2 inhibitors have a cardioprotective and renal protective role not associated with glucose lowering in patients with an eGFR as low as 25‐30 ml/min/1.73 m². Indeed, the cardiorenal benefits of SGLT‐2 inhibitors are consistent across the eGFR range, including stage 4 CKD. A reduction in heart failure hospitalization has also been observed across the different albuminuria subgroups in the CANVAS Program.

Discussions and implication of pathway — type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk reduction states that sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have been shown to directly improve cardiovascular (CV) outcomes, with randomized trials proving reductions in acute myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and CV death in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D); SGLT2 inhibitors also have heart failure (HF) and renal benefits that appear independent of HbA1c, even in patients without T2D. CV specialists "now need to incorporate these agents", and this ECDP provides a practical guide for initiation and monitoring that "should be used in concert with established risk factor modification guidelines" (including lipids, blood pressure, and antiplatelet therapy) and "applied in the context of guideline-directed diabetes care". The document "should complement, rather than supersede, good clinical judgement", emphasizes that achieving goals "requires a team-based approach", and notes that, if used appropriately, these therapies "should significantly reduce CV morbidity and mortality", while also stating that evidence is still emerging and algorithms may change as new data appear, with the overarching goal of improved CV outcomes remaining consistent.

### Newer pharmacologic treatments in adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^1131v4e9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this clinical guideline to update recommendations on newer pharmacologic treatments of type 2 diabetes. This clinical guideline is based on the best available evidence for effectiveness, comparative benefits and harms, consideration of patients' values and preferences, and costs.

Methods

This clinical guideline is based on a systematic review of the effectiveness and harms of newer pharmacologic treatments of type 2 diabetes, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, a GLP-1 agonist and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide agonist, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, and long-acting insulins, used either as monotherapy or in combination with other medications. The Clinical Guidelines Committee prioritized the following outcomes, which were evaluated using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach: all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for congestive heart failure, progression of chronic kidney disease, serious adverse events, and severe hypoglycemia. Weight loss, as measured by percentage of participants who achieved at least 10% total body weight loss, was a prioritized outcome, but data were insufficient for network meta-analysis and were not rated with GRADE.

Audience and Patient Population

The audience for this clinical guideline is physicians and other clinicians. The population is nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes.

Recommendation 1

ACP recommends adding a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor or glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist to metformin and lifestyle modifications in adults with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control (strong recommendation; high-certainty evidence).
- Use an SGLT-2 inhibitor to reduce the risk for all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events, progression of chronic kidney disease, and hospitalization due to congestive heart failure.
- Use a GLP-1 agonist to reduce the risk for all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events, and stroke.

Recommendation 2

ACP recommends against adding a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor to metformin and lifestyle modifications in adults with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control to reduce morbidity and all-cause mortality (strong recommendation; high-certainty evidence).

SGLT2i Positioning in Current Society Guidelines

As a result of the favorable results observed in the CVOTs and real-world studies, major national and international professional societies have updated their recommendations and guidelines to prioritize the use of SGLT2i, regardless of glucose control considerations, in patients with T2D with or at high risk for CV and kidney complications (Table 3). Current American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines state that first-line therapy depends on comorbidities, patient-centered treatment factors, and management needs and generally includes metformin and comprehensive lifestyle modification. Medications such as SGLT2i or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) are the recommended initial therapy for individuals with T2D with or at high risk for atherosclerotic CVD, HF (only SGLT2i), and/or CKD (preferably SGLT2i in those with CKD and albuminuria), independently of metformin use and baseline or target HbA1c levels. By contrast, the European Society of Cardiology/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (ESC/EASD) guidelines recommend the use of SGLT2i or GLP-1 RA in all patients with T2D with established or high/very high risk for CVD, either in monotherapy for treatment-naïve patients or added to the background treatment, regardless of other considerations such as the status of the glycemic control. For patients with atherosclerotic CVD, HF, and/or CKD, the Diabetes Canada Guidelines prioritize the use of agents with demonstrated CV or renal benefits (SGLT2i or GLP-1 RA), combined or not with metformin according to glycemic control and clinical status. The Primary Care Diabetes Europe categorizes patients with T2D into different risk groups based on individual factors such as atherosclerotic CVD, HF, CKD, and obesity, and recommend that SGLT2i should be prioritized over GLP-1RA for patients with HF or CKD.

The most recent American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines recommend GLP-1 RAs or SGLT2is with proven CV benefits for people with T2D with either established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or indicators of high risk of ASCVD, established kidney disease or heart failure (Fig. 6). Established ASCVD is defined as prior myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, unstable angina with electrocardiogram changes, myocardial ischaemia on imaging or stress test, or revascularisation of coronary, carotid or peripheral arteries. Indicators of high ASCVD risk are defined as aged ≥ 55 years with coronary, carotid or lower extremity artery stenosis > 50%, left ventricular hypertrophy, estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or albuminuria. The ADA/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) 2019 consensus report recommended that the decision to use a GLP-1 RA or SGLT2i to treat individuals with high risk of major adverse CV events, hospitalisation for heart failure, CV death or chronic kidney disease should be independent of baseline HbA 1c or individual HbA 1c target. GLP-1 RA therapies are also preferred to insulin in people with T2D who need further glucose lowering than can be obtained with oral agents.

Introduction

Diabetes affects half a billion people worldwide and accounted for 1.5 million deaths in 2016. Glucose lowering is a mainstay of treatment. In people with type 2 diabetes and higher risks of cardiovascular disease, several large scale randomised controlled trials have investigated sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and reported reductions in cardiovascular mortality and non-fatal cardiovascular complications with both classes of drug. The mortality reductions have not, however, proved consistent across trials, leaving clinicians and patients uncertain of the magnitude of benefits.

Recommendations released in 2019 by the American Diabetes Association include using SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists in the management of diabetes for people with cardiovascular disease or kidney disease who have not reached their glycaemic target goals. European Society of Cardiology guidelines in 2019 recommended SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists in people with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease or a high risk of cardiovascular disease. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance, updated in 2019, suggested a stepped approach to intensification of treatment with diabetes drugs, considering metformin as the first treatment with additions of dual and triple treatment from several drug classes, including SGLT-2 inhibitors.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors — evidence summary in T2D shows that SGLT2 inhibitors have emerged as important new oral therapies for patients with T2D, and Large, randomized controlled trials in patients with T2D have demonstrated that many of these agents reduce MACE in patients with established ASCVD and/or DKD, and reduce the risk of HF hospitalizations. The benefit of reducing HF hospitalizations reflected primarily prevention of symptomatic HF in T2D patients at high risk, as ~90% did not have HF at baseline. The benefits of an SGLT2 inhibitor in treating established HF were demonstrated in the DAPA-HF trial, in which dapagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of CV death or worsening HF, and improved HF-related symptoms in ~4,800 patients with HFrEF.

When considering the impact of treatment across a spectrum of risk profiles, it is important to remember that, given a consistent relative risk reduction, patients at low risk will experience a lower absolute risk reduction in events compared with those at high risk. 26, 27, 28 Number needed to treat (NNT) calculations provide an intuitive measure of the absolute risk reduction associated with treatment. However, to understand whether treatment impacts patients at low and high risk of events to a similar degree, irrespective of differences in baseline event rates, the relative risk rather than the absolute risk should be discussed. In addition, caution is required when discussing subgroup analyses, as trials are typically powered only to detect differences in the primary outcomes across the entire patient population. In the absence of specific trials powered to detect such differences in subpopulations, hypothesized subgroup effects can be assessed using proposed criteria to understand the strength of the existing evidence. 29 Definitive assessment of treatment effects in population subgroups would potentially require an individual patient meta‐analysis of the relevant trials.

This paper reviews the available evidence for the CV effects (including CV death, MI, hospitalization for heart failure [hHF] and stroke) of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T2D, at all levels of CV risk.

Methods

The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

We performed a systematic review and meta‐analysis of randomized, placebo‐controlled, event‐driven, cardiovascular or renal outcome trials of SGLT2 inhibitors that reported on cardiovascular outcomes and serious adverse events (SAEs). This review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses statement. 18

Search Strategy, Study Selection, and Data Extraction

Medline via Ovid (from 1946 to February 2019) and EMBASE via Ovid (from 1980 to February 2019) were searched systematically for relevant trials (Table S1 and Figure S1). The search had no language restriction and used subject headings relevant to SGLT2 inhibition, T2DM, CVD, and randomized control trial design. In addition, reference lists from included trials, review articles, and other relevant reports were manually scanned to identify other potentially relevant data.

Our primary aim was to assess the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiovascular outcomes; thus, we only included event‐driven, randomized, placebo‐controlled cardiovascular or renal outcome trials that reported independently adjudicated cardiovascular outcomes as primary or secondary end points. The titles and abstracts of all identified articles were extracted and screened for an initial assessment of eligibility. Full‐text versions of potentially eligible studies were reviewed to reach a final decision on inclusion or exclusion. We excluded studies in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus and those not conducted in humans. Duplicate reports, trials that involved compound agents (eg, SGLT2 inhibitors in combination with metformin), trials that did not compare with placebo, and trials that did not report on efficacy outcomes of interest (cardiovascular, death, or the specified safety outcomes) were considered ineligible. Data were extracted into an electronic spreadsheet with a specific focus on the collection of information about treatment effects in patient subgroups defined by the presence or absence of CVD at baseline, the presence or absence of reduced kidney function at baseline (defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] > 60 or < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m²), and the presence or absence of HF at baseline. In DECLARE (Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events)‐TIMI 58 Trial, cardiovascular outcomes were reported for eGFR < 60, 60 to 90, and > 90 mL/min per 1.73 m² separately, with the upper 2 categories pooled to determine the hazard ratio (HR) in those with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2.

### New perspectives in management of cardiovascular risk among people with diabetes [^115bxTv3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Following the publication of results from multiple landmark cardiovascular outcome trials of antihyperglycemic medications over the past 8years, there has been a major shift in the focus of care for people with type 2 diabetes, from control of hyperglycemia to managing cardiovascular risk. Multiple international cardiology and diabetes society guidelines and recommendations now endorse sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like protein-1 receptor agonists as first-line therapies to mitigate cardiovascular risk. The most recent publication is the 2023 European Society of Cardiology guideline on the management of cardiovascular disease in those with type 2 diabetes that, for the first time, recommends use of both classes of medications for the mitigation of cardiovascular risk for those with or at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. Here, we review the evidence behind contemporary society guidelines and recommendations for the management of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular risk.

### Guidelines for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 Diabetes: JACC guideline comparison [^113v27pd]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. These high-risk patients benefit from aggressive risk factor management, with blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol treatment, glycemic control, kidney protection, and lifestyle intervention. There are several recommendation and guideline documents across cardiology, endocrinology, nephrology, and general medicine professional societies from the United States and Europe with recommendations for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although there are some noteworthy differences, particularly in risk stratification, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and blood pressure treatment targets, and the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, overall there is considerable alignment across recommendations from different professional societies.

### Effectiveness of glucose-lowering medications on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes at moderate cardiovascular risk [^112SdqQA]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2024). High credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death among people with type 2 diabetes 1–5, most of whom are at moderate CVD risk 6, yet there is limited evidence on the preferred choice of glucose-lowering medication for CVD risk reduction in this population. Here, we report the results of a retrospective cohort study where data for US adults with type 2 diabetes and moderate risk for CVD are used to compare the risks of experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event with initiation of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA; n = 44,188), sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i; n = 47,094), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i; n = 84,315) and sulfonylureas (n = 210,679). Compared to DPP4i, GLP-1RA (hazard ratio (HR) 0.87; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82–0.93) and SGLT2i (HR 0.85; 95% CI 0.81–0.90) were associated with a lower risk of a major adverse cardiovascular event, whereas sulfonylureas were associated with a higher risk (HR 1.19; 95% CI 1.16–1.22). Thus, GLP-1RA and SGLT2i may be the preferred glucose-lowering agents for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients at moderate baseline risk for CVD. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT05214573.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes and acute kidney disease… [^11197wRY]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Question Do sodium-glucose cotransport protein 2 inhibitors have beneficial associations with mortality, major kidney events, and major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes and acute kidney disease. Findings In this cohort study of 230 366 patients, SGLT-2i use among those with type 2 diabetes and AKD was associated with significantly lower risks of mortality, MAKEs, and MACEs compared with nonuse. We conducted a subgroup analysis based on various comorbidities, including hypertension and advanced CKD, as well as medication use. The results suggest that the use of SGLT-2is was associated with a reduced risk of mortality, regardless of whether insulin or renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers or diuretics were used. In addition, a significantly lower risk of mortality was observed in the SGLT-2i users who did not have hypertension, had advanced CKD (eg, AOR for eGFR ≤ 45 mL. The association between SGLT-2i use and a lower risk of MAKEs was observed consistently among patients with advanced CKD and among those who used RAAS blockers or diuretics. However, this association was more pronounced in the patients without hypertension and those who were not receiving insulin or other OHAs. Similarly, the association between a lower risk of MACEs and the use of SGLT-2i was observed consistently among patients with hypertension and those using RAAS blockers, and in particular among patients with advanced CKD and those who were not receiving insulin or other OHAs or diuretics. glomerular feedback system and ameliorating metabolic dysfunction that may delay the development of diabetic kidney disease. 14, 34 The natriuretic, glycosuric, and osmotic diuretic effects of SGLT-2is have been shown to reduce cardiac preload and systemic congestion, consequently resulting in a cardioprotective effect.

35, 36 Our study provides evidence for the effectiveness of SGLT-2is in reducing the risk of redialysis and end-stage kidney disease, as well as decreasing cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes and AKD.

Treatment recommendations in relation to CV benefits and reduced all-cause mortality

In light of the significant benefits of certain SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs in reducing the risks of CV death and all-cause death in patients with T2D, major international guidelines have been updated to include evidence from CVOTs to help differentiate between the use of GLDs. The American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), and the Europe Society of Cardiology (ESC) and EASD guidelines all recommend specific treatments for patients with T2D and atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) based on CVOT data (Table 2). The general consensus between the guidelines is that patients diagnosed with T2D and CVD should be treated with an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 RA with proven CVD benefit, either as first add-on to metformin or as monotherapy. The ESC guidelines specifically recommend use of empagliflozin in patients with T2D and CVD to reduce the risk of death, while empagliflozin, canagliflozin, or dapagliflozin are recommended in patients with T2D and CVD, or at very high/high CV risk, to reduce CV events. Regarding choice of GLP-1 RA, the ESC and ACC guidelines recommend the use of dulaglutide, liraglutide or injectable semaglutide for patients with T2D and CVD, based on their CV benefits.

SGLT2 inhibitor use to manage ASCVD, HF, and DKD risk in type 2 diabetes follows this algorithm: Patient is ≥ 18 years old with T2D and ≥ 1 of the following: ASCVD, HF, DKD, or at high risk for ASCVD. If the patient is pregnant or breast feeding, do not start an SGLT2 inhibitor (no safety data available). If the patient's eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m², do not start an SGLT2 inhibitor. If not, consider starting an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven ASCVD, HF, or DKD benefit; after a discussion incorporating patient-clinician preferences and priorities, if the patient wishes to initiate an SGLT2 inhibitor, initiate an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven ASCVD, HF, or DKD benefit. Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, or empagliflozin is appropriate. No dose titration is required. Adjust other antihyperglycemic therapies if necessary. Monitor response to therapy and consider further therapies for CV risk reduction, as indicated. This may include the addition of a GLP-1RA in the appropriate patient.

### SGLT2 inhibitors in T2D and associated comorbidities-differentiating within the class [^116rqUhw]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

For patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single most common cause of mortality. In 2008 and 2012, the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) respectively mandated cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) on all new anti-diabetic agents, as prospective trials statistically powered to rule out excess cardiovascular risk in patients with T2D. Unexpectedly, some of these CVOTs have demonstrated not only cardiovascular safety, but also cardioprotective effects, as was first shown for the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin in EMPA-REG OUTCOME.

Expert Opinion

To debate newly available CVOT data and to put them into context, we convened as a group of medical experts from the Central and Eastern European Region. Here we describe our discussions, focusing on the conclusions we can draw from EMPA-REG OUTCOME and other SGLT2 inhibitor CVOTs, including when considered alongside real-world evidence.

Conclusion

CVOTs investigating SGLT2 inhibitors have suggested benefits beyond glucose lowering that have been confirmed in real-world evidence studies.

### Association of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors with cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2… [^112FrVdg]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

This meta-analysis of 10 high-quality randomized clinical trials found that use of SGLT2-Is was associated with lower occurrence of cardiovascular death or HHF by 33% in high-risk patients. For the primary outcome of HHF or cardiovascular death, the study showed equal benefit of SGLT2-Is in both sexes; lower risk in participants who were younger than 65 years compared with those 65 years or older; and greater risk reduction in participants who were Asian, Black, or of other races or ethnicities compared with White participants. Meaning These findings suggest that SGLT2-Is may be associated with an overall cardiovascular benefit for patients with high-risk cardiovascular features compared with placebo in both sexes, different age groups and different races and ethnicities. Importance The cardiovascular outcome in selected populations when sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors are emerging as standard therapy is not clearly understood.

It is important to learn the magnitude of cardiovascular benefit using SGLT2-Is across the select subgroups that include both sexes and multiple age and racial and ethnic groups. SGLT2-I use was associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular death or HHF by 33%, with a number needed to treat of 5. 7 at P <. 001, and there was a 2. 44% decreased event rate in the SGLT2-I group compared with the placebo group. Our study found that SGLT2-I use was associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular death or HHF by 33%, with a number needed to treat of 5. 7 at P <.
001. This result was significant when HHF admissions and cardiovascular death were analyzed independently as well. There was a 2. 44% decreased event rate in the SGLT2-I group compared with the placebo group. The all-cause mortality outcome was collected and evaluated from all trials. The combined result suggests a clear benefit associated with SGLT2-Is compared with placebo.

This finding suggests that there may be an overall benefit of SGLT2-Is for patients and vouches for the safety of the medication. Our meta-analysis evaluated a wide spectrum of efficacy outcomes, further characterizing the primary outcome in different subgroups from several well-designed large clinical trials. It supports that SGLT2-Is have emerged as an effective class of drugs for improving cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, including the prevention of HHF and reducing all-cause mortality in selected patients.

Conclusions

Our meta‐analysis provides robust reassurance regarding the cardiovascular and long‐term noncardiovascular safety of SGLT2 inhibitors, with sustained efficacy in reducing a range of markers of vascular risk. SGLT2 inhibitors showed remarkable cardiovascular and renal protective benefits and might be considered as preferred for type 2 DM patients with established or high risk for CVD.

Study quality was judged for each included trial, according to evidence of the proper conduct of randomization, concealment of treatment allocation, similarity of treatment groups at baseline, the provision of a description of the eligibility criteria, completeness of follow‐up, and use of intention‐to‐treat analysis using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 19 (Table S2).

Review of trials for eligibility, data extraction, and quality assessment was conducted independently by 2 authors (C. A. and A.K.) using a standardized approach. Any disagreement was settled by consultation with a third author (B.N.).

Outcomes

The efficacy outcomes studied were as follows: (1) major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) comprising cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke; (2) cardiovascular death; (3) fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction; (4) fatal or nonfatal stroke; (5) hospitalization for HF; (6) the composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for HF; and (7) all‐cause mortality. The safety outcomes studied were as follows: total SAEs, severe hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, amputation, and bone fracture. For each outcome, we sought to identify for each trial HRs and 95% CIs describing the effects of SGLT2 inhibition in the overall population and each patient subset of interest. If HRs were not available, we used in order of preference rate ratios or risk ratios to maximize the use of trial‐level data from included studies.

### Cardiorenal and other diabetes related outcomes with SGLT-2 inhibitors compared to GLP-1 receptor agonists in type 2 diabetes: nationwide observational study [^114oeWXX]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Major prospective randomized clinical safety trials have demonstrated beneficial effects of treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) and sodium–glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) in people with type 2 diabetes and elevated cardiovascular risk. Recent clinical treatment guidelines therefore promote early use of these classes of pharmacological agents, particularly in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD), heart failure (HF), chronic kidney disease (CHD), or with multiple risk factors. These trials have all been based on placebo-controlled in design, included many participants, variable exposure time, and high statistical power. Epidemiological studies in wider populations in clinical practice have shown results supporting the above recommendations. Meta-analyses have generally supported cardiorenal benefits for SGLT-2i whereas GLP-1RA seem to lessen atherothrombotic outcomes more consistently.

The 2018 American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensus report stated that patients with type 2 diabetes and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) should use GLP-1RA or SGLT-2i as part of glycaemic management. Due to important research findings from recent large CVOT's, the recommendations were updated 2019. The updated version of the consensus report declares that in high-risk individuals with type 2 diabetes, the decision to treat with a GLP-1RA or SGLT-2i should be considered independently of baseline HbA1c, as the cardiovascular benefits of these drugs are independent of HbA1c. The updated version also provides some guidance to which of the drug classes to choose depending on present risk factors. GLP-1RA is recommended in patients with type 2 diabetes and established ASCVD where major cardiovascular events (MACE) are considered the greatest threat, and in patients with indicators of high risk without established CVD, to reduce the risk of MACE. SGLT-2i on the other hand, are recommended in patients with type 2 diabetes and HF to reduce HF, MACE and CV death. SGLT-2i are also recommended in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, to prevent progression of CKD, HF, MACE and CV death.

### Diagnosis and treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults: a review [^1158avd1]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Type 2 diabetes involves progressive loss of insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells in the setting of insulin resistance and manifests clinically as hyperglycemia. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90% to 95% of all cases of diabetes globally, with estimates ranging from 589 million to 828 million people worldwide. In the US, type 2 diabetes affects approximately 1 in 6 adults.

Observations

Risk factors for type 2 diabetes include older age, family history, overweight or obesity, physical inactivity, gestational diabetes, Hispanic ethnicity, and American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, or Black race. Diabetes is diagnosed if fasting plasma glucose is greater than or equal to 126 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1C is greater than or equal to 6.5%, or 2-hour glucose during 75-g oral glucose tolerance testing is greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL. Approximately one-third of adults with type 2 diabetes have cardiovascular disease and 10.1% have severe vision difficulty or blindness. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is 39.2% among patients with kidney failure. Although weight management is an important component of treatment for type 2 diabetes, no specific diet has been proven to be most effective for improving health outcomes. Physical activity can reduce hemoglobin A1C by 0.4% to 1.0% and improve cardiovascular risk factors (ie, hypertension and dyslipidemia). Randomized clinical trials have reported absolute reductions in microvascular disease (3.5%), such as retinopathy and nephropathy, myocardial infarction (3.3%-6.2%), and mortality (2.7%-4.9%), with intensive glucose-lowering strategies (hemoglobin A1C < 7%) vs conventional treatment 2 decades after trial completion. First-line medications for type 2 diabetes include metformin and, in patients with cardiovascular or kidney comorbidities or at high cardiovascular risk, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is). Common add-on medications include dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1RAs, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones. Approximately one-third of patients with type 2 diabetes require treatment with insulin during their lifetime. Several randomized clinical trials have demonstrated benefits of specific SGLT2i and GLP-1RA medications compared with placebo for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (12%-26% risk reduction), heart failure (18%-25% risk reduction), and kidney disease (24%-39% risk reduction) over 2 to 5 years. Most trial participants with type 2 diabetes were taking metformin. High-potency GLP-1RA and dual GIP/GLP-1RA medications result in weight loss of greater than 5% in most individuals with type 2 diabetes, and weight loss may exceed 10%.

Conclusions

Type 2 diabetes affects up to 14% of the global population and is associated with preventable long-term complications, such as cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, vision loss, and increased mortality. In addition to lifestyle modifications including diet, exercise, and weight management, metformin is generally first-line therapy for attainment of hemoglobin A1C targets. For individuals with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular or kidney disease or at high cardiovascular risk, guidelines recommend early treatment with SGLT2i and/or GLP-1RA medications.

### SGLT2 inhibitors: cardiovascular benefits beyond HbA1c-translating evidence into practice [^111eCwD5]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

How is this Evolving Evidence-Base Being Reflected in Practical Guidelines?

A role for SGLT2i treatments in the management of T2DM is acknowledged in the current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines on T2DM management. However, triple therapy option in these guidelines is limited to use with metformin and a sulfonylurea. Current NICE guidelines do not yet offer advice on selection of T2DM treatment according to CVD risk. Recent Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guidelines recommend considering the evidence base for initiation of an SGLT2i or GLP-1 receptor agonist for patients with existing CVD, but do not offer advice on the specific selection of these drugs.

The American Diabetes Association (ADA)/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) panel has issued a consensus statement on the use of anti-diabetic medicines when considering outcomes beyond glycaemic control alone (ASCVD, HF, CKD, weight management and control of hypoglycaemia; Fig. 6). This consensus represents a welcome advance in personalising T2DM management. However, the Improving Diabetes Steering Committee recognises that the ADA/EASD position statement has limitations in that it may be difficult for clinicians to decide which disease category has priority. For example, in a patient with both HF and ASCVD, it is difficult to assess whether an SGLT2i or a GLP-1 RA should be prescribed, especially with an absence of supportive evidence, in which case options should be discussed with people with T2DM and a decision made on an individual basis. The Committee suggests that in the period before NICE guidelines are updated to reflect the CVD and HF considerations of treatment selection, wider implementation of the ADA/EASD consensus would be of value in improving outcomes.

Local guidelines may not always reflect emerging data; moreover, they need considerable resource allocation to be updated, and updates are even more challenging in rapidly evolving treatment areas. It would therefore be valuable to have broader and more accessible advice for the use of SGLT2i treatments in people with T2DM at risk of CVD. This Improving Diabetes Steering Committee consensus paper aims to offer practical advice to HCPs in the selection of treatment as an add-on to metformin and seeks to facilitate personalisation of medicine for people with T2DM and at risk of developing CVD.

### Association of SGLT2 inhibitors with cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis [^115Jyy7d]. JAMA Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors favorably affect cardiovascular (CV) and kidney outcomes; however, the consistency of outcomes across the class remains uncertain.

Objective

To perform meta-analyses that assess the CV and kidney outcomes of all 4 available SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Data Sources

A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed from January 1, 2015, to January 31, 2020.

Study Selection

One hundred forty-five records were initially identified; 137 were excluded because of study design or topic of interest. As a result, a total of 6 randomized, placebo-controlled CV and kidney outcomes trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes were identified, with contributory data from 9 publications. All analyses were conducted on the total patient population of these trials.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Standardized data search and abstraction were performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Statement. Data were analyzed using a fixed-effect model.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Outcomes included time to the first event of (1) the composite of major adverse CV events of myocardial infarction, stroke, or CV death, and each component, (2) the composite of hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) or CV death (HHF/CV death) and each component, and (3) kidney composite outcomes. For outcomes in the overall trial populations and in selected subgroups, hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were pooled and meta-analyzed across trials.

Results

Data from 6 trials comprised 46 969 unique patients with type 2 diabetes, including 31 116 (66.2%) with atherosclerotic CV disease. The mean (SD) age of all trial participants was 63.7 (7.9) years; 30 939 (65.9%) were men, and 36 849 (78.5%) were White. The median number of participants per trial was 8246 (range, 4401–17 160). Overall, SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a reduced risk of major adverse CV events (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.85–0.95; Q statistic, P = 0.27), HHF/CV death (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.73–0.84; Q statistic, P = 0.09), and kidney outcomes (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.56–0.70; Q statistic, P = 0.09), with no significant heterogeneity of associations with outcome. Associated risk reduction for HHF was consistent across the trials (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.61–0.76; I2 = 0.0%), whereas significant heterogeneity of associations with outcome was observed for CV death (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78–0.93; Q statistic, P = 0.02; I2 = 64.3%). The presence or absence of atherosclerotic CV disease did not modify the association with outcomes for major adverse CV events (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.84–0.95 and HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.83–1.07, respectively; p = 0.63 for interaction), with similar absence of associations with outcome modification by prevalent atherosclerotic CV disease for HHF/CV death (P = 0.62 for interaction), HHF (P = 0.26 for interaction), or kidney outcomes (P = 0.73 for interaction).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this meta-analysis, SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a reduced risk of major adverse CV events; in addition, results suggest significant heterogeneity in associations with CV death. The largest benefit across the class was for an associated reduction in risk for HHF and kidney outcomes, with benefits for HHF risk being the most consistent observation across the trials.

Prior trials have demonstrated CV safety of 3 dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors but have included limited numbers of patients with high CV risk and chronic kidney disease. Primary outcome was time to first occurrence of the composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Criteria for noninferiority of linagliptin vs placebo was defined by the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the hazard ratio of linagliptin relative to placebo being less than 1.
3. Secondary outcome was time to first occurrence of adjudicated death due to renal failure, ESRD, or sustained 40% or higher decrease in eGFR from baseline.

Conclusions and Relevance Among adults with type 2 diabetes and high CV and renal risk, linagliptin added to usual care compared with placebo added to usual care resulted in a noninferior risk of a composite CV outcome over a median 2. 2 years. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT01897532. One concern has been the within-class heterogeneity observed for risk of hospitalization for heart failure, ranging from no effect of sitagliptin10 to increased risk with saxagliptin. 8 Previous CV outcome trials evaluating glucose-lowering medications for type 2 diabetes enrolled limited numbers of patients with concomitant chronic kidney disease, a group of patients with very high CV risk.
2. Adults with type 2 diabetes, hemoglobin A1c values of
6. 5% to 10. 0% inclusive, and high CV and renal risk were eligible for inclusion. glomerular filtration rate of 45 to 75 mL/min/1.73 m² and UACR higher than 200 mg/g or equivalent or eGFR of 15 to 45 mL/min/1.

73 m2 regardless of UACR. Participants with end-stage renal disease, defined as an eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m² or requiring maintenance dialysis, were excluded. Full eligibility criteria are provided in Supplement 1.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^116dUpym]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

American Association of Clinical Endocrinology 2023 type 2 diabetes — cardiovascular risk therapy selection states that GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) lower major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in meta-analysis (hazard ratio [HR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80–0.93, P < .001), while sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) reduce hospitalization for heart failure (HF) and cardiovascular death, including a 32% reduction in HF hospitalization (HR 0.68 [95% CI 0.61–0.76]) and a 15% reduction in CV death (HR 0.85 [95% CI 0.78–0.93]) versus placebo. For persons with T2D and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or at high risk, a GLP-1 RA with cardiovascular benefit should be initiated as first-line therapy independent of A1C goal or other antihyperglycemic treatments, and as an alternative clinicians may recommend an SGLT2i with proven cardiovascular benefit to reduce MACE or CV death in persons with T2D and established ASCVD. SGLT2is should be recommended in persons with T2D and HF regardless of A1C goal or other antihyperglycemic treatments, and they have been shown to improve HF-related symptoms irrespective of left ventricular ejection fraction and background therapies. High-risk trial features included "albuminuria or proteinuria, HTN and LV hypertrophy, LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction, and/or ABI < 0.9". DPP-4 inhibitors show neutrality for MACE, but saxagliptin increased HF hospitalizations and caution is advised with alogliptin in New York Heart Association Class III or IV CHF. Thiazolidinediones can worsen fluid retention and should not be used in symptomatic HF, and initiation of pioglitazone is contraindicated in New York Heart Association Class III or Class IV CHF.

SGLT2 inhibitors with CV benefit — initiation and renal dose modifications — should be initiated at the lowest dose tested in CV and renal outcomes trials, and no further dose titration is needed for CV or renal risk reduction. For canagliflozin, dose modifications are: eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2: max dose 100 mg daily; and eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2: use is not recommended for glycemic control. For dapagliflozin, eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2: use is not recommended for glycemic control; and eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2: use is contraindicated. For empagliflozin, eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2: use is not recommended.

The American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes convened a panel to update the prior position statements, published in 2012 and 2015, on the management of type 2 diabetes in adults. A systematic evaluation of the literature since 2014 informed new recommendations. These include additional focus on lifestyle management and diabetes self-management education and support. For those with obesity, efforts targeting weight loss, including lifestyle, medication, and surgical interventions, are recommended. With regards to medication management, for patients with clinical cardiovascular disease, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with proven cardiovascular benefit is recommended. For patients with chronic kidney disease or clinical heart failure and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven benefit is recommended. GLP-1 receptor agonists are generally recommended as the first injectable medication.

10 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

With the increasing prevalence of T2DM and heightened risk of CVD in Asia, SGLT‐2 inhibitors represent a novel, key therapeutic agent for clinicians in the management of patients with diabetes who have established CVD or who are at high risk of CV disease. Given their consistent benefits in the primary prevention of HF hospitalization and secondary prevention of CVD, SGLT‐2 inhibitors should be considered early on in the treatment algorithm for patients with multiple risk factors or for those with established CVD. Based on the available evidence on SGLT‐2 inhibitors in the Asian population, results from CVOTs as well as clinical experience, a series of clinical recommendations has been developed for the use of SGLT‐2 inhibitors in this population (Table 4). The ongoing mechanistic studies and other outcomes trials in patients with HF and CKD will eventually define the cardiorenal protective role of SGLT‐2 inhibitors above and beyond glucose lowering.

Introduction

Recent studies of drugs in the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT-2i) classes provided evidence of glycemic efficacy and safety, along with strong evidence of benefits for cardiovascular outcomes and improved outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF) or renal disease. Key SGLT-2i cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) showed that treatment with this drug class reduced major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) by up to 20% and reduced the incidence of hospitalization for HF by up to 39%. Key GLP-1 RA CVOTs showed that treatment with this drug class reduced MACE by up to 26%. Significant benefits of these drug classes on renal outcomes, obesity, and minimizing hypoglycemia were also observed in numerous clinical trials.

These studies prompted changes in the type 2 diabetes treatment guidelines from major diabetes associations, such as The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD). Together, these organizations released a consensus report in December 2018, which identified targeted clinical groups of interest where GLP-1 RA and SLGT-2i were the preferred agents for treatment. These clinical groups included patients with high risk or history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), history of HF, a need to minimize hypoglycemia, and/or a need to minimize weight gain or to promote weight loss. These recommendations were later adopted by the official guidelines.

Evaluating RTUR in the year of publication of the guideline allows an assessment of the cumulative adoption in prior years and provides a baseline for future evaluations of guideline alignment. The guideline is based on accumulating data that may have driven adoption prior to the actual publication. The current data likely reflect primarily this early adoption rather than guideline-driven changes in the pattern of treatment. Knowledge about the degree of guideline alignment can motivate efforts to improve it. Furthermore, evaluating factors associated with treatment choices can help guide interventions to improve guideline alignment. Therefore, we set out to provide a description of the use rates and the factors associated with utilization (or not) of guideline-aligned therapy in real-world data derived from Commercial- and Medicare-supported practices.

Based on these recommendations, we retrospectively investigated the medication use patterns in real-world patients with type 2 diabetes in the US. Data were drawn from a large health insurance claims database, evaluating medication utilization patterns and alignment with these clinical groupings.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibition for the reduction of cardiovascular events in high-risk patients with diabetes mellitus [^117NVEvh]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) exhibit an increased risk for cardiovascular (CV) events. Hyperglycaemia itself contributes to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and heart failure (HF) in these patients, but glucose-lowering strategies studied to date have had little to no impact on reducing CV risk, especially in patients with a long duration of T2D and prevalent CV disease (CVD). Sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a novel class of anti-hyperglycaemic medications that increase urinary glucose excretion, thus improving glycaemic control independent of insulin. The recently published CV outcome trial, EMPA-REG OUTCOME, demonstrated in 7020 patients with T2D and prevalent CVD that the SGLT2-inhibitor empagliflozin significantly reduced the combined CV endpoint of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke vs. placebo in a population of patients with T2D and prevalent atherosclerotic CVD. In addition and quite unexpectedly, empagliflozin significantly and robustly reduced the individual endpoints of CV death, overall mortality, and hospitalization for HF in this high-risk population. Various factors beyond glucose control such as weight loss, blood pressure lowering and sodium depletion, renal haemodynamic effects, effects on myocardial energetics, and/or neurohormonal effects, among others may contribute to these beneficial effects of SGLT2-inhibition. The present review summarizes known and postulated effects of SGLT2-inhibition on the CV system and discusses the role of SGLT2-inhibition for the treatment of high-risk patients with T2D and CVD.

1 INTRODUCTION

During their preapproval development and testing, studies of drugs in the sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) and glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist (GLP‐1 RA) classes provided evidence of glycaemic efficacy and safety, followed by robust evidence of benefits for cardiovascular outcomes and improved outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF) or renal disease. These data prompted changes in the type 2 diabetes (T2D) treatment guidelines from major diabetes associations worldwide. For example, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) released a consensus report in 2018, subsequently adopted in the official guidelines, which identified targeted groups of interest where SGLT2is and GLP‐1 RAs were preferred agents and where sulphonylureas (SUs) were no longer preferred. These groups included patients with a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), a history of HF, a need to minimize hypoglycaemia, and/or a need to minimize weight gain or to promote weight loss. Recommendations for hypoglycaemia considerations also include dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitors and thiazolidinediones. Based on these recommendations, the medication utilization was retrospectively investigated in the real world among patients with T2D. Data were drawn from a large health insurance claims database evaluating medication utilization patterns and alignment with these clinical groupings.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a global pandemic, with an estimated 370 million people currently affected. 1, 2 It is a major risk factor for both cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), with CVD the leading cause of death in people with T2DM. 3 Sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a class of glucose‐lowering agent whose mechanism of action involves blockade of SGLT2 cotransporters on the luminal surface of the proximal renal tubule. The resultant increase in glycosuria and natriuresis contributes to a broad range of metabolic benefits, 4 including reduction in glycosylated hemoglobin, body weight, blood pressure, and albuminuria. 5

Large randomized control trials of SGLT2 inhibition in T2DM 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 have shown a clear reduction in CVD events among individuals with established atherosclerotic CVD. 12, 13 There remains, however, significant uncertainty about the potential benefits of SGLT2 inhibition in those without established CVD, with recent reviews suggesting this is an area of uncertainty that needs further evaluation and clarification. 14 North American guidelines currently recommend the use of SGLT2 inhibitors as second‐line therapy after metformin, specifically in those with established atherosclerotic CVD. 15, 16

The comparative effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with and without reduced kidney function are also yet to be fully elucidated, with concerns that the renal mechanism of action might lead to attenuated efficacy in this population. The recent publication of the CREDENCE (The Canagliflozin and Renal Endpoints in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation) trial, which reports on cardiovascular, renal, and safety outcomes in patients with CKD and high vascular risk, enables this subgroup to be examined in greater detail. 10 In addition, people with concomitant T2DM and heart failure (HF) have a 10‐fold increase in mortality compared with those with T2DM without HF, 17 and the comparative effects of SGLT2 inhibition in these individuals are of great interest.

The aim of this systematic review and meta‐analysis was to define the cardiovascular benefits and the effects on key safety outcomes of SGLT2 inhibition, overall and separately among participants with and without established CVD, reduced kidney function, or HF.

Methods

This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses guidelines and was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; CRD42018115077). Institutional review board approval was not required for this study. The data that support the findings of this study are publicly available but can also be made available from the corresponding author on request. We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to July 2020 (Data S1). We included RCTs of SGLT‐2 inhibitors compared with placebo to prevent CVD in adults with T2DM. All studies were required to have at least 24 weeks of randomized treatment and follow‐up and at least one event in either control or intervention group.

Data Extraction

Ten reviewers working independently and in duplicate reviewed titles, abstracts, full texts, and trial registries to assess studies for their inclusion and to extract data. The prespecified primary outcome of our analysis was all‐cause mortality, and the key secondary outcome was cardiovascular mortality, as these outcomes are considered to be of greatest importance to patients. Additional outcomes of interest were fatal or nonfatal stroke, fatal or nonfatal acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and hospitalization for heart failure (HHF). We did not extract results for major adverse cardiovascular events, defined as the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke, as the importance of individual components of this composite and possibly the direction of treatment effects could vary within and between agents. The combination of these individual end points in a composite outcome could dilute or entirely miss specific differences between agents. We did not extract results for chronic kidney disease or adverse events (Data S1).

### SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists for adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical practice guideline [^112VEpub]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists when added to usual care (lifestyle interventions and/or other diabetes drugs) in adults with type 2 diabetes at different risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes?

Current Practice

Clinical decisions about treatment of type 2 diabetes have been led by glycaemic control for decades. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are traditionally used in people with elevated glucose level after metformin treatment. This has changed through trials demonstrating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) benefits independent of medications' glucose-lowering potential.

Recommendations

The guideline panel issued risk-stratified recommendations concerning the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists in adults with type 2 diabetes• Three or fewer cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation against starting SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists.• More than three cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak against starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD and CKD: Strong recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak recommendation for starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• For those committed to further reducing their risk for CVD and CKD outcomes: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors rather than GLP-1 receptor agonists.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists created these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel applied an individual patient perspective.

The Evidence

A linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (764 randomised trials included 421346 participants) of benefits and harms found that SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists generally reduce overall death, and incidence of myocardial infarctions, and end-stage kidney disease or kidney failure (moderate to high certainty evidence). These medications exert different effects on stroke, hospitalisations for heart failure, and key adverse events in different subgroups. Absolute effects of benefit varied widely based on patients' individual risk (for example, from five fewer deaths in the lowest risk to 48 fewer deaths in the highest risk, for 1000 patients treated over five years). A prognosis review identified 14 eligible risk prediction models, one of which (RECODe) informed most baseline risk estimates in evidence summaries to underpin the risk-stratified recommendations. Concerning patients' values and preferences, the recommendations were supported by evidence from a systematic review of published literature, a patient focus group study, a practical issues summary, and a guideline panel survey.

Understanding The Recommendation

We stratified the recommendations by the levels of risk for CVD and CKD and systematically considered the balance of benefits, harms, other considerations, and practical issues for each risk group. The strong recommendation for SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with CVD and CKD reflects what the panel considered to be a clear benefit. For all other adults with type 2 diabetes, the weak recommendations reflect what the panel considered to be a finer balance between benefits, harms, and burdens of treatment options. Clinicians using the guideline can identify their patient's individual risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes using credible risk calculators such as RECODe. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids may support well informed treatment choices, including shared decision making.

Concomitant use of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs — evidence summary: To date, no trials have studied the CV outcome effects of concomitant use of both an SGLT2 inhibitor and a GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit. DURATION-8 (Phase 3 28-Week Study With 24-Week and 52-Week Extension Phases to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Exenatide Once Weekly and Dapagliflozin Versus Exenatide and Dapagliflozin Matching Placebo) demonstrated greater reductions in blood pressure and body weight in patients randomly allocated to the combination of dapagliflozin and exenatide than to either agent alone. Combination therapy with both an SGLT2 inhibitor and a GLP-1RA for glycemic management also accords with current T2D management guidelines, and in randomized, placebo-controlled trials, dulaglutide, liraglutide, and semaglutide have shown an additive glucose-lowering benefit over placebo.
