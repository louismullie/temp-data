## Question

can I give oral antibiotics for UTI in less than two months of age

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether oral antibiotics can be used to treat urinary tract infection (UTI) in infants less than 2 months old, and under what circumstances that would be safe and effective. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the age-based risk profile and why neonates and young infants are treated differently. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines say about route of therapy in this exact age group. Next, I will examine the direct and indirect evidence for oral therapy, including any neonatal data and the strength of that evidence. After that, I need to check for any exceptions where oral therapy might be acceptable even in this age group. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-focused recommendation and outline monitoring and follow-up considerations, including when to image and how to transition if oral therapy is eventually used.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk profile. Infants under 2 months have immature immune systems, unreliable oral absorption, and a higher risk of bacteremia and occult serious bacterial infection, which is why many guidelines default to initial intravenous therapy and inpatient observation in this group, especially when ill-appearing or unstable [^22ac25a0] [^4ad382e6].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline stance before drawing conclusions. The AAP 2021 guideline for well-appearing febrile infants 8–60 days explicitly supports home management with oral antibiotics for UTI only when strict criteria are met, but it does not extend that recommendation to neonates under 28 days, reflecting the lack of evidence and higher risk in the youngest infants [^f1cc664b] [^2afdb1e5]. Similarly, contemporary pediatric infectious disease guidance recommends initial IV therapy for neonates and infants under 2 months due to suboptimal enteral absorption, immune immaturity, and the risk of bacteremia, and it cautions that evidence for oral therapy alone in this exact age group is sparse and insufficient to make a strong recommendation [^22ac25a0] [^18e24522].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should review the direct evidence for oral therapy in this exact population. The best available data are small, retrospective series and cohorts in infants ≤ 90 days, including some ≤ 28 days, that suggest short IV courses with early switch to oral therapy can be safe in selected, clinically improving infants, but these are observational and not randomized, so the certainty is low and cannot overturn guideline conservatism for neonates [^fab4b7c8] [^c07518de] [^6bdf74a2]. I should double-check: none of these studies are RCTs in neonates, and most exclude meningitis or do not address it, which is a critical limitation when considering oral-only therapy in the first month of life [^fab4b7c8] [^c07518de].

> Let me consider the indirect evidence. In older infants and children, multiple RCTs and meta-analyses show oral therapy is as effective as IV for pyelonephritis and febrile UTI, and that early IV-to-oral switch is safe once clinically improving, but these data cannot be directly extrapolated to neonates because of age-specific pharmacokinetics, absorption, and pathogen risk profiles [^3acd3848] [^8875d9e6] [^2e391f2e]. I should confirm: the AAP 2–24 month guideline explicitly supports oral or parenteral as equally efficacious in that older infant group, which is not the same as endorsing oral-only therapy in neonates [^996fc75a] [^1cf32f4d].

> But wait, what if the infant is well-appearing, older than 28 days, and has reliable caregivers and close follow-up? Could oral therapy still be reasonable as initial treatment? The AAP allows home oral therapy for 29–60 day olds who meet strict safety criteria, including positive urine culture, negative blood and CSF cultures, and clinical improvement, which implies that oral therapy is acceptable after initial stabilization and exclusion of concomitant invasive infection, not as universal initial therapy in all under-2-month infants [^f1cc664b] [^2afdb1e5]. I should emphasize: this is not a blanket endorsement for neonates under 28 days, where evidence remains insufficient and guideline consensus favors IV initiation [^22ac25a0].

> I need to ensure I address the meningitis risk. In the neonatal period, the risk of concomitant meningitis with UTI is about 1%, and typical UTI antibiotics have poor CNS penetration, so many clinicians obtain CSF in ill-appearing or bacteremic neonates and maintain a low threshold for initial IV therapy until CSF is cleared and the infant is clinically stable [^4ad382e6]. This is another reason oral-only therapy is not standard in the first month of life, even though some retrospective series report low failure with short IV courses when meningitis is excluded [^c07518de].

> Next, I should review practical management if oral therapy is contemplated after initial IV stabilization. If the infant is 29–60 days, clinically well, tolerating feeds, has a positive urine culture with negative blood and CSF cultures, and is improving, then switching to oral therapy with close follow-up is supported by AAP guidance and can shorten hospitalization without increasing failures in observational cohorts [^f1cc664b] [^6bdf74a2]. For total duration, most pediatric guidance supports 7–14 days total therapy, with many centers using 10–14 days in young infants, and early switch after 2–3 days of IV therapy if improving is reasonable in non-bacteremic cases [^aa79cd55] [^f35e2009].

> I should confirm imaging considerations. Renal and bladder ultrasound is generally recommended after a first febrile UTI in young infants to detect congenital anomalies, and this should not be delayed unnecessarily if it will change management or follow-up planning, though exact timing can be individualized once the infant is stabilized [^dc6e3b21]. Hold on, I should verify: while some centers defer imaging until after acute treatment, most contemporary guidance supports ultrasound during or shortly after treatment to inform recurrence risk and follow-up strategy [^dc6e3b21].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and make sure I'm aligned with the evidence hierarchy. For neonates under 28 days, the balance of evidence and guidelines favors initial IV therapy with hospital observation, given immune immaturity, absorption concerns, and the risk of concomitant bacteremia or meningitis; oral-only therapy should not be used initially in this group outside of a research setting [^22ac25a0] [^18e24522]. For infants 29–60 days who are well-appearing, have reliable caregivers, and meet AAP criteria, oral therapy after initial stabilization and exclusion of invasive infection is acceptable and can be safe with close follow-up, acknowledging the evidence base is largely observational in the youngest infants [^f1cc664b] [^fab4b7c8].

> Final answer: No, oral antibiotics should not be used as initial therapy for UTI in infants less than 2 months of age, especially neonates under 28 days, due to inadequate evidence and higher risk. In select 29–60 day old infants who are clinically well, have negative blood and CSF cultures, and are improving, oral therapy can be used after a brief initial IV course with close follow-up, but this is not standard for neonates and should be individualized with specialist input [^22ac25a0] [^f1cc664b] [^2afdb1e5].

In select well-appearing infants 29–60 days old with UTI, **oral antibiotics are appropriate** [^f1cc664b] once they are clinically stable, tolerating feeds, and have reliable caregivers, with close follow-up [^2afdb1e5]. For infants < 28 days or those who are ill-appearing, **IV therapy is indicated** [^22ac25a0] because of higher risks of bacteremia, meningitis, and unreliable oral absorption [^18e24522]. If oral therapy is used, choose agents with high bioavailability (e.g. cefixime, amoxicillin-clavulanate) [^3d87944d] and ensure a total of 7–14 days of therapy [^aa79cd55], with early switch from IV to oral when clinically improving [^f35e2009].

---

## Evidence supporting oral antibiotic therapy in infants < 2 months

- **AAP guidelines**: For well-appearing infants 29–60 days with UTI, oral antibiotics are appropriate if clinically stable, tolerating feeds, and caregivers are reliable, with close follow-up [^f1cc664b] [^2afdb1e5].

- **Systematic review**: Short IV courses (≤ 3 days) with early oral switch are safe and effective in infants ≤ 90 days, including those ≤ 28 days, with low recurrence and no excess complications [^fab4b7c8] [^c07518de].

- **Retrospective studies**: Early oral switch in infants ≤ 60 days with UTI is associated with shorter hospital stay and no increase in treatment failure or recurrence [^6bdf74a2] [^b3ff0d92].

---

## Limitations and risks of oral antibiotic therapy

- **Age-related risks**: Infants < 28 days have higher risks of bacteremia, meningitis, and unreliable oral absorption; IV therapy is recommended [^22ac25a0] [^18e24522].

- **Clinical stability**: Oral therapy should only be considered in well-appearing, clinically stable infants with reliable caregivers and close follow-up [^f1cc664b] [^2afdb1e5].

- **Monitoring**: Infants on oral therapy need close follow-up to detect clinical deterioration or complications early [^f3c48e4c].

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

| **Guideline/source** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| AAP (2021) | - Oral antibiotics appropriate for well-appearing infants 29–60 days with UTI if stable, tolerating feeds, and caregivers reliable [^f1cc664b] [^2afdb1e5] <br/> - IV therapy for infants < 28 days or ill-appearing infants [^22ac25a0] |
| ESPID (2025) | - IV antibiotics recommended for neonates and infants < 2 months due to immune immaturity, high risk of bacteremia, and unreliable oral absorption [^22ac25a0] [^18e24522] <br/> - Consider oral therapy only in select, stable infants with close follow-up |
| Systematic review (2022) | Short IV courses (≤ 3 days) with early oral switch are safe and effective in infants ≤ 90 days, including those ≤ 28 days [^fab4b7c8] [^c07518de] |

---

## Practical considerations for oral antibiotic therapy

- **Antibiotic selection**: Use agents with high bioavailability and reliable absorption (e.g. cefixime, amoxicillin-clavulanate) [^ae319e4a].

- **Duration**: Total therapy should be 7–14 days, with early IV-to-oral switch when clinically improving [^aa79cd55] [^f35e2009].

- **Follow-up**: Ensure close clinical monitoring and caregiver education to detect deterioration early [^f3c48e4c].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Oral antibiotics can be used in select well-appearing infants 29–60 days old with UTI who are clinically stable, tolerating feeds, and have reliable caregivers, with close follow-up [^f1cc664b] [^2afdb1e5]. For infants < 28 days or those who are ill-appearing, **IV therapy is indicated** because of higher risks and unreliable oral absorption [^22ac25a0] [^18e24522]. If oral therapy is used, select agents with high bioavailability, ensure appropriate duration, and monitor closely for clinical response and complications [^ae319e4a] [^aa79cd55].

### Antibiotics for acute pyelonephritis in children [^3acd3848]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infections in infants. The most severe form of UTI is acute pyelonephritis, which results in significant acute morbidity and may cause permanent kidney damage. There remains uncertainty regarding the optimum antibiotic regimen, route of administration and duration of treatment. This is an update of a review that was first published in 2003 and updated in 2005 and 2007.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of antibiotics used to treat children with acute pyelonephritis. The aspects of therapy considered were 1) different antibiotics, 2) different dosing regimens of the same antibiotic, 3) different duration of treatment, and 4) different routes of administration.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, reference lists of articles and conference proceedings without language restriction to 10 April 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing different antibiotic agents, routes, frequencies or durations of therapy in children aged 0 to 18 years with proven UTI and acute pyelonephritis were selected.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model and the results expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean difference (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

This updated review included 27 studies (4452 children). This update included evidence from three new studies, and following re-evaluation, a previously excluded study was included because it now met our inclusion criteria. Risk of bias was assessed as low for sequence generation (12 studies), allocation concealment (six studies), blinding of outcome assessors (17 studies), incomplete outcome reporting (19 studies) and selective outcome reporting (13 studies). No study was blinded for participants or investigators. The 27 included studies evaluated 12 different comparisons. No significant differences were found in duration of fever (2 studies, 808 children: MD 2.05 hours, 95% CI -0.84 to 4.94), persistent UTI at 72 hours after commencing therapy (2 studies, 542 children: RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.07 to 17.41) or persistent kidney damage at six to 12 months (4 studies, 943 children: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.12) between oral antibiotic therapy (10 to 14 days) and intravenous (IV) therapy (3 days) followed by oral therapy (10 days). Similarly, no significant differences in persistent bacteriuria at the end of treatment (4 studies, 305 children: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.55) or persistent kidney damage (4 studies, 726 children: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.29) were found between IV therapy (three to four days) followed by oral therapy and IV therapy (seven to 14 days). No significant differences in efficacy were found between daily and thrice daily administration of aminoglycosides (1 study, 179 children, persistent clinical symptoms at three days: RR 1.98, 95% CI 0.37 to 10.53). Adverse events were mild and uncommon and rarely resulted in discontinuation of treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated review increases the body of evidence that oral antibiotics alone are as effective as a short course (three to four days) of IV antibiotics followed by oral therapy for a total treatment duration of 10 to 14 days for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis in children. When IV antibiotics are given, a short course (two to four days) of IV therapy followed by oral therapy is as effective as a longer course (seven to 10 days) of IV therapy. If IV therapy with aminoglycosides is chosen, single daily dosing is safe and effective. Insufficient data are available to extrapolate these findings to children aged less than one month of age or to children with dilating vesicoureteric reflux (grades III-V). Further studies are required to determine the optimal total duration of antibiotic therapy required for acute pyelonephritis.

### A comparison of short versus long course intravenous antibiotics when treating urinary tract infection in infants [^0e808fc1]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common reason for hospitalization in young infants, with more than 20 000 infants (< 1 year of age) hospitalized annually in the United States. In children aged 2 to 24 months, the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines from 2011 (reaffirmed in 2016) state that "initiating treatment orally or parenterally is equally efficacious". Infants younger than 60 days often initially receive parenteral antibiotics as part of an evaluation for invasive bacterial infection. The optimal approach to intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy when a UTI is diagnosed in these younger infants is not known. As a result, significant practice heterogeneity exists both within and between institutions. -

Prescribing patterns and the appropriate duration of antibiotic therapy are a priority for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hospital systems, and individual care providers alike as it has a big impact on antimicrobial resistance. Moreover, a short-course IV therapy could provide additional potential benefits compared with a long-course therapy. Shorter hospitalizations would mean lower medical costs and increased hospital bed availability and may be less disruptive to parent-infant bonding. In addition, shorter hospitalization could reduce the risk of nosocomial infectionand adverse events, such as IV infiltrates. This approach is also in keeping with value-based health care delivery.

The goal of this study was to determine the association between short-course (≤ 3 days) and long-course (> 3 days) IV antibiotic therapies and treatment failure, defined as readmission from date of discharge within 30 days. We hypothesized that a short-course IV antibiotic therapy followed by oral antibiotics is safe, with no difference in treatment failure between short-course and long-course IV antibiotic therapy.

Data on the outcome of infants younger than 60 days treated with a combination of intravenous and oral antibiotics for urinary tract infection are limited. This study examined susceptibility and successful outcomes of treatment with narrow-spectrum oral antibiotics. In addition, we describe the effects of antimicrobial stewardship education intervention on prescribing practices.

### Short versus standard duration oral antibiotic therapy for acute urinary tract infection in children [^ddb8311d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of oral antibiotic therapy for urinary tract infection (UTI) in children has not been determined. A number of studies have compared single dose therapy to standard therapy for UTI, with mixed results. A course of antibiotics longer than a single dose but shorter than the usual 7–10 days might decrease the relapse rate and still provide some of the benefits of a shortened course of antibiotics.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the benefits and harms of short-course (2–4 days) compared to standard duration (7–14 days) oral antibiotic treatment for acute UTI in children.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2002) MEDLINE (1966 - September 2002) and EMBASE (1988 -September 2002) without language restriction.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing short-term (2–4 days) with standard (7–14 days) oral antibiotic therapy were selected if they studied children aged three months to 18 years with culture proven UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).

Main Results

Ten trials were identified in which 652 children with lower tract UTI were evaluated. There was no significant difference in the frequency of positive urine cultures between the short (2–4 days) and standard duration oral antibiotic therapy (7–14 days) for UTI in children at 0–10 days after treatment (eight studies: RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.76) and at one to 15 months after treatment (10 studies: RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.29). There was no significant difference between short and standard duration therapy in the development of resistant organisms in UTI at the end of treatment (one study: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.01) or in recurrent UTI (three studies: RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.29).

Reviewer's Conclusions

A 2–4 day course of oral antibiotics appears to be as effective as 7–14 days in eradicating lower tract UTI in children.

### Antibiotics for acute pyelonephritis in children [^9e9d0d58]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infection in infants. The most severe form of UTI is acute pyelonephritis, which results in significant acute morbidity and may cause permanent renal damage. Published guidelines recommend treatment of acute pyelonephritis initially with intravenous (IV) therapy followed by oral therapy for seven to 14 days though there is no consensus on the duration of either IV or oral therapy.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of different antibiotic regimens for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis in children.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, reference lists of articles and abstracts from conference proceedings without language restriction. Date of most recent search: June 2004.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing different antibiotic agents, routes, frequencies or durations of therapy in children aged 0 to 18 years with proven UTI and acute pyelonephritis were selected.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or weight mean difference (WMD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Eighteen trials (2612 children) were eligible for inclusion. No significant differences were found in persistent renal damage at six months (one trial, 306 infants: RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.69 to 3.03) or in duration of fever (WMD 0.80, 95% CI -4.41 to - 6.01) between oral cefixime therapy (14 days) and IV therapy (three days) followed by oral therapy (10 days). Similarly no significant differences in persistent renal damage (three trials, 315 children: RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.37) were found between IV therapy (3–4 days) followed by oral therapy and IV therapy for 7–14 days. In addition no significant differences in efficacy were found between daily and thrice daily administration of aminoglycosides (one trial, 179 children, persistent symptoms at three days: RR 1.98, 95% CI 0.37 to 10.53).

Authors' Conclusions

These results suggest that children with acute pyelonephritis can be treated effectively with oral cefixime or with short courses (2–4 days) of IV therapy followed by oral therapy. If IV therapy is chosen, single daily dosing with aminoglycosides is safe and effective. Trials are required to determine the optimal total duration of therapy and if other oral antibiotics can be used in the initial treatment of acute pyelonephritis.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^68341ed2]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Pediatric urinary tract infection (UTI) algorithm — initial evaluation in febrile infants 2–24 months begins with "Infant 2–24 mo with fever ≥ 38°C" and asks whether the patient requires immediate antimicrobial therapy; if immediate therapy is needed, the algorithm directs to "Obtain urine by catheterization or SPA", "Perform urinalysis", and "Culture urine obtained by catheterization or SPA", and the notes state that "A urine sample suitable for culture should be obtained before initiating antimicrobials". Initial management is to "Treat with antimicrobials effective against common uropathogens according to local sensitivity patterns; oral or parenteral", and if "Urinalysis and culture positive?" is not satisfied, "Discontinue antimicrobials".

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^22ac25a0]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

For children with multiple recurrent UTI, starting with IV antibiotics is not obligatory. Each episode should be managed according to presentation. This group is at risk of infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria through increased antibiotic exposure. If a child has previously had a UTI with bacteria resistant to all oral options, initial antibiotics can be IV until culture results are available. Intravesical antibiotics, via the urethra or Mitrofanoff, are occasionally used to treat intractable recurrent UTI, with small studies showing successful outcomes with 7 days of treatment. Local irrigation may limit systemic antibiotic side effects and keep children out of hospital.

UTI with fever alone can be effectively treated with oral antibiotics. Severe clinical presentations of UTI requiring initial IV include sepsis (features include hypotension and tachycardia when afebrile) and extensive parenchymal involvement. Vomiting can be a sign of sepsis, but on its own is rarely a reason to start IV: in an observational study, over 60% of children with vomiting were successfully treated with oral antibiotics. For extensive renal parenchymal involvement (nephronia/abscess), IV antibiotics ensure maximum concentration at the site.

Nonurologic underlying conditions are renal and nonrenal. A review of UTI postrenal transplant recommended initial IV antibiotics for pyelonephritis to achieve rapid tissue saturation. Although there is a lack of studies of UTI management with other renal impairment, in the absence of severe VUR, oral antibiotics can usually be used. For immunocompromised children, treatment should be via febrile neutropenia pathways if relevant. Otherwise, unless presenting severely unwell, oral antibiotics may be appropriate in immunosuppression or other states of chronic disease (eg, diabetes and liver disease).

For neonates and infants < 2 months, there are no RCTs and little comparative evidence to definitively guide the route of antibiotics for UTI. Major guidelines recommend IV antibiotics due to suboptimal enteral absorption, immune immaturity and high risk of bacteremia. The only study of oral antibiotics in infants that included this age group had too few < 2 months to make strong recommendations supporting this. Most retrospective studies of UTI in neonatesand infants < 2 months – used initial IV antibiotics, and until there is any evidence to the contrary, this continues to be the recommendation, at least as the initial route.

### Short intravenous antibiotic courses for urinary infections in young infants: a systematic review [^fab4b7c8]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Context

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in young infants, yet there is no guidance on the optimal duration of intravenous (IV) treatment.

Objective

To determine if shorter IV antibiotic courses (≤ 7 days) are appropriate for managing UTIs in infants aged ≤ 90 days.

Methods

PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Medline, and Embase (February 2021) were used as data sources. Included studies reported original data for infants aged ≤ 90 days with UTIs, studied short IV antibiotic durations (≤ 7 days), and described at least 1 treatment outcome. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guideline was followed. Studies were screened by 2 investigators, and bias was assessed by using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Revised Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool.

Results

Eighteen studies with 16615 young infants were included. The largest 2 studies on bacteremic UTI found no difference in the rates of 30-day recurrence between those treated with ≤ 7 vs > 7 days of IV antibiotics. For nonbacteremic UTI, there was no significant difference in the adjusted 30-day recurrence between those receiving ≤ 3 vs > 3 days of IV antibiotics in the largest 2 studies identified. Three studies of infants aged ≥ 30 days used oral antibiotics alone and reported good outcomes, although only 85 infants were ≤ 90 days old.

Conclusions

Shorter IV antibiotic courses of ≤ 7 days and ≤ 3 days with early switch to oral antibiotics should be considered in infants aged ≤ 90 days with bacteremic and nonbacteremic UTI, respectively, after excluding meningitis. Further studies of treatment with oral antibiotics alone are needed in this age group.

### Short oral antibiotic therapy for pediatric febrile urinary tract infections: a randomized trial [^7a4a0118]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Febrile urinary tract infection (fUTI) in well-appearing children is conventionally treated with a standard 10-day course of oral antibiotic. The objective of this study is to determine the noninferiority (5% threshold) of a 5-day amoxicillin-clavulanate course compared with a 10-day regimen to treat fUTIs.

Methods

This is a multicenter, investigator-initiated, parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial. We randomly assigned children aged 3 months to 5 years with a noncomplicated fUTI to receive amoxicillin-clavulanate 50+7.12 mg/kg/day orally in 3 divided doses for 5 or 10 days. The primary end point was the recurrence of a urinary tract infection within 30 days after the completion of therapy. Secondary end points were the difference in prevalence of clinical recovery, adverse drug-related events, and resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and/or to other antibiotics when a recurrent infection occurred.

Results

From May 2020 through September 2022, 175 children were assessed for eligibility and 142 underwent randomization. The recurrence rate within 30 days of the end of therapy was 2.8% (2/72) in the short group and 14.3% (10/70) in the standard group. The difference between the 2 groups was -11.51% (95% confidence interval, -20.54 to -2.47). The recurrence rate of fUTI within 30 days from the end of therapy was 1.4% (1/72) in the short group and 5.7% (4/70) in the standard group (95% confidence interval, -10.4 to 1.75).

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that a 5-day course is noninferior to a 10-day course of oral amoxicillin-clavulanate.

### Urinary tract infections in young children and infants: common questions and answers [^aae2fbf0]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in children and are associated with significant short- and long-term morbidity. They have a high recurrence rate and are associated with anatomic and functional abnormalities. The decision to test for UTI is based on risk factors and the child's age. Urinalysis is valuable to rule out UTI and to help decide when to start antibiotics; however, urine culture is needed for definitive diagnosis. Urine specimens collected via perineal bagging should not be used for culture because of high false-positive rates. Diagnosis of UTI requires pyuria and bacterial growth in the urine culture. Prompt treatment of UTIs reduces renal scarring. Antibiotic selection should be based on local sensitivity patterns and adjusted once culture results are available. In most cases, oral antibiotics are as effective as intravenous agents. When intravenous antibiotics are used, early transition to an oral regimen is as effective as longer intravenous courses. Kidney and bladder ultrasonography is helpful to identify acute complications and anatomic abnormalities. Voiding cystourethrography is indicated when ultrasound findings are abnormal and in cases of recurrent febrile UTIs. The use of antibiotic prophylaxis for recurrent UTIs is controversial. Identification and treatment of bowel and bladder dysfunction can prevent UTI recurrence.

Initial management

General

Children with UTI require targeted antibiotics and supportive care. Most children with UTI can be managed at home with oral fluids and antibiotics. A small percentage will require admission for intravenous therapy, including very young and very unwell children, children with significant renal tract anomalies and children not responding to oral therapy.

Antibiotic therapy

Choice of empiric antibiotics must be guided by local guidelines, as local antimicrobial sensitivities vary significantly (table 2). The suitability of the initial agent should be reviewed once culture results are available.

Table 2
Recent evidence, controversies and emerging evidence

Oral antibiotics are effective for the overwhelming majority of paediatric UTI. Previous Cochrane reviews suggest that short 2–4 days courses are as effective as longer 7–14 days for uncomplicated cystitis, while single dose therapy is less effective. American guidelines recommend treatment durations of 7–14 days for both cystitis and pyelonephritis, Canadian guidelines recommend 7–10 days, while National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines suggests 7–10 days for pyelonephritis and a shorter 3 day course for children > 3 months with cystitis. Spanish guidelines mirror NICE recommendations though single-dose therapy is recommended for children aged > 6 years with uncomplicated cystitis.

Younger and sicker children may require initial intravenous therapy. Many guidelines and centres recommend admission, intravenous antibiotics and consideration of septic work-up for infants < 3 months. Aim to switch to oral therapy after 48 hours if there is clinical improvement.

Antibiotic resistance

Antibiotic resistant UTI is becoming more common globally, increases morbidity and doubles healthcare costs. The usual mechanism is through acquisition of enhanced beta-lactamase enzyme properties. Some Gram negative uropathogens can inactivate beta-lactam ring antibiotics such as penicillin and early generation cephalosporins with inherent beta-lactamase enzymes. However, some have acquired further multidrug-resistant properties through evolution of these enzymes, including the ability to hydrolyse and inactivate extended spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenem antibiotics. Such organisms are known as extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) organisms. Prior antibiotic therapy and hospitalisation are risk factors for ESBL carriage, which then contributes to community carriage and transmission of resistance. Rates of resistant UTIs are particularly high in resource-limited settings, where resistance to common oral antibiotics such as ampicillin and cotrimoxazole can be as high as 97%–100%.

Initial Antibiotic Route

For most children with cUTI, oral antibiotics can be trialed initially, including those who are not severely unwell, for isolated urological abnormality (including post-surgery or urological implementation), isolated tachycardia and for most underlying conditions (GRADES C and D).
The exceptions for whom at least initial IV is recommended are significant urological abnormality (VUR grades 4 and 5 or obstruction), clinical features of sepsis, renal nephronia/abscess, neonates and infants < 2 months, post-renal transplant and immunocompromise with concomitant febrile neutropenia (GRADES B–D).

The primary rationale for administering IV antibiotics is to rapidly achieve high concentrations at the site of action in critical situations while bypassing the limitations of oral intake, absorption and bioavailability. There are few studies including children with significant anatomical and functional urologic abnormalities. The only high-grade evidence for route of antibiotic for VUR is from an RCT that included isolated VUR. For VUR grades 1 and 2, oral antibiotics were as effective as IV. For VUR grades 3–5, it appeared that there was less scarring if IV antibiotics were used: 8/24 (33%) scarring with oral versus 1/22 (5%) with IV, P = 0.02. However, only 16% of participants had VUR grades 3–5 so the study was underpowered for this group and the authors did not draw conclusions. There are no other IV versus oral studies for VUR grades 3–5. A prospective study found that half of 172 children with any urological abnormality were treated with oral antibiotics with good clinical outcomes, although this was not stratified by severity. Given the move towards oral antibiotic management over the last 2 decades since the above RCT, and assessing clinical outcomes rather than dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans, we recommend that most children with VUR grade 3 can be managed with oral antibiotics. There are no studies comparing oral with IV post instrumentation or surgery in this group, but in a stable child, oral antibiotics are appropriate.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^f35e2009]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment durations for lower and upper UTIs have gradually reduced, but randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses of shorter durations have largely excluded children with complications. Therefore, there is scant evidence for total durations shorter than 10–14 days for cUTI.

For neonates and infants < 2 months, the majority of retrospective studies in bacteremic, and nonbacteremic,– UTI used a total of 10–14 days of antibiotics with high success rates. A recent systematic review comparing the IV component in infants up to 3 months recommended: for bacteremic UTI, IV antibiotics up to 7 days; and for nonbacteremic UTI, up to 3 days. Switching from IV to oral in both situations is recommended when the infant is afebrile, well and tolerating oral intake.

For severe clinical presentations, a retrospective study of children with febrile UTI included those with initial tachycardia, hypotension and/or vomiting. It showed that 6–9 days was as effective as ≥ 10 days of total antibiotics, although it did not report numbers with severe features. Once features of sepsis resolve (usually by day 3), total antibiotic duration is dependent on bacteremia. A multicenter study of children under 6 months with UTI found bacteremia was more likely to be treated with ≥ 4 than ≤ 3 days IV (total 7–14 days). A case-control study comparing bacteremic versus nonbacteremic UTI found a difference in IV (5–7 vs. 3–4 days) but not total (11–12 days) antibiotic duration, and no differences in outcomes. For acute lobar nephronia, a review including overlapping RCTs compared 14 versus 21 days' total duration, with initial IV then switching to oral 2–3 days after defervescence. There was higher treatment failure with 14 days, but failure was associated with longer pre-presentation fever, suggesting longer treatment is necessary for more established abscesses.

### Revised AAP guideline on UTI in febrile infants and young children [^15a8f0c0]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

In 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a revision of its 1999 clinical practice guideline on urinary tract infections in febrile infants and young children two to 24 months of age. The new clinical practice guideline has several important updates based on evidence generated over the past decade. The updated guideline includes clinical criteria for collecting urine specimens. Diagnosis now requires evidence of infection from both abnormal urinalysis results and positive urine culture results (the criterion for a positive culture has been reduced from at least 100,000 colony-forming units per mL to at least 50,000 colony-forming units per mL). Oral treatment now is considered to be as effective as parenteral treatment. Renal and bladder ultrasonography is still recommended, but the biggest change in the current guideline is that routine voiding cystourethrography is no longer recommended after the first urinary tract infection. Follow-up is based on evaluating children for urinary tract infection during subsequent febrile episodes, rather than routinely performing repeat urine cultures.

American Academy of Pediatrics urinary tract infection guideline — antimicrobial prophylaxis considerations state that although effectiveness for prevention of UTI has not been demonstrated, the concept has biological plausibility. Antimicrobials reach high urinary concentrations, yet barriers include adherence to a daily regimen, adverse effects, and emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Evidence of effectiveness with a well-tolerated, safe product and parent education are needed; a urinary antiseptic that could be taken indefinitely without resistance is particularly desirable, and probiotics are another possible strategy.

### Short compared with standard duration of antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infection: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials [^356073e6]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

To compare the effectiveness of short course (2–4 days) with standard duration oral antibiotic treatment (7–14 days) for urinary tract infection (UTI).

Methods

Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials using a random effects model. Ten trials were eligible, involving 652 children with lower tract UTI recruited from outpatient or emergency departments. Main outcome measures were UTI at the end of treatment, UTI during follow up (recurrent UTI), and urinary pathogens resistant to the treating antibiotic.

Results

There was no significant difference in the frequency of positive urine cultures between the short (2–4 days) and standard duration therapy (7–14 days) for UTI in children at 0–7 days after treatment (eight studies: RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.76) and at 10 days to 15 months after treatment (10 studies: RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.33). There was no significant difference between short and standard duration therapy in the development of resistant organisms in UTI at the end of treatment (one study: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.01) or in recurrent UTI (three studies: RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.29).

Conclusion

A 2–4 day course of oral antibiotics is as effective as 7–14 days in eradicating lower tract UTI in children.

### A comparison of short versus long course intravenous antibiotics when treating urinary tract infection in infants [^1cad7740]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

The presumption that IV antibiotics are superior to oral antibiotics remains a driving force for the treatment in many pediatric and neonatal conditions. Yet, in studies in which neonates are specifically addressed, oral antibiotic therapy has not been associated with treatment failure or recurrence of infection despite concerns of decreased enteral absorption.

The present study is not without its limitations, namely the retrospective design, and there is a potential for misclassification in infants with recurrent UTI if the recurrence was managed in the outpatient setting or at a different institution and would, therefore, not have been captured using our data-collection methodology. Based on the young age of the infants and the fact that we are the only children's hospital in Toronto, we suspect this is likely to be very uncommon, but this misclassification could lead to an underestimation of treatment failure. Given this, we acknowledge that the low incidence of treatment failure within our cohort posted limitations to our statistical analysis, particularly in the case of variable selection for our multiple logistic regression models.

Although we collected data on a variety of demographic, clinical, laboratory, and imaging variables, there may be others that were not included such that they could have impacted IV treatment duration, including response to treatment, resolution of fever, vomiting, or other clinical symptoms. Moreover, patients who are premature and/or present with comorbidities may not have the same outcomes with a shorter IV therapy. In addition, it is possible that there is a subset of infants in which there are high risk factors and in whom longer courses of parenteral antibiotics are appropriate. Future studies should focus on identifying which populations of young infants, if any, may benefit from longer courses of parenteral antibiotic therapy. Lastly, we did not collect information on multidrug-resistant organisms. As such, this study does not address or make specific recommendations relating to therapy nor duration of therapy for infants with culture results growing multidrug-resistant pathogens.

In neonates and infants < 2 months, common pathogens include E. coli, Klebsiella spp. Proteus spp. Enterobacter spp. group B streptococcus and Enterococcus spp. In preterm infants, hematogenous transmission is more prevalent, with CoNS and Candida spp. being causative pathogens. Empirical IV ampicillin and gentamicin are recommended for neonatal UTI by the World Health Organization. Resistance should be considered with maternal history of antibiotics during pregnancyor maternal ESBL-E cultured. Empirical treatment should be based on maternal isolates, although if unable to access these, gentamicin is usually sufficient. For prolonged stays in neonatal intensive care, resistant hospital pathogens, including MRSA, should be considered with empirical vancomycin if the infant is severely unwell.

Once culture results are available, empiric antibiotics can be targeted and potentially narrowed.

Antibiotic Duration and Timing of IV to Oral Switch

For most children with cUTI, there is not enough evidence to support varying from current practice and expert opinion recommending a total of 10–14 days (GRADE D).
When IV antibiotics are started, recommended IV durations vary between ≤ 3 days and ≤ 7 days depending on the cUTI subgroup and presence of bacteremia, with an early switch when the child is afebrile and clinically well (GRADES C and D).
Longer total durations (up to 21 days) may be needed for renal abscesses or nephronia, and renal USS is recommended after 14 days to determine progress and ultimate antibiotic duration (GRADE B).
For frequently relapsing UTI with the same organism, investigations should assess for an ongoing focal source of infection (GRADE D).
Shorter total durations (6–9 days) and a single dose IV component show early promise, but prospective studies are needed with more children with complicated UTI (GRADES C and D).

### Urinary tract infection at the age extremes: pediatrics and geriatrics [^33930ff9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common and generally benign conditions among healthy, sexually active young women without long-term medical sequelae. In contrast, UTIs are more complicated among those individuals at either end of the age spectrum: infants/young children and geriatrics. UTI in children younger than 2 years has been associated with significant morbidity and long-term medical consequences, necessitating an extensive and somewhat invasive imaging evaluation to identify possible underlying functional or anatomic abnormalities. Pediatric UTI should be considered complicated until proved otherwise, and treatment should reflect the severity of signs and symptoms. Management in the acutely ill child frequently involves parenteral broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, and less ill children can be treated with trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), beta-lactams, and cephalosporins.UTI among older patients (> 65 years) may be complicated by comorbidities, the baseline presence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, and benign urinary symptoms that can complicate diagnosis. The etiology of UTI encompasses a broader spectrum of infecting organisms than is seen among younger patients and includes more gram-positive organisms. Symptomatic UTI is generally more difficult to treat than among younger populations. Management should be conservative, of longer treatment durations, and cover a broad spectrum of possible uropathogens. Oral or parenteral treatment with a fluoroquinolone for 7 days is the preferred empiric approach. TMP-SMX can also be considered a first-line agent in women only, but only if the pathogen is known to be TMP-SMX sensitive.

### Urinary tract infection in children [^ab1a7123]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Up to 11.3% of girls and 3.6% of boys will have had a urinary tract infection (UTI) by the age of 16 years, and recurrence of infection is common. Vesicoureteric reflux is identified in up to 40% of children being investigated for a first UTI, and is a risk factor for, but weak predictor of, renal parenchymal defects.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatment of acute urinary tract infection in children? What are the effects of interventions to prevent recurrence? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to July 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 25 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics (short initial intravenous antibiotics, long initial intravenous antibiotics, initial oral antibiotics, single-dose or single-day courses of oral antibiotics, short courses of oral antibiotics, long courses of oral antibiotics, immediate empirical antibiotics, delayed antibiotics, prolonged delay of antibiotics, prophylactic antibiotics); immunotherapy; surgical correction of minor functional abnormalities; and surgical correction of moderate to severe vesicoureteric reflux.

### Modes of administration of antibiotics for symptomatic severe urinary tract infections [^8875d9e6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI), worldwide, is a major source of disease in children and adults. As it may have long-term consequences such as kidney failure and hypertension, it is important to treat patients with UTI adequately. Although standard management of severe UTI usually means intravenous (IV) therapy, at least initially, there are studies showing that oral therapy may also be effective.

Objectives

To assess whether the mode of administration of antibiotic therapy for severe UTI has an effect on cure rate, reinfection rate and kidney scarring.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, in The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched. No language restriction was applied. Reference lists of relevant articles and reviews were checked for additional studies and authors of relevant articles/abstracts were contacted for further information. Date of last search: July 2007.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different modes of antibiotic application for patients with severe UTI (children and adults) were considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study quality was assessed and data extracted. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean difference (WMD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Fifteen RCTs (1743 patients) were included. Studies compared oral versus parenteral treatment (1), oral versus switch treatment (initial intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) therapy followed by oral therapy) (5), switch versus parenteral treatment (6) and single dose parenteral followed by oral therapy versus oral (1) or switch therapy (3). There was a variety of short-term and long-term outcomes, but no pooled outcomes showed significant differences. Most included studies were small though and there were few outcomes for combination in a meta-analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence suggesting that oral antibiotic therapy is less effective for treatment of severe UTI than parenteral or initial parenteral therapy. The results of this review suggest that the mode of application does not determine therapeutic success.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^3389b020]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy duration for febrile UTI — the total course of therapy should be 7 to 14 days, and there is evidence that 1- to 3-day courses for febrile UTIs are inferior to courses in the recommended range; therefore, the minimal duration selected should be 7 days. Outcomes of short courses (1–3 d) are inferior to those of 7- to 14-d courses, and there are minimal harm and minor cost effects of antimicrobial choice and duration of therapy. Aggregate quality of evidence: A/B (RCTs), intentional vagueness notes that no evidence distinguishes the benefit of treating 7 vs 10 vs 14 days, and the policy level is Strong recommendation/ recommendation.

### Impact of early oral antibiotic therapy in infants with bacteremic urinary tract infections [^b3ff0d92]. Hospital Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine the effect of early conversion to oral antibiotics in infants ≤ 90 days with gram-negative bacteremia and concomitant urinary tract infection on hospital length of stay (LOS) and 30-day revisits for urinary tract infection.

Design

This retrospective cohort study included infants ≤ 90 days who had concomitant positive blood and urine cultures with gram-negative bacteremia at 22 hospitals from January 1, 2002 through January 31, 2020. Early oral conversion was defined as a maximum intravenous (IV) duration of 4 days. We conducted a noninferiority test to compare early oral conversion to long IV therapy. A propensity score framework was used to assess comparisons in survey-weighted regression models using matched weights.

Results

Among 174 infants, 73 infants received early oral conversion. The LOS was shorter in infants receiving early oral conversion compared to long IV therapy (median 2 days [interquartile range 2, 3] vs 4 days [3, 5]), descriptively (P < .001) and in noninferiority analysis (ratio = 0.43; 90% CI 0.35, 0.53, P < .001). Thirty-day revisits occurred in 5 of 174 (2.8%) of total patients. Early oral conversion did not meet our noninferiority criteria for the 30-day revisits (odds ratio: 4.22, 90%; confidence interval: 0.83, 21.34, P = 0.91).

Conclusions

Early oral conversion was associated with shorter LOS. The rate of 30-day revisit rates overall was low.

### Treatment of UTIs in infants [^acf757b5]. Hospital Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infections in infants < 2 months of age. However, there are no clear guidelines on the appropriate duration of antibiotics in this age group.

Objective

In this living systematic review, we compared different durations of parenteral antibiotics (≤ 3 vs > 3 days) in neonates and young infants (< 2 months) with UTIs. The secondary objective was to compare different durations of total antibiotic courses (≤ 10 vs > 10 days).

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde, Google Scholar, and gray literature, up to March 2, 2021.

Study Selection

Citations were screened in triplicate by using a crowdsourcing methodology, to identify randomized controlled trials and observational studies.

Data Extraction

Data were extracted by 2 crowd members and verified by an expert investigator. Outcomes were pooled via random-effects models.

Results

A total of 10334 citations were screened, and 12 eligible studies were identified. A total of 59 of 3480 (1.7% [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.3% to 2.2%]) infants had a UTI recurrence within 30 days after short parenteral treatment (≤ 3 days), and 47 of 1971 (2.4% [95% CI: 1.8% to 3.2%]) after longer courses. The pooled adjusted odds ratio for UTI recurrence with a short versus long duration of parenteral antibiotics was 1.02 (95% CI: 0.64 to 1.61; P = 0.95; n = 5451). A total of 5 studies assessed the risk of recurrence on the basis of the total duration of antibiotics (≤ 10 vs > 10 days) with no significant differences (pooled odds ratio: 1.29 [95% CI: 0.45 to 3.66; P = 0.63; n = 491).

Conclusions

On the basis of retrospective studies and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation level low evidence, short and long duration of parenteral antibiotics were associated with a similar risk of UTI recurrence in infants < 2 months.

American Academy of Pediatrics urinary tract infection guideline — scope and treatment duration clarifies that the guideline addresses initial management of the first UTI in febrile infants 2 to 24 months of age. The text adds that some infants will have recurrent UTIs or be identified with VUR or other abnormalities and that further research on optimal management in specific situations would be valuable. It also states that the optimal duration of antimicrobial treatment has not been determined and calls for RCTs of head-to-head comparisons of various duration to limit antimicrobial exposure to what is needed to eradicate the offending uropathogen.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^9f7deb4f]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Several studies support home IV treatment through well-resourced hospital-in-the-home programs if children are stable,– including neonates. In deciding between initial IV or oral antibiotics, the concept of complicated UTI being on a spectrum may be useful. Apart from children with sepsis, the majority with a single complicating feature are initially managed orally. Increasing the number of complicating features increases IV use, so they could be combined into a clinical score with a threshold for using IV. Outside of severe presentation, severe uropathy and neonates, clinically stable children with isolated complicating features can initially be treated with oral antibiotics.

Empiric Antibiotic Choice

Regarding empiric antibiotic choice (1) different cUTI subgroups have different uropathogen prevalence and (2) an individualized risk assessment for resistance is needed based on the child's underlying condition, prior antibiotic use and hospitalization. Based on these, an empiric regimen can be chosen that covers likely pathogens and incorporates the likelihood of resistance (GRADES C and D).
Patients with recurrent infections may initially be treated based on previous cultures (GRADE D).
For children on antibiotic prophylaxis, a different antibiotic choice is needed (GRADE C).
Targeted de-escalated monotherapy is recommended according to susceptibilities once available (GRADE D).

Each cUTI subgroup is vulnerable to different pathogens, and assessment for unusual and multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is crucial. Risk factors for ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) include recurrent UTI, VUR, recent antibiotic exposure, young age and Klebsiella spp. – Risk factors for more resistant carbapenemase-producing uropathogens are prolonged hospitalization, invasive devices and recent travel to endemic areas. – Empiric antibiotic choice needs to balance the risk of resistance with the need for antimicrobial stewardship for this common infection, potentially accepting a short delay in definitive treatment for children who are hemodynamically stable.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis and recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^181ca32d]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are widely administered to children with the intention of preventing urinary tract infection, but adequately powered, placebo-controlled trials regarding efficacy are lacking. This study from four Australian centers examined whether low-dose, continuous oral antibiotic therapy prevents urinary tract infection in predisposed children.

Methods

We randomly assigned children under the age of 18 years who had had one or more microbiologically proven urinary tract infections to receive either daily trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole suspension (as 2 mg of trimethoprim plus 10 mg of sulfamethoxazole per kilogram of body weight) or placebo for 12 months. The primary outcome was microbiologically confirmed symptomatic urinary tract infection. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed with the use of time-to-event data.

Results

From December 1998 to March 2007, a total of 576 children (of 780 planned) underwent randomization. The median age at entry was 14 months; 64% of the patients were girls, 42% had known vesicoureteral reflux (at least grade III in 53% of these patients), and 71% were enrolled after the first diagnosis of urinary tract infection. During the study, urinary tract infection developed in 36 of 288 patients (13%) in the group receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (antibiotic group) and in 55 of 288 patients (19%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the antibiotic group, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.40 to 0.93; P = 0.02 by the log-rank test). In the antibiotic group, the reduction in the absolute risk of urinary tract infection (6 percentage points) appeared to be consistent across all subgroups of patients (P ≥ 0.20 for all interactions).

Conclusions

Long-term, low-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with a decreased number of urinary tract infections in predisposed children. The treatment effect appeared to be consistent but modest across subgroups. (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry number, ACTRN12608000470392.)

### A comparison of short versus long course intravenous antibiotics when treating urinary tract infection in infants [^a4a5c5b1]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Historically, bacteremic UTIs have been treated with longer courses of IV antibiotics because of concerns for severity of infection, renal scarring, hospital readmission, and recurrent UTIs. It was therefore not surprising that in our study, infants with bacteremia received a longer duration of IV antibiotic therapy than those without bacteremia although there are no available published recommendations on duration of parenteral treatment. Many studies in the literature revealed variation in duration of parenteral antibiotics for treatment of UTI and bacteremic UTI.

Angeles et alperformed a more than 10-year retrospective analysis of otherwise healthy infants younger than 60 days of age with a UTI and identified an increasing trend toward short-course parenteral antibiotics, as well as no differences in readmission rates as the parenteral antibiotic duration shortened. Total antibiotic courses in that particular study were not analyzed.

In a randomized clinical trial of 309 infants aged 1 to 24 months with fever and UTI, patients received initial therapy with either oral cefixime alone or IV cefotaxime. Thirteen infants, after randomization, were found to be bacteremic. The study found no significant differences in time to defervescence, symptomatic reinfection, or renal scarring at 6 months, regardless of the presence of bacteremia. Significantly, in this study, none (0 of 13) of the infants with bacteremia were found to have renal scarring by 6 months of age; however, 10% (26/288) of the nonbacteremic population did have evidence of scarring. A recent systemic review was published in pediatricsincluding several of the aforementioned studies. In this review, the largest two studies on bacteremic UTI found no difference in the rates of 30-day recurrence between those treated with ≤ 7 days versus > 7 days of IV antibiotics. For nonbacteremic UTI, there was no significant difference in the adjusted 30-day recurrence between those receiving ≤ 3 days versus > 3 days of IV antibiotics in the largest 2 studies identified. A Finnish study including 134 children with bacteremic UTI matched with children with UTIs and negative blood culture results found that infants with bacteremia often had no difference in clinical presentation or recovery and that the presence of positive culture results did not add new microbiologic information.

### Pediatric urinary tract infections: the role of fluoroquinolones [^32796797]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Infections of the urinary tract (UTI) occur commonly in the pediatric population. Because of the high association of pediatric UTI with congenital structural anomalies of the urinary tract and with dysfunctional elimination syndromes, it is far more common for children to be categorized as having complicated UTI than their adult counterparts. And for children more intensive therapy is often required. Early and effective treatment of UTIs in the pediatric patient is considered essential to prevent long term morbidity and potential mortality from end stage renal disease. An oral antimicrobial is more convenient than parenteral therapy and is preferable as long as clinical efficacy and safety can be assured. Oral fluoroquinolones are an attractive alternative for the treatment of complicated UTI in children, and safety must always be a factor in considering their use in this population. Although the role of fluoroquinolones in pediatric UTI is still under investigation, the limited data available demonstrate a likelihood of efficacy and safety.

### A comparison of short versus long course intravenous antibiotics when treating urinary tract infection in infants [^4a02a138]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Short-course IV antibiotic treatment was defined as the receipt of IV antibiotics for ≤ 3 calendar days, and long-course treatment was defined as the receipt of IV antibiotics for > 3 calendar days. One or more doses of an antibiotic on a given calendar day was considered a full day of treatment. The main outcome was readmission for a UTI, which is defined as any readmission within 30 days of the index discharge with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, code related to UTI present at admission. We chose 30 days because this time would allow more than 2 weeks' period without antibiotics for all infants who completed a typical 10- to 14-day course, including oral antibiotic treatment at home. A UTI diagnosis within this period likely would be related to treatment failure.

Descriptive statistics were performed for categorical and continuous variables, and data were summarized as median (interquartile range [IQR]), counts and percentages. For comparison of each group, chi-square and Fischer's exact tests were used for categorical variables and Mann-Whitney U test for nonparametric continuous data. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression were used to examine the association between the primary exposure variable (short vs long IV treatment) and the odds of readmission for a UTI and for all causes within 30 days. Statistical analyses were performed with STATA (16.1; StataCorp, College Station, Texas). All P values were calculated by 2-tailed distribution, and values < .05 were considered significant.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^a576c443]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Timing of intravenous to oral antibiotics transition for complicated UTI with associated Gram-negative bacteremia — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and associated Gram-negative bacteremia treated initially with parenteral therapy who are clinically improving, able to take oral medication, and for whom an effective oral option is available, we suggest transitioning to oral antibiotics rather than continuing parenteral therapy for the remaining treatment duration (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of the evidence). The trials supporting this recommendation mostly included patients who were afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and had achieved source control (relief of any urinary obstruction) before transitioning to oral antibiotics. An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnostic policy considerations: Harms/risks/costs state that stringent diagnostic criteria may miss a small number of UTIs, the benefit-harms assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm, and value judgments note that treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria may be harmful; the role of patient preferences is that parents prefer no action in the absence of a UTI (avoiding false-positive results) over a very small chance of missing a UTI, with exclusions noted as none, intentional vagueness as none, and policy level as recommendation.

Methods

The study was approved by the institutional review board at our pediatric tertiary care center (REB #10000062307). We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all infants < 60 days old with confirmed bacterial UTIs who were admitted and received IV antibiotics between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2017. Primary and secondary diagnosis codes for acute UTI or pyelonephritis (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, code 590.10, 590.11, 590.80, or 599.0) were included in the initial cohort.

The diagnosis of UTI was deemed certain if urine cultures obtained through suprapubic aspiration showed gram-negative bacteria (any amount) or > 10×10⁶ colonies per liter of gram-positive bacteria or if urine cultures obtained through bladder catheterization showed > 50×10⁶ colonies per liter of a single pathogen (excluding lactobacilli, corynebacteria, and coagulase-negative staphylococci) or > 10×10⁶ colonies per liter of Pseudomonas species. Those treated for UTI who did not meet the aforementioned criteria were excluded for the purpose of this study. We also excluded any infants with catheter-associated UTI, prior urological procedures, mixed-growth urine cultures, fungal growth, and bacterial meningitis. Covariates of interest included patient age, sex, prematurity (defined as gestational age < 37 weeks), comorbidities, clinical parameters such as systolic blood pressure, creatinine level, presence of fever (ie, a reported temperature ≥ 38.0 °C [100.4 °F] at home, in an outpatient clinic, or documented in the emergency department and obtained via any method), ill appearance, causative pathogens, blood culture, imaging modalities, type and length of antibiotic treatment (oral/IV), caring team, and length of stay. Ill appearance was defined as any of the following physical examination terms documented on arrival to the emergency department: "ill appearing", "toxic", "limp", "unresponsive", "gray", "cyanotic", "apnea", "weak cry", "poorly perfused", "grunting", "listless", "lethargic", or "irritable". If none of these terms were documented, the infant was classified as alert. Nosocomial UTI was defined as any infant who developed UTI during hospital stay for other reasons, except those with catheter-associated UTI.

### A comparison of short versus long course intravenous antibiotics when treating urinary tract infection in infants [^416f28d9]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Treatment failure for infants hospitalized in the first 2 months of life with UTI is uncommon and does not change if the duration of parenteral antibiotic therapy is more or less than 3 days. Treating more infants of this age group with short courses of IV antibiotic therapy might decrease the length of hospitalization and resource use without affecting the readmission rates. The relationship between longer antibiotic duration and prematurity, comorbidities, bacteremia, younger age group (< 3 weeks), hospital-acquired UTI, and other clinical parameters should be explored further because these factors were significantly associated with longer antibiotic duration.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Over the last 5 years, new and updated pediatric UTI guidelines from around the world have become increasingly consistent for uncomplicated UTI, but either do not address or differ in definition and recommendations for complicated UTI. This is the first comprehensive guideline focused exclusively on cUTI in children that addresses its diagnosis and management according to the features making it complicated: young age, disease severity/extent and comorbidities. This guideline is comprehensive in addressing gaps in existing guidelines by first highlighting that cUTI is not a uniform entity but rather constitutes a wide range of disease processes. The guideline presents the evidence for diagnosing and managing the subgroups presenting with each of these processes to ensure more individualized patient management. It also reviews emerging evidence for conceptualizing cUTI as an amalgamation of patients' individual features and attainment of a threshold for more intense management. Regardless of the subgroup, accurate diagnosis is the critical first step in managing children with cUTI for which additional investigations, such as blood culture, serum biochemistry and USS, might be required. While several subgroups benefit from initial IV (sepsis, VUR 3–5, neonates) and broad-spectrum antibiotics (sepsis, high risk of resistance from recurrent UTI and immunocompromise), oral narrow-spectrum antibiotics are recommended for most children with cUTI who are not severely unwell. Prophylaxis is not needed universally in cUTI, and its relatively small benefits in specific subgroups need to be weighed against the risk of resistance, with at least 6-monthly reevaluation for its requirement. Longer-term follow-up should aim to assess the need for surgical intervention to reduce the risk of renal damage.

Despite cUTI being common in children, differences in definition and focus on uncomplicated infection have led to scarce high-grade evidence for management, that is also difficult to synthesize. Apart from RCT-based recommendations for CAP in children with urological abnormality, these guidelines are largely based on retrospective studies and expert consensus in areas where high-quality evidence is currently lacking. In addition, available evidence mostly comes from resource-rich settings, and in resource-limited settings there may be some barriers to accessing some investigations and treatments, for example, nuclear medicine imaging and broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, most first-line investigations in the guideline are broadly available and most antibiotic recommendations are from the World Health Organization Access list which should be available in most countries. Therefore, these guidelines can be effectively implemented in most healthcare settings, even in resource-limited environments.

### A comparison of short versus long course intravenous antibiotics when treating urinary tract infection in infants [^70069a1d]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Oral cephalexin and amoxicillin were used in the continuation phase in 48% and 30% of the cases, respectively, and the total period of treatment (oral and IV) was 10 (IQR: 9–14) days. The median length of stay was 5 (IQR: 3–21) days, and only 34 (8%) patients needed long-term home IV antibiotics. Of the 403 children in the final study cohort, only 19 (5%) experienced treatment failure, defined as readmission within 30 days after discharge. Over the course of the study period, the proportion of children exhibiting treatment failure per year ranged from 2.5% to 8.8%. The treatment failure rate was similar (5%) between both groups; short-course versus long-course IV antibiotic exposure (P > .05). The median time to readmission was 17 (IQR: 8–27) days.

We found in the bivariate analyses (Table 1) that nosocomial UTI, age younger than 3 weeks, children with a higher baseline creatinine level, premature children, the presence of comorbidities, and children with a positive blood culture were each associated with increased likelihood of receiving a long-course IV antibiotic treatment (P < .001). Children with comorbidities and hospital-acquired UTI had longer length of stay (28 vs 3 days [P < .0001] and 56 vs 3 [P < .0001], respectively). In retrospect, the rate of renal scarring on DMSA scan was significantly higher in patients that had received long-course IV antibiotics (2 vs 13 days, P = 0.03). There were no statistically significant associations between IV antibiotic duration and patient sex, UTI history, appearance at presentation, low systolic blood pressure, abnormal KUB US findings, and presence of vesicoureteral reflux on voiding cystourethrography.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^ce643685]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Conclusions — In infants and young children 2 to 24 months of age with UTI and unexplained fever, diagnosis is based on the presence of pyuria and at least 50 000 CFUs per mL of a single uropathogen in an appropriately collected specimen of urine; urinalysis alone does not provide a definitive diagnosis. Strategies for diagnosis and treatment depend on whether the clinician determines that antimicrobial therapy is warranted immediately or can be delayed safely until urine culture and urinalysis results are available. After 7 to 14 days of antimicrobial treatment, close clinical follow-up monitoring should be maintained with evaluation of the urine during subsequent febrile episodes to permit prompt diagnosis and treatment of recurrent infections.

### Current primary care management of children aged 1–36 months with urinary tract infections in Europe: large scale survey of paediatric practice [^405b2c42]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe current practice among European paediatricians regarding diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections in children aged 1-36months and to compare these practices with recently published guidelines.

Design

Web-based large scale survey evaluating knowledge of, attitudes towards and the methods for diagnosing, treating and managing urinary tract infections in children.

Setting

Primary and secondary care practices in Europe.

Sample

1129 paediatricians.

Results

A diagnosis of urinary tract infection is considered by 62% of the respondents in children aged 1-36months with unexplained fever. The preferred method of urine collection is use of a bag (53% for infants < 3months and 59% for children 4-36months of age). 60% of paediatricians agree that oral and parenteral antibiotics have equal efficacy. Co-amoxiclav is the antibiotic of choice for 41% of participants, while 9% prescribe amoxicillin. 80% of respondents prescribe ultrasound in all children with a confirmed urinary tract infection. 63% of respondents prescribe a cystography when abnormalities are revealed during ultrasound evaluation. A quarter of respondents recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for all children with any vesicoureteral reflux. The data among European countries are very heterogeneous. The three most recent urinary tract infection guidelines (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the American Academy of Paediatrics and the Italian Society of Paediatric Nephrology) are not followed properly.

Conclusions

Management of febrile urinary tract infections remains controversial and heterogeneous in Europe. Simple, short, practical and easy-to-remember guidelines and educational strategies to ensure their implementation should be developed.

### Short-course intravenous antibiotics for young infants with urinary tract infection [^c07518de]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Shorter courses of intravenous antibiotics for young infants with urinary tract infection (UTI) have myriad advantages. As practice shifts toward shorter intravenous treatment courses, this study aimed to determine the safety of early intravenous-to-oral antibiotic switch and identify risk factors for bacteraemia with UTI.

Methods

Retrospective audit of infants aged ≤ 90 days with a positive urine culture at a quaternary paediatric hospital over 4years (2016–2020). Data were collected from the hospital electronic medical record and laboratory information system. Short-course intravenous antibiotic duration was defined as < 48hours for non-bacteraemic UTI and < 7days for bacteraemic UTI. Multivariate analysis was used to determine patient factors predicting bacteraemia.

Results

Among 427 infants with non-bacteraemic UTI, 257 (60.2%) were treated for < 48hours. Clinicians prescribed shorter intravenous courses to infants who were female, aged > 30days, afebrile and those without bacteraemia or cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis. Treatment failure (30-day UTI recurrence) occurred in 6/451 (1.3%) infants. All had non-bacteraemic UTI and one received < 48hours of intravenous antibiotics. None had serious complications (bacteraemia, meningitis, death). Follow-up audiology occurred in 21/31 (68%) infants with cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, and one had sensorineural hearing loss. Bacteraemia occurred in 24/451 (5.3%) infants, with 10 receiving < 7days intravenous antibiotics with no treatment failure. Fever and pyelonephritis were independent predictors of bacteraemia.

Conclusion

Short-course intravenous antibiotics for < 48hours for young infants with non-bacteraemic UTI should be considered, provided meningitis has been excluded. Treatment failure and serious complications were rare in young infants with UTI.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^a301ace9]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection — methods and evidence synthesis: To provide evidence for the guideline, 2 literature searches were conducted, including surveillance of Medline-listed literature over the past 10 years and a systematic review on the effectiveness of prophylactic antimicrobial therapy to prevent recurrence of febrile UTI/pyelonephritis in children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). The search was expanded to include trials published since 1993 comparing antimicrobial prophylaxis with no treatment or placebo for children with VUR; because all except 1 recent randomized controlled trials included children more than 24 months of age and some lacked grade-specific data, the authors of the 6 RCTs were contacted and all provided raw data from their studies specifically addressing infants 2 to 24 months of age, according to grade of VUR. Meta-analysis of these data was performed, results from the literature searches and meta-analyses were provided to committee members, evidence and recommendation strength were graded according to AAP policy, and the subcommittee formulated 7 recommendations presented in text and in algorithm form in the Appendix.

### Management of urinary tract infections in young children: balancing admission with the risk of emergency department revisits [^5805eae9]. Academic Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Oral antibiotics effectively treat most pediatric urinary tract infections (UTIs); however, children with UTIs are frequently admitted. We examined variation and trends in admission for children with UTIs plus investigated the relationship between admission and emergency department (ED) revisits for those initially managed on an outpatient basis. We hypothesized that hospitals would have similar 3-day revisit rates regardless of the admission rate at the index visit.

Methods

This was a retrospective analysis of 36 hospitals in the Pediatric Health Information System. ED visits for children aged < 2 years presenting with UTI between 2010 and 2016 were studied. Main outcomes were age-stratified and included admission and 3-day ED revisit rates. Regression analyses were used to test hospital-level associations between outcomes and linear temporal trends.

Results

A total of 41,792 visits were studied. The overall admission rate was 27%. The admission rate was 89% for children aged < 2 months and 15% for those aged 2 to 24 months. Interhospital admission rates varied from 6% to 64%. Admission and revisit rates were inversely related (mean change, -0.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.13 to -0.02 per 1% increase in admission rate); however, lower admission rates were not associated with increased revisits leading to admission (mean change, -0.02; 95% CI, -0.07 to 0.03). Over the study period, admission rates were stable (test for linear trend: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.99; 95% CI, 0.95–1.02); however, among infants aged < 2 months, admissions decreased (aOR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88–0.97).

Conclusions

A substantial variation in admission rates exists for children with UTI. Although hospitals with lower admission rates had higher revisit rates, those hospitals did not have an increase in revisits with subsequent admission, supporting the goal of outpatient management.

### Parenteral antibiotic therapy duration in young infants with bacteremic urinary tract infections [^99a37641]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine the association between parenteral antibiotic duration and outcomes in infants ≤ 60 days old with bacteremic urinary tract infection (UTI).

Methods

This multicenter retrospective cohort study included infants ≤ 60 days old who had concomitant growth of a pathogen in blood and urine cultures at 11 children's hospitals between 2011 and 2016. Short-course parenteral antibiotic duration was defined as ≤ 7 days, and long-course parenteral antibiotic duration was defined as > 7 days. Propensity scores, calculated using patient characteristics, were used to determine the likelihood of receiving long-course parenteral antibiotics. We conducted inverse probability weighting to achieve covariate balance and applied marginal structural models to the weighted population to examine the association between parenteral antibiotic duration and outcomes (30-day UTI recurrence, 30-day all-cause reutilization, and length of stay).

Results

Among 115 infants with bacteremic UTI, 58 (50%) infants received short-course parenteral antibiotics. Infants who received long-course parenteral antibiotics were more likely to be ill appearing and have growth of a non- Escherichia coli organism. There was no difference in adjusted 30-day UTI recurrence between the long- and short-course groups (adjusted risk difference: 3%; 95% confidence interval: -5.8 to 12.7) or 30-day all-cause reutilization (risk difference: 3%; 95% confidence interval: -14.5 to 20.6).

Conclusions

Young infants with bacteremic UTI who received ≤ 7 days of parenteral antibiotics did not have more frequent recurrent UTIs or hospital reutilization compared with infants who received long-course therapy. Short-course parenteral therapy with early conversion to oral antibiotics may be considered in this population.

### Treatment of urinary tract infections among febrile young children with daily intravenous antibiotic therapy at a day treatment center [^d9957a5e]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common among infants and toddlers. Children can be treated effectively with short courses (2–4 days) of intravenous (IV) therapy followed by oral therapy. If IV therapy is chosen, use of once-daily dosing may allow outpatient management instead of hospital admission. However, no description of ambulatory treatment with IV antibiotics of UTI among febrile children has been reported to date. We aimed to describe the feasibility and complications of outpatient management with IV antibiotics of UTI among febrile children, at the day treatment center (DTC) of a tertiary-care pediatric hospital.

Methods

Between April 1, 2002, and March 31, 2003, a prospective cohort of patients 3 months to 5 years of age who were examined in the emergency department (ED) and diagnosed as having presumed febrile UTI were treated according to a clinical protocol. Patients were treated at the DTC unless they met exclusion criteria, in which case they were hospitalized. The DTC was open 7 days per week, including holidays, from 8:30 am to 4:30 pm. At the DTC, patients were initially treated with a daily dose of IV gentamicin, until the child had been afebrile for at least 24 hours, and with oral amoxicillin, until preliminary urine culture results were available. Children allergic to penicillin received gentamicin only. IV antibiotics were administered through peripheral IV access; the IV catheter's patency was maintained with injection of 50 U of heparin once daily throughout the treatment period. Parental satisfaction with the DTC experience was assessed with an anonymous, self-administered questionnaire.

Results

Two hundred ninety-one episodes of presumed febrile UTI were diagnosed in the ED, of which 212 (72.9%) were sent to the DTC. There were 71 hospital admissions (24.4%); in 9 of these instances, the child was admitted because parents refused or were unable to comply with DTC treatment. Adherence to the treatment protocol in the ED was excellent; in 92.1% of presumed febrile UTI episodes (268 of 291 episodes), the patient was referred to the appropriate setting for treatment. In 8 instances, patients who met an exclusion criterion were sent to the DTC. They should have been hospitalized, according to the protocol. At the DTC, a final diagnosis of UTI was made in 178 of the 212 episodes (84%). Patients treated at the DTC, with a final diagnosis of UTI, had a median age of 12.0 months (range: 3–68 months), and their mean initial temperature was 39.2 degrees C (SD: 1.1 degrees C). Patients were afebrile by 24 hours in 52% of UTI episodes and by 48 hours in 82%. Minor problems with IV access occurred in 9.0% of cases. The duration of IV antibiotic therapy at the DTC was 1.9 days (SD: 0.9 day). The mean number of visits to the DTC, including appointments for renal ultrasound and voiding cystourethrography evaluations, was 3.5 (SD: 0.9). Parents were present at all scheduled visits in 98.9% of cases. Four patients needed to be hospitalized from the DTC, but in only 1 case was hospital admission related to UTI treatment. Four patients with UTI treated in the DTC had positive blood cultures, 2 with Escherichia coli (both successfully treated at the DTC) and 2 with contaminants. For 4 children treated at the DTC, UTI was caused by gentamicin-resistant E coli. One patient became afebrile within 24 hours after treatment initiation with IV gentamicin; he was then treated with oral cefixime. A second patient was treated with IV ceftriaxone, administered at the DTC once culture results were available, and remained febrile for < 72 hours. The last 2 patients were hospitalized; one, who was also allergic to cephalosporins, had been febrile for 72 hours at the time of hospitalization (once hospitalized, he was treated with IV amikacin), and the other was admitted to the hospital for an unrelated problem, namely, scalp cellulitis. None of these 4 patients was initially bacteremic or became bacteremic during the treatment period. Repeat urine culture was performed within 14 days after treatment initiation in 146 instances, and results were negative in all cases. At telephone follow-up assessments 14 days after discharge, no patient had been rehospitalized because of UTI. Successful treatment at the DTC (defined as attendance at all visits, normalization of temperature within 96 hours, negative control urine cultures, if performed, and absence of hospitalization from the DTC) was observed in 96.6% of the 178 UTI episodes. Overall adherence of physicians to the protocol at the DTC was 87.1% (95% confidence interval: 82.2–92.0%). One hundred seventy-two satisfaction questionnaires were returned and revealed good, very good, or excellent parental satisfaction in 98.8% of cases.

Conclusions

Our data show that ambulatory treatment with IV antibiotics, at a DTC, may be used for at least three-fourths of UTIs among febrile children 3 months to 5 years of age. It is safe and feasible and appears very satisfactory to parents. Although ambulatory treatment with IV antibiotics is more invasive than oral therapy during the initiation of UTI treatment, it ensures almost full compliance, allows close medical supervision, and facilitates investigations related to the UTI. It is an interesting alternative to hospitalization.

### Efficacy of short-term intravenous antibiotic in neonates with urinary tract infection [^177f9c4e]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Recent studies have questioned the use of prolonged intravenous treatment in neonates with urinary tract infection (UTI). The aim of the present study was to examine the clinical course of neonates with UTI with special attention paid to the rates of bacteremia and meningitis and to determine the efficacy of short-term intravenous antibiotic.

Methods

Retrospective review of clinical charts of neonates admitted for UTI. Patients were treated first intravenously with a beta-lactam antibiotic and gentamicin. Treatment was completed orally.

Results

One hundred seventy-two neonates (median age, 19 days) were included. Of 129 blood cultures carried out, 16 (12.4%) were positive. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid was performed in 75 patients; none of the cultures was positive. Forty-nine patients (28.5%) were treated with ampicillin and gentamicin and 105 (61%) with amoxicillin-clavulanate and gentamicin. The median length of intravenous treatment was 4 days (P25: 3; P75: 6). Oral amoxicillin-clavulanate was used in the continuation phase in 75%. No treatment failure or relapse was detected. Eleven (8.7%) of 126 patients had renal scarring at 6 months.

Conclusions

The clinical course in neonates with UTI treated with short-term intravenous antibiotic followed by oral treatment is highly favorable, both in short and long terms. The absence of meningitis and the good evolution of the associated bacteremias argue in favor of a review of the habitual diagnostic-therapeutic protocol in neonates.

### Safety and efficacy of ceftolozane / tazobactam versus meropenem in neonates and children with complicated urinary tract infection, including pyelonephritis: a phase 2, randomized clinical trial [^014cd75a]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Randomized participants were stratified and dosed by age group. The selected doses were based on population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulations. For participants in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group, those 12 to < 18 years of age were given 1.0 g ceftolozane and 0.5 g tazobactam (the dose indicated for adult patients with cUTI), and those from birth to < 12 years of age were given 20 mg/kg ceftolozane and 10 mg/kg tazobactam (maximum of 1.0 g ceftolozane and 0.5 g tazobactam per dose). All participants in the meropenem group received 20 mg/kg (maximum of 1.0 g per dose), with higher dosing up to 30 mg/kg for participants who were 14 days to < 3 months of age permitted at the investigator's discretion. Each dose of ceftolozane/tazobactam or meropenem was administered as a 60-minute (± 10 minutes) infusion and dosed every 8 hours (± 1 hour) after the previous infusion.

Treatment duration was 7–14 days. After 3 days (9 doses) of IV therapy, optional open-label, standard-of-care, oral step-down therapy was permitted at the investigator's discretion, with choice of therapy guided by culture and antibacterial susceptibility results, as well as local standard of care for treatment of cUTI. Recommended options for oral step-down therapy were β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim‚ or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.

Specimen Collection

A baseline urine sample for culture was obtained ≤ 48 hours before the start of administration of the first dose of study treatment. Urine specimens were obtained by suprapubic aspiration, clean urethral catheterization, indwelling urethral catheter‚ or midstream clean catch. Additional details of specimen collection and culture of urine specimens are included in Methods, Supplemental Digital Content 1.

### Contemporary management of urinary tract infection in children [^dc6e3b21]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children, and girls are at a significantly higher risk, as compared to boys, except in early infancy. Most cases are caused by Escherichia coli Collection of an uncontaminated urine specimen is essential for accurate diagnosis. Oral antibiotic therapy for 7 to 10 days is adequate for uncomplicated cases that respond well to the treatment. A renal ultrasound examination is advised in all young children with first febrile UTI and in older children with recurrent UTI. Most children with first febrile UTI do not need a voiding cystourethrogram; it may be considered after the first UTI in children with abnormal renal and bladder ultrasound examination or a UTI caused by atypical pathogen, complex clinical course, or known renal scarring. Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis is used selectively in high-risk patients. Few patients diagnosed with vesicoureteral reflux after a UTI need surgical correction. The most consequential long-term complication of acute pyelonephritis is renal scarring, which may increase the risk of hypertension or chronic kidney disease later in life. Treatment of acute pyelonephritis with an appropriate antibiotic within 48 hours of fever onset and prevention of recurrent UTI lowers the risk of renal scarring. Pathogens causing UTI are increasingly becoming resistant to commonly used antibiotics, and their indiscriminate use in doubtful cases of UTI must be discouraged.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^6823a86f]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria in infancy — An important cause of bacteriuria without pyuria is asymptomatic bacteriuria, which can occur in infants. In a study of infants 2 to 24 months of age, 0.7% of afebrile girls had 3 successive urine cultures with 105 CFUs per mL of a single uropathogen; this condition can be confused with true UTI but should be distinguished because studies suggest antimicrobial treatment may do more harm than good, and the key discriminator is the presence of pyuria.

Morbidity

Acute UTI encompasses the full spectrum of severity from mild dysuria in an otherwise well child to life-threatening urosepsis. While serious infections are less common, they can and do occur, particularly in neonates. Since routine immunisation for Haemophilus influenzae type B and Streptococcus pneumoniae, UTI has become a more common cause of occult and serious bacterial infection in infants.

Short-term morbidity can arise from infection within the renal system. This includes systemic features including poor oral intake and dehydration, and uncommon local complications including perinephric abscess formation. Short-term morbidity also arises from haematogenous uropathogen spread. Bactaraemic UTI has been best studied in infants, as this population is most likely to have blood cultures collected during febrile illnesses. Approximately 5% of infants < 12 months with UTI have bacteraemia identified, depending on study setting. Bacteraemia can then lead to urosepsis. Meningitis can also occur with haematogenous spread to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The risk of coexisting meningitis and UTI is 1% in the neonatal period, suggesting a low threshold to perform lumbar puncture in this age group. Beyond 1 month, the risk is smaller. Typical empirical UTI antibiotics have poor CSF penetration and inadequate duration to treat bacterial meningitis.

Long-term morbidity follows renal injury and scarring from upper tract UTI. Around 15% of children with first UTI who have follow-up scanning will have evidence of renal scarring. This scarring would be clinically important if it led to renal dysfunction, hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Historical thinking suggested these sequalae were common, leading to aggressive imaging guidelines to identify children at risk of CKD. Recent data suggest the risks are much lower. A 2011 systematic review of 1576 cases found no cases where childhood UTI was the main cause of subsequent CKD. Of a further 366 local CKD patients in the same study, 13 (3%) had a history of UTI in childhood but all had renal abnormalities evident on renal ultrasound, and recurrent UTI was possibly the cause of CKD in only one case (0.3%). Therefore, in the absence of structural renal anomalies or recurrent UTI, the risk of CKD appears minimal. Debate about the significance of post-UTI renal scarring continues.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^75ae50f2]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Common uropathogens in children with significant urologic abnormalities, including postsurgery and instrumentation, are Enterobacterales, P. aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus.– To cover these, if IV antibiotics are needed, an aminoglycoside or broad-spectrum cephalosporin is recommended, with a child's individual history guiding whether to cover rarer S. aureus or more indolent Enterococcus spp. empirically. Where multiple antibiotics have previously been used, assessment of the likelihood of resistance is part of management (see below).

Multiple recurrent UTIs, defined by 2 or more UTIs caused by different organisms, are a risk for resistant and MDR bacteria. Although recurrent UTIs might occur without anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, other risk factors include VUR, underlying neurological conditions, prolonged hospitalization and UTI prophylaxis, and girls are at higher risk than boys. If on prophylaxis, a different treatment antibiotic is required due to breakthrough. For children at high risk of resistance, including suspected ESBL-E, empiric oral options include nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, quinolones and fosfomycin. Empirical IV options for children at moderate risk of resistance but who have never cultured ESBL-E include gentamicin and quinolones. If there has been previous ESBL-E or clinical risk is higher, IV amikacin retains high susceptibility to uropathogens, concentrates well in urine and can avoid broad-spectrum beta-lactam and carbapenem use. Most gentamicin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae exhibit cross-resistance to tobramycin but remain susceptible to amikacin, due to reduced inactivation by bacterial enzymes. If cultures grow Klebsiella pneumoniae with high bacterial inoculum, empirical B-lactam antibiotics should be switched to a different class. With a high bacterial inoculum, the stationary phase is rapidly reached, so the effect of targeting penicillin-binding proteins is rapidly diminished, and an alternative is better. In the large majority, carbapenems should be spared since their use is the greatest risk for developing carbapenem resistance. Even with a history of recurrent UTI with resistant uropathogens, empirical carbapenems are rarely needed in children with cUTI unless a child presents with sepsis (see below). – If the identified uropathogen is MDR, including carbapenem-resistant, options include a carbapenem plus amikacin combination, colistin and newer B-lactam/B-lactamase antibiotics such as ceftazidime-avibactam. Since methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is an uncommon uropathogen, this rarely needs to be covered empirically. P. aeruginosa (susceptible and resistant) is more common in recurrent UTIs, so it should be empirically treated with oral quinolones or IV aminoglycosides.

### Treatment of urinary tract infections in children… [^92699454]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Cystitis is characterized by dysuria, urgency, frequency and pain in the lower abdomen. Fever is less common. Oral antibiotics, including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate and second-and third-generation cephalosporins, are usually effective. However. E. coli is becoming increasingly resistant to amoxicillin and TMP-SMX in some parts of the United States. The optimal duration of therapy is normally seven days, although shorter courses and single-dose regimens have demonstrated moderate but variable success. More than 60 percent of young febrile patients with UTI have evidence of pyelonephritis. Febrile infants with UTI who are younger than one year of age generally require hospitalization and initial treatment with intravenous antibiotics until afebrile, followed by oral therapy for 10 to 14 days. Appropriate intravenous agents include cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, ampicillin-sulbactam and gentamicin.

Oral therapy depends on bacterial isolation and sensitivity. Recent studies question the need for long courses of intravenous cefotaxime when a short course of intravenous cefixime followed by oral therapy yields comparable results. The selection of appropriate treatment requires review of local antimicrobial resistance patterns and compliant caretakers who understand the seriousness of the infection, the need for exact antibiotic dosing and the importance of maintaining close contact with the treating physician. Oral antibiotics are sufficient for use in older children who present with high fever, abdominal or flank pain, and costovertebral angle tenderness if they do not appear to be toxic. Suitable medication choices include cefixime, other extended-spectrum cephalosporins, amoxicillin-clavulanate, TMP-SMX and, occasionally, quinolones.

The authors conclude that treatment of UTI with oral antibiotics is usually effective, even in younger children with pyelonephritis. Cefixime is a useful empiric choice. Children who appear toxic or who cannot tolerate oral medication should be hospitalized for initial intravenous therapy. Radiographic studies can be performed before completion of antibiotic therapy. Caretakers should be educated about the risk of recurrence and advised when to seek medical attention.

Urinary tract infection in febrile infants and young children — scope and key definitions: This guideline focuses on the diagnosis and management of initial urinary tract infections (UTIs) in febrile infants and young children (2–24 months of age) who have no obvious neurologic or anatomic abnormalities known to be associated with recurrent UTI or renal damage, and uses the phrase "febrile infants" to indicate febrile infants and young children 2–24 months of age. In studies underlying these limits, the prevalence of UTI is high (~5%) in this age group and fever was defined as temperature of at least 38.0°C (≥ 100.4°F), which is the definition adopted here. Neonates and infants less than 2 months of age are excluded, and data are insufficient to determine whether evidence from infants 2 to 24 months applies to children more than 24 months of age.

Other agents (e.g., trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, first or second-generation cephalosporins) are less well studied but may be appropriate in select settings or situations for empiric oral treatment of cUTI.

### Scoping review of clinical decision aids in the assessment and management of febrile infants under 90 days of age [^cd9ac91c]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The definition of IBI was consistently defined as the growth of a single pathogen in blood or CSF. However, in studies examining SBI, the definition included IBI but also UTI, pneumonia and other infections. This heterogeneity in definitions could impact the performance of CDAs when applied to diverse populations. Therefore, the AAP has recommended focusing on IBI as an outcome due to the heterogeneity associated with SBI. Complications from the delayed treatment of IBI can be catastrophic for febrile infants. Current evidence suggests that infants with UTI and are low risk can be safely managed as outpatients on oral antibiotics. This is supported by the AAP and CA FIRST protocols. The incidence of IBI varied from 1.6% to 5.9% across 28 studies, while that of SBI ranged from 7% to 38.7 (21 studies). The upper limit of these values exceeded the range previously reported in literature. Such variation could be attributed to factors such as epidemiology, regional practices, and patient selection in the studies included in the analysis and highlight the importance of applying and validating the various CDAs in different contexts.

The American Academy of Pediatrics' (AAP) clinical practice guideline for UTIs focuses on febrile children age 2–24 months, with no guideline for infants < 2 months of age, an age group commonly encountered by pediatric hospitalists. In this review, we assess the applicability of the AAP UTI Guideline's action statements for previously healthy, febrile infants < 2 months of age. We also discuss additional considerations in this age group, including concurrent bacteremia and routine testing for meningitis.

### Weight gain and obesity in infants and young children exposed to prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis [^6d37021d]. JAMA Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

An association between antibiotic use and excessive weight gain or obesity in healthy infants and young children has been reported, but evidence is inconsistent and based on observational studies of growth in relation to incidental antibiotic exposures.

Objective

To evaluate whether prolonged antibiotic exposure is associated with weight gain in children participating in a clinical trial of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent recurrent urinary tract infection.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Secondary analysis of data from the Randomized Intervention for Children With Vesicoureteral Reflux Study, a 2-year randomized clinical trial that enrolled participants from 2007 to 2011. All 607 children who were randomized to receive antibiotic (n = 302) or placebo (n = 305) were included. Children with urinary tract anomalies, premature birth, or major comorbidities were excluded from participation.

Interventions

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or placebo taken orally, once daily, for 2 years.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Weight gain as measured by change in weight-for-age z score from baseline to the end-of-study visit at 24 months. Secondary outcomes included weight gain at 6, 12, and 18 months and the prevalence of overweight or obesity at 24 months.

Results

Participants had a median age of 12 months (range, 2–71 months) and 558 of 607 (91.9%) were female. Anthropometric data were complete at the 24-month visit for 428 children (214 in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group and 214 in the placebo group). Weight gain in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group and the placebo group was similar (mean [SD] change in weight-for-age z score: +0.14 [0.83] and +0.18 [0.85], respectively; difference, -0.04 [95% CI, -0.19 to 0.12]; P = 0.65). There was no significant difference in weight gain at 6, 12, or 18 months or in the prevalence of overweight or obesity at 24 months (24.8% vs 25.7%; P = 0.82). Subgroup analyses showed no significant interaction between weight gain effect and age, sex, history of breastfeeding, prior antibiotic use, adherence to study medication, or development of urinary tract infection during the study.

Conclusions and Relevance

Based on a secondary analysis of data from a large clinical trial of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis, there was no evidence that prolonged exposure to this antibiotic has a concurrent effect on weight gain or the prevalence of overweight or obesity in healthy infants and young children.

### Neonatal group B. streptococcus sepsis after negative screen in a patient taking oral antibiotics [^d284ac3a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of serious neonatal infection. Neonatal morbidity and mortality can be reduced by appropriate prenatal screening and intrapartum chemoprophylaxis.

Case

A 20-year-old primigravida was treated with oral antibiotics at 35 weeks for a recurrent urinary tract infection. Her GBS screen following the antibiotic treatment showed a negative culture. The patient, therefore, did not receive intravenous antibiotics during her induction of labor for mild preeclampsia. The infant developed early onset neonatal GBS pneumonia and sepsis.

Conclusion

Oral antibiotics can cause a temporary negative culture in a GBS-colonized patient. Relying on a negative culture for management may not be appropriate in a patient treated with oral antibiotics. Additional studies are necessary to elucidate the effects of oral antibiotics on GBS.

### Predictors of long length of stay in infants hospitalized with urinary tract infection [^dc0255f5]. Hospital Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common serious bacterial infection in infants. To use resources optimally, factors contributing to costs through length of stay (LOS) must be identified. This study sought to identify clinical and health system factors associated with long LOS in infants with UTI.

Methods

Using a case-control design, we included infants < 6 months old hospitalized with UTI. Cases had LOS ≥ 96 hours; controls had LOS < 96 hours. Clinical and health system variables were extracted from medical records. Cases and controls were compared by using comparative statistics and multiple logistic regression analysis.

Results

Cases (n = 71) and controls (n = 71) did not differ by gender; cases were more likely to be younger (4.2 vs 7.1 weeks, P = 0.04), born preterm (13% vs 3%, P = 0.03), have known genitourinary disease (17% vs 4%, P = 0.01), an ultrasound (85% vs 68%, P = 0.02) or voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) (61% vs 34%, P = 0.001) ordered, longer wait for VCUG (53 vs 27 hours, P = 0.002), consult requested (54% vs 10%, P < .001), and longer duration of intravenous (IV) antibiotics (125 vs 62 hours, P < .001). Multiple logistic regression demonstrated that cases were more likely to be premature (odds ratio [OR] 7.6), have known genitourinary disease (OR 7.3), and have VCUG ordered in the hospital (OR 4.5).

Conclusions

Infants who are older, are born full term, have no genitourinary disease, receive shorter courses of IV antibiotics, and do not have a VCUG ordered have shorter stays and may be eligible for a short-stay unit. Earlier transition to oral antibiotics and delayed ordering of a VCUG may decrease LOS.

### A comparison of short versus long course intravenous antibiotics when treating urinary tract infection in infants [^e0746246]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this large retrospective cohort study of infants younger than 60 days, we examined the association between the duration of IV antibiotic therapy for UTIs and the risk of treatment failure. We observed no association between the receipt of short-course IV therapy (≤ 3 days) and increased odds of readmission for UTIs compared with the receipt of longer courses. There are no available published recommendations on the duration of parenteral treatment for UTI in infants younger than 60 days. Data on parenteral antibiotic use can be gleaned from existing studies and suggest that prolonged parenteral antibiotic courses offer no clear benefit. However, these studies are limited by small numbers, lack of inclusion in some cases of infants younger than 1 month, or lack of focus on clinical outcomes.-

In a recent retrospective chart review of 112 neonates < 28 days old hospitalized for UTI, the median IV antibiotic duration was 49 hours (51% received IV antibiotics for > 48 hours). No demographic features or laboratory values correlated with IV antibiotic duration apart from age < 7 days. The odds of long IV antibiotic duration increased if the neonate had a secondary diagnosis extending hospitalization (adjusted OR [aOR] 3.2, P < .002, 95% CI: 1.2–8.7), subspecialty consult (aOR 4.79, P < .001, 95% CI: 1.87–12.3), or an abnormal renal US (aOR 2.26, P < .02, 95% CI: 1.01–5.08). Only 1 neonate experienced treatment failure.

In a multicenter retrospective study conducted by Desai et al in a similar age group with bacteremic UTIs, infants receiving a short course of parenteral antibiotics did not experience more-frequent UTI recurrence or hospital reutilization than infants receiving a long-course parenteral therapy. However, short-course parenteral antibiotic duration was defined in this study as ≤ 7 days. Another multicenter retrospective study by Schroeder et alof infants ≤ 90 days of age with bacteremic UTIs revealed that infants with recurrent UTI did not receive shorter parenteral antibiotic treatment than infants without recurrent UTI in an unadjusted analysis. Schroeder's findings are similar to those in this study, with infants who received longer courses of parenteral antibiotics more likely to be younger and have a positive blood culture. In 2007, Magín et alreviewed 172 infants (median age of 19 days) with UTIs, finding that early transition to oral antibiotics had no increased rate of treatment failure, relapses, or renal complications.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of… [^9b1ec760]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Postcoital administration of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or ciprofloxacin appears to reduce the incidence of UTIs in women compared with placebo. 1 No significant difference in effectiveness between intermittent, defined as the use of antibiotics after a trigger such as coitus, and continuous strategies has been demonstrated in high quality studies. 2 Benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis appear confined to their usage period and the optimal duration that balances individual and ecological risks with effectiveness are unclear. A sufficient quality and quantity of evidence was found to provide a clear recommendation for the use of methenamine hippurate to prevent UTIs. Methenamine, which was approved in 1967 for recurrent UTI prophylaxis in those aged 12 years and older, works by releasing formaldehyde in acidic urine, thus resulting in bacteriostasis.

A systematic review, 31 which included a multicenter, open-label, randomized noninferiority trial conducted in the UK from June 2016 to June 2018, compared the efficacy of methenamine with daily low-dose antibiotics in preventing recurrent UTIs in women aged 18 years and older and found that methenamine was noninferior to antibiotics for the prevention of UTIs. Similarly, a nonblinded RCT compared methenamine with trimethoprim for preventing recurrent UTIs over 12 months in women aged 18 years and older found noninferiority for methenamine, with no significant difference in UTI recurrence rates between the 2 groups and similar adverse effects. 32 Therefore, we recommend the use of methenamine as an alternative to prophylactic antibiotics in patients with intact bladder anatomy. The clinical review found insufficient quality of evidence to enable a clear recommendation.

There is inconclusive evidence to recommend for or against the use of oral or vaginal probiotics to prevent UTIs. Studies were heterogeneous as it pertains to the patient populations, specific probiotics, route of administration, and study design. 33–36. A sufficient quality and quantity of evidence was found to provide a clear recommendation for empirical treatment regimens for pediatric and adult patients diagnosed with UTIs. Empirical treatment regimens for pediatric and adult patients should contain antimicrobials that have historically demonstrated efficacy and safety in the treatment of UTIs, achieve adequate urinary concentrations, and provide reliable activity against the most common pathogens based on local resistance rates.

### Issues in febrile urinary tract infection management [^2269f9fc]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are common occurrences in the pediatric age group and are a cause of significant morbidity and expense. The understanding of the consequences and sequelae of febrile urinary tract infections led to revision of standard protocols initiated by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in 1999. A less invasive protocol of radiologic evaluation has been the major outcome of the revised AAP guidelines. Emphasis on prevention of recurrent febrile urinary tract infections has also led to therapeutic programs that are centered less around the use of prophylactic antibiotics than has previously been the practice.

### Prescribing pattern and efficacy of oral antibiotics for pediatric urinary tract infections in Japan: a descriptive study using a nationwide claims database [^feaf728f]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pediatric urinary tract infections are often treated with third-generation cephalosporins; however, the increasing prevalence of Escherichia coli resistant to cephalosporins has reduced their effectiveness. Although resistance is prevalent in Asia, the prescribing patterns and clinical effectiveness of antibiotics have mostly been reported in the United States. This study aimed to describe the prescription patterns and effectiveness of oral antibiotics for treating pediatric urinary tract infections in Japan.

Methods

This descriptive study used data from a nationwide Japanese claims database. We identified patients < 6 years old with urinary tract infections who received oral antibiotics between January 2016 and December 2020. Descriptive analyses were performed to assess prescription patterns. Moreover, logistic regression analyses were conducted to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for treatment failure among the commonly prescribed antibiotics and patient characteristics. Treatment failure was defined as the prescription of different antibiotics within 7 days of the primary prescription.

Results

Of the 4,127 patients, 2,766 (67.0%) were prescribed third-generation cephalosporins, and 347 (8.4%) were prescribed amoxicillin. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and amoxicillin-clavulanate were prescribed to 63 (1.5%) and 50 (1.2%) patients, respectively. Treatment failure was observed in 118 (2.9%) patients and more often in amoxicillin-treated patients than in cefcapene pivoxil-treated patients [OR, 2.18 (95% CI: 1.04–4.58)].

Conclusions

Third-generation cephalosporins are the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for the initial therapy of pediatric urinary tract infections in Japan. Third-generation cephalosporins are still effective in Japan, despite the high prevalence of resistance against cephalosporins.

### Ciprofloxacin [^272e4b82]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Complicated Urinary Tract Infection and Pyelonephritis–Efficacy in Pediatric Patients

Ciprofloxacin administered intravenously and/or orally was compared to a cephalosporin for treatment of cUTI and pyelonephritis in pediatric patients 1 to 17 years of age (mean age of 6 ± 4 years). The trial was conducted in the US, Canada, Argentina, Peru, Costa Rica, Mexico, South Africa, and Germany. The duration of therapy was 10 to 21 days (mean duration of treatment was 11 days with a range of 1 to 88 days). The primary objective of the study was to assess musculoskeletal and neurological safety.

Patients were evaluated for clinical success and bacteriological eradication of the baseline organism(s) with no new infection or superinfection at 5 to 9 days post-therapy (Test of Cure or TOC). The Per Protocol population had a causative organism(s) with protocol specified colony count(s) at baseline, no protocol violation, and no premature discontinuation or loss to follow-up (among other criteria).

The clinical success and bacteriologic eradication rates in the Per Protocol population were similar between ciprofloxacin and the comparator group as shown below.

### Management and outcomes in children with third-generation cephalosporin-resistant urinary tract infections [^3d8bdb11]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Third-generation cephalosporin-resistant urinary tract infections (UTIs) often have limited oral antibiotic options with some children receiving prolonged parenteral courses. Our objectives were to determine predictors of long parenteral therapy and the association between parenteral therapy duration and UTI relapse in children with third-generation cephalosporin-resistant UTIs.

Methods

We conducted a multisite retrospective cohort study of children < 18 years presenting to acute care at 5 children's hospitals and a large managed care organization from 2012 to 2017 with a third-generation cephalosporin-resistant UTI from Escherichia coli or Klebsiella spp. Long parenteral therapy was ≥ 3 days and short/no parenteral therapy was 0–2 days of concordant parenteral antibiotics. Discordant therapy was antibiotics to which the pathogen was non-susceptible. Relapse was a UTI from the same organism within 30 days.

Results

Of the 482 children included, 81% were female and the median age was 3.3 years (interquartile range: 0.8–8). Fifty-four children (11.2%) received long parenteral therapy (median duration: 7 days). Predictors of long parenteral therapy included age < 2 months (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 67.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 16.4–275.7), limited oral antibiotic options (aOR 5.9; 95% CI: 2.8–12.3), and genitourinary abnormalities (aOR 5.4; 95% CI: 1.8–15.9). UTI relapse occurred in 1 of the 54 (1.9%) children treated with long parenteral therapy and in 6 of the 428 (1.5%) children treated with short/no parenteral therapy (P = 0.57). Of the 105 children treated exclusively with discordant antibiotics, 3 (2.9%, 95% CI: 0.6%-8.1%) experienced UTI relapse.

Conclusions

Long parenteral therapy was associated with age < 2 months, limited oral antibiotic options, and genitourinary abnormalities. UTI relapse was rare and not associated with duration of parenteral therapy. For UTIs with limited oral options, further research is needed on the effectiveness of continued discordant therapy.

### Treating urinary tract infections in young children… [^9a2f4766]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Young children with acute urinary tract infections typically are hospitalized for intravenous antibiotic therapy. Effective oral therapy would eliminate the costs, risks and trauma associated with hospitalization. Hoberman and colleagues compared the effectiveness of an oral antibiotic with that of an intravenous antibiotic in treating UTIs in this population. Exclusion criteria included a history of UTI, urinary tract abnormalities, underlying chronic disease or gram-positive cocci in the urine. Patients who met the study criteria were randomized by age and duration of fever to receive cefotaxime intravenously in the hospital or cefixime on an outpatient basis. Hospitalized patients were switched to oral cefixime on day 4 or after they were afebrile for 24 hours, whichever was longer.

Follow-up examination and repeat urine culture were performed in the hospital after 24 hours. Subsequent evaluation was done by telephone after 48 hours and again after 10 days. Escherichia coli was the most common isolate found in the urine cultures. Almost one half of the isolated microorganisms were resistant to ampicillin and amoxicillin. Patients found to have bacteremia tended to be younger and to have a longer duration of fever than those without bacteremia. The incidence of reinfection did not differ significantly between groups. All follow-up renal scans were normal in children whose baseline scans were normal. In addition, the cost of inpatient treatment was twice as high as that for outpatient treatment. The authors conclude that oral cefixime is as safe and effective as intravenous cefotaxime in treating UTI in young febrile children. Outpatient management not only reduces health care costs, it is less traumatic for the patient and family.

Oral cefixime is a viable alternative because it is not associated with poor outcomes or long-term sequelae as was once thought to occur with what was perceived to be less aggressive treatment. editor's note: In an accompanying editorial, Fisher applauds the findings of the Hoberman study. She also cautions that cefixime, although appropriate for empiric therapy of UTI, has a spectrum that is too broad once susceptibility studies are available. At that point, patients should be switched to a narrow-spectrum antibiotic. — g. b. h.

### A comparison of short versus long course intravenous antibiotics when treating urinary tract infection in infants [^31b6b4ed]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Following multivariate adjustment, there was no significant association between specific treatment group and treatment failure, with an odds ratio (OR) for long- versus short-course treatment of 0.42 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.11–1.63). Additionally, prematurity, positive blood cultures, and the presence of comorbidities were also not predictive of treatment failure. However, the odds of treatment failure increased if the patient had documented fever on admission (OR 3.37, 95% CI: 1.05–10.86), UTI history (OR 6.87, 95% CI: 1.71–27.15), and length of stay more than 15 days (OR 6.56, 95% CI: 1.65–26.09) (Table 2).

### Bacterial susceptibility to oral antibiotics in community acquired urinary tract infection [^86824d53]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The most common oral antibiotics used in the treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI) are sulphonamides and cephalosporins, but emerging resistance is not unusual.

Aims

To assess the change in susceptibility of urinary pathogens to oral antibiotics during the past decade in children with community acquired UTI.

Methods

The study sample included two groups of children with a first community acquired UTI: 142 children enrolled in 1991 and 124 enrolled in 1999. UTI was diagnosed by properly collected urine specimen (suprapubic aspiration, transurethral catheterisation, or midstream specimen in circumcised males) in symptomatic patients. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates was compared between the two groups.

Results

The pathogens recovered in the two groups were similar: in 1991 — E coli 86%, Klebsiella 6%, others 8%; in 1999 — E coli 82%, Klebsiella 13%, and others 5%. A slight but generalised decrease in bacterial susceptibility to common antibiotics in the two groups was shown: ampicillin 35% versus 30%; cephalexin 82% versus 63% (p < 0.001); nitrofurantoin 93% versus 92%. The only exception was co-trimoxazole, 60% versus 69%. Overall resistance to antibiotics in 1999 was as follows: ampicillin 70%, cephalexin 37%, co-trimoxazole 31%, amoxicillin-clavulanate 24%, nitrofurantoin 8%, cefuroxime-axetil 5%, nalidixic acid 3%.

Conclusions

This study shows a slight but generalised decrease in bacterial susceptibility to common oral antibiotics in the past decade in our population. Empirical initial treatment with co-trimoxazole or cephalexin is inadequate in approximately one third of UTI cases. A larger number of pathogens may be empirically treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate (24% resistance); 95% of organisms are susceptible to cefuroxime-axetil.
