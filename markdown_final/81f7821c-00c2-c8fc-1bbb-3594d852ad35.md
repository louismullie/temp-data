A. 1890s
B. 1920s
C. 1950s
D. 1970s

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which decade the Hula-Hoop was invented in, with options including the 1890s, 1920s, 1950s, and 1970s. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the provided documents contain any direct mention of the Hula-Hoop. Then, I should verify whether any of the cited decades align with the known history of the Hula-Hoop. Next, I will consider whether the documents offer any indirect clues that could support or refute a particular decade. Finally, I will reconcile any discrepancies and state the most defensible answer based on the available evidence and general knowledge.

> Let me first confirm whether the supplied references mention the Hula-Hoop at all. Wait, let me verify the content carefully: I do not see any document that explicitly names the Hula-Hoop or discusses its invention timeline, which means I cannot cite a direct source for the exact invention decade from this packet alone [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should still check whether any of the decades highlighted in the documents match the commonly accepted history of the Hula-Hoop. The 1950s are repeatedly referenced across multiple sources in this packet, including discussions of hurricane activity, hepatitis B dynamics, and various medical and technological developments, which at least confirms that the 1950s are a well-represented decade in the corpus, even if none of these entries discuss the Hula-Hoop itself [^14294f48] [^6614fdaa] [^2e306d57].

> I need to ensure I'm not overlooking an indirect clue. Let me consider whether any adjacent decades or cultural touchpoints could hint at the timing. The 1970s are heavily featured in these documents for diverse topics such as HIV emergence, mental health paradigms, and climate phenomena, but nothing links them to the Hula-Hoop's invention, which makes a 1970s origin less likely based on this packet alone [^8d8a6509] [^408cacdf] [^14294f48].

> But wait, what if the correct answer is not represented among the options at all? I should double-check my own knowledge against the choices. The modern plastic Hula-Hoop as a mass-market toy is generally credited to the late 1950s, with widespread commercialization in 1958, which aligns with option C; however, since none of the provided sources explicitly state this, I must acknowledge that my conclusion relies on external historical knowledge rather than a direct citation from the packet [^notfound].

> Given the absence of a direct source and the need to choose among the supplied decades, I should select the option that best matches the external historical timeline while noting the limitation. Therefore, the most defensible choice here is C. 1950s, with the caveat that this answer is supported by general historical knowledge rather than a specific citation within the provided documents [^notfound].

The Hula-Hoop was invented in the **1950s**, specifically in **1958** when Wham-O began mass-producing the plastic toy that became a global fad. While hoops have existed for centuries, the modern Hula-Hoop's design and commercial success originated in this decade, making the 1950s the correct answer.

---

## Historical background

Hoops have been used for play and exercise for centuries, with evidence of their use in ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome. These early hoops were typically made from materials such as wood, metal, or bamboo. However, the modern Hula-Hoop, as it is known today, was not developed until the mid-20th century.

---

## Invention of the modern Hula-Hoop

The modern Hula-Hoop was invented in **1958** by Richard Knerr and Arthur "Spud" Melin, founders of the Wham-O toy company. Inspired by Australian bamboo exercise hoops, they developed a plastic version that was lightweight, durable, and colorful. The name "Hula-Hoop" was derived from the Hawaiian dance, hula, due to the similar hip movements required to use the toy.

---

## Popularity and cultural impact

Upon its release in 1958, the Hula-Hoop quickly became a cultural phenomenon, with millions sold worldwide within the first few months. It was particularly popular among children and teenagers, who enjoyed the challenge of keeping the hoop spinning around their waist, hips, or arms. The Hula-Hoop also became a symbol of the 1950s and 1960s, representing the carefree spirit and innovation of the era.

---

## Conclusion

The Hula-Hoop was invented in the **1950s**, specifically in 1958, by Richard Knerr and Arthur Melin. While hoops have been used for centuries, the modern Hula-Hoop's design and commercial success originated in this decade, making it a defining toy of the era.

### Tracing the history of hepatitis B virus genotype D in Western Japan [^cdf6bef0]. Journal of Medical Virology (2006). Low credibility.

The major hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes in Japan are B and C. HBV genotype D (HBV/D), however, is widespread in a small area of Western Japan, where the Gianotti-Crosti syndrome caused by HBV subtype ayw, which is suspected to be HBV/D, was endemic in the 1970s. The aim of the study was to elucidate its origin, time of transmission, and spread in this area. Genotyping of HBV-DNA was done in 363 patients with HBV infection. The year of birth was checked in patients with HBV/D. The full genome sequences of 20 HBV/D strains, 2 of which were obtained from a single carrier with a 19-year-interval, were analyzed. An evolutionary rate, the date of the most recent common ancestor, and the effective number of HBV/D infections were calculated. Fifty-two of 363 patients were infected with HBV/D, and 39 were born in 1970s. In a phylogenetic tree, the 20 HBV/D strains produced a definite cluster, and the evolutionary rate was calculated to be 5.4 × 10⁻⁵ nucleotide substitutions/site/year. The root of the tree was estimated to be in approximately 1,900 and began to spread from the 1940s, leading to a rapid increase of infected patients in the 1970s. From these results, it is suspected that HBV/D was likely transmitted to the area investigated approximately 100 years ago and then spread widely in the 1970s. From the history of the area and the genetic analysis, HBV/D in this area was speculated to be of Russian origin.

Prevention of Rh D alloimmunization — regional prevalence, disease burden without prophylaxis, and impact of immune globulin are detailed: prevalence of Rh D-negative individuals varies "from 5% in India to 15% in North America", and in countries without prophylaxis "14% of affected fetuses are stillborn and one half of live born infants suffer neonatal death or brain injury". The postpartum administration of Rh D immune globulin, "first introduced in the 1970s", "reduced the rate of alloimmunization in at-risk pregnancies from approximately 13–16% to approximately 0.5–1.8%", and "with the addition of routine antepartum administration" the risk "was further reduced to 0.14–0.2%". Despite efficacy, cases still occur "because of failure to follow established protocols".

Markers are numbered 1 through the last marker on the chromosome in order of physical position. Haplotypes are ordered in the top panel, purple to crimson, based on frequency in pre-1970s sample. All additional haplotypes are colored gray. The same haplotype in both samples, pre-1970s and 2000s, will have the same color, excepting gray haplotypes. Note that shared colors left to right along the chromosomes could represent unlinked haplotypes although similar frequencies (and frequency changes) generally suggest linkage. The third panel shows average pairwise difference (π) for 50 marker windows; lines are colored based on indicated samples. In the fourth panel, blue lines indicate the frequency change of the most rapidly changing haplotype within a window. Orange lines indicate the average change of the three most rapidly changing alleles in a window. Haplotype change is based on the first (pre-1970s) and last (2000s) samples, whereas allele change is based on all sampled decade groupings (see Materials and Methods).

Initial corticosteroid regimen history and duration evidence — pediatric nephrotic syndrome: In the 1960s and 1970s, a consensus initial corticosteroid regimen was 60 mg/m²/d for 4 weeks followed by +40 mg/m²/d for 3 consecutive days per week for 4 weeks, with the follow-up dose later changed to every other day corticosteroids for ease of administration and no head-to-head comparisons available. While some early randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showed a benefit of longer corticosteroid treatment (12–24 weeks) versus 8 weeks on risk of relapse, more recent studies have not consistently shown a benefit for extending the initial treatment course beyond 12 weeks.

### Advancing alcohol research and treatment: contentions and debates about treatment intensity, goals and outcomes in the 1970s and 1980s [^05dbab2a]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

This narrative exploration of alcohol treatment research focuses on key contentions and advances in alcohol treatment during the critical 1970s and 1980s.

Methods

Papers and books which signal some of the major debates and advances in alcohol treatment research were selected from the 1970s and 1980s. The selection process was based on significant debate during this period, and included those that influenced the field in general and this author in particular.

Results

This was a period where challenges to traditional models and concepts, and the perceived universal need for long-term treatment, were accompanied by contention but also advances in research and treatment approaches. The debates and advances resonate today. These include the recognition that: intensive and long-term treatment is not always required; for dependent drinkers, relapse is a common treatment outcome meriting specific treatment approaches to prevent and reduce this risk; controlled drinking is a treatment option, especially for younger and less dependent drinkers; and an important contributor to enduring change is access to, and realization of, improvements in the quality of life.

Conclusions

Pioneering research and publications in the 1970s and 1980s, sometimes conducted and produced in contentious contexts, influenced significantly conceptualizations of alcohol-related problems, and laid the foundations for treatment hypotheses and research, improving access to a broader range of evidence-based treatment. These underpinning works influenced the development of stepped-up care from brief to intensive interventions, relapse prevention and treatment options not limited to abstinence, and they identified the need to include a stronger focus on quality of life.

### Natural and anthropogenic contributions to the hurricane drought of the 1970s-1980s [^14294f48]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

North-Atlantic hurricane activity, as measured by the power dissipation indexor the accumulated cyclone energy, was much smaller during the 1970s and 1980s than in the preceding or following decades –. In a changing climate, the high hurricane activity, and destructiveness we have witnessed in the recent decadespose the pressing question of whether the hurricane drought of the 1970s and 1980s was natural or anthropogenic in nature. In the former case, we might expect similar droughts to recur, providing a respite from hurricane hazards. In the latter case, we need to consider the recent hurricane activity as the new normal and prepare accordingly.

The hurricane power dissipation index depends on the number of hurricanes during each season, their intensity, and their duration. These in turn depend on a variety of proximal environmental influences like variations in mid-tropospheric saturation deficit, vertical wind shear, and potential intensity, a theoretical upper limit on tropical cyclone (TC) intensity imposed by the thermodynamic environment. Potential intensity theory predicts stronger tropical cyclones when the sea surface is anomalously warm locally, and indeed, North Atlantic power dissipation is highly correlated with summertime tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SSTs). This is especially true at long timescales, and SST was depressed on average in the 1970s and 1980s, concurrently with the hurricane drought.

The evidence presented in a steadily growing number of papers using both statistical, and numerical – methods suggests an important influence of anthropogenic sulfate aerosol radiative effects on Atlantic ocean SSTs during the hurricane drought. Indeed, emissions of SO 2, a sulfate aerosol precursor, increased rapidly to peak in Europe and North America in the 1970s and 1980s, before decreasing rapidly due to emission controls. However, despite accounting for sulfate radiative forcing, climate model simulations fail to represent the magnitude of SST variations at multidecadal time scales, in the tropical North-Atlantic and the main development region –. As a result, models also fail to capture the full observed depression of hurricane activity of the 1970s and 1980s. This contrast between a large statistical dependence of TC activity on the emissions of SO 2, and a relatively small modeled dependence suggests that the effects of anthropogenic sulfates could be amplified locally by positive climate feedbacks that are not well captured in climate models. We propose that Saharan dust emissions could provide such a feedback.

### Choosing the best apple: counselling leaflets and technologies of communication in the history of reproduction [^45e1424e]. Medical Humanities (2023). Medium credibility.

The leaflet as a technology to frame reproductive decisions, by the late 1970s, as analogous to economic decisions, reflects significant entanglements between the different FDC members and their concepts of reproductive health. One example is the integration of the concept of 'degeneration' into the counselling leaflet. Under the impression of atomic armament and thalidomide, Wendt, just like other researchers, predicted a rise of 'mutagenicity' in 'future generations', parallel with a decline in 'natural selection' due to support structures and the healthcare system. Genetic counselling, he argued to TV audiences, was one countermeasure against the predicted increase of 'hereditary diseases' (Wendt, n.d. quoted from, min 03:16–03:37). 39 In the meantime, at FDC meetings, this argument developed into an economic reasoning for primary prevention of disability by counselling, instead of support structures. 'Even if it is an unpopular goal', Nitsch and FDC treasurer Karl M Döll, a bank attorney, concluded in an internal meeting, 'it is better to prevent hardship, than to alleviate it". 40 FDC members, such as Horst Bickel, a Heidelberg paediatrician, took this argument into political discourse. Bickel et al calculated the costs saved by counselling, amniocentesis and abortion, compared with the cost for the care of people with Down syndrome, for scientific and political audiences. 41 This argument was repeated by government representatives to ultimately justify the funding decisions for the aforementioned West German polite project on human genetic counselling (, 7).

### Trends in intracranial and cerebral volumes of framingham heart study participants born 1930 to 1970 [^4b4b9833]. JAMA Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Impact of Decade of Birth

There was a significant secular trend for greater height (adjusting for age and sex) with mean (SD) height of 66.0 (3.5) in for individuals born during the 1930s compared with a mean (SD) height of 67.6 (3.9) in for individuals born during the 1970s.

There was a secular trend for larger ICV (adjusting for age and sex) with an adjusted mean ICV of 1234 mL for individuals born during the 1930s and 1321 mL for individuals born in the 1970s (Figure 2 and Table 2). There was no sex × decade of birth interaction. Given the association between height and ICV, we further tested whether secular differences in ICV remained significant after adjusting for height. In a multivariable model that included adjustments for height, sex, and age, secular differences in ICV remained significant, varying from 1238 mL for those born during the 1930s to 1315 mL for those during the 1970s.

a Simulated SST and b GPIᵀ as a function of dust optical thickness (τ) at 0.55 μm, under a weak temperature gradient constraint. The red dots are the values of SST and GPIᵀ for dust concentrations representative of the 1970s–1980s hurricane drought (τ = 0.23) and of the entire period from 1960 to 2017 (τ = 0.19). The gray profiles represent simulations with single scattering albedo (ω₀) perturbed so that the dust is more reflective (ω₀ = 0.94) or more absorptive (ω₀ = 0.84). Similar simulations where the asymmetry parameter is perturbed to values of 0.58 and 0.78 yield similar results.

We next turn our attention to the sensitivity of TC activity-relevant physical parameters to dust aerosol optical depth. Figure 3 b shows the variations, as a function of dust optical depth, of the thermodynamic component of the genesis potential indexdefined aswhere PI is potential intensityand χ is mid-tropospheric saturation deficit. The genesis potential index is proportional to the number of storms that form at a given location. As dust increases, PI decreases and χ increases, leading to a decrease in GPIᵀ. In Fig. 3 b, GPIᵀ is normalized by its value at τ = 0.2, which is representative of the dust cover over the main development region. In Fig. 3 b, the red squares correspond to two simulations based, respectively, on the high dust optical depth of the 1970s and 1980s, and on the average of the 1960–2017 period. This shows that dust variations may have resulted in a 15% decrease in the genesis potential index during the 1970s and 1980s. Considering that there were 22% fewer observed hurricanes during that period and that the effects of dust on wind shear were neglected in our computation, this shows that dust variations can explain a large fraction of the decrease in hurricane numbers in the 1970s and 1980s.

### Changing impact of modifiable risk factors on the incidence of major outcomes of type 1 diabetes: the Pittsburgh epidemiology of diabetes complications study [^2e353286]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

RESULTS

At baseline, the prevalence of any MOD was 15.9% in the 1960s cohort and declined insignificantly to 13.0% in the 1970s cohort (P = 0.35). The prevalence of each component of MOD at baseline generally declined, with the exception of CAD, which remained the same (1960s, 2.9% vs. 1970s, 2.9%; P = 0.98), and amputation, which increased slightly (1960s, 1.7% vs. 1970s, 2.5%; P = 0.50). No differences in prevalence between the 1960s and 1970s cohorts reached statistical significance. Blindness was the most common prevalent complication in both cohorts (1960s, 10.9% vs. 1970s, 7.6%; P = 0.19), whereas CBVD was the most rare (0.8 vs. 0.4%, respectively, P = 0.60). Prevalence of ESRD in the 1970s cohort (2.5%) was less than half that seen in the 1960s cohort (5.4%) (P = 0.09).

After excluding all prevalent cases of MOD at baseline, the estimated 8-year incidence of any MOD was 22.6% (95% CI 17.0–29.1) in the 1960s cohort, and 15.8% (11.6–21.4) in the 1970s cohort (P = 0.06). The change in the 8-year incidence of individual MOD types is shown in Fig. 1. The most significant declines were seen in diabetes-related death (13 vs. 7%, P = 0.02), CAD (12 vs. 5%, P = 0.005), and ESRD (12 vs. 4%, P < 0.0001) from the 1960s to the 1970s cohort. The incidence of CBVD, although low, also decreased (3 vs. 0.7%, P = 0.09), whereas blindness declined only slightly (7 vs. 5%, P = 0.42), and the low incidence of amputation remained the same (1 vs. 1%, P = 0.99).

### Psychedelic crossings: American mental health and LSD in the 1970s [^07236323]. Medical Humanities (2020). Medium credibility.

No band is as rich in references to psychopathology… as original 1970s New York punks The Ramones. Songs such as 'Psychotherapy', 'Gimme Gimme Shock Treatment', 'I Wanna Be Sedated' and 'Teenage Lobotomy', although playing fast and loose with DSM criteria, are punk rock classics, mini case-vignettes with a savage, knuckle-headed wit lying behind the buzz saw guitar attack. 18

Besides music, the literary world provided other glimpses into cultural narratives of mental health and illness. Gravity's Rainbow, published by Thomas Pynchon in 1973, was 'a voyage into space, time and human consciousness', and it offered, like punk rock, a window into the 'mental world' of the 1970s. 19 Pynchon later won the National Book Award in 1974. Now considered a masterpiece, the novel stands as 'bonecrushingly dense, compulsively elaborate, silly, obscene, funny, tragic, pastoral, historical, philosophical, poetic, grindingly dull, inspired, horrific, cold, bloated, beached and blasted'. 20 While writing, Pynchon notably took cues from Sigmund Freud's 'The Mechanism of Paranoia', at the height of the Vietnam War, and he then published it a year after the Watergate break-in. Anxiety and mistrust dripped off the page, which of course reflected back on the decade of the 1970s and discussions about LSD and mental health. 21

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^809c0879]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to vitamin D requirements, ES 2011 guidelines recommend to consider advising intake of at least 600 IU/day of vitamin D in adults aged 19–50 years to maximize bone health and muscle function. Insufficient evidence whether 600 IU/day is enough to provide all the potential nonskeletal health benefits associated with vitamin D. Recognize that at least 1,500–2,000 IU/day of vitamin D may be required to raise the blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D consistently > 30 ng/mL.

### Changing impact of modifiable risk factors on the incidence of major outcomes of type 1 diabetes: the Pittsburgh epidemiology of diabetes complications study [^341e1f90]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Another major observation of interest is that high HbA 1c (> 8.4%, 68 mmol/mol) in the 1970s cohort is not associated with an increased risk of MOD, whereas the same cut point in the 1960s cohort increases risk significantly. However, there still is an almost twofold difference in MOD rates by HbA 1c status in the 1970s cohort (21 vs. 11%), albeit not as great as in the 1960s (36 vs. 11%). Also, HbA 1c levels decreased during the 8-year follow-up in the 1970s cohort but did not change in the 1960s cohort; thus, baseline values are more representative of follow-up values in the 1960s cohort than the 1970s. More extensive analysis of the impact of change in HbA 1c was not possible here, as the numbers of participants with repeated HbA 1c measures at 8 years of follow-up were small and biased because of mortality. Nevertheless, these data are consistent with our previous observation that long-term change in HbA 1c may be a better predictor of cardiovascular events than baseline, or even mean, HbA 1c. Finally, it is possible that better blood pressure and lipid management in the later period of the 1970s cohort follow-up helps to ameliorate the damage of poor glycemic control per se.

Our study has many strengths, including its prospective design and wide range of diabetes diagnosis years, which allowed us to compare the two cohorts. Additionally, deaths and cardiovascular events were verified using death certificates and medical records by reviewers who were masked to risk factor status. The main limitation is the potential for a "survivor bias", because prevalent cases of MOD were excluded from incident risk factor analysis. This exclusion means that we have not been able to assess the impact of risk factors in the earliest, higher-risk cases, which predominate in the earlier 1960s cohort. This exclusion may also minimize the impact of baseline HbA 1c in the 1970s cohort, as discussed above. Although we have standardized the two cohorts in terms of duration of diabetes, we are not able to fully account for exposure to various risk factors over time, which is likely to differ between the two cohorts (e.g. changes in clinical practice, introduction of medications, etc.). Despite these limitations, the original objective, to examine risk factors in the setting of improved control, is still addressable with this data set.

### Psychedelic crossings: American mental health and LSD in the 1970s [^408cacdf]. Medical Humanities (2020). Medium credibility.

Witch doctors and shamans

Alternative approaches to mental health and LSD collided with the creation of new diagnostic guidelines in the 1970s. What's more, ideas that challenged mainstream psychiatric practice gathered momentum.

E Fuller Torrey, an expert in schizophrenia, published a book called The Mind Game in 1972. It was highly critical of mental health practice, and Torrey, a one-time special assistant to the National Institute of Mental Health director, had clearly become disenchanted during the late 1960s and early 1970s. He described psychiatrists specifically as akin to witch doctors, or shamans, since:

The techniques used by Western psychiatrists are, with few exceptions, on exactly the same plane as the techniques used by witchdoctors. If one is magic then so is the other. If one is prescientific, then so is the other. 40 41

In his view, the data underpinning mental health were lacking. The rhetorical use of religion and complementary medicine raised images of Timothy Leary, cults, yoga and gurus. Torrey's language raised questions about the hazards of unverifiable mental health practices based not on evidence and replicability but tradition, on 'hidden' knowledge passed from generation to generation. The term witch doctor, likewise, raised ideas about the priesthood — and how the progressive and positivist nature of mental health therapy was supposed to transcend antiquated means of treating people.

Torrey was not alone. Other individuals and institutions argued for a 're-biologization' of psychiatric thought, and this view germinated slowly in the late 1960s–1970s and culminated in the DSM-III in 1980. Discussions over data and DSM in the 1970s were a 'fateful point' in mental health. The revising of diagnostic categories represented a shift in conceptualising a 'standardized nosology of fixed disease categories' based on research-based medical model which all but swept away psychodynamic and other alternative theories from the official manual of the American Psychiatric Association (APA). 40 The multiple amendments introduced to the DSM-III demonstrated a shift in the conceptualisation of mental disorders from psychological 'states' to discrete, operationally defined disease categories, and a return to a descriptive, symptom-based classification. In essence, the DSM-III inaugurated an attempt to 'remedicalize' American psychiatry.

### Psychedelic crossings: American mental health and LSD in the 1970s [^1f12b8ba]. Medical Humanities (2020). Medium credibility.

This article places a spotlight on lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and American mental health in the 1970s, an era in which psychedelic science was far from settled and researchers continued to push the limits of regulation, resist change and attempt to revolutionise the mental health market-place. The following pages reveal some of the connections between mental health, LSD and the wider setting, avoiding both ascension and declension narratives. We offer a renewed approach to a substance, LSD, which bridged the gap between biomedical understandings of 'health' and 'cure' and the subjective needs of the individual. Garnering much attention, much like today, LSD created a cross-over point that brought together the humanities and arts, social sciences, health policy, medical education, patient experience and the public at large. It also divided opinion. This study draws on archival materials, medical literature and popular culture to understand the dynamics of psychedelic crossings as a means of engendering a fresh approach to cultural and countercultural-based healthcare during the 1970s.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) research needs — watchful waiting: Priorities include defining the anticipated rate of spontaneous resolution of OME in infants and young children (existing data are limited primarily to children aged ≥ 2 years), conducting large-scale prospective cohort studies to obtain current data on spontaneous resolution of newly diagnosed OME of unknown prior duration (existing data are primarily from the late 1970s and early 1980s), developing prognostic indicators to identify the best candidates for watchful waiting, determining whether children with an OME duration exceeding 1 to 2 years have an increased risk of hearing loss, balance problems, discomfort, or other findings that would prompt intervention, and determining if the lack of impact from prompt insertion of tympanostomy tubes on speech and language outcomes seen in asymptomatic young children with OME can be generalized to older or symptomatic children with OME referred for evaluation.

Finally, we examined retention by gender and decade of first appointment from the 1970s to the 2010s, adjusted for degree type and race and ethnicity and restricting follow-up time to 10 years (Table 3). In these analyses, we found that women who joined the faculty in the 1970s were 20% more likely to leave academia, whereas women who joined the faculty in the 2010s had no greater risk of leaving compared with men (Table 3). Of note, the median retention time for women in the 1970s was 7.17 (95% CI, 6.75–8.00) years and in the 2010s the median was 7.83 (95% CI, 7.74–7.92) years. The gap decreased due to a decline in men's tenure in academic medicine, with men in the 1970s retained for a median greater than 10 years and those joining the faculty in the 2010s being retained for a median of 8.08 (95% CI, 8.00–8.25) years. After controlling for the outcomes of private vs public institution, total revenue, and institution size, the pattern of gender differences remained the same (see eTable 9 in Supplement 1).

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^17ef9153]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D dosing in adults aged 50 years and older with indications for supplementation or treatment: Recommendation 11 states, "we suggest, daily, lower-dose vitamin D instead of non-daily, higher-dose vitamin D. (2 | ⊕⊕⊕◯)". The evidence base included 2 trials with 537 participants directly comparing intermittent high-dose vs daily lower-dose regimens, and an expanded review of 19 manuscripts from 15 studies involving 53 527 participants. Daily vitamin D doses ranged from 400 to 800 IU (10–20 µg), while non-daily regimens included 50 000 IU (1250 µg) every 2 weeks, 60 000–100 000 IU (1500–2500 µg) monthly, and 96 000–150 000 IU (2400–3750 µg) every 2 to 4 months. There was a trend for intermittent high-dose vitamin D to increase fracture risk (RR 1.08 [95% CI, 0.98–1.19]), with an estimated absolute effect of 5 more participants with a fracture per 1000 (1 fewer to 11 more). We did not identify evidence related to individuals younger than age 50 years.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^9b5741e3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D prevention guideline — trial design and measurement limitations: Expected greater benefit at lower baseline 25(OH)D contrasted with few randomized controlled trials in low-baseline populations, and many large trials had adequate baseline levels (eg, 25(OH)D 31 ng/mL [78 nmol/L]). Control groups were routinely exposed to vitamin D via sun and diet and many trials allowed continued supplements reflecting the DRI (eg, 600–800 IU [15–20 μg] daily for adults), which the panel notes may bias results toward the null. Most trials lacked a specific 25(OH)D eligibility threshold and were not designed or powered for subgroup analyses by baseline or achieved 25(OH)D; accordingly, the commissioned review does not include subgroup analyses by average baseline 25(OH)D. Additional constraints included insufficient duration to assess long-latency chronic disease outcomes and heterogeneity of doses and schedules, precluding specific dose recommendations (with doses summarized in technical remarks).

Radiation therapy — conformal radiotherapy (RT) techniques — states that conformal RT (CRT) techniques, which include 3D-CRT and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), are recommended for performing focal brain irradiation, and IMRT often will provide superior dosimetric target coverage and better sparing of critical structures than 3D-CRT; several randomized controlled trials conducted in the 1970s showed that radiation improved both local control and survival in patients with newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas. Sufficient radiation doses are required to maximize this survival benefit; however, radiation dose escalation above 60 Gy has not been shown to be beneficial, and the recommended radiation dose for high-grade astrocytomas is 60 Gy in 2.0 Gy fractions or 59.4 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions.

This article summarizes the adventures and explorations in the 1970s and 1980s in the treatment of children with leukemia and cancer that paved the way for the current success in childhood cancers. Indeed, these were adventures and bold steps into unchartered waters. Because childhood leukemia the most common of the childhood cancers, success in childhood leukemia was pivotal in the push toward cure of all childhood cancers. The success in childhood leukemia illustrates how treatment programs were designed using clinical- and biology-based risk factors seen in the patients.

### Changing impact of modifiable risk factors on the incidence of major outcomes of type 1 diabetes: the Pittsburgh epidemiology of diabetes complications study [^898f6241]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The results of our study suggest that the impact of glycemia, cholesterol, and smoking on the development of MOD was lower in those diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in the 1970s compared with those diagnosed in the 1960s. However, hypertension showed no change in its impact, accelerating the incidence of a MOD to a similar degree in both cohorts. The persistence of hypertension as a strong predictor of MOD is in spite of the fact that treatment of hypertension increased dramatically, from 50% in the 1960s cohort to > 90% in the 1970s cohort. Additionally, whereas BMI was higher in the 1970s compared with the 1960s cohort, it was not associated with the incidence of MOD in either. Finally, microalbuminuria was a significant factor in accelerating the incidence of MOD in both diagnosis cohorts, although to a much greater degree in the 1960s cohort compared with the 1970s. Furthermore, only microalbuminuria appears to account for much of the cohort effect on MOD incidence.

It is important to note that the two cohorts analyzed here both had median HbA 1c levels of 8.4% at their respective baselines, suggesting that control had not significantly improved. However, as we have previously reported, there has been a decrease in the HbA 1c in the total EDC cohort, particularly since 1996–1998. The equivalent HbA 1c in the two cohorts presented here thus likely reflects the exclusion of prevalent MOD case subjects who were greater in number in the 1960s cohort and in worse control. Unfortunately, we do not have sufficient follow-up data to effectively assess the impact of change in glycemia throughout follow-up as the 1970s cohort had only one subsequent exam (8 years postbaseline), although as mean HbA 1c at 8 years follow-up decreased in the 1970s cohort but remained nearly unchanged in the 1960s, it is likely that HbA 1c improved over follow-up to a greater extent in the 1970s cohort.

### Natural and anthropogenic contributions to the hurricane drought of the 1970s-1980s [^ec2a5ff3]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Atlantic hurricane activity experienced a pronounced lull during the 1970s and 1980s. The current explanation that anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing cooled the sea surface locally fails to capture the magnitude of this large decrease in activity. To explain this hurricane drought, we propose that the radiative effects of sulfate aerosols from Europe and North-America decreased precipitation in the Sahara-Sahel region, leading to an enhancement of dust regional emissions and transport over the Atlantic. This dust in turn enhanced the local decrease of sea-surface temperature and of hurricane activity. Here, we show that dust emissions from the Sahara peaked in phase with regional sulfate aerosol optical thickness and Sahel drought conditions, and that dust optical depth variations alone can explain nearly half of the sea-surface temperature depression in the 1970s and 1980s.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^ac90b227]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) testing — In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against routine 25(OH)D testing (2 | ⊕◯◯◯). Technical remarks state that, in this population, 25(OH)D levels that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials and that the panel suggests against routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making and against routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing; this recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia). Based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely to be small at best and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely to be trivial, and panel members judged that empiric vitamin D would likely be acceptable to individuals in this age group, especially females with risk factors for developing osteoporosis.

Methods

Study population

The Twenty-07 study has followed up people in three cohorts born around 1932, 1952 and 1972 for 20 years (for full details, see Benzeval et al). The study contains two subsamples: the regional sample, a two-stage stratified random sample of people living in the Central Clydeside Conurbation, west of Scotland and the localities sample of people from two areas in the city of Glasgow. Baseline interviews were carried out in 1987/1988 when study members were aged approximately 15, 35 and 55. The target sample for each cohort was 1500. The overall achieved sample was 4510, with 1515 in the 1970s cohort, 1444 for the 1950s cohort and 1551 for the 1930s cohort. This represents 85% of those approached for interview for the 1970s cohort, 89% for the 1950s and 87% for the 1930s. At baseline, study members have been shown to be representative of the general population in the sample area. The study members were followed up on separate occasions with 86.1% of those alive responding in 1990/1992, 68.8% in 1995/1997, 64.3% in 2000/2004 and 67.4% 2007/2008. By wave 5, mortality had accounted for 1.7% of the 1970s cohort, 6.0% of the 1950s cohort and 36.6% of participants in the 1930s cohort. Numbers participating in each wave and percentage missing for each variable by cohort and gender are presented in the online.

### The prophylactic effect of long-term lithium administration in bipolar patients entering treatment in the 1970s and 1980s [^247bb5de]. Bipolar Disorders (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of the study was to assess the prophylactic effect of long-term lithium administration in patients with bipolar mood disorders entering treatment in the 1970s and 1980s at the outpatient clinic of the Department of Psychiatry, University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.

Methods

The clinical characteristics of two groups of patients before and during lithium therapy were compared, namely, the 60 bipolar patients who entered lithium prophylaxis in the 1970s and 49 patients who entered in the 1980s. Both groups received the drug over a 10-year period.

Results

The patients who entered lithium in the 1970s had fewer previous episodes of depression and more of mania than the patients who entered the therapy in the 1980s, although the total number of affective episodes was similar in both groups. The overall prophylactic efficacy of lithium over a 10-year period of administration was similar in both groups, except for a trend towards a greater number of depressive episodes in the first year of lithium prophylaxis in the 1980s group. The excellent lithium responders constituted 35% of the 1970s patients and 27% of those in the 1980s group. The 1970s patients were maintained on a higher level of serum lithium compared to the patients in the 1980s group and had more lithium-induced side effects.

Conclusions

A decrease in lithium prophylactic efficacy in consecutive decades was not observed. Small differences between the bipolar patients entering lithium therapy in the 2 decades were observed in terms of the previous history of illness and during the course of lithium administration.

### Towards a structure of feeling: abjection and allegories of disease in science fiction' mutation' films [^6d836590]. Medical Humanities (2016). Low credibility.

This article considers differences between the representation of mutation in science fiction films from the 1950s and the present, and identifies distinctive changes over this time period, both in relation to the narrative causes of genetic disruption and in the aesthetics of its visual display. Discerning an increasingly abject quality to science fiction mutations from the 1970s onwards-as a progressive tendency to view the physically opened body, one that has a seemingly fluid interior-exterior reversal, or one that is almost beyond recognition as humanoid-the article connects a propensity for disgust to the corresponding socio-cultural and political zeitgeist. Specifically, it suggests that such imagery is tied to a more expansive 'structure of feeling', proposed by Raymond Williams and emergent since the 1970s, but gathering momentum in later decades, that reflects an 'opening up' of society in all its visual, socio-cultural and political configurations. Expressly, it parallels a change from a repressive, patriarchal society that constructed medicine as infallible and male doctors as omnipotent to one that is generally more liberated, transparent and equitable. Engaging theoretically with the concept of a 'structure of feeling', and critically with scientific, cinematic and cultural discourses, two post-1970s' 'mutation' films, The Fly (1986) and District 9 (2009), are considered in relation to their pre-1970s' predecessors, and their aesthetics related to the perceptions and articulations of the medical profession at their respective historic moments, locating such instances within a broader medico-political canvas.

### A widening longevity gap between people with schizophrenia and general population: a literature review and call for action [^a88eeeee]. Schizophrenia Research (2018). Low credibility.

Individuals with schizophrenia have higher mortality rates than the population at large. General mortality rates have declined in developed countries since the early 1970s, extending average lifespan by nearly a decade. This review of eight longitudinal studies of mortality in schizophrenia found that the mean standardized mortality ratio (SMR, a measure of mortality rate in schizophrenia compared to the general population) increased 37%, from 2.2 in the pre-1970s studies to 3.0 in the post-1970s reports. Major changes in societal stigma, healthcare, and economic policy are urgently warranted to ensure that this vulnerable segment of the population participates in the longevity revolution.

### Changing impact of modifiable risk factors on the incidence of major outcomes of type 1 diabetes: the Pittsburgh epidemiology of diabetes complications study [^dfbae246]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Another interesting result is that, like hypertension, microalbuminuria is still predictive in the 1970s cohort, but markedly less so than in it was the 1960s cohort. This effect may partially be explained by the observation that despite the decrease in the continuous values of albumin excretion rate from the 1960s to 1970s, many in the 1970s cohort still meet the definition of microalbuminuria. Thus, the microalbuminuria in the 1970s cohort is, on average, milder than that of the 1960s cohort. These findings also underscore the importance of microalbuminuria as a predictor of adverse outcome and are consistent with our recent confirmation over a 20-year follow-up period that micro- (or greater) albuminuria fully accounts for the excess mortality in type 1 diabetes, as was first shown in the Finnish Diabetic Nephropathy (FinnDiane) Study.

Another finding of interest is the observation that a history of ever smoking does not predict MOD in the 1960s cohort, where rates are high in both smokers (25%) and nonsmokers (22%). However, in the 1970s, rates remain similar in the smokers (23%) but have halved in the nonsmokers (12%), revealing a borderline risk factor (P = 0.07). The lack of a smoking effect seen in some diabetes studies may reflect a minimal impact of the formation of advanced glycation end products (one putative pathway for damage in smokers) in those with poor glycemic control (as here in the 1960s), when cumulative excess advanced glycation end product formation may be higher; thus, the added effect of smoking is small. In contrast, in the 1970s cohort, when glycemic control improves, this added risk factor emerges. Interestingly, the impact of current smoking shows a different pattern, being a major predictor in the 1960s cohort, but not in the 1970s.

### Multispecific drugs herald a new era of biopharmaceutical innovation [^9cc1264e]. Nature (2020). Excellent credibility.

The modern biopharmaceutical industry traces its roots to the dawn of the twentieth century, coincident with marketing of aspirin-a signature event in the history of modern drug development. Although the archetypal discovery process did not change markedly in the first seven decades of the industry, the past fifty years have seen two successive waves of transformative innovation in the development of drug molecules: the rise of 'rational drug discovery' methodology in the 1970s, followed by the invention of recombinant protein-based therapeutic agents in the 1980s. An incipient fourth wave is the advent of multispecific drugs. The successful development of prospectively designed multispecific drugs has the potential to reconfigure our ideas of how target-based therapeutic molecules can work, and what it is possible to achieve with them. Here I review the two major classes of multispecific drugs: those that enrich a therapeutic agent at a particular site of action and those that link a therapeutic target to a biological effector. The latter class-being freed from the constraint of having to directly modulate the target upon binding-may enable access to components of the proteome that currently cannot be targeted by drugs.

Vitamin D and obesity — research priorities emphasize definitive trials to define benefit thresholds, targets, and dosing. The guideline notes that "Large RCTs in participants with obesity will be required to determine if vitamin D lowers the risk of disease, whether benefit is limited to those with low baseline levels (and defining what these levels are), what target levels are required for optimal disease prevention, and what dosages are required to achieve these target levels/desired outcomes". It adds that "inclusion of several daily dosages and targeting several levels of 25(OH)D would inform the dosages and target levels required for disease prevention", and that "Clinical trials must be designed to be of sufficient duration to address the outcomes being examined", considering disease natural history and pathophysiology.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics by incidence status of MOD by diabetes diagnosis cohort in participants free of complication at baseline

In the 1960s cohort, the estimated 8-year incidence of MOD was 49.2% in those with hypertension at baseline and 16.5% in those without (Table 2), yielding a significant acceleration factor of 4.5 (P = 0.0002). The 1970s cohort showed a similar difference in 8-year MOD incidence by baseline hypertension (42.8 vs. 11.8%), and acceleration factor of 4.2 (P = 0.001) (Table 3). Three subgroups of those with hypertension were examined separately: BP ≥ 140/90 and untreated, ≥ 140/90 despite treatment with medication, or < 140/90 on treatment with medication. The group with successfully controlled hypertension accounted for 84% of the 32 participants with hypertension in the 1970s cohort, but nonetheless showed a significantly higher risk of MOD than those without hypertension (P = 0.001). The numbers were too small to obtain reliable comparisons in the other hypertension groups. When these analyses were repeating using a lower definition of hypertension (130/80 mmHg or medication), hypertension remained significantly predictive of MOD in both the 1960s and 1970s cohorts. Additionally, microalbuminuria was associated with accelerated MOD incidence in both cohorts, although to a greater degree in the 1960s cohort (k = 13.2, P < 0.0001 vs. 1970s, k = 3.0, P = 0.008), and these results did not differ when using an alternate definition of microalbuminuria that included the use of ACE inhibitors. Whereas hypertension and microalbuminuria were the only factors to predict MOD incidence in the 1970s cohort (Table 2), hypercholesterolemia (k = 2.5, P = 0.01), HbA 1c ≥ 8.4% (68 mmol/mol, median) (k = 4.7, P = 0.0005), and current smoking status at baseline (k = 3.1, P = 0.003) were all significantly predictive of MOD incidence in the 1960s cohort (Table 2). In alternate analyses, HbA 1c ≥ 8% (64 mmol/mol) showed similar results to the 8.4% cut point, being predictive only in the 1960s (k = 4.2, P = 0.003 vs. 1970s, k = 1.7, P = 0.20), as was HbA 1c ≥ 9% (75 mmol/mol) (k = 4.7, P = 0.0005 vs. 1970s, k = 1.1, P = 0.74). Using the alternate hypercholesterolemia cut point of LDL cholesterol ≥ 100 mg/dL also showed similar results to those above and was predictive of MOD only in the 1960s cohort. BMI was not associated with MOD incidence in either cohort.

### The early innovators of today's resurfacing condylar knees [^19e0f004]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2005). Low credibility.

The 1970s saw an explosion of ideas in the field of prosthetic knee arthroplasty. This paper is an effort to identify the innovators who contributed to the development of today's condylar total knee prostheses and the surgical techniques used to insert them. The 1970s were selected because most innovations occurred during those years. Two different design approaches were undertaken simultaneously. One was a functional approach whereas the other was a strictly anatomical approach. Initially, these 2 approaches led to very different designs. But the common goal of recreating human knee function eventually led to more similarities than differences. The author describes how, when, and why these dedicated individuals came to their ideas. The work is largely based on interviews and correspondence with those involved as well as on reviews of patents and papers pertaining to their work.

### Trends in the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus from the 1970s to the 1990s: the framingham heart study [^c59d536e]. Circulation (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Recent studies indicate that the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasing in the United States; less is known about trends in the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Methods and Results

Participants free of diabetes mellitus (n = 3104; mean age 47 years; 1587 women) from the Framingham Offspring Study who attended a routine examination in the 1970s, 1980s, or 1990s were followed up for the 8-year incidence of diabetes mellitus. Diabetes was defined as a fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L or treatment with either insulin or a hypoglycemic agent. Pooled logistic regression was used to compare diabetes incidence across decades for participants between 40 and 55 years of age in each decade. The age-adjusted 8-year incidence rate of diabetes was 2.0%, 3.0%, and 3.7% among women and 2.7%, 3.6%, and 5.8% among men in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, respectively. Compared with the 1970s, the age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio (OR) for diabetes was 1.40 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89 to 2.22) in the 1980s and 2.05 (95% CI, 1.33 to 3.14) in the 1990s (P for trend = 0.0006). Among women, the OR was 1.50 (95% CI, 0.75 to 2.98) in the 1980s and 1.84 (95% CI, 0.95 to 3.55) in the 1990s (P for trend = 0.07) compared with the 1970s, whereas among men, the OR was 1.33 (95% CI, 0.72 to 2.47) in the 1980s and 2.21 (95% CI, 1.25 to 3.90) in the 1990s (P for trend = 0.003). Most of the increase in absolute incidence of diabetes occurred in individuals with body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m² (P for trend = 0.03).

Conclusions

In the present community-based sample of middle-aged adults, we observed a doubling in the incidence of type 2 diabetes over the last 30 years. Careful surveillance of changes in diabetes incidence may be necessary if current trends of excess adiposity continue.

### Fatherlessness, sperm donors and' so what?' parentage: arguing against the immorality of donor conception through' world literature' [^3eb51944]. Medical Humanities (2022). Medium credibility.

'In the Force, very different each one of you are'.

Star Wars draws on a rich and ancient culture of mythical story-telling. It is not surprising to see similarities between Star Wars and the mythical examples Velleman refers to, including the themes of the displaced child, adoption, and unknown and rediscovered biological parentage. However, while the Star Wars saga is set in a 'galaxy a long time ago', it is a product of the 1970s and the development of the franchise coincides with the ART revolution.

The first film of the saga was released in the 1970s; a decade marked by crisis and hope. Miles Booy traces how the predicaments of the 1970s (Vietnam, Watergate, the illegal surveillance of citizens by the CIA, the energy crisis, etc) informed the making of Star Wars and argues that the films respond to 'the changing cultural landscape' (2021, 22). I agree with Booy that the 1970s was a 'polarising' time, and this polarity is also reflected in how the ART industry was being perceived following the birth of Louise Brown — the first IVF baby in 1978. Susan Golombok notes that this decade was a pivotal time in Western culture for how families were perceived: 'Changes to the structure of the family have been taking place since the 1970s', and these changes coincided with changing attitudes towards people identifying as LGBTQ+ and the growing gay rights and women's liberation movements (, 2–3). The birth of Brown was followed by IVF success in America in 1981 (2 years before Return of the Jedi). The growth of the industry, as evidenced by the increase in fertility clinics in the 1980s and 1990s, coincided with a torrent of breakthroughs in ART (such as greater success with frozen gametes and embryo transfers) and cultural shifts that welcomed treatment for same-sex couples, co-parents, solo people and unmarried couples.

### 1970s and' patient 0' HIV-1 genomes illuminate early HIV / AIDS history in north America [^8d8a6509]. Nature (2016). Excellent credibility.

The emergence of HIV-1 group M subtype B in North American men who have sex with men was a key turning point in the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Phylogenetic studies have suggested cryptic subtype B circulation in the United States (US) throughout the 1970s and an even older presence in the Caribbean. However, these temporal and geographical inferences, based upon partial HIV-1 genomes that postdate the recognition of AIDS in 1981, remain contentious and the earliest movements of the virus within the US are unknown. We serologically screened > 2,000 1970s serum samples and developed a highly sensitive approach for recovering viral RNA from degraded archival samples. Here, we report eight coding-complete genomes from US serum samples from 1978-1979-eight of the nine oldest HIV-1 group M genomes to date. This early, full-genome 'snapshot' reveals that the US HIV-1 epidemic exhibited extensive genetic diversity in the 1970s but also provides strong evidence for its emergence from a pre-existing Caribbean epidemic. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses estimate the jump to the US at around 1970 and place the ancestral US virus in New York City with 0.99 posterior probability support, strongly suggesting this was the crucial hub of early US HIV/AIDS diversification. Logistic growth coalescent models reveal epidemic doubling times of 0.86 and 1.12 years for the US and Caribbean, respectively, suggesting rapid early expansion in each location. Comparisons with more recent data reveal many of these insights to be unattainable without archival, full-genome sequences. We also recovered the HIV-1 genome from the individual known as 'Patient 0' (ref. 5) and found neither biological nor historical evidence that he was the primary case in the US or for subtype B as a whole. We discuss the genesis and persistence of this belief in the light of these evolutionary insights.

2. Estimates of Mortality from Contraceptive Use

One study gathered data from a variety of sources which have estimated the mortality rates associated with different methods of contraception at different ages (see Table III).41These estimates include the combined risk of death associated with contraceptive methods plus the risk attributable to pregnancy in the event of method failure. Each method of contraception has its specific benefits and risks. The study concluded that with the exception of oral contraceptive users 35 and older who smoke and 40 and older who do not smoke, mortality associated with all methods of birth control is low and below that associated with childbirth. The observation of a possible increase in risk of mortality with age for oral contraceptive users is based on data gathered in the 1970s — but not reported in the U.S. until 1983.16, 41However, current clinical practice involves the use of lower estrogen dose formulations combined with careful restriction of oral contraceptive use to women who do not have the various risk factors listed in this labeling.

Because of these changes in practice and, also, because of some limited new data which suggest that the risk of cardiovascular disease with the use of oral contraceptives may now be less than previously observed,78, 79the Fertility and Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee was asked to review the topic in 1989. The Committee concluded that although cardiovascular disease risks may be increased with oral contraceptive use after age 40 in healthy non-smoking women (even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women and with the alternative surgical and medical procedures which may be necessary if such women do not have access to effective and acceptable means of contraception.

Therefore, the Committee recommended that the benefits of oral contraceptive use by healthy non-smoking women over 40 may outweigh the possible risks. Of course, older women, as all women who take oral contraceptives, should take the lowest possible dose formulation that is effective.80

### Vitamin D supplementation and major cardiovascular events: D-health randomised controlled trial [^07040a2b]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study D-Health was published by Bridie Thompson and colleagues in 2023 in the journal BMJ. This study is related to the following diseases: ST-elevation myocardial infarction, Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and Acute ischemic stroke. In the D-Health study, the trial question was: what is the role of vitamin D supplementation in older adults? In the D-Health study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the D-Health study, the population was: 21302 patients (9777 female, 11525 male). The inclusion criteria were adult participants aged 60–84 years. The key exclusion criteria were self-reported hypercalcemia; hyperparathyroidism; kidney stones; osteomalacia; sarcoidosis; receipt of > 500 IU/day supplemental vitamin D; or unable to give consent because of language or cognitive impairment. In the D-Health study, the interventions were: n = 10658 vitamin D (oral dose of 60,000 IU/month for 5 years) n = 10644 placebo (matching oral placebo for 5 years). In the D-Health study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in major cardiovascular event (6% vs. 6.6%; HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.01). In the D-Health study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in myocardial infarction (1.8% vs. 2.2%; HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.98) No significant difference in coronary revascularization (3.9% vs. 4.3%; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01) No significant difference in stroke (1.6% vs. 1.6%; HR 0.99, 99% CI 0.8 to 1.23). In the D-Health study, the conclusion was: in adult participants aged 60–84 years, vitamin D was not superior to placebo with respect to major cardiovascular event.

ASCCP colposcopy standards — indications and benefits: The main indication for colposcopic examination is the evaluation of women at increased risk for cervical neoplasia, including those with abnormal or inconclusive cervical cancer screening tests, symptoms or signs of possible cervical cancer, including any suspicious cervical abnormality found during pelvic examination, abnormal genital tract bleeding, or unexplained cervicovaginal discharge, and past cytologic and/or pathologic anogenital tract abnormalities, treated or untreated. Colposcopy has been the standard of care for the evaluation of abnormal cervical cytology since its introduction in the United States in the 1970s, and the introduction of colposcopy with targeted biopsies provided accurate identification of cervical disease when present, as well as reassurance of the absence of disease in many cases, without the attendant risks and potential complications of conization. Colposcopy plays an equally important role on the opposite side of the cervical neoplasia spectrum — specifically, in reducing overtreatment of low-grade lesions.

Asbestos was used in up to 3,000 consumer products before government agencies began to phase it out in the 1970s, and until the 1970s many types of building products and insulation used in homes routinely contained asbestos. Vermiculite, described by USGS as a claylike material that expands when heated to form wormlike particles, ceased being mined in 1992 but old stocks may still be available. Example household sources and release conditions include steam pipes, boilers, and furnace ducts insulated with an asbestos blanket or asbestos paper tape, which may release fibers if damaged, repaired, or removed improperly.

### Genomic evidence of two-staged transmission of the early seventh cholera pandemic [^6614fdaa]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

It is perhaps not surprising that the seventh pandemic has diverged before it spread out of Indonesia. The precursor of the seventh pandemic clone was known to have caused outbreaks between 1937 and 1957 in the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia. Then in 1960, an outbreak of cholera occurred in Makassar (Sulawesi) and spread to other Asian countries in 1961 which was recognised as the year of the start of the seventh pandemic. Therefore, there were at least three years from 1957 for the seventh pandemic clone to diverge in Indonesia before it spread to other regions.

Stage 2 was marked by the spread to the Middle East as the last leg of cholera spread within Asia and crossing to Africa in the 1970s. At this stage, the seventh pandemic spread out of Asia to Africa as clusters CL6 and CL7. CL6 corresponded to Africa introduction event T1, which spread from the Middle Eastern countries to South, and North African countries in the 1970s. There were two subclusters identified in CL7. CL7.1 isolates circulated in the Middle East and East Africa in 1970s which corresponded to Africa introduction event T3. CL7.2 isolates were found mainly in Bangladesh and other Asian countries in the late 1970s. An isolate (M647) in Bangladesh in 1970 shared the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) with other isolates in CL7.2. We assumed that both CL7.1 and CL7.2 diverged from a common ancestor in 1970 with CL7.1 spreading to East Africa through the Middle Eastwhile CL7.2 remained in Asia, and was mostly sampled in Bangladesh.

### Henry J.M. barnett (1922–2016) [^25aecc54]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Their first study, published in 1978, was pharmaceutical. Since "certain drugs… were known to have an inhibitory effect on platelet function and had had promising results among patients with cerebrovascular disease", they tested the effect of a daily dose of 1300 mg of aspirin and 800 mg of sulfinpyrazone, together or alone, in 585 patients with transient ischaemic attacks or minor stroke. Sulfinpyrazone did not fulfil the expectations, but after more than 2 years, aspirin significantly reduced the risk of stroke or death, by 31% for all the patients. For women alone, the risk reduction was not significant. True enough, later studies were to show that the alleged 'aspirin resistance' of women was a chance finding, that the dose of aspirin could be much lower, and that other antiplatelet agents existed, but the Canadian study opened the field.

The other studies involved two different surgical interventions. Both had already been introduced, but mainly on the basis of theory; they had not yet been subjected to the rigour of controlled clinical trials. Bypass surgery, from the territory of the external carotid artery, was becoming en vogue in patients with symptoms of cerebral ischaemia associated with ipsilateral occlusion or stenosis of the carotid or middle cerebral artery. Unfortunately, Barney's multinational trial, published in 1985, failed to find a preventive effect on the occurrence of stroke or stroke-related death in 714 patients randomly assigned to surgical treatment, compared with 633 patients receiving best medical treatment. Carotid endarterectomy in the neck had been an even more common operation with the purpose of preventing stroke, despite concerns about lack of evidence. Barney, retired from hospital duties but continuing as head of a new research institute, launched in January 1988 a trial in 50 centres across Canada and the US; it was stopped after 3 years, after 659 patients with stenosis of 70–99% of the carotid artery had been randomised, because interim analysis showed a significant reduction for major or fatal ipsilateral stroke. Almost simultaneously, this result was confirmed by a European trial of 2200 patients, which had been running from 1981.

By the time of his death in 2016, Barney's contributions to the management of stroke had made him world-famous and earned him honours such as inclusion in the Canadian Hall of Fame and honorary doctorates from the Canadian universities of Western Ontario and Dalhousie, as well from Utrecht (The Netherlands) and from Oxford (UK).

2. ESTIMATES OF MORTALITY FROM CONTRACEPTIVE USE

One study gathered data from a variety of sources which have estimated the mortality rate associated with different methods of contraception at different ages (Table 3).

These estimates include the combined risk of death associated with contraceptive methods plus the risk attributable to pregnancy in the event of method failure. Each method of contraception has its specific benefits and risk. The study concluded that with the exception of oral contraceptive users 35 and older who smoke and 40 and older who do not smoke, mortality associated with all methods of birth control is low and below that associated with childbirth.

The observation of a possible increase in risk of mortality with age for oral contraceptive users is based on data gathered in the 1970s but not reported until 1983. However, current clinical practice involves the use of lower estrogen dose formulations combined with careful restriction of oral contraceptive use to women who do not have the various risk factors listed in this labeling.

Because of these changes in practice and, also, because of some limited new data which suggest that the risk of cardiovascular disease with the use of oral contraceptives may now be less than previously observed, the Fertility and Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee was asked to review the topic in 1989. The Committee concluded that although cardiovascular disease risk may be increased with oral contraceptive use after age 40 in healthy nonsmoking women (even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women and with the alternative surgical and medical procedures which may be necessary if such women do not have access to effective and acceptable means of contraception.

Therefore, the Committee recommended that the benefits of oral contraceptive use by healthy nonsmoking women over 40 may outweigh the possible risks. Of course, older women, as all women who take oral contraceptives, should take the lowest possible dose formulation that is effective.

### Trends in diabetes incidence: the framingham heart study [^7be43a58]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Obesity and type 2 diabetes continue to increase in prevalence in the U.S. Whether diabetes incidence continues to increase in recent times is less well documented. We examined trends in diabetes incidence over the previous four decades.

Research Design and Methods

Framingham Heart Study participants ages 40–55 years and free of diabetes at baseline (n = 4,795; mean age 45.3 years; 51.6% women) were followed for the development of diabetes in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. Diabetes was defined as either fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL or use of antidiabetes medication. Poisson regression was used to calculate sex-specific diabetes incidence rates for a 47-year-old individual in each decade. Rates were also calculated among obese, overweight, and normal weight individuals.

Results

The annualized rates of diabetes per 1,000 individuals were 2.6, 3.8, 4.7, and 3.0 (women) and 3.4, 4.5, 7.4, and 7.3 (men) in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, respectively. Compared with the 1970s, the age- and sex-adjusted relative risks of diabetes were 1.37 (95% CI 0.87–2.16; P = 0.17), 1.99 (95% CI 1.30–3.03; P = 0.001), and 1.81 (95% CI 1.16–2.82; P = 0.01) in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, respectively. Compared with the 1990s, the relative risk of diabetes in the 2000s was 0.85 (95% CI 0.61–1.20; P = 0.36).

Conclusions

In our community-based sample, the risk of new-onset diabetes continued to be higher in the 2000s compared with the 1970s. In the past decade, diabetes incidence remained steady despite the ongoing trend of rising adiposity.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^182f23e4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — evidence for diabetes prevention in adults with prediabetes: The commissioned systematic review included 11 RCTs on new-onset diabetes in adults with prediabetes (total of 5316 participants), conducted in India (n = 4), Iran (n = 1), Greece (n = 1), Norway (n = 1), Japan (n = 1), and the United States (n = 3). In pooled analyses, vitamin D reduced the risk of developing diabetes (RR 0.90 [95% CI, 0.81–1.00]), and including the DPVD trial produced similar results (RR 0.90 [95% CI, 0.81–0.99]). An individual participant data meta-analysis of the 3 vitamin D trials (total of 4190 participants) showed a 15% reduction in new-onset diabetes in adults with prediabetes randomized to vitamin D compared to placebo (HR 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75–0.96]). The beneficial effect of vitamin D on diabetes risk was described as consistent across subgroups by risk of bias or vitamin D dosage.

The number of RTCs crashes increased from 1964 to the mid-1970s. From the mid-1970s, the number of RTCs started decreasing (figure 1). The period of falling RTCs corresponds with the oil price crisis in the mid-1970s. RTCs started rising again in the mid-1980s, starting at around 8000 RTCs in the early to mid-1980s, the number increased to around 12 000 in 1992–1993 and then fell again to below 8000 in the early 2000 s. After that number of RTCs were increasing.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^c5dfcfc9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — adults with obesity: For screening of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), in adults with obesity, we suggest against routine screening for 25(OH)D levels (2 | ⊕⊕⚪⚪). Technical remarks note that 25(OH)D thresholds that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials and that this applies to generally healthy adults with obesity who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia). The evidence review identified no trials testing a screen-and-treat strategy for low 25(OH)D in people with obesity that improved prespecified outcomes.

### 100 years of the warburg effect: a historical perspective [^c5b35944]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Otto Warburg published the first paper describing what became known as the Warburg effect in 1923. All that was known about glucose metabolism at that time was that it occurred in two stages: (i) fermentation (glycolysis) in which glucose was converted to lactate, which did not require oxygen, and (ii) oxidative metabolism, in which the carbon atoms derived from glycolysis were fully oxidized to carbon dioxide, which did require oxygen. Warburg discovered that most tumour tissues produced a large amount of lactate that was reduced but not eliminated in the presence of oxygen, while most normal tissues produced a much smaller amount of lactate that was eliminated by the provision of oxygen. These findings were clearly well ahead of their time because it was another 80 years before they were to have any major impact, and even today the mechanisms underlying the Warburg effect are not completely understood.

### Paul ehrlich's magic bullet concept: 100 years of progress [^4d22324b]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2008). Medium credibility.

Exceptional advances in molecular biology and genetic research have expedited cancer drug development tremendously. The declared paradigm is the development of 'personalized and tailored drugs' that precisely target the specific molecular defects of a cancer patient. It is therefore appropriate to revisit the intellectual foundations of the development of such agents, as many have shown great clinical success. One hundred years ago, Paul Ehrlich, the founder of chemotherapy, received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. His postulate of creating 'magic bullets' for use in the fight against human diseases inspired generations of scientists to devise powerful molecular cancer therapeutics.

### Health system, community-based, or usual dementia care for persons with dementia and caregivers: the D-CARE randomized clinical trial [^352eb3b6]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study D-CARE (health system-based care) was published by David B Reuben and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Dementia. In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the trial question was: what is the role of health system-based care in community-dwelling persons living with dementia? In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the population was: 1160 patients (688 female, 472 male). The inclusion criteria were community-dwelling persons living with dementia and their caregivers. The key exclusion criteria were nursing home resident; hospice care; paid caregiver not a relative or close friend; cognitively impaired caregiver; unwilling or unable to provide self-reported outcome measures for 18 months. In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the interventions were: n = 1016 health system-based care (care provided by an advanced practice dementia care specialist) n = 144 usual care (care corresponding to traditional care). In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in least squares means for Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire severity score (9.8 points vs. 10.1 points; MD -0.33, 95% CI -1.32 to 0.67). In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in least squares means for Modified Caregiver Strain Index (10.7 points vs. 10.6 points; MD 0.14, 95% CI -0.7 to 0.99) No significant difference in PHQ-8 score (4.7 points vs. 4.69 points; MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.53 to 0.55) Significant increase in Caregiver Self-Efficacy score (15.1 points vs. 14.4 points; MD 0.7, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.14). In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in death and hospitalizations. In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the conclusion was: in community-dwelling persons living with dementia and their caregivers, health system-based care was not superior to usual care with respect to least squares means for Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire severity score.

### 100 years of physiology, discrimination and wonder [^a3146f45]. Diabetic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

7 CONCLUSION

In the 100 years since the discovery of insulin, some of the greatest advances in medicine have occurred studying diabetes. Insulin plays a fundamental role in metabolism and growth and has been highly conserved in evolution illustrating its importance. Strong evolutionary pressure has led to subtle changes which can be explained by understanding physiology. Treatment with insulin has evolved leading to new generations of people with diabetes experiencing very different care and relying on different tools to achieve good control. These improvements have allowed discrimination to be challenged.

### Psychological knowledge production about abortion: the politics of location and representation [^c0ed41e0]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2019). High credibility.

Background

Despite considerable psychology research being conducted on abortion, there has been no study of the history of psychological knowledge production on the topic. The aim of our research was to analyse journal articles published in English language psychology journals using a politics of location and of representation analytical lens.

Study Design

A systematic search for articles published on abortion in psychology journals from 1960 to 2015 was conducted. A mixed-method approach (content analysis and narrative review) was used to analyse the dataset. Articles were coded according to: decade of publication, region, types of research conducted, and main issues focused on. A narrative review of the dominant issue researched - psychological consequences - in two decades (the 1970s and 2000s) was conducted.

Results

Knowledge production began in the 1970s in most regions featured in the dataset and in the 1990s in South Africa. Research is dominated by quantitative studies conducted in North America and Europe concerning the demarcation of psychological consequences of abortion performed under safe conditions. In the 1970s, abortion was viewed as leading to benign psychological consequences, but by the 2000s traumatology talk was firmly entrenched. Only one article, emanating from South Africa, addressed the question of unsafe abortion.

Conclusions

Knowledge production in psychology needs to move beyond a narrow focus on the psychological consequences of abortion and attitudes to abortion. Nuanced, contextualised research of the psychology of both safe and unsafe abortion is necessary.

### Imaging, navigation, and robotics in spine surgery [^2e306d57]. Spine (2016). Low credibility.

Spinal technology involves imaging, navigation, and robotics-collectively known as "image-guided therapy". Imaging coupled with navigation enhances visualization of irregular anatomy, enabling less invasive procedures. With robotics surgeons can perform quicker and safer hand movements with increased accuracy. In the 1890s, X-rays were invented by Roentgen. The first piece of X-ray equipment, the Cryptoscope, would take an image for 15 minutes, with the surgeon placing his hand in front of the beam to guide calibration; radiation exposure for both surgeon and patient was extreme. In the 1950s, fluoroscopy (C-arm) was invented. In the 1970s, computer-assisted tomography (CAT), known as CAT scan, became available; magnetic resonance imaging had its beginnings in the 1980s, and in 1985, the first robotic surgery was performed to obtain a neurosurgical biopsy specimen. The concept of navigation was introduced in the 1990s, and today's niche products for navigation came onto the market in the 2000s.

In the D-CARE (community-based care) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the D-CARE (community-based care) study, the population was: 1160 patients (660 female, 500 male). The inclusion criteria were community-dwelling persons living with dementia and their caregivers. The key exclusion criteria were nursing home resident; hospice care; paid caregiver not a relative or close friend; cognitively impaired caregiver; unwilling or unable to provide self-reported outcome measures for 18 months. In the D-CARE (community-based care) study, the interventions were: n = 1016 community-based care (care provided by a social worker, nurse, or licensed therapist care consultant) n = 144 usual care (care corresponding to traditional care). In the D-CARE (community-based care) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in least squares means for Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire severity score (9.5 points vs. 10.1 points; MD -0.62, 95% CI -1.61 to 0.37). In the D-CARE (community-based care) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in least squares means for Modified Caregiver Strain Index (10.5 points vs. 10.6 points; MD -0.1, 95% CI -0.94 to 0.74) No significant difference in PHQ-8 score (4.42 points vs. 4.69 points; MD -0.27, 95% CI -0.81 to 0.27) Significant increase in Caregiver Self-Efficacy score (15.2 points vs. 14.4 points; MD 0.85, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.29).

### The changing faces of leadership in surgery: study on presidents of major surgical organizations [^04e9cb91]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

To gain an understanding of the changing faces of leadership in surgery, we examined trends in the demographics, additional degrees pursued, and scientific publication characteristics of the past presidents of three major surgery organizations.

Methods

We queried the BoardCertifiedDocs and Web of Science databases for the demographics, as well as the quantity and quality of publications, of the past presidents of the Association for Academic Surgery, Society of University Surgeons, and American College of Surgeons from 1970 to 2020. Data were analyzed by decade to identify any trends.

Results

We identified a total of 140 presidents from the organizations. The proportion of female presidents significantly increased from the 1990s to the 2010s (10% versus 33%, P < 0.05). The percentage of non-White presidents increased from the 1970s to the 2010s (3.33% versus 21.2%, P = 0.024). The percentage of presidents with additional degrees also increased from the 1970s to the 2010s (10.0% versus 48.8%, P = 0.039). During this same time period, the most common area of expertise of presidents shifted from cardiothoracic surgery to surgical oncology. The ratio of presidents' postinduction to preinduction publications was significantly increased among all three organizations in the 2010s compared to the 1970s (P < 0.05). Co-cluster analysis revealed a research topic change from the 1970s to the 2010s.

Conclusions

The faces of surgical leadership have changed in terms of gender equality, racial diversity, surgical subspecialty, and additional degrees held. Such a transformation mirrors evolving diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, and it further highlights the adaptability of surgical leadership to the ever-changing landscape of surgery.

### The impact of marijuana policies on youth: clinical, research, and legal update [^6fee22f5]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

International experiences with decriminalization — Portugal and the Netherlands: In Portugal, in the 5 to 10 years after laws decriminalizing all drug use and possession, twice as many people sought addiction treatment compared with before 2001, and reported youth marijuana use increased during that time; since 2001, Portugal has had decreased HIV infection from injection drug use but some increases in heroin use and drug-related crimes in some locales. In the Netherlands, current use has declined since the 1970s, with Dutch youth ages 15 to 24 around 11% versus an 8.4% average across other European Union nations, and both rates are lower than in the United States.

### SAGES guideline for clinical application of laparoscopic bariatric surgery [^95ee577f]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2009). Medium credibility.

Evolution of contemporary surgical options — The original operation for morbid obesity, the jejunoileal bypass, was first performed in 1954, with shifts away from purely malabsorptive procedures; biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) was first described in the 1970s with duodenal switch (DS) in 1993, and gastric bypass was introduced by Mason in 1966 as a combined restrictive-malabsorptive procedure. As of 2003, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RGB) accounted for over 80% of all bariatric procedures done in the USA, and laparoscopic RGB was popularized and validated in the early 1990s by Wittgrove and Clark. Techniques for laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy include transoral circular stapler, transgastric circular stapler, linear stapler, and handsewn, and all are supported in the literature as producing similar safety and weight loss results.

### Hippocrates' influence on the origins of neurosurgery [^d7d31203]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

Hippocrates is widely considered the father of medicine. His contributions revolutionized the practice of medicine and laid the foundation for modern-day neurosurgery. He inspired several generations to follow his vision, by pioneering the rigorous clinical evaluation of cranial and spinal disorders and combining this approach with a humanistic and ethical perspective focused on the individuality of the patient. His legacy has forever shaped the field of medicine and his cumulative works on head injuries and spinal deformities led to the basic understanding of many of the fundamental neurosurgical principles in use today.

Lead paint — primary source and housing-related risk explains that in the United States, the primary source of childhood lead exposure is lead-based paint and paint dust. Paint manufacturers began phasing out lead in paint in the 1950s, but lead was not banned in residential paints in the United States until 1978, and older homes are more likely to contain lead paint. Lead paint chips and dust can contaminate a home and be ingested by children when the paint is deteriorated or when home renovation projects occur.

### Preventing excessive noise exposure in infants, children, and adolescents [^52927763]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

E. Toys — measured noise from common toy types shows potential for high exposure: sound levels for 7 squeaking toys at 10 cm (4 in) were 78 to 108 dBA, analysis of 11 moving toys showed 82 to 100 dBA at 10 cm, and authors noted that levels of 130 to 140 dBA could be achieved if toys were held close to the ear, creating a closed chamber effect with a high risk of NIHL; the researchers recommended that ear protectors are needed when toy weapons are used and that manufacturers add warning labels about the risk of NIHL.
