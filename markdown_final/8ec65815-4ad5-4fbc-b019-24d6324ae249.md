Formulate and justify the stepwise selection of medical and surgical
treatment options of acute and chronic otitis media

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to formulate and justify a stepwise selection of medical and surgical treatment options for managing acute otitis media (AOM), otitis media with effusion (OME), and chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about accurate diagnosis and classification because treatment hinges on distinguishing AOM from OME and CSOM. Then, I should verify initial management priorities, especially pain control and the decision to observe versus treat with antibiotics. Next, I will review antibiotic selection, dosing, and duration, followed by follow-up and escalation if there is no improvement. After that, I need to consider surgical indications for recurrent AOM and persistent OME, including adenoidectomy nuances. Finally, I will address CSOM management, special populations, and documentation/outcomes tracking, ensuring each step aligns with guideline strength and evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic foundation, because misclassification drives overtreatment and undertreatment; AOM requires acute symptoms plus middle ear effusion plus signs of inflammation, with bulging of the tympanic membrane being the most reliable otoscopic finding, whereas OME is fluid without acute inflammatory signs, and CSOM implies persistent drainage through a perforation or with a tympanostomy tube in place [^1154NTQj] [^11378QAH] [^114m67Gm]. Hold on, I should verify that pneumatic otoscopy is prioritized for OME confirmation and that tympanometry can be used when otoscopy is uncertain, which the OME guideline supports, and I should remember that guidelines assume a high-certainty AOM diagnosis before applying treatment algorithms [^112YAxw6] [^116fLhfv].

> Next, I should review pain control because it is the universal first priority; I need to ensure analgesia is offered to all children with AOM regardless of antibiotic decision, since pain relief is essential and antibiotics do not provide immediate analgesia, with acetaminophen or ibuprofen as first-line agents and topical analgesics avoided if the tympanic membrane is perforated or tympanostomy tubes are present [^117JTqVo] [^114pQr6t]. Wait, let me verify that this applies even when observation is chosen; yes, pain management is independent of antibiotic use and should be continued as long as needed [^117JTqVo].

> Now, I will examine the initial management decision for AOM: treat immediately versus observe with a safety net; I should confirm that observation is appropriate only when diagnosis is certain, the child is older than 6 months, there is no severe illness, and reliable follow-up is assured, with antibiotics started if symptoms worsen or fail to improve within 48–72 hours [^112zwNdR] [^112KSmBB]. I need to check age-specific thresholds: for children 6–23 months, observation is reasonable for unilateral nonsevere disease, but bilateral disease or severe symptoms warrant immediate antibiotics; for children 24 months and older, observation is reasonable for unilateral or bilateral nonsevere disease, again with a strict 48–72 hour reassessment plan [^1162orWZ] [^111eTJjM] [^116fLhfv]. Hold on, I should verify that severe features include moderate to severe otalgia, otalgia lasting at least 48 hours, or fever of 39°C or higher, which trigger a strong recommendation for antibiotics in children 6 months and older [^116na4A4] [^112QStUz].

> I will now examine antibiotic selection; first-line therapy is amoxicillin at 80–90 mg/kg/day divided twice daily in the absence of recent amoxicillin exposure, concurrent purulent conjunctivitis, or recurrent AOM unresponsive to amoxicillin, and I should double-check that this remains the most cost-effective and guideline-endorsed choice [^116ujukL] [^1173F3P5]. But wait, what if risk factors for beta-lactamase producers or resistant pneumococcus are present? In that case, I should add beta-lactamase coverage with high-dose amoxicillin–clavulanate (90 mg/kg/day of the amoxicillin component with 6.4 mg/kg/day of clavulanate in a 14:1 ratio, divided twice daily) or use ceftriaxone, reserving clindamycin for severe penicillin allergy and considering tympanocentesis if multiple failures occur [^114FpdgU] [^114HRxCA]. I should confirm duration: 10 days for children under 2 years or with severe symptoms, 7 days for ages 2–5 with mild to moderate disease, and 5–7 days for children 6 years and older with mild to moderate disease, balancing efficacy and adherence [^1135fz6j].

> Next, I should review follow-up and escalation; I need to ensure reassessment at 48–72 hours if symptoms persist or worsen, and if there is no improvement, I should switch to amoxicillin–clavulanate or ceftriaxone, consider tympanocentesis for persistent nonresponse, and obtain ENT consultation for recurrent or refractory disease, documenting the rationale for any changes [^116ZUjvu] [^113y75pc] [^114HRxCA]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; persistent effusion alone is not a failure criterion, so I should confirm that clinical deterioration or lack of improvement in pain and fever guide the decision to alter therapy rather than persistent middle ear fluid on exam [^112gPhkU].

> Let me consider recurrent AOM; I should confirm the definition of 3 episodes in 6 months or 4 in 12 months with at least 1 in the prior 6 months, and I need to verify that tympanostomy tubes are an option when effusion is present at the time of candidacy assessment, while tubes should not be placed for recurrent AOM without concurrent effusion [^114KJyqh] [^116QBPW5] [^117WX85Y]. Wait, I initially thought tubes were indicated solely by episode count, but I should correct that: contemporary guidance emphasizes offering bilateral tympanostomy tubes for recurrent AOM with unilateral or bilateral effusion at evaluation, reflecting the role of persistent MEE in pathophysiology and outcomes [^116QBPW5]. I should also remember that prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended for recurrent AOM due to limited benefit and resistance concerns, so shared decision-making is essential when considering surgery [^114dCz5f].

> For OME, I need to ensure a structured watchful waiting approach; I should confirm offering observation for 3 months from onset or diagnosis in children not at risk, with hearing testing if effusion persists for 3 months or at any time in at-risk children, and I should avoid antibiotics, corticosteroids, antihistamines, and decongestants because they do not improve long-term outcomes and carry harms [^1142nRLf] [^1131Dqsw] [^115TsK36] [^113YZN92] [^115cw4ZV]. Hold on, I should verify that at-risk children include those with speech-language delay, developmental disability, craniofacial anomalies, or cleft palate, who merit closer surveillance and earlier intervention if effusion persists [^114G4Uh5].

> I will now examine surgical indications for OME; I should confirm that tympanostomy tubes are offered for bilateral OME lasting 3 months or longer with documented hearing difficulties, and considered for chronic OME with symptoms attributable to effusion such as balance problems, school or behavioral issues, or reduced quality of life, with adenoidectomy considered as an adjunct in children aged 4 years and older or when there are distinct adenoid-related indications like nasal obstruction or chronic adenoiditis [^114VNq7z] [^114r7BTp] [^1122fYub]. Wait, let me verify age-related nuances: in children under 4 years, adenoidectomy is not recommended as a primary OME treatment, whereas in children 4 years and older, adenoidectomy can reduce future surgery and relapse, supporting shared decision-making about combined procedures [^1131Dqsw] [^112EPWma].

> For CSOM, I need to ensure aural toilet and topical therapy are prioritized; I should confirm meticulous debridement and use of topical fluoroquinolone drops, which are preferred when the tympanic membrane is perforated or tubes are present because they are non-ototoxic, and I should avoid systemic antibiotics unless there is extension beyond the ear canal or specific host risk factors, in which case imaging and ENT involvement may be required [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify that persistent or complicated CSOM warrants ENT referral for possible surgical management, including tympanoplasty or mastoid procedures, to achieve a safe, dry ear and prevent complications [^113N8BUY].

> Special populations require tailored decisions; I should double-check that Indigenous and other high-risk children have higher burdens of disease and may benefit from more aggressive prevention and earlier surgical evaluation, and that infants under 6 months with AOM generally warrant immediate antibiotics and urgent assessment given immature immunity and higher complication risk [^notfound]. Let me reconsider vaccine strategies as well; pneumococcal conjugate vaccination reduces AOM incidence and should be emphasized in prevention counseling, aligning with broader public health measures [^11378QAH].

> Finally, I need to ensure robust documentation and outcome tracking; I should confirm that clinicians record laterality, duration, and severity at each visit, counsel families on natural history and follow-up plans, and document resolution of effusion, improved hearing, or improved quality of life as key outcomes when managing OME, with periodic reassessment until effusion resolves or new concerns arise [^1131Dqsw] [^116dAKSh] [^112JpuvH]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should verify that this documentation requirement extends to AOM care as well; while explicitly detailed in the OME guideline, similar principles of tracking symptoms, interventions, and outcomes apply to AOM follow-up and are consistent with evidence-based pediatric care [^116ZUjvu].

A stepwise approach to otitis media (OM) balances symptom control, infection control, and risk of recurrence or complications [^11378QAH]. For **acute OM**, prioritize analgesia [^117JTqVo], observe if nonsevere [^116fLhfv], and use **amoxicillin first-line** [^116ujukL] when antibiotics are indicated; escalate to amoxicillin-clavulanate [^114HRxCA] or ceftriaxone [^114HRxCA] if no improvement in 48–72 hours [^116ZUjvu]. For **chronic OM**, use watchful waiting for OME [^1142nRLf] and consider tympanostomy tubes for persistent effusion with hearing loss or recurrent AOM [^114VNq7z]; reserve adenoidectomy for children ≥ 4 years or with adenoid pathology [^1122fYub]. Surgery is indicated for complications or refractory disease [^114Jov9u], with tympanostomy as the primary intervention [^117WBZDL] and mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma or mastoiditis [^114Jov9u].

## Stepwise management of acute otitis media (AOM)

### Initial assessment and diagnosis

- **Accurate diagnosis**: Use pneumatic otoscopy [^112YAxw6] to confirm AOM (bulging TM, middle ear effusion, acute symptoms) and distinguish from OME [^111ujbcy].

- **Severity assessment**: Classify as severe (moderate/severe otalgia ≥ 48 h or fever ≥ 39°C) [^116na4A4] or nonsevere.

---

### Medical management

#### Symptomatic treatment

For symptomatic relief, **analgesia** [^117JTqVo] is recommended for all patients, with acetaminophen or ibuprofen as first-line agents [^notfound]. Observation is appropriate for nonsevere cases in children ≥ 6 months with close follow-up and a 48–72 hour safety net [^112zwNdR] [^112KSmBB].

---

#### Antibiotic therapy

- **Indications**: Severe symptoms, bilateral AOM in 6–23 months [^115Draen], or nonsevere cases in which observation is not feasible or preferred [^116fLhfv].

- **First-line antibiotic**: Amoxicillin 80–90 mg/kg/day divided BID [^111a7pz8] if no recent amoxicillin, no concurrent purulent conjunctivitis, and no recurrent AOM unresponsive to amoxicillin [^114FpdgU].

- **Second-line antibiotic**: Amoxicillin-clavulanate (90 mg/kg/day amoxicillin, 6.4 mg/kg/day clavulanate) [^114HRxCA] if recent amoxicillin, purulent conjunctivitis, or recurrent AOM unresponsive to amoxicillin [^114FpdgU].

- **Duration**: 10 days for < 2 years or severe symptoms; 7 days for 2–5 years with mild/moderate symptoms; 5–7 days for ≥ 6 years with mild/moderate symptoms [^1135fz6j].

---

### Follow-up and escalation

Reassess within **48–72 hours** [^116ZUjvu]; if there is no improvement, switch to amoxicillin-clavulanate or ceftriaxone, or perform tympanocentesis with specialist consultation [^114HRxCA].

---

## Stepwise management of chronic otitis media (COM)

### Chronic otitis media with effusion (OME)

#### Initial assessment and diagnosis

For initial assessment, **diagnosis** relies on pneumatic otoscopy [^1153D6TN] and tympanometry to confirm effusion and exclude AOM [^117WBZDL]. Hearing assessment is indicated if effusion persists ≥ 3 months or if the child is at risk for developmental sequelae [^1131Dqsw].

---

#### Medical management

Watchful waiting is recommended for 3 months [^1142nRLf] from onset or diagnosis in children not at risk [^115UoGJR]. During this period, **medical therapy** with systemic antibiotics, corticosteroids, antihistamines, or decongestants is not recommended [^115TsK36] [^113YZN92] [^112YAxw6].

---

#### Surgical management

- **Tympanostomy tubes**: Offer for bilateral OME ≥ 3 months with documented hearing difficulties [^114VNq7z] or persistent effusion with symptoms (balance, school/behavioral issues, reduced QoL) [^114r7BTp].

- **Adenoidectomy**: Consider as adjunct in children ≥ 4 years or with adenoid pathology (obstruction, chronic adenoiditis) [^1122fYub].

- **Do not perform**: Tympanostomy for single OME episode < 3 months [^112GxUXr] or adenoidectomy alone in children < 4 years without indication [^111dH9J5].

---

### Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM)

#### Initial assessment and diagnosis

For initial assessment, **diagnosis** is based on persistent otorrhea through a perforated TM or tympanostomy tube for ≥ 3 months [^notfound]. Obtain cultures to guide therapy and assess for complications (cholesteatoma, mastoiditis, hearing loss) [^114Jov9u].

---

#### Medical management

For medical management, perform **aural toilet** with regular debridement and dry-ear precautions. Topical therapy with non-ototoxic fluoroquinolone drops is first-line [^115o9R8F]; reserve systemic antibiotics for extensive disease or complications [^113YUrtu].

---

#### Surgical management

- **Tympanoplasty**: For persistent perforation or refractory disease [^notfound].

- **Mastoidectomy**: For cholesteatoma or mastoiditis [^notfound].

- **Tympanostomy tubes**: For recurrent AOM with effusion or persistent drainage [^116QBPW5].

## Stepwise management of OM

| **Step** | **Acute OM** | **Chronic OM (OME)** | **Chronic OM (CSOM)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | Accurate diagnosis (otoscopy) [^116E8E4w] | Accurate diagnosis (otoscopy, tympanometry) [^112YAxw6] | Accurate diagnosis (culture, assess complications) [^114Jov9u] |
| 2 | Analgesia [^117JTqVo] | Watchful waiting (3 months) [^1142nRLf] | Aural toilet [^notfound] |
| 3 | Observe vs antibiotics [^112zwNdR] | Hearing assessment [^1131Dqsw] | Topical fluoroquinolone drops [^notfound] |
| 4 | Amoxicillin first-line [^116ujukL] | Tympanostomy tubes if persistent [^114VNq7z] | Systemic antibiotics if extensive [^notfound] |
| 5 | Escalate if no improvement [^114HRxCA] | Adenoidectomy if ≥ 4 years [^112EPWma] | Surgery (tympanoplasty, mastoidectomy) [^113N8BUY] |

---

A stepwise approach to OM prioritizes **accurate diagnosis**, symptom control, and judicious use of antibiotics, with escalation to surgery for persistent effusion, recurrent disease, or complications [^115vFj9E].

OM, though frequent and seemingly simple to evaluate and manage, remains a treatment challenge. Increasingly sophisticated clinical trials assessing OM medical treatment efficacy and outcome have demonstrated that many treatment regimens that were commonly used a decade ago are no longer recommended. Surgical therapy for OM, though remaining the same, has come under intense scrutiny from several angles but still plays a central role for this disease. Given the multiple facets of OM, its frequency, and its potential to cause short- and long-term morbidity in children, the next decade is sure to bring further treatment innovations.

Acute otitis media guideline — evidence-based statement definitions and implications set four tiers with specific clinician guidance: For Strong Recommendation, "A strong recommendation in favor of a particular action is made when the anticipated benefits of the recommended intervention clearly exceed the harms (as a strong recommendation against an action is made when the anticipated harms clearly exceed the benefits) and the quality of the supporting evidence is excellent", and "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present". For Recommendation, "A recommendation in favor of a particular action is made when the anticipated benefits exceed the harms, but the quality of evidence is not as strong", with the implication that "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". For Option, "Options define courses that may be taken when either the quality of evidence is suspect or carefully performed studies have shown little clear advantage to 1 approach over another", and "Clinicians should consider the option in their decision-making, and patient preference may have a substantial role". For No Recommendation, "No recommendation indicates that there is a lack of pertinent published evidence and that the anticipated balance of benefits and harms is presently unclear", and "Clinicians should be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit versus harm".

Chronic ear disease encompasses a wide range of clinical entities amenable to medical and surgical intervention. The otolaryngologist must always consider the goals of surgery — first and foremost to achieve a safe ear. The least invasive procedure capable of eradicating disease is generally chosen. During surgery, a delicate balance has to exist between the careful preservation of function and the aggressive prevention of potentially recurrent disease. Postoperatively, thorough follow-up and good judgment are paramount in avoiding complications and preventing unnecessary additional surgical procedures.

The incidence of complications of chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma has decreased since the proliferation of antibiotics early in the twentieth century. However, these complications continue to occur, and can be lethal if they are not identified and treated properly. Therapy for the complications associated with chronic otitis media, unlike that of acute otitis media, usually involves surgical intervention. As medical (antibiotic) therapy continues to improve, and new imaging techniques are introduced, less invasive treatment modalities may be shown to be as effective as the classic, time-tested, surgical options.

### Contemporary concepts in management of acute otitis media in children [^116E8E4w]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common disease of childhood. AOM is most appropriately diagnosed by careful otoscopy with an understanding of clinical signs and symptoms. The distinction between AOM and chronic otitis media with effusion should be emphasized. Treatment should include pain management, and initial antibiotic treatment should be given to those most likely to benefit, including young children, children with severe symptoms, and those with otorrhea and/or bilateral AOM. Tympanostomy tube placement may be helpful for those who experience frequent episodes of AOM or fail medical therapy. Recent practice guidelines may assist the clinician with such decisions.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^115vFj9E]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) guideline — this evidence-based clinical practice guideline provides recommendations to primary care clinicians for the management of children from 6 months through 12 years of age with uncomplicated AOM and focuses on appropriate diagnosis and initial treatment. The guideline provides a specific, stringent definition of AOM and addresses pain management, initial observation versus antibiotic treatment, appropriate choices of antibiotic agents, and preventive measures, and it also addresses recurrent AOM. Decisions were made on the basis of a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and benefit-harm relationships, and the practice guideline underwent comprehensive peer review before formal approval by the American Academy of Pediatrics. The guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance; rather, it is intended to assist primary care clinicians by providing a framework for clinical decision-making, not to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all children, and these recommendations may not provide the only appropriate approach to management.

### Panel 7: otitis media: treatment and complications [^114WLTvd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective We aimed to summarize key articles published between 2011 and 2015 on the treatment of (recurrent) acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion, tympanostomy tube otorrhea, chronic suppurative otitis media and complications of otitis media, and their implications for clinical practice. Data Sources PubMed, Ovid Medline, the Cochrane Library, and Clinical Evidence (BMJ Publishing). Review Methods All types of articles related to otitis media treatment and complications between June 2011 and March 2015 were identified. A total of 1122 potential related articles were reviewed by the panel members; 118 relevant articles were ultimately included in this summary. Conclusions Recent literature and guidelines emphasize accurate diagnosis of acute otitis media and optimal management of ear pain. Watchful waiting is optional in mild to moderate acute otitis media; antibiotics do shorten symptoms and duration of middle ear effusion. The additive benefit of adenoidectomy to tympanostomy tubes in recurrent acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion is controversial and age dependent. Topical antibiotic is the treatment of choice in acute tube otorrhea. Symptomatic hearing loss due to persistent otitis media with effusion is best treated with tympanostomy tubes. Novel molecular and biomaterial treatments as adjuvants to surgical closure of eardrum perforations seem promising. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of complementary and alternative treatments. Implications for Practice Emphasis on accurate diagnosis of otitis media, in its various forms, is important to reduce overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and antibiotic resistance. Children at risk for otitis media and its complications deserve special attention.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion executive summary (update) [^117Y9bUu]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation has published a supplement to this issue of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery featuring the updated "Clinical Practice Guideline: Otitis Media with Effusion". To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 18 recommendations developed emphasize diagnostic accuracy, identification of children who are most susceptible to developmental sequelae from otitis media with effusion, and education of clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most otitis media with effusion and the lack of efficacy for medical therapy (eg, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants). An updated guideline is needed due to new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.

### Acute and chronic otitis media [^111Vms3B]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Otitis media (OM) is a common illness in young children. OM has historically been associated with frequent and severe complications. Nowadays it is usually a mild condition that often resolves without treatment. For most children, progression to tympanic membrane perforation and chronic suppurative OM is unusual (low-risk populations); this has led to reevaluation of many interventions that were used routinely in the past. Evidence from a large number of randomized controlled trials can help when discussing treatment options with families. Indigenous children in the United States, Canada, Northern Europe, Australia, and New Zealand experience more OM than other children. In some places, Indigenous children continue to suffer from the most severe forms of the disease. Communities with more than 4% of the children affected by chronic tympanic membrane perforation have a major public health problem (high-risk populations). Higher rates of invasive pneumococcal disease, pneumonia, and chronic suppurative lung disease (including bronchiectasis) are also seen. These children will often benefit from effective treatment of persistent (or recurrent) bacterial infection.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^115Ssjx4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion guideline — evidence-based statements and clinical judgment state that guidelines are intended to reduce inappropriate variations in clinical care, produce optimal health outcomes for patients, and minimize harm; the evidence-based approach requires that evidence be identified, appraised, and summarized with an explicit link between evidence and statements, and statements reflect both the quality of evidence and the balance of benefit and harm. Guidelines are never intended to supplant professional judgment; less frequent variation in practice is expected for a strong recommendation than with a recommendation, options offer the most opportunity for practice variability, and Clinicians should always act and decide in a way that they believe will best serve their individual patients' interests and needs, regardless of guideline recommendations.

American Academy of Pediatrics evidence approach and scope — Guideline development "using an evidence-based approach requires that all evidence related to the guideline is gathered in a systematic fashion, objectively assessed, and then described so readers can easily see the links between the evidence and recommendations made". The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) framed key questions including: "Diagnosis of AOM: What are the operating characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios) of clinical symptoms and otoscopic findings (such as bulging TM) to diagnose uncomplicated AOM and to distinguish it from OME?", "What has been the effect of the use of heptavalent PCV7 on AOM microbial epidemiology, what organisms (bacterial and viral) are associated with AOM since the introduction of PCV7, and what are the patterns of antimicrobial resistance in AOM since the introduction of PCV7?", "What is the comparative effectiveness of various treatment options for treating uncomplicated AOM in average risk children?", "What is the comparative effectiveness of different management options for recurrent OM (uncomplicated) and persistent OM or relapse of AOM?", "Do treatment outcomes in Questions 3 and 4 differ by characteristics of the condition (AOM), patient, environment, and/or health care delivery system?", and "What adverse effects have been observed for treatments for which outcomes are addressed in Questions 3 and 4?" Searches for the review included "PubMed and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Education Resources Information Center… for publications from 1998 through June 2010", and "The Web of Science was also used to search for citations of the 2001 report and its peer-reviewed publications".

### Treatment and prevention of otitis media [^113tSKY3]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

To review and summarize recent advances in the treatment and prevention of otitis media (OM).

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1996-March 2000) was performed to identify relevant primary and review articles. References from these articles were also reviewed if deemed important.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language primary and review articles focusing on the treatment and prevention of acute otitis media (AOM) were included. Studies focusing exclusively on OM with effusion or serous OM and chronic suppurative OM were excluded. Information regarding prevention and drug therapy was reviewed, with an emphasis placed on advances made in the last two years.

Data Synthesis

Recently, an expert panel of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended use of only three of 16 systemic antibiotics approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of AOM: amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, and ceftriaxone. Controversy exists over the importance of key selection factors used by the expert panel in determining which antibiotics to recommend in a two-step treatment algorithm, that is, in vitro data, pharmacodynamic profiles, and necessity for coverage of drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae at all steps of empiric treatment. Additional antibiotic and patient selection factors useful for individualizing therapy include clinical efficacy, adverse effects, frequency and duration of administration, taste, cost, comorbid infections, and ramifications should bacterial resistance develop to the chosen antibiotic. Presumed or past patient/caregiver adherence (especially when antibiotic failure has occurred) is also paramount in selecting antibiotic therapy. A three-step treatment algorithm for refractory AOM that employs amoxicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), or high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (depending on the prior dose of and adherence to amoxicillin therapy), and ceftriaxone or tympanocentesis at steps 1, 2, and 3, respectively, appears rational and cost-effective. The recent upsurge in antimicrobial resistance is highlighted, and recommendations are presented for the treatment of AOM and prevention of recurrent otitis media (rAOM).

Conclusions

Amoxicillin remains the antibiotic of choice for initial empiric treatment of AOM, although the traditional dosage should be increased in patients at risk for drug-resistant S. pneumoniae. In cases refractory to high-dose amoxicillin, TMP/SMX should be prescribed if adherence to prior therapy seemed good or complete, or high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate if adherence was incomplete or questionable. Ceftriaxone should be reserved as third-line treatment. The increasing prevalence of drug-resistant S. pneumoniae emphasizes the importance of alternative medical approaches for the prevention of OM, as well as judicious antibiotic use in established cases. Removal of modifiable risk factors should be first-line therapy for prevention of rAOM. We support the use of conjugate pneumococcal vaccine per guidelines for prevention of rAOM from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with consideration given to influenza vaccine for cases of rAOM that historically worsen during the flu season. Sulfisoxazole prophylaxis should be reserved for children who are immunocompromised, have concurrent disease states exacerbated by AOM, or meet the criteria of rAOM despite conjugate pneumococcal and influenza vaccination. Therapy should be intermittent, beginning at the first sign of an upper respiratory infection, and should continue for 10 days. The invasive nature and risks of anesthesia relegate myringotomy, tympanostomy tubes, and adenoidectomy to last-line therapies for rAOM.

Background and Objectives

Otitis media (OM) is one of the most common reasons for antibiotic treatment in children. Controversies regarding antibiotic treatment for OM have accumulated in the past decade, and there seem to be more dilemmas than certainties. The objectives of this article are to provide the state-of-the art review on achievements in treatment of all different stages of OM, including acute otitis media (AOM), otitis media with effusion (OME), and chronic suppurative otitis media, and to outline the future research areas.

Data Sources

PubMed, Ovid Medline, the Cochrane Database, and Clinical Evidence (BMJ Publishing).

Review Methods

All types of articles related to OM treatment published in English between January 2007 and June 2011 were identified. A total of 286 articles related to OM treatment were reviewed by the panel members; 114 relevant quality articles were identified and summarized.

Results

New evidence emerged on beneficial results of antibiotic treatment, compared with observation of AOM in young children who were diagnosed based on stringent criteria. In OME, the main results were related to a nonsignificant benefit of adenoidectomy versus tympanostomy tube placement alone in the treatment of chronic OME in younger children. Other modalities of OM treatment were studied and described herein.

Conclusions and Implications For Practice

Significant progress has been made in advancing the knowledge on the treatment of OM. Areas of potential future research have been identified and outlined.

### Acute otitis media in children [^111SgF8L]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common reason for primary care visits in children. Yet, there is considerable debate on the most effective treatment.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments (analgesics, antibiotics, and myringotomy) in children with AOM? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 17 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: analgesics, antibiotics, delayed antibiotics, immediate antibiotics, longer courses of antibiotics, and myringotomy.

### Unsolved problems and new medical approaches to otitis media [^116mJDBG]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Otitis media (OM) is a spectrum of infectious and inflammatory diseases that involve the middle ear. It includes acute otitis media (AOM), otitis media with effusion (OME) and chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).

Areas Covered

This manuscript discusses some of the emerging and unsolved problems regarding OM, and some of the newly developed prophylactic and therapeutic medical measures.

Expert Opinion

In recent years, considerable progress in the knowledge of OM physiopathology has been made. However, although extremely common, diseases included under OM have not been adequately studied, and many areas of development, evolution and possible treatments of these pathologies are not defined. It is necessary that these deficiencies be quickly overcome if we want to reduce the total burden of a group of diseases that still have extremely high medical, social and economic relevance.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) surgical options — shared decision grid compares watchful waiting, ear (tympanostomy) tube placement, and adenoidectomy across age limits, process, timing, benefits, risks, and long‑term expectations. Watchful waiting and ear tubes can be done at any age, but "Adenoidectomy is not recommended for age < 4 y for treating ear fluid that persists for at least 3 mo". Watchful waiting involves "Checking the eardrum every 3 to 6 mo in your doctor's office". Ear tube surgery "takes about 10 to 20 min and usually requires general anesthesia", while adenoidectomy "takes about 30 min and requires general anesthesia". Benefits include that ear tubes "Relieves fluid and hearing loss promptly and prevents relapse of fluid while the tube is in place and stays open", and adenoidectomy "reduces the need for future ear surgery", with "The chance that your child may need future ear tubes is reduced by about 50% after adenoidectomy". Risks for tubes include "About 1 in 4 children get an ear infection (drainage) that is treated with eardrops" and "About 2 or 3 in 100 children have a tiny hole in the eardrum that does not close after the tube falls out and may need surgery". Long‑term, "Most tubes fall out in about 12 to 18 mo" and "About 1 in every 4 children may need to have them replaced".

Although the incidence of acute mastoiditis has been substantially reduced since the introduction of antibiotic therapy, mastoiditis complications are still commonly seen in the pediatric population. Many of these cases require lengthy hospitalizations and extensive medical and surgical interventions. Accordingly, a safe, effective, and resourceful diagnostic and therapeutic plan must be executed for the workup and treatment of each patient suspected of having acute mastoiditis. With thorough clinical evaluations, early diagnosis, and close follow-up, a large proportion of children with severe acute otitis media or early stage mastoiditis can be managed in the primary care setting without immediate surgical specialty involvement. This review presents an overview of the anatomical and pathophysiological considerations in acute mastoiditis and offers pediatricians a practical, evidence-based algorithm for the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to this disease.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa executive summary [^116SLoNd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) has published a supplement to this issue featuring the updated Clinical Practice Guideline: Acute Otitis Externa, as a supplement to Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 8 recommendations developed address appropriate diagnosis of acute otitis externa (AOE) and the use of oral and topical antimicrobials and highlight the need for adequate pain relief. An updated guideline is needed due to new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.

### Otitis media with effusion [^117WBZDL]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

The clinical practice guideline on otitis media with effusion (OME) provides evidence-based recommendations on diagnosing and managing OME in children. This is an update of the 1994 clinical practice guideline "Otitis Media With Effusion in Young Children", which was developed by the Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research (now the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality). In contrast to the earlier guideline, which was limited to children 1 to 3 years old with no craniofacial or neurologic abnormalities or sensory deficits, the updated guideline applies to children aged 2 months through 12 years with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians, and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery selected a subcommittee composed of experts in the fields of primary care, otolaryngology, infectious diseases, epidemiology, hearing, speech and language, and advanced-practice nursing to revise the OME guideline. The subcommittee made a strong recommendation that clinicians use pneumatic otoscopy as the primary diagnostic method and distinguish OME from acute otitis media. The subcommittee made recommendations that clinicians should 1) document the laterality, duration of effusion, and presence and severity of associated symptoms at each assessment of the child with OME, 2) distinguish the child with OME who is at risk for speech, language, or learning problems from other children with OME and more promptly evaluate hearing, speech, language, and need for intervention in children at risk, and 3) manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known) or diagnosis (if onset is unknown). The subcommittee also made recommendations that 4) hearing testing be conducted when OME persists for 3 months or longer or at any time that language delay, learning problems, or a significant hearing loss is suspected in a child with OME, 5) children with persistent OME who are not at risk should be reexamined at 3- to 6-month intervals until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected, and 6) when a child becomes a surgical candidate (tympanostomy tube insertion is the preferred initial procedure). Adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication exists (nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis); repeat surgery consists of adenoidectomy plus myringotomy with or without tube insertion. Tonsillectomy alone or myringotomy alone should not be used to treat OME. The subcommittee made negative recommendations that 1) population-based screening programs for OME not be performed in healthy, asymptomatic children, and 2) because antihistamines and decongestants are ineffective for OME, they should not be used for treatment; antimicrobials and corticosteroids do not have long-term efficacy and should not be used for routine management. The subcommittee gave as options that 1) tympanometry can be used to confirm the diagnosis of OME and 2) when children with OME are referred by the primary clinician for evaluation by an otolaryngologist, audiologist, or speech-language pathologist, the referring clinician should document the effusion duration and specific reason for referral (evaluation, surgery) and provide additional relevant information such as history of acute otitis media and developmental status of the child. The subcommittee made no recommendations for 1) complementary and alternative medicine as a treatment for OME, based on a lack of scientific evidence documenting efficacy, or 2) allergy management as a treatment for OME, based on insufficient evidence of therapeutic efficacy or a causal relationship between allergy and OME. Last, the panel compiled a list of research needs based on limitations of the evidence reviewed. The purpose of this guideline is to inform clinicians of evidence-based methods to identify, monitor, and manage OME in children aged 2 months through 12 years. The guideline may not apply to children more than 12 years old, because OME is uncommon and the natural history is likely to differ from younger children who experience rapid developmental change. The target population includes children with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The guideline is intended for use by providers of health care to children, including primary care and specialist physicians, nurses and nurse practitioners, physician assistants, audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and child-development specialists. The guideline is applicable to any setting in which children with OME would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating children with OME. Rather, it is designed to assist primary care and other clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all children with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

### Otitis media [^11378QAH]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media (OM) or middle ear inflammation is a spectrum of diseases, including acute otitis media (AOM), otitis media with effusion (OME; 'glue ear') and chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). OM is among the most common diseases in young children worldwide. Although OM may resolve spontaneously without complications, it can be associated with hearing loss and life-long sequelae. In developing countries, CSOM is a leading cause of hearing loss. OM can be of bacterial or viral origin; during 'colds', viruses can ascend through the Eustachian tube to the middle ear and pave the way for bacterial otopathogens that reside in the nasopharynx. Diagnosis depends on typical signs and symptoms, such as acute ear pain and bulging of the tympanic membrane (eardrum) for AOM and hearing loss for OME; diagnostic modalities include (pneumatic) otoscopy, tympanometry and audiometry. Symptomatic management of ear pain and fever is the mainstay of AOM treatment, reserving antibiotics for children with severe, persistent or recurrent infections. Management of OME largely consists of watchful waiting, with ventilation (tympanostomy) tubes primarily for children with chronic effusions and hearing loss, developmental delays or learning difficulties. The role of hearing aids to alleviate symptoms of hearing loss in the management of OME needs further study. Insertion of ventilation tubes and adenoidectomy are common operations for recurrent AOM to prevent recurrences, but their effectiveness is still debated. Despite reports of a decline in the incidence of OM over the past decade, attributed to the implementation of clinical guidelines that promote accurate diagnosis and judicious use of antibiotics and to pneumococcal conjugate vaccination, OM continues to be a leading cause for medical consultation, antibiotic prescription and surgery in high-income countries.

### Pediatric acute otitis media: the case for delayed antibiotic treatment [^113CsUn7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is both a commonly diagnosed condition and a frequent indication for antibiotic use in children. Recent literature suggests that antibiotics are not needed in many children with AOM, as most cases resolve spontaneously without complication. However, a majority of AOM infections in children are still treated with antibiotics. The American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians released a guideline for treatment of AOM in children. We review the guideline as well as scientific evidence related to AOM treatment options. We support a set of evidence-based guidelines employing a delayed prescription option for antibiotic therapy in selected children. If used appropriately, these cost-effective guidelines will reduce the amount of antibiotics prescribed, increase parental satisfaction, and may lower rates of antibiotic resistance while producing similar rates of resolution of AOM.

### Clinical practice guidelines: whose practice are we guiding? [^115oanpJ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) has just released an update to the clinical practice guideline (CPG) on otitis media with effusion. This common condition is frequently managed by primary care providers; however, their awareness and utilization of the AAO-HNSF CPGs are unknown. We performed a cross-sectional survey to assess familiarity with otologic diagnoses, evaluation skills, and guidelines. Only 38.5% of respondents use pneumatic otoscopy, and roughly 50% utilize a CPG for management of otitis media or for referral for tympanostomy tube insertion. Providers predominantly use the acute otitis media guideline from the American Academy of Pediatrics. In this single-institution study, providers are largely unaware of the AAO-HNSF CPGs and could benefit from additional training, including workshops taught by otolaryngologists within individual health care systems or development of a national otolaryngology medical student curriculum. A more immediate option includes referencing our CPGs on specialty societies' websites or newsletters.

The placement of myringotomy tubes remains an effective treatment of recurrent acute otitis media and chronic otitis media with effusion. Infants and young children are prone to these entities because of their immature anatomy and immunology. Several host, pathogenic, and environmental factors contribute to the development of these conditions. The identification and modification of some these factors can preclude the need for intervention. The procedure continues to be one of the most common outpatient pediatric procedures. Close vigilance and identification of potential complications is of utmost importance in the ongoing management of the child with middle ear disease.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^112YAxw6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2004 guideline codeveloped by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians, provides evidence-based recommendations to manage otitis media with effusion (OME), defined as the presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection. Changes from the prior guideline include consumer advocates added to the update group, evidence from 4 new clinical practice guidelines, 20 new systematic reviews, and 49 randomized control trials, enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of OME.

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing OME and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy, identify children who are most susceptible to developmental sequelae from OME, and educate clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most OME and the clinical benefits for medical therapy (eg, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants). Additional goals relate to OME surveillance, hearing and language evaluation, and management of OME detected by newborn screening. The target patient for the guideline is a child aged 2 months through 12 years with OME, with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage children with OME, and it applies to any setting in which OME would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline, however, does not apply to patients < 2 months or > 12 years old.

Action Statements

The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) should document the presence of middle ear effusion with pneumatic otoscopy when diagnosing OME in a child; (2) should perform pneumatic otoscopy to assess for OME in a child with otalgia, hearing loss, or both; (3) should obtain tympanometry in children with suspected OME for whom the diagnosis is uncertain after performing (or attempting) pneumatic otoscopy; (4) should manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known) or 3 months from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown); (5) should recommend against using intranasal or systemic steroids for treating OME; (6) should recommend against using systemic antibiotics for treating OME; and (7) should recommend against using antihistamines, decongestants, or both for treating OME. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should document in the medical record counseling of parents of infants with OME who fail a newborn screening regarding the importance of follow-up to ensure that hearing is normal when OME resolves and to exclude an underlying sensorineural hearing loss; (2) should determine if a child with OME is at increased risk for speech, language, or learning problems from middle ear effusion because of baseline sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors; (3) should evaluate at-risk children for OME at the time of diagnosis of an at-risk condition and at 12 to 18 months of age (if diagnosed as being at risk prior to this time); (4) should not routinely screen children for OME who are not at risk and do not have symptoms that may be attributable to OME, such as hearing difficulties, balance (vestibular) problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, or ear discomfort; (5) should educate children with OME and their families regarding the natural history of OME, need for follow-up, and the possible sequelae; (6) should obtain an age-appropriate hearing test if OME persists for 3 months or longer OR for OME of any duration in an at-risk child; (7) should counsel families of children with bilateral OME and documented hearing loss about the potential impact on speech and language development; (8) should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected; (9) should recommend tympanostomy tubes when surgery is performed for OME in a child < 4 years old; adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication exists (nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis); (10) should recommend tympanostomy tubes, adenoidectomy, or both when surgery is performed for OME in a child ≥ 4 years old; and (11) should document resolution of OME, improved hearing, or improved quality of life when managing a child with OME.

### Treatment of acute otitis media consensus recommendations [^111a7pz8]. Clinical Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this paper is to provide consensus recommendations for the management of acute otitis media (AOM) that pediatricians can incorporate into their daily practices. These recommendations were developed during a roundtable meeting that convened clinicians versed in the management of AOM. This meeting was sponsored by an educational grant from SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals. In addition, clinical studies on AOM identified via MEDLINE search were considered in the development of these recommendations. The Drug-Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae Therapeutic Working Group guidelines for the management of AOM are reviewed in detail. All of the articles identified from the data sources were evaluated and all information deemed relevant was included in this review. AOM is one of the most common infectious diseases affecting infants and children and one of the leading causes of office visits and antibiotic prescriptions for this population. The incidence of AOM has increased during the past 25 years, probably the result of an increased utilization of day care facilities in the United States. The predominant pathogens in AOM include S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The high prevalence of drug-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-producing organisms presents a clinical challenge for practitioners in the selection of empiric antimicrobial therapy. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles should be considered in addition to minimum inhibitory concentrations in selecting antibiotics for AOM. Amoxicillin at conventional or high doses (80–90 mg/kg/day) remains an appropriate choice for first-line therapy for AOM. For patients in whom amoxicillin is unsuccessful, second-line therapy should have demonstrated activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae as well as beta-lactamase-producing pathogens. Appropriate options for second-line therapy include high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (90 mg/kg/day based on the amoxicillin component) and ceftriaxone. Cefuroxime has been suggested as a second-line agent in the past, but recent surveillance data suggest it may no longer be active against penicillin-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae. Tympanocentesis is useful for identifying the causative pathogen, and it may be beneficial for patients who have failed multiple courses of antibiotics. The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine recently was approved for use in children and should be administered to all children less than 2 years old and those at risk for recurrent AOM (e.g., day care attendance, siblings with a history of recurrent AOM). Consensus recommendations are provided for the management of AOM, with a focus on antimicrobial therapy. The current challenges in the management of AOM include the need for an increased understanding of epidemiology, increasing resistance among common middle ear pathogens, use of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles in designing treatment strategies, and understanding the potential impact of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^112rLymK]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Initial antibiotic therapy for acute otitis media — microbiology and effect sizes indicate benefit: tympanocentesis cultures showed 55% with bacteria only and 15% with bacteria and virus; a meta-analysis reported a 14% increase in absolute rates of clinical improvement, and systematic reviews before 2011 found increases of 6% to 12% with initial antibiotics. Trials using stringent diagnostic criteria in young children showed differences in clinical improvement of 26% to 35% favoring antibiotics, with greater benefit for bilateral AOM or AOM with otorrhea; antibiotic therapy also decreased duration of pain, analgesic use, or school absence and parent days missed from work. Children younger than 2 years may take longer to improve and are more likely to benefit, yet many cases resolve without antibiotics, and a clinically significant benefit is observed for bilateral AOM, Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, or AOM with otorrhea.

### Acute otitis media in infants: the disease and the illness. clinical distinctions for the new treatment paradigm [^114xR7SQ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media has changed conceptually from being a feared infection with severe complications to a modest disease that should be treated for symptomatic relief but often without immediate antimicrobials. This holds true for infants and children with nonsevere forms of the illness if the parents and the clinician agree to a strategy of watchful waiting with easy access for follow-up. Accurate otologic examination is critical for disease recognition, but the initial choice of treatment must also consider the general impact that the disease produces in each individual patient. The appraisal of the symptoms that characterize the illness in a child, matched with the otoscopic intensity of the disease, provide a comprehensive estimation of overall severity that many experts have used for research. The perspectives examined in this article and the schematic construct that proposes considering disease and illness independently may help to bring the current paradigm of acute otitis media into everyday pediatric practice as a model for a more rational and personalized management of each patient.

American Academy of Pediatrics — acute otitis media (AOM) pain management states Key Action Statement 2: "The management of AOM should include an assessment of pain. If pain is present, the clinician should recommend treatment to reduce pain" with "Evidence Quality: Grade B, Rec. Strength: Strong Recommendation". Pain is the major symptom of AOM. Antibiotic therapy "does not provide symptomatic relief in the first 24 hours and even after 3 to 7 days, there may be persistent pain, fever, or both in 30% of children younger than 2 years", whereas "analgesics do relieve pain associated with AOM within 24 hours and should be used whether antibiotic therapy is or is not prescribed; they should be continued as long as needed". The management of pain "should be addressed regardless of the use of antibiotics", and "Treating pain is essential whether or not antibiotics are prescribed". Choice of analgesic is intentionally unspecified, and clinicians should select therapy on "the basis of a consideration of benefits and risks" and "incorporate parent/caregiver and patient preference". Topical analgesics are excluded "in the presence of a perforated TM".

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^114G4Uh5]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion — at-risk infants and children: At-risk children with OME require more frequent hearing assessment and prompt management to prevent additional impact on developmental outcomes. This category includes children with speech-language or academic delay and those with developmental disability of any cause, especially Down syndrome and other craniofacial anomalies in which OME is very common and persistent. Children in these categories should receive otologic and hearing screening or assessment when speech-language delay is identified to allow prompt treatment for OME, and hearing should be reassessed following medical or surgical treatment, at ongoing intervals (at least annually), or as recommended in relevant clinical practice guidelines.

### Otitis media in children (acute) [^111Dzxuh]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the UK, about 30% of children under 3 years of age visit their GPs each year with acute otitis media (AOM), and 97% of these receive antibiotics. In the United States, AOM is the most common reason for outpatient antibiotic treatment. Without antibiotics, AOM resolves within 24 hours in about 60% of children, and within 3 days in about 80% of children.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for AOM in children; and what are the effects of interventions to prevent recurrence? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to January 2007. (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 19 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: analgesics, antibiotics, delayed antibiotics, immediate antibiotics, long-term antibiotic prophylaxis, longer courses of antibiotics, myringotomy, pneumococcal vaccination, tympanostomy with ventilation tubes.

Surgery for children aged ≥ 4 years with OME — if a decision is reached to manage OME in a child aged ≥ 4 years with surgical intervention, adenoidectomy, tympanostomy tube insertion, or both can be recommended, and the availability of at least 3 surgical options (tubes alone, adenoidectomy alone, or adenoidectomy plus tubes) creates an opportunity for shared decision making with caregivers; evidence from an individual patient data meta-analysis based on 1761 children from 10 randomized trials (9 comparisons of adenoidectomy with or without tubes vs no surgery or tubes alone) found no clinically important benefits for adenoidectomy in children < 4 years old, whereas children aged ≥ 4 years old spent 50 fewer days with OME over the next 12 months, had lower failure rates (51% vs 70%), and a lower rate of future surgery (2% vs 19%); in that study, failure at 12 months was defined as additional surgery, recurrent AOM, middle ear effusion at least 50% of the time, or average hearing improvement < 10-dB HL; additionally, a review of 15 randomized trials and observational studies evaluated tympanostomy tubes with or without adenoidectomy as primary therapy for OM.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^114VNq7z]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for otitis media with effusion, more specifically with respect to tympanostomy (AAO-HNSF), AAO-HNS 2022 guidelines recommend to offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion in pediatric patients with bilateral OME of ≥ 3 months duration and documented hearing difficulties.

Chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) surveillance — "Clinicians should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected". This is a "Recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm", with "Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, observational studies", "Level of confidence in the evidence: High", and "Policy level: Recommendation". Benefits include detection of structural tympanic membrane changes and new hearing difficulties that may prompt reassessment and discussion of listening-learning strategies with ongoing counseling, while risks/costs are limited to the "Cost of follow-up", and the "Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm". Timing is intentionally flexible because "The surveillance interval is broadly defined at 3 to 6 months", and patient preference is acknowledged: "Role of patient preferences: Moderate; opportunity for shared decision making regarding the surveillance interval".
