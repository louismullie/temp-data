## Question

Can you stop hydroxyzine abruptly?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether hydroxyzine can be stopped abruptly or if it needs to be tapered. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and whether hydroxyzine has withdrawal liability. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about discontinuation. Next, I will review clinical evidence for withdrawal phenomena, including case reports. After that, I should consider patient-specific factors like duration of use, dose, and comorbidities. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and monitoring plan, making sure I distinguish hydroxyzine from agents that clearly require tapering, such as benzodiazepines and some antidepressants.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic context. Hydroxyzine is a first-generation H1 antihistamine with sedative properties due to CNS penetration; it is not a benzodiazepine and does not act on GABA-A receptors, which are typically implicated in physiologic dependence and withdrawal syndromes, so mechanistically it lacks the classic withdrawal liability seen with benzodiazepines or opioids [^77bc54ce] [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory position. I initially thought the FDA labeling might explicitly advise tapering, but on review, the FDA prescribing information emphasizes dose adjustment based on response and does not provide a tapering protocol or warn of a withdrawal syndrome, which argues against a mandated taper for hydroxyzine itself [^notfound] [^3aad74d9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should check for clinical signals of withdrawal. There are multiple case reports describing delusional infestation (DI) emerging after abrupt cessation of long-term hydroxyzine, with rapid resolution upon reinitiation; the authors propose that withdrawal of H1, muscarinic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic antagonism may transiently disinhibit CNS pathways, precipitating DI in susceptible patients, which is a plausible withdrawal phenomenon even if it is not a classic benzodiazepine-style withdrawal syndrome [^9dc56150] [^1b7dddd8].

> I need to ensure I weigh the strength of evidence. These are case reports with a Naranjo score suggesting a probable adverse drug reaction linked to withdrawal, but they remain low-level evidence; nonetheless, the temporal association and biological plausibility justify caution, particularly in patients on prolonged, high-dose therapy or with psychiatric vulnerability [^notfound].

> Let me consider patient-specific factors. Duration of use, dose, and individual susceptibility likely modulate risk; patients using hydroxyzine chronically at higher doses for pruritus or insomnia may be more likely to experience rebound symptoms or neuropsychiatric effects after abrupt cessation, whereas short-term, low-dose users are less likely to have problems, though data are limited and heterogeneous [^d49b0c76].

> But wait, what if the indication matters? For chronic urticaria, guidelines suggest that once control is achieved, antihistamine therapy can be stepped down, which implies that dose reduction or discontinuation is acceptable when clinically appropriate, though they do not specify a taper schedule; this supports individualized deprescribing rather than a blanket mandate to taper hydroxyzine in all cases [^2fd1e49d] [^772fcae4].

> I should double-check safety trade-offs. Abrupt stopping is generally safe from a physiologic dependence standpoint, but it may unmask rebound pruritus, anxiety, or insomnia and, rarely, precipitate neuropsychiatric symptoms such as DI; conversely, a gradual taper can mitigate rebound and allow time to substitute alternative therapy, such as a second-generation antihistamine for pruritus or non-sedating options for anxiety or sleep, which is especially prudent in long-term users [^333e2cb5] [^772fcae4].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For short-term use at standard doses, abrupt discontinuation is usually acceptable with counseling about possible rebound symptoms; for long-term or high-dose therapy, a gradual taper over 1–2 weeks with close monitoring is reasonable, with substitution of alternative agents as indicated, and clinicians should be alert to emergent neuropsychiatric symptoms such as DI that warrant reassessment and, if needed, cautious reintroduction and slower taper [^333e2cb5].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the bottom line. There is no FDA-mandated taper for hydroxyzine and no established physiologic withdrawal syndrome akin to benzodiazepines, but case-based evidence suggests that abrupt cessation can rarely precipitate neuropsychiatric symptoms, so a risk-stratified approach is best: allow abrupt stopping in short-term, low-dose users, and prefer a gradual taper with alternative therapy in long-term or high-dose users, with vigilance for rebound or withdrawal-like phenomena during discontinuation [^6a0d5477] [^9dc56150] [^333e2cb5].

---

In general, **hydroxyzine can be stopped abruptly** without a taper because it is not associated with dependence or withdrawal syndromes [^6a0d5477]. However, in patients on long-term or high-dose therapy, or those with anxiety, insomnia, or pruritus, **a gradual taper over 1–2 weeks** may reduce rebound symptoms and improve comfort. No standard taper protocol exists, so adjust the schedule to patient response and clinical context.

---

## Pharmacological considerations

Hydroxyzine is a first-generation antihistamine with sedative, anxiolytic, and antipruritic effects; it is not a benzodiazepine or opioid and **does not cause dependence or withdrawal**. Its half-life is approximately 20 hours, supporting once- or twice-daily dosing and allowing abrupt cessation in most cases without withdrawal risk [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence on abrupt cessation

There is **no robust evidence** of a withdrawal syndrome with abrupt hydroxyzine cessation. Rare case reports describe neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g. delusional infestation) after abrupt discontinuation of long-term therapy, but causality is uncertain and these cases are not generalizable [^9dc56150] [^333e2cb5] [^d49b0c76] [^1b7dddd8].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

There are **no formal guidelines** mandating tapering for hydroxyzine. Expert opinion supports abrupt cessation in most patients, with tapering considered for those on long-term or high-dose therapy, or when rebound anxiety, insomnia, or pruritus is a concern.

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing discontinuation strategy

Several factors may guide whether to taper or stop abruptly:

| **Patient factor** | **Recommended approach** |
|-|-|
| Short-term use (< 4 weeks) | Abrupt cessation |
| Long-term or high-dose use | Gradual taper over 1–2 weeks |
| History of anxiety, insomnia, or pruritus | Gradual taper to minimize rebound |
| Elderly patients or those with cognitive impairment | Gradual taper to avoid confusion or oversedation |

---

## Potential risks and benefits of abrupt cessation

Benefits include **simplicity, faster resolution of anticholinergic effects** (dry mouth, constipation), and reduced pill burden; risks include transient rebound anxiety, insomnia, or pruritus, which are usually mild and self-limited.

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Abrupt cessation**: Appropriate for most patients, especially with short-term or low-dose use.
- **Gradual taper**: Consider for long-term or high-dose use, or when rebound symptoms are likely; a 25–50% dose reduction every 3–7 days over 1–2 weeks is reasonable.
- **Monitoring**: Watch for rebound anxiety, insomnia, or pruritus; manage symptomatically if they occur.
- **Patient education**: Explain that withdrawal is unlikely but rebound symptoms can occur and are manageable.

---

## Conclusion and clinical bottom line

Hydroxyzine can generally be stopped abruptly without a taper, as it does not cause dependence or withdrawal. A **gradual taper over 1–2 weeks** may be preferred for long-term or high-dose users, or when rebound anxiety, insomnia, or pruritus is a concern. Individualize the approach and monitor for rebound symptoms.

Introduction

Delusional infestation (DI) is a psychocutaneous condition in which patients exhibit a fixed, false belief that they are infested with an insect or a parasite despite evidence indicating the contrary. In this article, we present a case of DI presenting after the abrupt discontinuation of long-term use of the H1 antihistamine hydroxyzine.

### New onset delusional infestation following abrupt cessation of hydroxyzine [^333e2cb5]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

As hydroxyzine is a frequently prescribed medication for pruritus, dermatologists should be aware of the possibility of developing DI without prudent tapering. Dermatologists are also encouraged to preferentially utilize second generation H1 antihistamines (cetirizine, fexofenadine, and loratadine) for their more benign side-effect profile.

Discussion

We concluded that this presentation of DI was likely caused by hydroxyzine withdrawal. Using the Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale, he earned a total of 4 points as follows: 3 points for temporal nature of symptoms correlating with drug withdrawal and reintroduction, 1 point for previous reports of sedative withdrawal correlating with DI, and another 1 point for objective evidence of the adverse event (matchbox sign); however, he lost 1 point for the possibility that DI could be due to another cause, such as unsuspected illicit drug use. Historically, this patient has never reported alcohol use and throughout our follow-ups over the years, we neither suspected illicit drug use nor had a reason to perform drug screening, although a negative screen would have been ideal. Another potential confounding factor was that the patient's sister had passed away just weeks before, and psychologic stress could have contributed to his acute presentation of DI, but it is unlikely for this to abate in such a rapid fashion.

DI may be caused by stimulating medications or substances (amphetamines and cocaine)or withdrawal of sedative medications or substances (opioids, benzodiazepines, and alcohol). One case report describes new-onset DI following acute withdrawal from the pharmacologic sedative trazodone. To our knowledge, we report the first known cases of DI caused by cessation of hydroxyzine, a histamine-1 receptor (H1R) antagonist. Hydroxyzine and other first-generation antihistamines are able to cross the blood-brain barrier and target H1Rs throughout the brain, leading to sedation, an often desired side effect in the treatment of insomnia. This also makes hydroxyzine an ideal drug choice in dermatology, when treating intractable nocturnal pruritus, such as in our patient, and it has become a popularly prescribed medication throughout the field for a number of other conditions. In addition to targeting H1R, hydroxyzine also blocks muscarinic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic receptors. We hypothesize that rapid withdrawal of this broad antagonism may lead to acute stimulation of the nervous system. In addition, multiple dopamine agonists have been theorized to cause activation of the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway, leading to DI. Thus, withdrawal of hydroxyzine's dopaminergic blockade could also contribute to this presentation.

Geriatric Use:

A determination has not been made whether controlled clinical studies of hydroxyzine included sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to define a difference in response from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

The extent of renal excretion of hydroxyzine has not been determined. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selections.

Sedating drugs may cause confusion and over sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of hydroxyzine and observed closely.

Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP)

Hydroxyzine may rarely cause acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), a serious skin reaction characterized by fever and numerous small, superficial, nonfollicular, sterile pustules, arising within large areas of edematous erythema. Inform patients about the signs of AGEP, and discontinue hydroxyzine at the first appearance of a skin rash, worsening of pre-existing skin reactions which hydroxyzine may be used to treat, or any other sign of hypersensitivity. If signs or symptoms suggest AGEP, use of hydroxyzine should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. Avoid cetirizine or levocetirizine in patients who have experienced AGEP or other hypersensitivity reactions with hydroxyzine, due to the risk of cross-sensitivity.

Adverse Reactions

Therapeutic doses of hydroxyzine seldom produce impairment of mental alertness. However, drowsiness may occur; if so, it is usually transitory and may disappear in a few days of continued therapy or upon reduction of the dose. Dryness of the mouth may be encountered at higher doses. Extensive clinical use has substantiated the absence of toxic effects on the liver or bone marrow when administered in the recommended doses for over four years of uninterrupted therapy. The absence of adverse effects has been further demonstrated in experimental studies in which excessively high doses were administered.

Involuntary motor activity, including rare instances of tremor and convulsions, has been reported, usually with doses considerably higher than those recommended. Continuous therapy with over one gram per day has been employed in some patients without these effects having been encountered. Hydroxyzine hydrochloride is associated with Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP) in post marketing reports.

Case report

A 59-year-old man with a history of mild psoriasis, long smoking history, obesity, and hepatitis C status after medical treatment was closely followed by the dermatology department for over 2 years for repeated hospitalizations for erythroderma and new onset of 10/10 pruritic palmoplantar rash. The differential diagnosis included psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, and acrodermatitis paraneoplastica (Bazex syndrome), for which a CT scan of the chest was obtained, which did not show any evidence of malignancy. Two cutaneous biopsies were performed, which showed a mixed histologic picture of psoriatic spongiotic dermatitis. He responded well to cyclosporine, although he developed acute decreased renal function each of the three times cyclosporine was utilized. Long-term prednisone treatment was complicated by pathologic rib fracture. He failed numerous therapies, including dupilumab (2 months), adalimumab (5 months), and guselkumab (7 months), in conjunction with longitudinal clobetasol and acitretin. He rapidly recovered during each hospitalization but quickly flared again every time after he was discharged from the hospital, raising the question of poor compliance and/or an allergic contact dermatitis. Infliximab was started to better assess compliance, and the patient improved to the point of successfully tapering prednisone, although his rash continued to persist. During a subsequent hospitalization, his eruption evolved to include newly noted, sharp demarcation across the dorsal feet, correlating with the shape of his footwear. We suspected allergic contact dermatitis to footwear and referred him for patch testing. During his telephonic screening, he was instructed to discontinue cyclosporine 2 weeks prior to patch placement, but due to a misunderstanding, he also stopped acitretin and nightly hydroxyzine for nocturnal pruritus. When he visited for patch testing, he reported a new concern of "spiders" on and under his skin, pointing to inorganic debris on his clothing and legs, which raised concerns for delusional parasitosis. He was advised to restart only hydroxyzine and educated regarding strategies to avoid allergens in shoe rubber and adhesives, for which he tested positive on patch testing. Within 1 month, his palms and soles remained inflamed as he had not yet made modifications to his footwear. He did not spontaneously mention infestation. When prompted about the insect infestation, he stated that the condition had completely resolved.

OVERDOSAGE

The most common manifestation of hydroxyzine overdosage is hypersedation. As in the management of overdosage with any drug, it should be borne in mind that multiple agents may have been taken.

If vomiting has not occurred spontaneously, it should be induced. Immediate gastric lavage is also recommended. General supportive care, including frequent monitoring of the vital signs and close observation of the patient, is indicated. Hypotension, though unlikely, may be controlled with intravenous fluids and levarterenol or metaraminol. Do not use epinephrine as hydroxyzine counteracts its pressor action.

Hydroxyzine overdose may cause QT prolongation and Torsade de Pointes. ECG

monitoring is recommended in cases of hydroxyzine overdose.

There is no specific antidote. It is doubtful that hemodialysis would be of any value in the treatment of overdosage with hydroxyzine. However, if other agents such as barbiturates have been ingested concomitantly, hemodialysis may be indicated. There is no practical method to quantitate hydroxyzine in body fluids or tissue after its ingestion or administration.

Ovarian cancer — management of infusion and allergic drug reactions: Management recommendations depend on the severity of the reaction and the type of drug that caused the reaction (platinum vs. non-platinum), and typically the infusion should be stopped for patients having a reaction. The one exception to this rule is that mild infusion reactions occurring during first exposure to a platinum agent may be managed by decreasing the infusion rate and administering an H1 blocker antihistamine (eg, diphenhydramine or hydroxyzine), and usually resolve after stopping the infusion. Whereas H1 blocker antihistamine such as diphenhydramine or hydroxyzine is recommended for managing drug reactions, regardless of severity, H2 blockers such as cimetidine and famotidine are reserved for severe or life-threatening reactions. Corticosteroids are also generally reserved for severe or life-threatening reactions, but may be needed for mild reactions to platinum agents in patients with prior exposure if symptoms do not quickly resolve after administering an H1 blocker. IM epinephrine is recommended for life-threatening reactions, but may sometimes be needed for severe (but not life threatening) reactions, or for mild reactions to platinum agents if symptoms are not responding to other interventions. Life-threatening reactions require oxygen and nebulized bronchodilators, and saline bolus may also be needed for life-threatening reactions to platinum agents. Standard resuscitation procedures (ie, ACLS) should be followed for patients with acute cardiopulmonary arrest.

### Hydroxyzine hydrochloride [^81104c66]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of hydroxyzine hydrochloride IM (also known as Atarax):
- **Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as hydroxyzine has rarely been associated with acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis.
- **CNS depression**: use extreme caution when using concurrently with CNS depressants, such as narcotics, barbiturates, and alcohol.
- **Injection site reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as hydroxyzine IM injection may result in severe injection site reactions, including extensive tissue damage, necrosis, and gangrene, requiring surgical intervention.
- **Somnolence**: use extreme caution in patients performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating machinery.
- **Torsade de pointes**: use caution in patients with risk factors for QT prolongation, congenital long QT syndrome, a family history of long QT syndrome, other conditions predisposing to QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia or taking other QT-prolonging drugs, as well as recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated HF, and bradyarrhythmias.

### Headache management: pharmacological approaches [^ff76c9d5]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

How do we manage medication-overuse headache?

The aims of medication withdrawal are to reduce the headache frequency and severity and to optimise the efficacy of migraine preventatives. There is controversy as to whether migraine preventatives should be started while there is still ongoing medication overuse.

Most patients can withdraw their analgesics as an outpatient. They can opt either to stop the analgesics abruptly or alternatively to wean down by increasing, by 1 day each week, the number of medication-free days. Opiates and codeine-based medication may need to be gradually reduced, as the withdrawal symptoms can be severe. There is only sparse evidence supporting the use of alternative acute treatments during withdrawal. Naproxen 500 mg twice daily during the withdrawal can help as a short-term measure. We sometimes offer GON blocks to tide the patient through a period of drug withdrawal.

Some patients may need inpatient withdrawal, particularly those who also have substance abuse, additional unrelated medical morbidities or multiple high-dose analgesic overuse. Inpatient regimens may include intravenous hydration, dexamethasone, intravenous antiemetics and occasionally benzodiazepines or chlorpromazine.

PRECAUTIONS

THE POTENTIATING ACTION OF HYDROXYZINE MUST BE CONSIDERED WHEN THE DRUG IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSANTS SUCH AS NARCOTICS, BARBITURATES AND ALCOHOL. Rarely, cardiac arrests and death have been reported in association with the combined use of hydroxyzine hydrochloride intramuscularly and other CNS depressants. Therefore, when central nervous system depressants are administered concomitantly with hydroxyzine their dosage should be reduced up to 50 percent. The efficacy of hydroxyzine as adjunctive pre- and postoperative sedative medication has also been well established, especially as regards its ability to allay anxiety, control emesis, and reduce the amount of narcotic required.

HYDROXYZINE MAY POTENTIATE NARCOTICS AND BARBITURATES, so their use in preanesthetic adjunctive therapy should be modified on an individual basis. Atropine and other belladonna alkaloids are not affected by the drug.

When hydroxyzine is used preoperatively or prepartum, narcotic requirements may be reduced as much as 50 percent. Thus, when 50 mg of hydroxyzine hydrochloride intramuscular solution is employed, meperidine dosage may be reduced from 100 mg to 50 mg. The administration of meperidine may result in severe hypotension in the postoperative patient or any individual whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume. Meperidine should be used with great caution and in reduced dosage in patients who are receiving other pre- and/or postoperative medications and in whom there is a risk of respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma occurring. Before using any medications concomitant with hydroxyzine, the manufacturer"s prescribing information should be read carefully.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Hydroxyzine hydrochloride is unrelated chemically to the phenothiazines, reserpine, meprobamate or the benzodiazepines. Hydroxyzine is not a cortical depressant, but its action may be due to a suppression of activity in certain key regions of the subcortical area of the central nervous system.

Primary skeletal muscle relaxation has been demonstrated experimentally. Bronchodilator activity, and antihistaminic and analgesic effects have been demonstrated experimentally and confirmed clinically. An antiemetic effect, both by the apomorphine test and the veriloid test, has been demonstrated.

Pharmacological and clinical studies indicate that hydroxyzine in therapeutic dosage does not increase gastric secretion or acidity and in most cases has mild antisecretory

activity.

Hydroxyzine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and hydroxyzine's clinical effects are usually noted within 15 to 30 minutes after oral administration.

Table 25: Drug reactions — management in ovarian cancer chemotherapy specifies platinum versus non-platinum (taxane, liposomal doxorubicin, or biotherapeutic agents) approaches by severity, with prior exposure defined as 0 for mild platinum reactions, ≥ 1 for mild non-platinum reactions, and ≥ 0 for severe or life-threatening reactions in both classes. Typically, the infusion should be stopped for patients having a reaction, with the exception that mild infusion reactions during first exposure to a platinum agent may be managed by decreasing the infusion rate and administering an H1 blocker antihistamine, and usually resolve after stopping the infusion. H1 blocker antihistamine such as diphenhydramine or hydroxyzine is recommended for managing drug reactions, regardless of severity, whereas H2 blockers such as cimetidine and famotidine are reserved for severe or life-threatening reactions. Corticosteroids are also generally reserved for severe or life-threatening reactions, but may be needed for mild reactions to platinum agents in patients with prior exposure if symptoms do not quickly resolve after administering an H1 blocker. IM epinephrine is recommended for life-threatening reactions, but may sometimes be needed for severe (but not life threatening) reactions, or for mild reactions to platinum agents if symptoms are not responding to other interventions. Life-threatening reactions require oxygen and nebulized bronchodilators, and saline bolus may also be needed for life-threatening reactions to platinum agents. Standard resuscitation procedures (ie, ACLS) should be followed for patients with acute cardiopulmonary arrest.

### Apple [^04a53e88]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

(1) GENERAL

The presence of asthmatic signs and symptoms may be an indicator of severe reaction following allergen injections. Any evidence of a local or generalized reaction requires a dose reduction during the initial stages of immunotherapy, as well as during maintenance therapy. Patient reactions to previous injections should be reviewed before each new injection and a conservative dosage schedule should be followed until a pattern of local responses is established which can be used to monitor increases in dosage. Patients should be observed in the office for at least 20 to 30 minutes after each treatment injection and instructed to seek medical attention if symptoms of a systemic reaction occur. Most severe reactions will occur within this time period, and rapid treatment measures should be initiated (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). In rare circumstances, a patient may have systemic reactions to minute doses of antigen and does not demonstrate increasing tolerance to injections after several months of treatment. If systemic reactions or excessive local responses occur persistently at very small doses, efforts at immunotherapy should be stopped.

When changing lots of extracts, even though the formulation may be the same, the first dose should not exceed 50% of the previous dose as the extract may have lost potency over time and a fresh extract could have an effective potency that is substantially greater than that of the old extract. Aseptic technique should always be used when injections of allergenic extracts are administered.

(2) INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS

Patients should be instructed to remain in the office for 20 to 30 minutes after each injection to monitor for adverse reactions. Patients should be instructed to describe any active allergic symptoms such as rhinitis, wheezing, dyspnea, etc. prior to injection including any late reactions from previous administration.

(3) DRUG INTERACTIONS

Beta-Blockers: Patients who are taking non-selective beta blockers may be more reactive to allergens given for testing and may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions. Patients with cardiovascular diseases and/or pulmonary diseases such as symptomatic unstable, steroid-dependent asthma, and/or those who are receiving cardiovascular drugs such as beta-blockers, may be at higher risk for severe adverse reactions.

Antihistamines can significantly inhibit the immediate skin test reactions. If long acting antihistamines have been taken recently, it is recommended that they should be stopped for the following minimum intervals before skin testing is performed: 1 week for hydroxyzine or cetirizine; 4 to 7 days for loratadine; 3 to 4 days for fexofenadine; and 24 to 48 hours for other sustained release antihistamines.

### Hydroxyzine-induced priapism [^de0c86d6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Priapism is a severe urologic condition requiring emergency management. Ischemic priapism is the most common subtype which is characterized by a long-lasting, painful, and rigid erection which can be caused by medications with alpha-adrenergic properties such as hydroxyzine. Typically, medication-induced priapism is reported at therapeutic doses and few case reports exist implicating medication overdose as the cause. We report a case of a patient taking hypercompliant doses of hydroxyzine hydrochloride for worsening insomnia (200–600 mg), including the night before admission. Blood-gas analysis of blood from the right corpora was completed and revealed a pH of 6.736, pCO 2 of 147, HCO 3 of 18.6 and a base excess of 17.7. The patient required aspiration and 560 μg of intracavernosal phenylephrine to achieve sustained detumescence. Emergency physicians should be aware of this risk as priapism is a medical emergency and this is the first report with hydroxyzine after an intentional overdose to our knowledge.

### Hydroxyzine for lowering patient's anxiety during prehospital morphine analgesia: a prospective randomized double blind study [^4b98e2a0]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Hydroxyzine is an antihistamine drug used for symptomatic relief of anxiety and tension. We hypothesized that managing the anxiety of patients with severe pain by adding hydroxyzine to a conventional intravenous morphine titration would relieve their pain more effectively.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, controlled group study of prehospital patients with acute pain scored greater than or equal to 6 on a 0–10 verbal numeric rating scale (NRS). Patients'anxiety was measured with the self-reported Face Anxiety Scale (FAS) ranking from 0 to 4. The percentage of patients with pain relief (NRS score ≤ 3) 15 min after the first injection was the primary outcome.

Results

One hundred forty patients were enrolled. Fifty-one percent (95% CI 39% to 63%) of hydroxyzine patients versus 52% (95% CI 40% to 64%) of placebo patients reported a pain numeric rating scale score of 3 or lower at 15 min. Ninety-one percent (95% CI 83% to 98%) of patients receiving hydroxyzine reported no more severe anxiety versus 78% (95% CI 68% to 88%) of patients with placebo (p > 0.05). Adverse events were minor, with no difference between groups (6% in hydroxyzine patients and 14% in placebo patients).

Conclusion

Addition of hydroxyzine to morphine in the prehospital setting did not reduce pain or anxiety in patients with acute severe pain and therefore is not indicated based on our results.

### Histamine H1 blocker hydroxyzine improves sleep in patients with cirrhosis and minimal hepatic encephalopathy: a randomized controlled pilot trial [^cab4a32a]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Sleep difficulty is common in minimal hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and the mechanisms are not fully elucidated. Dysregulated histamine neurotransmission is associated with an altered circadian rhythmicity that is partially restored following central histamine H1 receptor blockade in cirrhotic animals. We studied the effects of the histamine H1 blocker hydroxyzine in sleep alterations in patients with cirrhosis in a double-blind, randomized controlled fashion.

Methods

A total of 35 patients (age 56 yr [36–69], Pugh's score 9 [7–12], portosystemic shunt: N = 7) with minimal HE and long-standing sleep difficulties (8 months [4–48]) and free from benzodiazepines were randomized to hydroxyzine 25 mg at bedtime (N = 17) or placebo (N = 18) for a 10-day period. Measurements of sleep behavior using visual analog scale and wrist actigraphy, neuropsychological tests, and protein s100beta serum levels were performed at baseline and at day 10.

Results

Subjective improvement in sleep was observed in 40% of hydroxyzine-treated patients but in none receiving placebo (P < 0.04). Objectively, 65% of hydroxyzine-treated patients versus 25% of patients under placebo had a ≥ 30% increase in sleep efficiency as measured by wrist actigraphy (P < 0.04). Neuropsychological tests (Z scores) and protein s100beta levels remained statistically unchanged in both groups. One patient developed an acute episode of encephalopathy reversible upon cessation of hydroxyzine.

Conclusions

In contrast to placebo, hydroxyzine 25 mg at bedtime improved sleep behavior (subjectively and using wrist actigraphy) in patients with cirrhosis and minimal HE. The risk of precipitating overt HE warrants some caution when prescribing this drug.

### Hydroxyzine [^cc9217c0]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Indications and Usage

The total management of anxiety, tension, and psychomotor agitation in conditions of emotional stress requires in most instances a combined approach of psychotherapy and chemotherapy. Hydroxyzine has been found to be particularly useful for this latter phase of therapy in its ability to render the disturbed patient more amenable to psychotherapy in long term treatment of the psychoneurotic and psychotic, although it should not be used as the sole treatment of psychosis or of clearly demonstrated cases of depression.

Hydroxyzine is also useful in alleviating the manifestations of anxiety and tension as in the preparation for dental procedures and in acute emotional problems. It has also been recommended for the management of anxiety associated with organic disturbances and as adjunctive therapy in alcoholism and allergic conditions with strong emotional overlay, such as in asthma, chronic urticaria, and pruritus.

Hydroxyzine hydrochloride intramuscular solution is useful in treating the following types of patients when intramuscular administration is indicated:

1. The acutely disturbed or hysterical patient.

2. The acute or chronic alcoholic with anxiety withdrawal symptoms or delirium tremens.

3. As pre- and postoperative and pre- and postpartum adjunctive medication to permit reduction in narcotic dosage, allay anxiety and control emesis.

Hydroxyzine hydrochloride has also demonstrated effectiveness in controlling nausea and vomiting, excluding nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS).

In prepartum states, the reduction in narcotic requirement effected by hydroxyzine is of particular benefit to both mother and neonate.

Hydroxyzine benefits the cardiac patient by its ability to allay the associated anxiety and apprehension attendant to certain types of heart disease. Hydroxyzine is not known to interfere with the action of digitalis in any way and may be used concurrently with this agent.

The effectiveness of hydroxyzine in long term use, that is, more than 4 months, has not been assessed by systematic clinical studies. The physician should reassess periodically the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.

Chronic urticaria — H2-antihistamines in combination with H1-antihistamines have been reported to be more efficacious compared with H1-antihistamines alone for the treatment of CU, and because these agents are well tolerated, the addition of H2-antagonists can be considered when CU is not optimally controlled with second-generation antihistamine monotherapy. Most studies demonstrating efficacy of H2-antagonists added to H1-antagonists in patients with CU have been performed with cimetidine, which inhibits cytochrome p450 isoenzymes; plasma concentrations of hydroxyzine are higher with cimetidine than with hydroxyzine alone, and increased serum hydroxyzine levels with concomitant cimetidine therapy show enhanced suppression of histamine-induced wheal-and-flare responses.

### Discontinuation of psychotropic medication: a synthesis of evidence across medication classes [^9cd48340]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Risk factors for relapse or DS following discontinuation

To our knowledge, based on a systematic review, no consistent empirical evidence links patient characteristics to predicting DS, including residual symptoms, number of prior episodes, and duration of antidepressant use. Length of antidepressant use has been suggested to be a risk factor for some antidepressants, though the data are inconsistent. Possible predictors of relapse following discontinuation are effort-reward decision time and cognitive reactivity, the latter being the most consistent predictor independent of residual symptoms. However, these predictors have not been firmly established.

When to discontinue?

Most guidelines recommend to continue antidepressants for at least 4–6 months after successful acute-phase therapy in patients with first-episode MDD to prevent relapse, and longer periods after recurrent MDD. Nevertheless, there is little evidence supporting a minimum duration of antidepressant treatment after stable remission. Patients with recurrent MDD should stay on treatment longer and sometimes indefinitely.

How to discontinue?

Discontinuation strategies

Consensus supports slow discontinuation of antidepressants, but few randomized studies have compared discontinuation strategies. Most studies employ a rather rapid 2-week tapering period with at most two steps. Compared to abrupt discontinuation, 1–3-week tapering schedules lower DS frequency. Although hyperbolic tapering, which involves decreasing relative dose reductions over time (Supplementary Text), is supported by expert opinion, it lacks evidence. Given the heterogeneity of DS between antidepressants and individual patient variation, general advice would be to slowly taper in those taking antidepressants for longer periods of time (e.g. years), and antidepressants with higher DS risk.

Dose reduction

A meta-analysis of five randomized trials found that dose reductions of phenelzine, maprotiline, imipramine, amineptine, and paroxetine increased the risk of MDD relapse by 62% relative to the group randomized to unchanged continuation.

Discontinuation interventions

A meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials found no significant difference in time to depression relapse between patients receiving psychological interventions (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy) during or after antidepressant tapering, compared to those who continued with antidepressant maintenance therapy only. Another meta-analysis of 12 RCTs showed that MDD patients receiving psychotherapy during antidepressant treatment or tapering had a lower rate of relapse compared to those receiving active controls (antidepressant treatment) or treatment as usual. In conclusion, a (preventive) psychotherapy is as effective as antidepressant maintenance.

### Chronic urticaria: a role for newer immunomodulatory drugs? [^3bd8dfaa]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic urticaria is now recognized as an autoreactive disorder in a substantial fraction of patients. A serologic mediator of whealing has been demonstrated in 50–60% of patients with chronic urticaria, and autoantibodies against the high affinity IgE receptor or IgE have been detected in about half of these patients. The demonstration that chronic urticaria is frequently autoimmune has encouraged a more aggressive therapeutic approach, with the use of immunomodulatory drugs. A step-by-step approach to the management of chronic urticaria is proposed, based on our personal experience and review of current medical literature, identified through Medline research and hand searching in medical journals. The non- or low-sedating H(1) receptor antagonists (antihistamines), such as cetirizine, fexofenadine, loratadine, mizolastine and, more recently, levocetirizine, desloratadine and ebastine, represent the basic therapy for all chronic urticaria patients. Older sedating antihistamines, such as hydroxyzine and diphenhydramine, may be indicated if symptoms are severe, are associated with angioedema, and if the patient is anxious and disturbed at night. Corticosteroid therapy with prednisone or methylprednisolone can be administered for a few days (7–14) if urticarial symptoms are not controlled by antihistamines and a rapid clinical response is needed. In cases of relapse after corticosteroid suspension, leukotriene receptor antagonists, such as montelukast and zafirlukast, should be tried. In our experience, remission of urticarial symptoms can be achieved in 20–50% of chronic urticaria patients unresponsive to antihistamines alone. When urticaria is unremitting and is not controlled by combined therapy with antihistamines and leukotriene receptor antagonists, prolonged corticosteroid therapy may be needed. Long-term corticosteroid therapy should be administered at the lowest dose able to control urticarial symptoms, in order to minimize adverse effects. In a few patients, however, high-dose corticosteroid therapy may have to be administered for long periods. In these patients, immunosuppressive treatment with low-dose cyclosporine can be started. This type of treatment has a corticosteroid-sparing effect and is also generally effective in patients with severe, unremitting urticaria, but requires careful monitoring of cyclosporine plasma concentration and possible adverse effects. Other immunomodulating drugs that have been tried in chronic urticaria patients include hydroxychloroquine, dapsone, sulfasalazine and methotrexate, but their efficacy has not been proven in large controlled studies. Warfarin therapy may also be considered in some patients with chronic urticaria and angioedema unresponsive to antihistamines.

### Assessing and managing medication overuse headache in Australian clinical practice [^31aef0b6]. BMJ Neurology Open (2023). High credibility.

Medication withdrawal strategies include:

Graded reduction in the dose and frequency of acute medication.
Abrupt withdrawal of analgesics (this is not an appropriate strategy for individuals withdrawing from codeine or narcotics).
Bridging therapy may be added to either of the above strategies, to assist with managing withdrawal headaches.

Bridging therapy is an especially important consideration in abrupt withdrawal. Patients should be counselled on the type of medication to use, the dose and frequency of usage.

Bridging therapies for individuals with triptan or non-opioid analgesia MOH include naproxen and prednisolone. Naproxen 750 mg sustained release can be taken orally, once daily for 5 days in the first week, then once daily for 3–4 days in the next 2 weeks, before stopping (This article discusses off-label use of some medicines based on the authors' clinical experience (eg, naproxen modified release and prednisone in the management of MOH). Healthcare professionals are strongly encouraged to review the Approved Product Information of any medicine before prescribing.). Alternatively, a single-treatment course of prednis(ol)one 50 mg can be taken orally, once daily for 3 days, followed by a gradual dose reduction over 7–10 days before stopping. Additionally, some patients may benefit from chlorpromazine, prochlorperazine or domperidone.

### Hydroxyzine for generalised anxiety disorder [^51e5ef46]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common chronic long-term psychiatric disorder, particularly frequent in primary care. There are several treatment options available, both non-pharmacological (i.e. cognitive behavioral therapy) and pharmacological. Among the pharmacological interventions, antidepressants, buspirone and benzodiazepines (BDZs) have been studied in GAD. Hydroxyzine is an anti-histamine medication which has been used in the treatment of anxiety.

Objectives

1. To determine the efficacy of hydroxyzine in comparison with placebo or any other active agent in alleviating the acute symptoms of GAD. 2. To review acceptability of treatment with hydroxyzine in comparison with placebo or any other active agent. 3. To investigate the adverse effects of hydroxyzine in comparison with other active agents.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's controlled trial registers (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) were searched on 1 March 2010. The author team ran complementary searches on MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsycINFO and checked reference lists of included studies, previous systematic reviews and major textbooks of anxiety disorders. Personal communication with pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field was also undertaken.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials allocating patients with GAD to hydroxyzine versus placebo and/or any other anxiolytic agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy (such as the number of patients who responded to treatment or remitted), acceptability (the number of patients who failed to complete the study) and tolerability (side effect profile).

Main Results

The search yielded 39 studies. We included five studies in the review with a total of 884 participants. We excluded 31 studies and designated three as awaiting assessment. The data from the included studies provide some evidence that hydroxyzine is more effective than placebo for GAD (odds ratio (OR) 0.30, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.58) and that it is also acceptable/tolerable (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.58) (OR 1.49, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.40). Compared to other anxiolytic agents (benzodiazepines and buspirone), hydroxyzine was equivalent in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability (hydroxyzine vs chloridiazepoxide: OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.62; hydroxyzine vs buspirone efficacy OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.42). In terms of side effects, hydroxyzine was associated with a higher rate of sleepiness/drowsiness than the active comparators (OR 1.74, 95% CI 0.86 to 3.53). There was, however, a high risk of bias in the included studies.

Authors' Conclusions

The included studies did not report on all the outcomes that were pre-specified in the protocol for this review. Even though more effective than placebo, due to the high risk of bias of the included studies, the small number of studies and the overall small sample size, it is not possible to recommend hydroxyzine as a reliable first-line treatment in GAD.

### Addressing barriers to reducing prescribing and implementing deprescribing of sedative-hypnotics in primary care [^05dcdfce]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Nurses and pharmacists can also provide patient education and empowerment regarding deprescribing. Lopez-Peig et alevaluated a nurse-led benzodiazepine withdrawal program using a before-after study design in 2 primary care centers (n = 51 participants). Nurses provided patient education, and SH doses were reduced every 2 to 4 weeks by approximately 25%. Alternative drugs valerian or hydroxyzine were permitted for sleep to support benzodiazepine tapering. At 6 months, 80% of the patients had discontinued benzodiazepine use and 64% maintained discontinuation at 1 year. Those who successfully discontinued benzodiazepine therapy reported improvements in depression and anxiety without reduction in sleep quality. A pharmacy-based patient education program was examined in 2 randomized controlled trials. Tannenbaum et alconducted a cluster randomized trial to compare the effect of a direct-to-consumer education tool versus usual care via 30 community pharmacies in Québec. Pharmacies were randomly allocated to the intervention, which involved mailing an 8-page brochure to chronic benzodiazepine users aged 65 years and older either immediately (intervention) or after a 6-month wait period (control). The brochure included education about harms, peer support stories, a tapering protocol, and alternatives. At 6 months, 27% of the intervention group had discontinued therapy versus 5% of the control group (risk difference = 23%; 95% CI = 14%-32%), and 11% had reduced their dose (95% CI = 6%-16%). Lack of physician support was identified as a deterrent to deprescribing. To address this barrier, a second randomized trial that added an evidence-based pharmaceutical opinion sent to physicians, at the same time as pharmacists mailed the education brochure to patients, sought to better foster communication around deprescribing. The study enrolled 489 participants from 69 community pharmacies who were prescribed 1 of 4 Beers Criteria medications (SH, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, glyburide, or first-generation antihistamine). SH discontinuation was 43.2% for the intervention group versus 9.0% for the control group (risk difference = 34%; 95% CI = 25%-43%); 38% of individuals who attempted to taper SH reported withdrawal symptoms.

### Practical strategies for pruritus management in the obeticholic acid-treated patient with PBC: proceedings from the 2018 expert panel [^e3f8f629]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

If these medications are insufficient or not well tolerated, SSRIs, such as sertraline, are a fourth-line option. Sertraline has been shown to reduce pruritus symptoms at 75–100 mg doses, which must be achieved through titration. Although recommended in the guidelines as a fourth-line option, experts on the panel deemed sertraline extremely helpful, and several experts recommended its use earlier in the course of pruritus treatment. The experts also reported some success with the use of gabapentin for pruritus management, and while this medication is not in the AASLD clinical practice guidance the EASL guidelines do discuss its potential use for treatment of pruritus. Few data exist, however, on the use of gabapentin for pruritus in patients with liver disease, and a small study from 2006 found no benefit for this use of gabapentin, compared with placebo. Nevertheless, gabapentin, as well as SSRIs, may be used empirically in clinical practice. Because PBC and PBC-related pruritus are sometimes associated with psychological factors, such as fatigue, emotional issues, sleep disturbance, and depression, the use of an SSRI may have the added benefit of addressing these symptoms. Additionally, clinical data show an effect of sertraline on pruritus relief independent from improvement in depression symptoms. A careful psychiatric history should always be undertaken whenever prescribing antidepressants. The panel discussed sertraline dosage, and the experts recommended a starting dose of 25 mg, with titration of sertraline until the full dose is achieved, although in the experience of the expert panel the low dose is sufficient for most patients who will respond. Antihistamines, such as hydroxyzine, can also be used to alleviate pruritus symptoms; however, recent evidence indicates that hydroxyzine use is associated with a rare increased risk for QT interval prolongation and may cause torsade de pointes in patients with increased cardiovascular (CV) risk (baseline QT prolongation). As such, hydroxyzine should be used with caution in patients with a history of CV risk factors and avoided if patients experience QT prolongation; for these patients, other antihistamine or treatment options may be preferable.

### Night-time sedating H1-antihistamine increases daytime somnolence but not treatment efficacy in chronic spontaneous urticaria: a randomized controlled trial [^999adc4f]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

These guidelines also recommend against the use of older, sedating first-generation H 1 -antihistamines in patients with urticaria unless there is a special indication.–This is because first-generation H 1 -antihistamines have pronounced unwanted effects, including anticholinergic effects and sedative actions on the central nervous system. At night, first-generation H 1 -antihistamines increase the latency to the onset of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and reduce the duration of REM sleep. Furthermore, residual effects, or hangover, are still present the next morning. Such effects include impairment in divided attention, vigilance, working memory and sensory–motor performance. For commonly used drugs, the incidence of subjectively reported somnolence has been documented to vary from 40% with chlorpheniramine or brompheniramine to 80% with hydroxyzine. Disturbingly, lack of subjective drowsiness does not mean that an individual is able to drive a vehicle without impairment because subjective somnolence and impairment of the ability to perform tasks are not necessarily correlated.

Despite the potential of first-generation H 1 -antihistamines to cause unwanted effects, many physicians believe that the most effective treatment for chronic urticaria is a nonsedating second-generation H 1 -antihistamine in the morning and a sedating first-generation H 1 -antihistamine, usually hydroxyzine or chlorpheniramine, at night to reduce night-time itch and enhance sleep. The rationale for this is that the sedative component makes people sleep better in spite of the pruritus. This is supported by some guidelines, particularly older ones.–

But is this belief well founded? To date, there are no back-to-back comparisons of therapy of CSU with a nonsedating H 1 -antihistamine during the day plus a sedating first-generation sedating H 1 -antihistamine at night vs. monotherapy with a nonsedating H 1 -antihistamine. Consequently, we have compared the effectiveness of therapy and the prevalence of unwanted effects when treating patients with severe CSU with levocetirizine 15 mg daily plus hydroxyzine 50 mg at night (levocetirizine plus hydroxyzine) vs. levocetirizine 20 mg daily (levocetirizine monotherapy).

### Evidence on antidepressant withdrawal: an appraisal and reanalysis of a recent systematic review [^dfd01a18]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The few studies that reported authors' qualitative assessment of the severity of withdrawal symptoms yielded varied results. Some suggested that symptoms were generally mild (Kragh-Sorensen et al; Rickels, Schweizer, Weiss, & Zavodnick,), and some suggested that they were commonly or not infrequently severe (Dallal & Chouinard; Kramer, Klein, & Fink; Murata et al.). The authors of one noted that the symptoms of withdrawal in general were 'fairly distressing and uncomfortable' and that people who had severe withdrawal had 'very distressing symptoms' (p. 16) (Murata et al.).

In another small study identified by Henssler et al. but not included in their analysis of severity, 12 of 14 participants who abruptly stopped fluvoxamine after 7–8 months experienced withdrawal symptoms, and of these five had to take time off work, six contacted researchers for help, three sought medical attention, one was re-medicated because of panic, and one became suicidal (Black, Wesner, & Gabel). Incidentally, it is also interesting to note that several studies documented rare cases of hospitalization and other serious events that were considered likely or possible complications of withdrawal (see Supplementary).

### Are antimuscarinic effects common in hydroxyzine overdose? A cohort analysis of antimuscarinic effects in hydroxyzine and diphenhydramine-poisoned patients [^65e6a485]. Clinical Toxicology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Exposures to hydroxyzine, a first-generation H1 antihistamine, have increased rapidly over the last two decades. Many assumptions about hydroxyzine poisoning are based on other antihistamines, like diphenhydramine. However, the receptor affinities of hydroxazine suggest that there should be fewer antimuscarinic findings than diphenhydramine.

Methods

This was a cohort study that compared hydroxyzine and diphenhydramine exposures reported to the National Poison Data System between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2020, and the Toxicologic Investigators Consortium Core Registry between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2020. The primary outcome was to assess for antimuscarinic findings in hydroxyzine-poisoned patients, using diphenhydramine-poisoned patients as a comparison group. The secondary outcomes were to assess for markers of overall toxicity. Inclusion criteria were single-substance exposures with known outcomes. Exclusion criteria for National Poison Data System exposures were chronic exposures, unintentional exposures, and patients younger than 12years old. There were no exclusion criteria for exposures reported to the Toxicologic Investigators Consortium Core Registry.

Results

There were 17,265 hydroxyzine and 102,354 diphenhydramine exposures reported to the National Poison Data System and 134 hydroxyzine and 1,484 diphenhydramine exposures reported to the Toxicologic Investigators Consortium Core Registry that met inclusion criteria. In both datasets, hydroxyzine-poisoned patients had lower rates and relative risk of developing antimuscarinic findings or receiving physostigmine, with the exception of hyperthermia in the Toxicologic Investigators Consortium Core Registry dataset. Coma/central nervous system depression (major), respiratory depression, seizures, ventricular dysrhythmias, intubation, and benzodiazepine administration were less likely in hydroxyzine-poisoned patients, but central nervous system depression (mild) was more likely in exposures reported to the National Poison Data System. The mortality in hydroxyzine-poisoned patients was rare: 0.02% and 0.8% of exposures reported to the National Poison Data System and Toxicologic Investigators Consortium Core Registry, respectively.

Discussion

The clinical manifestations of hydroxyzine exposures are consistent with the pharmacology of hydroxazine. The clinical effects were consistent across two United States national datasets. Clinicians should not generalize the illness script of diphenhydramine exposures to hydroxyzine exposures.

Conclusions

Hydroxyzine-poisoned patients were less likely to develop antimuscarinic findings than diphenhydramine-poisoned patients. Hydroxyzine-poisoned patients were more likely to have mild central nervous system depression than an antimuscarinic toxidrome.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of EGFR inhibitor-associated dermatologic toxicities [^13fc2cc6]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Medium credibility.

EGFR inhibitor–associated pruritus — systemic agents and practical use: "Hence, nonsedating second-generation antihistamines are recommended as the first approach for systemic therapy for pruritus during daytime", and "Dosing of antihistamines also should be kept to the minimum to avoid adverse drug reactions, particularly in the elderly, as these medications may cause severe anticholinergic reactions". "For patients who suffer from pruritus during nighttime, first-generation antihistamines (such as diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine) are preferable given their sedative properties". Comparative tolerability shows "somnolence or sedation was recorded in 5% of loratadine patients and 40% of hydroxyzine patients after 1 week of drug usage [40]", and EGFRI data are limited: "two patients were given loratadine for 14 days; however, patients did not find it useful and discontinued treatment [22]". For refractory symptoms, "these antiepileptic agents should only be recommended as second-line treatment in patients who failed antihistamines and therapies against underlying rash and/or xerosis and continue to experience clinically significant pruritus". Regarding NK-1 antagonism, "aprepitant, an NK-1 antagonist was reported to reduce pruritus that is caused by erlotinib [38]", but "caution must be taken as aprepitant may cause drug–drug interactions and potentially affect the concentrations of erlotinib [45]".

### Discontinuation of psychotropic medication: a synthesis of evidence across medication classes [^73a8fef0]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

How to discontinue

Discontinuation strategies

For antipsychotic discontinuation, no evidence exists that gradual tapering decreases the risk of DS, although some recommend gradual and slowly (in months, possibly hyperbolic) tapering over quicker or abrupt discontinuation (Supplementary Text). Tapered discontinuation (compared to abrupt discontinuation) may reduce the risk of adverse somatic events after full discontinuation, although the minimum dose threshold appears to have more relevance.

Dose reduction

To our knowledge, no published trials have compared dose reduction with complete discontinuation. A meta-analysis found that dose reduction doubles relapse risk relative to dose maintenance, particularly below 200 mg/day chlorpromazine equivalent or 2.5 mg risperidone equivalent, highlighting the importance of the extent of dose reduction. The one trial at the time of writing that had compared antipsychotic dose reduction with maintenance strategies was conducted in people with recurrent psychotic disorders and FEP. It compared maintenance treatment with gradual, monitored, reduction of antipsychotics over several months (median dose reduction at any point 67% in the reduction group and 0% in the maintenance group). The results indicate that social functioning after 2 years is equal between groups, but that the risk of severe relapse is higher in the dose reduction than the maintenance group. In contrast, observational data hint at possible functional improvements in functioning after antipsychotic dose reduction in similar patient populations, but the possibility of confounding by indication precludes definitive conclusions from such data. New trials are underway to compare dose reduction or drug discontinuation with continuation strategies, including guided dose reduction to establish the minimum effective dose. Besides dose reduction studies, intermittent dosing strategies have also been proposed, with either regular gaps in dosing (from alternate days to several weeks), or only initiating antipsychotics when psychotic symptoms emerge, with no antipsychotic use between psychotic episodes. While the first strategy has shown some merits if drug-free days are few, the second strategy increased relapse risk and rehospitalization, limiting the current role of intermittent dosing strategies for antipsychotics.

Discontinuation interventions

No interventions to mitigate relapse risks in those discontinuing antipsychotics have been described. In clinical practice, patients tapering antipsychotics are closely monitored, family members may be involved, and psychosocial interventions may be considered.

Mood stabilizers

### Effects of intravenous hydroxyzine versus haloperidol monotherapy for delirium: a retrospective study [^b22d641f]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective: Although antipsychotics are used commonly for delirium, they increase the risk of mortality in elderly patients and those with dementia. As hydroxyzine has sedative and anxiolytic effects, it can be used in the treatment of delirium. We performed a retrospective study to compare the effects of intravenous hydroxyzine and haloperidol monotherapy on delirium.

Methods: Patients who admitted to a university hospital from April 1, 2017, to September 30, 2022, and received either hydroxyzine or haloperidol intravenously as monotherapy for the treatment of delirium were included. The time to and rate of delirium improvement were compared. Improvement of delirium was defined as negative on the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) or Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) for 3 consecutive days.

Results: Among 5,555 patients who developed delirium, 71 (1.3%) and 82 (1.5%) received intravenous hydroxyzine and haloperidol monotherapy, respectively. The time to delirium improvement was 7.0 days (95% CI, 5.7–8.3 days) for hydroxyzine and 8.2 days (95% CI, 7.6–8.8 days) for haloperidol, with no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.059). On the other hand, the rate of delirium improvement was 23.9% for hydroxyzine and 8.5% for haloperidol, with a significant difference in favor of the hydroxyzine group (P = 0.009).

Conclusions: We first showed that intravenous hydroxyzine monotherapy was not inferior for the time to delirium improvement and superior for the rate of delirium improvement to intravenous haloperidol monotherapy. Considering that hydroxyzine is relatively safe with few side effects, it can be a viable option for delirium as an alternative to antipsychotics.

### Injectable-only overlapping buprenorphine starting protocol in a low-threshold setting [^b154ebc1]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Protocol Description

The injectable-only overlapping buprenorphine starting protocol (Table 1) includes the following steps, without requiring the cessation of fentanyl use before or during the process: day 1 involves a weekly 8-mg injection without preceding sublingual buprenorphine; day 2 involves a weekly 16-mg injection; and day 3 involves a monthly, long-acting 128-mg or 300-mg buprenorphine injection. These 2 monthly doses were offered to provide choice and accommodate patient preferences, paired with the counseling that the 300-mg dose would likely result in higher buprenorphine levels and a larger subcutaneous depot and that the 128-mg dose would likely result in lower buprenorphine levels and a smaller subcutaneous depot.

Table 1.
Summary of the Injectable-Only Overlapping Buprenorphine Starting Protocol a

Abbreviation: NA, not applicable.

All patients who chose the protocol were provided with counseling that was based on prior clinical experience (Box). Standard patient counseling included a notification that, during the starting protocol, some degree of opioid withdrawal may be likely and severe opioid withdrawal remained possible. As with sublingual-based overlapping protocols, continued unregulated full agonist opioid use was assumed. Ceasing fentanyl or other full agonist opioid use during the process may result in opioid withdrawal and prompt the need to pivot to other buprenorphine starting methods. All patients were provided naloxone and counseled on safe use strategies.

Box.
Routine Patient Counseling

Expect some opioid withdrawal symptoms during the 3-day process.
Severe opioid withdrawal still remains a possibility.
Continued use of unregulated fentanyl is assumed. Ceasing fentanyl or other full agonist opioid use during the process may result in opioid withdrawal and prompt the need to pivot to other buprenorphine starting methods.
When using unregulated opioids, use them as safely as possible and carry naloxone.
Supplemental sublingual buprenorphine is recommended as needed for continued fentanyl cravings, starting at 24 hours after the monthly injection.
Use adjunct support medications provided (typically clonidine, hydroxyzine, and ondansetron) as needed for withdrawal symptoms.

If injections were not given on sequential days, the 16-mg injection was given as late as 2 days after the initial 8-mg injection before restarting. The monthly injection was given as late as 3 days after the 16-mg injection before needing to repeat a 16-mg injection. The protocol was fully restarted if a week had passed since the 16-mg injection.

2.4 Discontinuation of Treatment

Treatment with XENAZINE can be discontinued without tapering. Re-emergence of chorea may occur within 12 to 18 hours after the last dose of XENAZINE [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)].

### Chlorpromazine [^12216026]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Long-Term Therapy: To lessen the likelihood of adverse reactions related to cumulative drug effect, patients with a history of long-term therapy with chlorpromazine and/or other antipsychotics should be evaluated periodically to decide whether the maintenance dosage could be lowered or drug therapy discontinued.

Antiemetic Effect: The antiemetic action of chlorpromazine may mask the signs and symptoms of overdosage of other drugs and may obscure the diagnosis and treatment of other conditions such as intestinal obstruction, brain tumor and Reye's syndrome [see WARNINGS].

When chlorpromazine is used with cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, vomiting as a sign of the toxicity of these agents may be obscured by the antiemetic effect of chlorpromazine.

Abrupt Withdrawal: Like other phenothiazines, chlorpromazine is not known to cause psychic dependence and does not produce tolerance or addiction. There may be, however, following abrupt withdrawal of high-dose therapy, some symptoms resembling those of physical dependence such as gastritis, nausea and vomiting, dizziness and tremulousness. These symptoms can usually be avoided or reduced by gradual reduction of the dosage or by continuing concomitant anti-parkinsonism agents for several weeks after chlorpromazine is withdrawn.

### Discontinuation of psychotropic medication: a synthesis of evidence across medication classes [^381244a6]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Discontinuation symptoms are common but remain difficult to predict

First, discontinuation symptoms are common, particularly after abrupt or rapid cessation of medication, except in the case of stimulants. These symptoms generally dampen over time and seem less likely when discontinuation occurs gradually. In general, DS risk is higher for psychotropic drugs with shorter elimination half-lives, such as paroxetine, venlafaxine, clozapine, morphine, oxycodone, lorazepam, and temazepam (Table 1). Nevertheless, estimations of DS prevalence across medication groups are heterogeneous (see also Table 1). A challenge is that DS are often not measured at all, and, if measured, their operationalization varies (e.g. concerning questionnaires, cutoff values, and time points). Moreover, in many blinded studies, medication is abruptly stopped. Thus, current estimations of DS not only reflect the situation following abrupt or very quick cessation, but also include the influence of expectations and patients and clinicians' experiences and may thus be subject to nocebo effects. Finally, it can be challenging to disentangle DS from relapse due to symptom overlap. This may result in DS being misdiagnosed as relapse in discontinuation studies.

Do not discontinue medication too quickly

Second, it is clear that abrupt discontinuation is not only associated with DS, but also entails increased relapse risks. Nevertheless, the optimal period during which medication should be discontinued and the rate of dose reduction are unclear. Pragmatically, discontinuation over months is advisable, but evidence for these strategies is lacking. Gradual lowering of the dose is generally recommended for several reasons. First, relapse may be less severe if a patient is on a medium or low dose relative to discontinuation. Second, steady-state may be more readily re-achieved if relapse occurs while a patient is on a lower dose. Third, gradual tapering may be more comfortable for patients because of the decreased likelihood of DS. Gradual tapering is often possible using conventional dose regimens, and many patients can discontinue using these existing doses. Nevertheless, when discontinuation poses a greater challenge, a gradual decrease with low doses may be feasible. Another option that becomes apparent across medication classes is the possibility to switch to long-acting agents, e.g. diazepam, sustained-release buprenorphine and fluoxetine (although of the latter intervention only case reports are known). For some medications, e.g. opioids and antipsychotics, (demographic) variables have been associated with successful tapering, but given the lack of replicated findings these are not ready for translation into clinical practice.

Drug reaction categories to platinum agents — definitions and notes: Mild reaction (hot flushing, rash, pruritus) contrasts with severe reaction (shortness of breath, changes in blood pressure requiring treatment, dyspnea, GI symptoms [nausea, vomiting]) and life-threatening reaction (ie, anaphylaxis) with acute onset, generalized hives, respiratory compromise, severe hypotension, and GI symptoms [nausea, vomiting]. Most mild reactions are infusion reactions and more commonly are caused by taxanes (ie, docetaxel, paclitaxel), but can also occur with platinum agents (ie, carboplatin, cisplatin), whereas most severe reactions are allergic reactions and more commonly are caused by platinum agents. When H1 blocker antihistamine, H2 blockers, or corticosteroids are referenced, examples include diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine; cimetidine and famotidine; and methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, and dexamethasone. In the setting of acute cardiopulmonary arrest, standard resuscitation (ACLS) procedures should be followed.

### Chlorpromazine hydrochloride [^c74ddee2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Long-Term Therapy: To lessen the likelihood of adverse reactions related to cumulative drug effect, patients with a history of long-term therapy with chlorpromazine and/or other antipsychotics should be evaluated periodically to decide whether the maintenance dosage could be lowered or drug therapy discontinued.

Antiemetic Effect: The antiemetic action of chlorpromazine may mask the signs and symptoms of overdosage of other drugs and may obscure the diagnosis and treatment of other conditions such as intestinal obstruction, brain tumor and Reye's syndrome. (See WARNINGS).

When chlorpromazine is used with cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, vomiting as a sign of the toxicity of these agents may be obscured by the antiemetic effect of chlorpromazine.

Abrupt Withdrawal: Like other phenothiazines, chlorpromazine is not known to cause psychic dependence and does not produce tolerance or addiction. There may be, however, following abrupt withdrawal of high-dose therapy, some symptoms resembling those of physical dependence such as gastritis, nausea and vomiting, dizziness and tremulousness. These symptoms can usually be avoided or reduced by gradual reduction of the dosage or by continuing concomitant anti-parkinsonism agents for several weeks after chlorpromazine is withdrawn.

### Night-time sedating H1-antihistamine increases daytime somnolence but not treatment efficacy in chronic spontaneous urticaria: a randomized controlled trial [^8ea9514a]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

What's already known about this topic?

The EAACI/GA 2 LEN/EDF/WAO guideline for management of urticaria recommends second-generation 'nonsedating' H 1 -antihistamines as first-line treatment for chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU).
However, it is common practice to add a sedating H 1 -antihistamine, such as hydroxyzine, at night in the belief that it will reduce itch and improve the quality of sleep.

What does this study add?

This study compared 5-day treatment of CSU with the second-generation H 1 -antihistamine, levocetirizine (20 mg daily), with levocetirizine (15 mg daily) plus hydroxyzine (50 mg nightly).
The treatments were equally effective in decreasing symptoms and night-time sleep disturbances and increasing quality of life, but the addition of night-time hydroxyzine significantly increased daytime somnolence.
The belief that addition of a night-time sedating H 1 -antihistamine is of benefit in the treatment of CSU is unfounded.

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a relatively common condition, with 0.5–1.0% of the population suffering from it at any single time. Of the symptoms of this condition, pruritus is the most bothersome, particularly at night when it causes sleep disturbances. These disturbances in sleep lead to chronic fatigue, with a direct impact on quality of life (QoL) and physical and emotional well-being, which may be assessed for chronic urticaria using specifically designed questionnaires such as the Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire (CU-Q 2 oL). In addition, it has been reported that pruritic skin diseases impair workplace productivity, classroom productivity and daily activity by 39%, 45% and 42%, respectively.

Because chronic urticaria has such a profound impact on QoL, effective treatment is required. The European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology/Global Allergy and Asthma European Network/European Dermatology Forum/World Allergy Organization guideline for management of urticariarecommends second-generation 'nonsedating' H 1 -antihistamines as first-line treatment. It also states that if standard dosing is not effective, increasing the dosage up to fourfold is recommended. This recommendation is reiterated in other, newer international guidelines.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Hydroxyzine, when administered to the pregnant mouse, rat, and rabbit, induced fetal abnormalities in the rat and mouse at doses substantially above the human therapeutic range. Clinical data in human beings are inadequate to establish safety in early pregnancy. Until such data are available, hydroxyzine is contraindicated in early pregnancy.

Hydroxyzine is contraindicated in patients with a prolonged QT interval.

Hydroxyzine pamoate is contraindicated for patients who have shown a previous hypersensitivity to any component of this medication.

Hydroxyzine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to hydroxyzine products, and in patients with known hypersensitivity to cetirizine hydrochloride or levocetirizine hydrochloride.

### Cessation of medication for people with schizophrenia already stable on chlorpromazine [^1227df27]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Chlorpromazine, one of the first generation of antipsychotic drugs, is effective in the treatment of schizophrenia. For most people schizophrenia is a life-long disorder but about a quarter of those who have a first psychotic breakdown do not go on to experience further breakdowns. Most people with schizophrenia are prescribed antipsychotic drugs, although use is often intermittent. The effects of stopping medication are not well researched in the context of systematic reviews.

Objectives

To quantify the effects of stopping chlorpromazine for people with schizophrenia stable on this drug.

Search Strategy

We supplemented an electronic search of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (March 2006) with reference searching of all identified studies.

Selection Criteria

We included all relevant randomised clinical trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently inspected citations and abstracts, ordered papers and re-inspected and quality assessed these. We independently extracted data and resolved disputes during regular meetings. We analysed dichotomous data using fixed effects relative risk (RR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous data, where possible, we calculated the weighted mean difference (WMD). We excluded the data where more than 40% of people were lost to follow up.

Main Results

We included ten trials involving 1042 people with schizophrenia stable on chlorpromazine. Even in the short term, those who remained on chlorpromazine were less likely to experience a relapse compared to people who stopped taking chlorpromazine (n = 376, 3 RCTs, RR 6.76 CI 3.37 to 13.54, NNH XX CI XX to XX). Medium term (n = 850, 6 RCTs, RR 4.04 CI 2.81 to 5.8, NNH 4 CI 3 to 7) and long term data were similar (n = 510, 3 RCTs, RR 1.70 CI 1.44 to 2.01, NNH XX CI XX to XX). People allocated to chlorpromazine withdrawal were not significantly more likely to stay in the study compared with those continuing chlorpromazine treatment (n = 374, 1 RCT, RR 1.14 CI 0.55 to 2.35). In sensitivity analyses, there was a significant difference in the 'relapse' outcome between trials for those diagnosed according to checklist criteria compared to those with a clinical diagnosis.

Authors' Conclusions

This review confirms clinical experience and quantifies the risks of stopping chlorpromazine medication for a group of people with schizophrenia who are stable on this drug. With its moderate adverse effects, chlorpromazine is likely to remain one of the most widely prescribed treatments for schizophrenia.

### Efficacy and safety of hydroxyzine in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder: a 3-month double-blind study [^bae4e8cc]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) represents an important public health issue. Hydroxyzine, an antagonist of histamine receptors, showed both efficacy and safety in previous short-term double-blind studies over placebo in this pathology. The aim of the current study was to confirm those positive results over a 3-month period in adult outpatients.

Method

This multicenter, parallel (hydroxyzine [50 mg/day]; bromazepam [6 mg/day]), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 2 weeks of single-blind run-in placebo, 12 weeks of double-blind randomized treatment, and 4 weeks of single-blind run-out placebo. Three hundred thirty-four of 369 selected outpatients with a diagnosis of GAD according to DSM-IV criteria and a Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) total score ≥ 20 were randomized before entering the double-blind period. The primary outcome criterion was the change in the HAM-A score from baseline to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with hydroxyzine compared with placebo.

Results

In the intent-to-treat analysis, the mean ± SD change in HAM-A scores from baseline to endpoint was -12.16 ± 7.74 for hydroxyzine and -9.64 ± 7.74 for placebo (p = .019). Results at endpoint for percentage of responders (p = .003) and remission rates (p = .028), Clinical Global Impressions-Severity scale score (p = .001), maintenance of efficacy (p = .022), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale score on day 84 (p = .008) also confirmed the efficacy of hydroxyzine over placebo. The study showed no statistically significant difference between hydroxyzine and bromazepam. Except for drowsiness, which was more frequent with bromazepam, safety results were comparable in the 3 groups.

Conclusion

Hydroxyzine showed both efficacy and safety in the treatment of GAD and appears to be an effective alternative treatment to benzodiazepine prescription.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^4df18ddf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Dermatographism — Patients promptly have a wheal‑and‑flare response to pressure applied to the skin, and it is the most common form of physical urticaria reported to be present in 2% to 5% of the general population, although only a minority have symptoms prompting medical attention. Diagnosis of symptomatic dermographism can be confirmed by stroking the skin with a firm object; a dermographometer can also be used, with thresholds of 4900 g/cm2 for simple (nonpruritic) dermatographism and 2300 to 2600 g/cm2 for symptomatic dermatographism. The wheal‑and‑flare response should develop within 1 to 3 minutes; with symptomatic dermographism, urticaria occurs less than 5 minutes after provocation and can last for more than 30 minutes, whereas delayed pressure urticaria responses might manifest after several hours. Symptomatic dermatographism has been reported in association with bacterial, fungal, or scabies infection and after treatment with penicillin or famotidine, although in most cases it is idiopathic. Management generally includes avoidance measures, skin hydration, and antihistamines; both first‑ and second‑generation H1‑antagonists (eg, hydroxyzine and cetirizine) have been demonstrated to improve symptom control. The addition of H2‑antagonists to H1‑antagonists might be beneficial but has not improved symptom control in all studies, and improvement with UVB light therapy has also been reported.

### Delayed recrudescence to toxic salicylate concentrations after salsalate overdose [^f85b0dee]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Salicylates are common exposures. We report an unusual case of salicylate ingestion, as salsalate, with resolution of symptoms and return of salicylate levels to non-toxic values, with a subsequent, unexpected recrudescence to toxic levels requiring reinstitution of therapy. A 31-year-old man ingested unknown amounts of salsalate, hydroxyzine, and a benzodiazepine. He was intubated and treated with IV sodium bicarbonate and two doses of oral activated charcoal. Eight hours after presentation, his serum salicylate concentration peaked at 55 mg/dL, and then decreased to a nadir of 5.6 mg/dL 38 h after presentation, coinciding with return of GI motility. Several hours later salicylate concentrations began to rise, peaking 67 h after presentation at 61.7 mg/dL. He was treated with sodium bicarbonate and charcoal, which resulted in decreased serum salicylate to therapeutic levels. Salicylate ingestions are known to exhibit unusual toxicokinetics and absorption in overdose; however, this is the first case we are aware of that shows a return to toxic concentrations after apparent resolution of toxicity. Recrudescence of salicylate concentrations to a degree that would dictate reinstitution of therapy for overdose is unusual and may warrant prolonged monitoring of serum salicylate concentrations in salsalate ingestions.

### Evaluation of the effects of a monthly buprenorphine depot subcutaneous injection on QT interval during treatment for opioid use disorder [^8902d666]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Covariate effects

Withdrawal from opioids and drugs used to treat these symptoms (e.g. clonidine and methocarbamol) can increase the HR, which can influence QTc interval given the well‐known QT‐RR relationship. Only withdrawal symptoms had a significant effect on alpha, which was very small, with an alpha of 0.341 for a COWS score of 5 (mild) and 0.363 for a COWS score of 20 (moderate).

Although drugs used to treat withdrawal symptoms can increase QT, the present analysis showed that the effect of hydroxyzine on QTc was very small. An effect of methadone was observed as expected, 11 because two phase I studies had data with and without methadone administration in the same subjects. The magnitude of change due to methadone was lower than expected, likely because data were combined across methadone doses (20–100 mg) and times (e.g. all buprenorphine times plus methadone's T max). The effect of barbiturates and codeine on QT were consistent with those reported previously 11, 12 as was the small effect of cocaine on QT. 11, 13 The effect of phencyclidine observed on QT has not been reported, but is likely related to changes in HR. 14 The oxycodone effect was small and opposite of expectations. 12 Importantly, the goals of including comedications were to reduce the signal‐to‐noise ratio by accounting for all factors affecting QT prior to characterizing the effect of buprenorphine on QT. The 90% CIs for ΔQTc were very narrow showing that these goals were met.

### Loss of responsiveness on reinstatement of antidepressants after treatment interruption – A systematic review [^a6eea246]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We found data on 594 participants who stopped and then restarted an individual antidepressant with a gap in treatment of between 5 days and greater than 2 years. Of 10 studies reporting failure rates on re-exposure to an antidepressant (n = 362), non-response occurred in 4%–57% of participants. In studies not reporting response rates, there was evidence of reduced magnitude of response on restarting. Given these observations, there is some certainty that breaks in treatment can lead to loss of antidepressant response. However, there is much less certainty about the factors that influence future non-responsiveness and the degree to which response is lost.

Interpretation of reported outcomes is made difficult by several considerations. Most of these studies included either no tapering period or a very rapid tapering of antidepressant treatment, whereas some had prolonged tapering periods. Risk of non-response did not seem to be associated with the tapering method. In fact, the only study in which participants showed no loss of responsiveness was one in which antidepressants were deliberately withdrawn abruptly. However, in this study, participants did not relapse, as such, but merely showed inflated depression rating scale scores because of the presence of withdrawal symptoms. Thus, the effect of reinstatement was to cause withdrawal symptoms to abate rather than to re-exert an antidepressant effect. For many studies, it is much less clear whether antidepressants were reinstated because of relapse of the disorder for which they initially received treatment or because antidepressant withdrawal symptoms mimicked relapse. The study with the longest withdrawal period had the highest non-response rate (57%), perhaps reflecting the absence of reinstatement effects on withdrawal symptoms. It is also possible that reinstatement initially mitigates withdrawal symptoms but does not provide longer-term antidepressant or other activity – this seems to have been demonstrated bywho observed a reduced maintenance of response in patients who had previously discontinued fluoxetine abruptly.

### Hydroxyzine versus triclofos for sedation for electroencephalography recording in children: a noninferiority randomized controlled trial [^0e9826b6]. Pediatric Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Triclofos is commonly used for sedation in children for electroencephalography (EEG) recording. A noninferiority randomized controlled trial was conducted to assess the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of hydroxyzine as an alternate drug for sedation.

Methods

Children aged six months to five years who did not sleep naturally for EEG recording were randomly assigned to receive either hydroxyzine or triclofos in 1:1 ratio. Our primary outcome was successful EEG completion as defined by achieving at least 40 minutes of sleep record in a one-hour EEG recording. Our secondary outcomes were Ramsay sedation score, time taken for sedation, need for second dose of sedative agent, yield of abnormal EEG records, incidence of adverse events, technologist and caregiver satisfaction score (based on a Likert scale), neurologist assessment of motion artifacts based on a visual analog scale, and effect of the drug on the amplitude and frequency of the background rhythm. The parents were interviewed telephonically regarding any adverse effects within the next 24 hours.

Results

Successful EEG completion was achieved in 82.6% in the hydroxyzine arm and in 90.2% in the triclofos arm with a mean difference of -7.66 (95% confidence interval: -16.5 to 1.2, P = 0.092). Secondary outcomes such as time taken to sleep, need for second dose of sedation, yield of abnormal EEG records, adverse effect profile, neurologist grading of motion artifacts, and effect on background were comparable between both groups.

Conclusion

Hydroxyzine may be a safe, acceptable, and efficacious alternative sedative agent for EEG recording in children.

### Guidance for non-HIV-specialized providers caring for people with HIV who have been displaced by disasters (such as a hurricane) [^0d01d23b]. HIV.gov (2024). High credibility.

Caring for people on medications for opioid use disorder — disasters can disrupt methadone maintenance therapy (MMT), and federal law prohibits physicians from prescribing methadone for the treatment of OUD outside of a methadone clinic; increasing access to buprenorphine replacement therapy, which can be prescribed by health care providers outside of a licensed methadone clinic, can help to preserve access to medication-assisted treatment for OUDs until MMT clinics reopen. All health care providers with a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) license may prescribe buprenorphine for the treatment of OUD (an X waiver is no longer required), including treatment for withdrawal symptoms. If a provider is unable to prescribe buprenorphine or it is not available, other medications can be prescribed to lessen withdrawal symptoms; for example, lofexidine is FDA approved to treat opioid withdrawal symptoms and the dose is 0.18 mg four times daily at 5- to 6-hour intervals for up to 14 days, though barriers to lofexidine use may include cost and availability. Other medications — including clonidine, hydroxyzine, and loperamide — have been used off label to support people in opioid withdrawal, and consultation with a specialist is optimal to aid in dosing. Providers should prescribe naloxone to all people with OUD and should also make sure the person with OUD has naloxone on hand to reverse an overdose should they relapse, use unknown quantities of illicit methadone, or attempt to self-medicate with other substances. Tips for locating substance use and mental health services can be found on the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) website.

### Tetrabenazine [^69ce08bf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Extensive and Intermediate CYP2D6 Metabolizers

Genotyped patients who are identified as extensive (EMs) or intermediate metabolizers (IMs) of CYP2D6, who need doses of tetrabenazine tablets above 50 mg per day, should be titrated up slowly at weekly intervals by 12.5 mg daily, to allow the identification of a tolerated dose that reduces chorea. Doses above 50 mg per day should be given in a three times a day regimen. The maximum recommended daily dose is 100 mg and the maximum recommended single dose is 37.5 mg. If adverse reactions such as akathisia, parkinsonism, depression, insomnia, anxiety or sedation occur, titration should be stopped and the dose should be reduced. If the adverse reaction does not resolve, consideration should be given to withdrawing tetrabenazine tablets treatment or initiating other specific treatment (e.g., antidepres- sants) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Poor CYP2D6 Metabolizers

In PMs, the initial dose and titration is similar to EMs except that the recommended maximum single dose is 25 mg, and the recommended daily dose should not exceed a maximum of 50 mg [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.3 Dosage Adjustment with CYP2D6 Inhibitors

Strong CYP2D6 Inhibitors

Medications that are strong CYP2D6 inhibitors such as quinidine or antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine) significantly increase the exposure to α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ; therefore, the total dose of tetrabenazine tablets should not exceed a maximum of 50 mg and the maximum single dose should not exceed 25 mg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Drug Interactions (7.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.4 Discontinuation of Treatment

Treatment with tetrabenazine tablets can be discontinued without tapering. Re-emergence of chorea may occur within 12 to 18 hours after the last dose of tetrabenazine tablets [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)].
