## Question

Which laboratory tests should be obtained on ascitic fluid?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which laboratory tests to obtain on ascitic fluid. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming ascites and indications for diagnostic paracentesis. Then, I should define the core tests that every sample must have and why. Next, I will examine infection-focused testing, including PMN thresholds and cultures, and verify units and techniques. After that, I will consider etiologic classification with SAAG and total protein. Then, I should layer in add-on tests driven by clinical suspicion and explicitly correct any misstatements. I also need to review rapid adjuncts, sample handling, and safety. Finally, I will integrate special populations and close with a concise scenario-based summary that aligns with major guidelines [^114SRKgZ] [^116pba1m].

> Let me first confirm when to tap and how to confirm ascites. Diagnostic paracentesis should be performed without delay in all hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and ascites, and in anyone with new-onset ascites or concern for infection, because early paracentesis reduces in-hospital mortality and acute kidney injury and shortens length of stay, and delays can be harmful [^116sj21P] [^112mQfR9]. I should confirm the presence of fluid by exam or ultrasound; shifting dullness typically requires approximately 1.5 liters of fluid, and ultrasound is helpful when the exam is equivocal or the patient is obese [^116DesEd]. Wait, let me verify the procedural guidance piece: point-of-care ultrasound often changes the insertion site to a safer, deeper pocket and is therefore reasonable to use when available, which fits the observed 69% relocation rate and greater fluid depth at the chosen site [^1148k3o4].

> Now, I need to ensure the core tests are not missed, because they answer the three immediate questions: is there infection, is portal hypertension the driver, and what is the risk of SBP. The universally recommended core panel at the time of diagnostic paracentesis includes: cell count with differential to obtain the neutrophil count, bedside culture in aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles, ascitic albumin with simultaneous serum albumin to calculate SAAG, and ascitic total protein, as endorsed by AASLD, EASL, and BASL/BSG [^114SRKgZ] [^116pba1m] [^111KuzhC]. Hold on, I should verify that all three societies align on albumin and total protein; yes, they do, with BASL/BSG explicitly emphasizing both SAAG calculation and total protein on initial analysis [^114GgmpD] [^113Brfv2].

> I will now examine the infection threshold and the counting method. SBP is diagnosed when the ascitic polymorphonuclear (neutrophil) count is greater than 250 cells per mm³ in the absence of a surgically treatable source, and automated flow-cytometric differential counts have accuracy close to manual microscopy while being faster and less operator-dependent, which improves reliability in practice [^1114zpPx] [^111vWbop]. Hmm, wait a minute, I recall seeing an EASL phrasing with "greater than 250 cells/L", but that unit is clearly incongruent with standard practice; I should correct myself and state the conventional and guideline-consistent unit is per mm³ or µL, with the accepted threshold at 250 cells/mm³, which maximizes sensitivity for SBP detection [^111vWbop] [^116hzk29].

> Next, I should review cultures and the timing because missing this step can lower diagnostic yield. Ascitic fluid culture should be inoculated at the bedside into both aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles before antibiotics, which substantially increases culture positivity and informs pathogen-directed therapy, and remains guideline-recommended even though some single-center emergency department studies suggested limited downstream changes in management [^111QMCdv] [^111L4bpm]. Wait, let me verify consistency across society statements: AASLD repeatedly stresses bedside inoculation before starting antibiotics, and EASL agrees that culture positivity is not required for SBP diagnosis but still advises culture to guide therapy, which reconciles the occasional low-yield reports with best practice recommendations [^117JZ4Hm] [^116iQsaf].

> Let me think about SAAG now, because I need to determine whether portal hypertension is the dominant mechanism. I should calculate SAAG as serum albumin minus ascitic albumin; a SAAG of at least 1.1 g/dL strongly suggests portal hypertensive ascites, whereas a SAAG below 1.1 g/dL points toward non-portal hypertensive etiologies, and this remains the preferred classification approach in guidelines [^111KuzhC] [^114GgmpD]. Hold on, I should confirm the simultaneous blood draw point: serum and ascitic albumin must be measured contemporaneously to ensure valid SAAG interpretation, which AASLD operationalizes in its initial testing checklist [^114SRKgZ].

> I should also confirm the role of total protein, because it both refines etiology and stratifies infection risk. Low ascitic total protein, especially below 1.5 g/dL, identifies cirrhotic patients at higher risk for SBP, while a higher protein, particularly above 2.5 g/dL, together with a high SAAG, suggests a cardiac contribution to the ascites physiology, which can be further supported by BNP when clinically suspected [^111KuzhC]. Let me verify the EASL statement about total protein and SBP risk; yes, EASL also recommends total protein to identify high-risk patients, reinforcing its inclusion in the core panel [^116pba1m].

> Next, I should review targeted add-on tests that I will order selectively based on pretest probability raised by history, exam, imaging, or the core results. For suspected malignancy, cytology is appropriate and guideline-endorsed to differentiate malignant from non-malignant ascites when suspicion is meaningful and adequate volume is sent, improving the yield when performed properly, which EASL emphasizes [^1147QQ6P] [^112EBY1E]. For suspected pancreatic ascites, a markedly elevated ascitic amylase, typically greater than 1000 mg/dL or several-fold above serum, along with low SAAG and high protein, supports the diagnosis, guiding toward endoscopic or surgical management when conservative therapy fails [^111NHHzj] [^116P4MEC] [^112c5pAS]. For suspected cardiac ascites, a high SAAG with ascitic protein above 2.5 g/dL and an elevated serum or ascitic BNP supports a cardiac etiology, aiding differentiation from cirrhotic portal hypertension alone [^111KuzhC]. For suspected tuberculous peritonitis, I should send ADA and consider a nucleic acid amplification test such as Xpert MTB/RIF on ascitic fluid in addition to mycobacterial culture, recognizing that evidence quality is variable but these tests can be helpful in the right clinical context [^114uEZRX] [^1115uioo]. For suspected secondary bacterial peritonitis due to a perforated viscus, I should check glucose and LDH, because very low glucose and high LDH in ascites suggest a secondary process that warrants urgent surgical evaluation, not empiric SBP-only management [^112Xjg6J]. For suspected chylous ascites, triglycerides help confirm a lymphatic leak, and in bile or urine leaks, ascitic bilirubin greater than serum or ascitic creatinine greater than serum, respectively, provide strong diagnostic clues that redirect management to source control and specialty consultation [^112Xjg6J]. But wait, I need to correct a potential mix-up I noticed elsewhere: linking TB culture positivity to a threshold of high amylase would be incorrect; high amylase is a pancreatic ascites signal, not a TB criterion, and I should avoid conflating these entities when ordering the panel [^111NHHzj] [^114uEZRX].

> I should double-check whether any rapid adjuncts can assist at the bedside without replacing gold standards. Lactoferrin measured in ascitic fluid shows very high sensitivity and specificity for SBP at reported cutoffs and may be useful as an adjunct, but it is not yet guideline-standard and should not replace PMN counting or cultures [^113Zw8Bo]. Leukocyte esterase dipsticks can provide a quick screen for elevated PMNs with good specificity, but reagent strips lack sufficient sensitivity for reliable standalone use and therefore are not recommended as replacements for cell counts by major guidelines, though they can be considered as temporary triage tools [^116h4W5A] [^111vWbop]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: even with promising rapid tests, confirmatory PMN count and early cultures remain the diagnostic backbone for SBP decisions [^1114zpPx] [^111QMCdv].

> Next, I should review practical collection and handling, because preanalytical steps determine diagnostic accuracy. I need to collect enough volume for all targets: generally 20–50 mL for routine chemistry and cell counts, at least 10 mL into each of the aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles at the bedside before antibiotics, and a larger volume such as 100–200 mL when cytology is clinically indicated to improve yield, while ensuring an EDTA tube is used for automated cell differential when available [^111QMCdv] [^111vWbop]. I should confirm post-procedure monitoring for SBP cases: if clinical response is inadequate, a repeat paracentesis at about 48 hours to reassess PMN trends and culture status is reasonable per guidance, and routine pre-procedure coagulation testing is not required unless there is clinical concern for severe coagulopathy, which avoids unnecessary delays [^116sj21P] [^114Qadwe]. Let me verify again the ultrasound guidance point: its use reduces complications by guiding the needle to deeper, safer pockets, so it is prudent when feasible, particularly in obese patients or those with loculated fluid [^1148k3o4].

> I will now examine special populations where my testing approach may need tailoring. In severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, outpatient ultrasound-guided paracentesis is acceptable, and peri-procedural attention to renal function and electrolytes is advised given dynamic fluid shifts, with observational data showing improved urine output after drainage, which can guide the timing of repeat taps and lab checks [^115zJS53] [^111T2Cgy]. In pediatric patients, if eosinophilic gastroenteritis is suspected, I should look for eosinophil-predominant ascitic inflammation to support the diagnosis along with appropriate GI evaluation, recognizing that this is a selective rather than routine test [^115iAGHG]. In fetal ascites, specialized biochemical and cytologic panels can be diagnostic and should be coordinated with maternal-fetal medicine; this is outside the usual adult workflow but important when consulted for prenatal cases [^115fK4xf].

> Let me reconsider how to translate this into common clinical scenarios so ordering is efficient and accurate. For new-onset ascites of unclear cause, I should always send the core panel and then add tests driven by the story and imaging, such as cytology if malignancy is suspected, amylase if pancreatic disease is likely, or ADA and mycobacterial studies if TB is on the differential, ensuring that each add-on is justified by pretest probability and not sent indiscriminately [^114SRKgZ] [^1147QQ6P] [^1116aGS6]. For routine cirrhotic ascites at admission, I should still obtain the full core panel to screen for SBP and reclassify the physiology as needed, with BNP considered if clinical features point toward a cardiac component such as right heart failure or constrictive pericarditis [^111KuzhC]. For suspected SBP, I must prioritize a STAT PMN count and bedside cultures before antibiotics, then tailor antibiotics to local resistance patterns, and consider repeat paracentesis at 48 hours if the response is suboptimal, while adjunctive rapid tests may support but not replace the core methods [^1114zpPx] [^111QMCdv] [^116sj21P]. For suspected secondary bacterial peritonitis, I should add ascitic glucose and LDH to the core testing and promptly involve surgery if the biochemical pattern and clinical context indicate a perforated source, avoiding anchoring bias on SBP in the face of atypical features or poor response to therapy [^112Xjg6J].

> Final check and summary so nothing is missed. Mandatory for every diagnostic paracentesis are: cell count with differential to obtain the neutrophil count, bedside inoculated cultures in aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles before antibiotics, ascitic albumin with simultaneous serum albumin for SAAG, and ascitic total protein; these address infection, portal hypertensive physiology, and SBP risk in accordance with AASLD, EASL, and BASL/BSG guidance [^114SRKgZ] [^116pba1m] [^111KuzhC]. Selective add-ons are ordered based on clinical suspicion: cytology for malignancy, amylase for pancreatic ascites, BNP when cardiac disease is suspected, ADA and TB studies for tuberculous peritonitis, glucose and LDH for suspected secondary peritonitis, triglycerides for chylous ascites, and bilirubin or creatinine for suspected bile or urine leaks, respectively, with rapid adjuncts like lactoferrin or leukocyte esterase serving only as supportive tools, not replacements for PMN and culture [^1147QQ6P] [^111NHHzj] [^1115uioo] [^114uEZRX] [^112Xjg6J] [^113Zw8Bo] [^111vWbop]. Hold on, I should verify alignment one more time: this approach is consistent across major society guidelines and balances diagnostic yield with stewardship by reserving non-core tests for specific clinical questions rather than sending an undirected panel on every patient [^114SRKgZ] [^116pba1m].

Order the following tests on ascitic fluid: **cell count with differential** (PMN ≥ 250/mm³ indicates SBP) [^1114zpPx], **albumin and total protein** (to calculate SAAG and assess SBP risk) [^111KuzhC], and **bedside inoculation into aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles** before antibiotics [^111QMCdv]. Add **cytology** for suspected malignancy [^1147QQ6P], **amylase** for pancreatic ascites [^112c5pAS], **triglycerides** for chylous ascites [^112Xjg6J], and **ADA with mycobacterial studies** for suspected TB [^114uEZRX] [^1115uioo]. These tests guide the diagnosis and management of SBP, portal hypertension, malignancy, and other causes [^114SRKgZ].

## Essential laboratory tests for ascitic fluid analysis

### Cell count and differential

- **Purpose**: Detect infection, particularly SBP [^113BocY5].
- **Key parameter**: PMN count ≥ 250 cells/mm³ indicates SBP [^1114zpPx].
- **Clinical significance**: Prompt diagnosis enables early antibiotics, reducing morbidity and mortality [^116sj21P].

---

### Albumin and total protein

- **Purpose**: Differentiate portal hypertension-related ascites from other causes [^114GgmpD].
- **Key parameter**: SAAG ≥ 1.1 g/dL suggests portal hypertension; < 1.1 g/dL suggests malignancy, infection, or pancreatitis [^111KuzhC].
- **Clinical significance**: Guides further evaluation and management [^1177Wn5b].

---

### Culture and sensitivity

- **Purpose**: Identify causative organisms in suspected infection [^116hzk29].
- **Method**: Bedside inoculation into aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles before antibiotics [^111QMCdv] [^111L4bpm].
- **Clinical significance**: Guides targeted antibiotic therapy [^116iQsaf].

---

## Additional tests based on clinical suspicion

### Cytology

Cytology is indicated when **malignancy is suspected** (e.g. ovarian, gastrointestinal, or peritoneal carcinomatosis) and detects **malignant cells** to confirm malignant ascites [^1147QQ6P] [^11674Zor].

---

### Amylase

Amylase testing is indicated when **pancreatic ascites** is suspected (e.g. chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic trauma, pseudocyst rupture). An ascitic amylase level > 1000 IU/L suggests pancreatic ascites and helps distinguish it from other causes [^112c5pAS] [^111NHHzj].

---

### Triglycerides

Triglyceride testing is indicated for suspected **chylous ascites** (e.g. lymphatic obstruction, malignancy, trauma). Ascitic triglycerides > 200 mg/dL support the diagnosis of chylous ascites and guide further evaluation [^112Xjg6J].

---

### Adenosine deaminase (ADA) and mycobacterial studies

ADA and mycobacterial studies are indicated for suspected **tuberculous peritonitis**. An elevated ADA supports TB; send fluid for AFB smear, culture, and PCR to confirm TB peritonitis and guide anti-tuberculous therapy [^114uEZRX] [^1115uioo].

---

## Summary table of recommended ascitic fluid tests

| **Test** | **Indication** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Cell count and differential | All patients | Detects infection (SBP) [^111vWbop] |
| Albumin and total protein | All patients | Differentiates portal hypertension-related ascites [^111KuzhC] |
| Culture and sensitivity | Suspected infection | Identifies causative organisms [^111L4bpm] |
| Cytology | Suspected malignancy | Detects malignant cells [^1147QQ6P] |
| Amylase | Suspected pancreatic ascites | Differentiates pancreatic ascites [^112c5pAS] |
| Triglycerides | Suspected chylous ascites | Confirms chylous ascites [^112Xjg6J] |
| ADA and mycobacterial studies | Suspected TB peritonitis | Confirms TB peritonitis [^114uEZRX] |

## Clinical implications of ascitic fluid analysis

Early **diagnostic paracentesis** reduces in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and acute kidney injury in cirrhosis with ascites [^112mQfR9] [^111aXzxq]. SBP is diagnosed with a **PMN count ≥ 250 cells/mm³**; prompt treatment reduces morbidity and mortality [^1114zpPx]. The **SAAG** helps differentiate portal hypertension–related ascites from other causes and guides management [^111KuzhC]. Additional tests — cytology, amylase, triglycerides, and ADA — clarify etiology and guide therapy [^1115uioo].

---

## Conclusion

Ascitic fluid analysis should include a **cell count with differential, albumin, total protein, and culture and sensitivity** [^114SRKgZ] [^111QMCdv]. Add cytology, amylase, triglycerides, and ADA with mycobacterial studies based on clinical suspicion to guide diagnosis and management [^1115uioo] [^114uEZRX].

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^111KuzhC]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

Aspiration of ascitic fluid and its laboratory analysis is an essential step in the management of patients with newly diagnosed ascites. In cirrhosis, hepatic sinusoids are less permeable owing to fibrous tissue deposition, resulting in ascites with low protein content. It is important to estimate the total protein level in ascitic fluid; a concentration below 1.5 g/dL (or 15 g/L) is a risk factor for the development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Additionally, the serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) should be routinely estimated. A cut-off point of 1.1 g/dL (or 11 g/L) differentiates between causes of ascites with high sensitivity, although alternative causes should be considered based on the clinical scenario.

Hepatic sinusoids are normally permeable in heart failure, which allows for leakage of protein-rich lymph into the abdominal cavity. Therefore, the total protein concentration in ascitic fluid is high (> 2.5 g/dL) in combination with a high SAAG. In such situations, measurement of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in the serum ± ascites is useful. Total protein concentrations > 2.5 g/dL within the ascites and serum BNP > 364 ng/L are suggestive of underlying or additional cardiac disease, whereas serum protein values < 182 ng/L rule out cardiac disease.

In low SAAG states, the clinical context and imaging should guide the investigational approach. The yield for positive cytology in the context of malignancy is variable, ranging from…

### Differentiation of exudate from transudate ascites based on the dipstick values of protein, glucose, and pH [^113TmVPs]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of the present study was to determine the reliability of dipstick values (protein, glucose, and pH) for differentiating exudate from transudate ascites, in comparison with the serum-ascites albumin gradient as the criterion standard. A total of 100 patients with ascites (58 males and 42 females; mean age, 55.6 ± 16.1 years) were studied to identify the various causes of ascites. Peripheral blood samples were obtained, and at the same time, the patients underwent paracentesis. Based on the serum-ascites albumin gradient, there were 62 cases (62.0%) of transudate ascites and 38 cases (38.0%) of exudate ascites.

Using logistic regression, we identified a dipstick equation (K = 0.012Protein - 0.012Glucose - 3.329pH + 23.498) to differentiate transudate (K ≥ 0) from exudate ascites. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the dipstick equation to diagnose ascites as transudate were 93.8%, 94.4%, 96.8%, and 89.5%, respectively. For exudate ascites, these values were 94.4%, 93.9%, 89.5%, and 96.9%, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.915 (95% confidence interval, 0.848–0.982; P < .001). We concluded that the dipstick can be an inexpensive, rapid, and simple option for categorizing ascites into transudate and exudate, and can be routinely used for this purpose in clinical practice.

### Ascitic fluid lactoferrin for diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^113Zw8Bo]. Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

- **Aims**: The diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is based on a manual count of ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs). This procedure is operator-dependent and lysis of PMNs during transport to the laboratory may lead to false-negative results. Furthermore, ascitic fluid culture is insensitive and leads to delays in diagnosis. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of ascitic fluid lactoferrin (AFLAC) for the diagnosis of SBP and to identify a cut-off level that can be used for future development of a rapid bedside test.

- **Methods**: A total of 218 consecutive ascites samples from 148 patients (1–8 samples per patient) with cirrhosis at 2 tertiary care medical centers were examined for PMN count, bedside culture, and lactoferrin concentration. AFLAC concentrations were determined using a polyclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. An ascitic fluid PMN count of 250 cells/mL or greater, with or without a positive culture, was used for diagnosis of SBP.

- **Results**: Twenty-two (10.1%) samples fulfilled diagnostic criteria for SBP. Samples with SBP had a significantly higher lactoferrin concentration (median, 3744 ng/mL; 25th-75th percentiles [P25-P75], 788–9617) compared with non-SBP samples (median, 31 ng/mL; P25-P75, 12–67; P < .001). By using a cut-off level of 242 ng/mL, the sensitivity and specificity of the assay for diagnosis of SBP were 95.5% and 97%, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.98.

- **Conclusions**: AFLAC can serve as a sensitive and specific test for diagnosis of SBP.

### Diagnostic model for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients with ascites: A multicenter cohort study [^113Uf1D8]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

- **Design**: We conducted a cross-sectional study to develop a diagnostic model for the early and accurate diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

- **Study population**: The retrospective study was conducted at Beijing You-An Hospital, Capital Medical University, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, and Beijing Ditan Hospital between January 2017 and December 2018. We continuously recruited 1618 patients with ascites who underwent abdominal paracentesis. Data related to the clinical features, history, demographic information, physical examination, and laboratory test results were collected. Diagnostic abdominal paracentesis was routinely performed in all cirrhotic ascites patients, as well as those with suspicion of SBP. Cirrhosis was diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria suggested by the 2019 guidelines for the management of cirrhosis. The study included patients aged 18–90 years with cirrhosis and ascites.

	- We excluded patients with any factors that may affect the diagnosis of SBP, namely:

		- **Medication-related factors**: antibiotic use, use of SBP prophylaxis, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or contraceptives

		- **Non-cirrhotic ascites causes**: ascites without cirrhosis (such as due to pancreatitis, peritoneal cancer, tuberculosis, heart failure, kidney disease, or intraabdominal bleeding)

		- **Other medical conditions**: malignant tumors, hematological diseases, abdominal diseases (such as gastritis, enteritis, or intestinal obstruction)

		- **Recent treatments or interventions**: abdominal surgery within the past 3 months, chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the past 1 month

		- **Additional conditions**: pregnancy, secondary peritonitis, bacterial infections other than SBP, vomiting, diarrhea

### Peritoneal fluid cultures rarely alter management in patients with ascites [^112mywRx]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to determine if the peritoneal fluid culture results in patients with ascites being evaluated for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in the Emergency Department (ED) are used by the inpatient physician to appropriately alter empiric antibiotic treatment. We performed a retrospective study of all ascitic fluid samples sent from the ED between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2004. Exclusion criteria included peritoneal fluid samples from peritoneal dialysis patients and those undergoing diagnostic peritoneal lavage for trauma. Medical records were examined to determine culture results, initial antibiotic choices, and subsequent changes in antibiotics by the inpatient physician in response to the culture results. The primary outcome measure was the percentage of cases in which ED peritoneal fluid culture results caused inpatient physicians to appropriately change antibiotic coverage.

There were 201 ascitic fluid samples, of which 7 (3.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4%-7.0%) had a pathogen identified. Of these, only 1 (0.5%; 95% CI .01%-2.4%) resulted in an appropriate change in empiric antibiotic therapy. Although there were additional opportunities for appropriately using the culture results to change the antibiotic coverage in 2 (1%; 95% CI 0.1%-3.6%) patients, coverage was not changed. In fact, it was changed inappropriately in these 2 patients, and in an additional patient on appropriate empiric therapy.

The yield from ascitic fluid cultures was low, and when positive, the results did not appropriately alter antibiotic treatment decisions.

### Does point-of-care ultrasound change the needle insertion location during routine bedside paracentesis [^1148k3o4]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Paracentesis is a bedside procedure to obtain ascitic fluid from the peritoneum. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) improves the safety of some medical procedures; however, the evidence supporting its utility in paracentesis is limited.

- **Objective**: We aimed to assess if POCUS would yield a user-preferred site for needle insertion compared to conventional landmarking, defined as a ≥ 5 cm change in location.

- **Design**: This was a prospective non-randomized trial comparing a POCUS-guided site to the conventional anatomic site in the same patient.

- **Participants**: Adult patients at Kingston Health Sciences Centre undergoing paracentesis were included.

- **Interventions**: Physicians landmarked using conventional technique and compared this to a POCUS-guided site. The paracentesis was performed at whatever site was deemed optimal if safe to do so.

- **Main measures**: Data collected included the distance from the two sites, depth of fluid pockets, and anatomic considerations.

- **Key results**: Forty-five procedures were performed among 30 patients and by 24 physicians, who were primarily in their PGY 1 and 2 years of training (33% and 31% respectively). Patients' ascites was mostly due to cirrhosis (84%), predominantly due to alcohol (47%) and NAFLD (34%). Users preferred the POCUS-guided site, which resulted in a change in needle insertion ≥ 5 cm from the conventional anatomic site in 69% of cases. The average depth of fluid was greater at the POCUS site vs. the anatomic site (5.4 ± 2.8 cm vs. 3.0 ± 2.5 cm, p < 0.005). POCUS deflected the needle insertion site superiorly and laterally.

### The role of ascitic fluid viscosity in differentiating the nature of ascites and in the prediction of renal impairment and duration of ICU stay [^112K2cQi]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

The serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) has been used in the classification of ascites for the last 20 years, but it has some drawbacks. This study explores possible correlations between ascitic fluid viscosity and the etiology of ascites, renal impairment, and the length of ICU stay.

- **Materials and methods**: The study was conducted at Zagazig University Hospital, Egypt. It included 240 patients with ascites due to various causes, divided into two groups: the cirrhotic ascites group (120 patients) and the non-cirrhotic ascites group (120 patients). Ascitic patients on medical management with diuretics, antibiotics, paracentesis, and infusions of plasma or albumin were excluded. The laboratory analysis included routine investigations to detect the cause of ascites, as well as specific investigations such as ascitic fluid viscosity using a falling ball viscosimeter (microviscosimeter) at 37°C.

- **Results**: The mean ascitic viscosity of patients with SAAG at least 1.1 was 1.16 ± 0.56, associated with serum creatinine 1.35 ± 0.52 mg/dl and ICU stay of 3.3 ± 1.2 days. For patients with SAAG less than 1.1 g/dl, the mean ascitic viscosity was 2.98 ± 0.87, with serum creatinine 2.1 ± 0.56 mg/dl and ICU stay of 7.1 ± 1.3 days. Ascitic viscosity can discriminate ascites due to portal hypertension from those associated with non-portal hypertension at a cut-off value of 1.65. It can predict renal impairment in hepatic patients at a cut-off of 1.35 and long ICU stay at a cut-off of 1.995 using receiver operating characteristic analysis.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^114qbwPX]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

The British Society of Gastroenterology, in collaboration with the British Association for the Study of the Liver, has prepared this document. The aim of this guideline is to review and summarize the evidence that guides clinical diagnosis and management of ascites in patients with cirrhosis. Substantial advances have been made in this area since the publication of the last guideline in 2007.

These guidelines are based on a comprehensive literature search and comprise systematic reviews in key areas, including diagnostic tests, diuretic use, therapeutic paracentesis, use of albumin, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and beta-blockers in patients with ascites. Where recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses are available, these have been updated with additional studies. Additionally, the results of prospective and retrospective studies, evidence obtained from expert committee reports, and, in some instances, reports from case series have been included.

Where possible, judgments have been made on the quality of information used to generate the guidelines. Specific recommendations have been made according to the 'Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)' system. These guidelines are intended to inform practicing clinicians, and it is expected that they will be revised in 3 years' time.

### Early diagnostic paracentesis improves outcomes of hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and ascites: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112mQfR9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Diagnostic paracentesis is recommended for patients with cirrhosis admitted to the hospital, but adherence is suboptimal, with an unclear impact on clinical outcomes. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the outcomes of early versus delayed diagnostic paracentesis among hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and ascites.

- **Methods**:
	- We searched multiple databases for studies comparing early versus delayed diagnostic paracentesis among hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and ascites. The pooled odds ratio (OR) and mean difference with confidence intervals (CIs) for proportional and continuous variables were calculated using the random-effects model. Early diagnostic paracentesis was defined as receiving diagnostic paracentesis within 12–24 hours of admission. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were the length of hospital stay, acute kidney injury, and 30-day readmission.

- **Results**:
	- Seven studies (n = 78,744; n = 45,533 early vs. n = 33,211 delayed diagnostic paracentesis) were included. Early diagnostic paracentesis was associated with lower in-hospital mortality (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46–0.82, P = 0.001), a shorter length of hospital stay (mean difference -4.85 days; 95% CI -6.45 to -3.20; P < 0.001), and reduced acute kidney injury (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.42–0.92, P = 0.02) compared with delayed diagnostic paracentesis. The results showed similar 30-day readmission rates (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.52–2.39, P = 0.79). Subgroup analysis revealed consistent results for in-hospital mortality whether early diagnostic paracentesis was performed within 12 hours (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.32–0.79, P = 0.003, I² = 0).

### Pancreatic ascites: Update on diagnosis and management [^114gS8xu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

Pancreatic ascites is a diagnostic challenge because of its rarity and nonspecific clinical features. Therefore, a comprehensive diagnostic approach that incorporates a history of the presenting illness, physical examination, blood tests, imaging, and diagnostic paracentesis with fluid analysis is crucial. The physical findings of ascites may include cachexia, abdominal tenderness, peritonitis, abdominal distension, shifting dullness, positive fluid wave, decreased bowel sounds, and extremity edema. Patients with concomitant pleural effusion may exhibit decreased breath sounds, crackles or rales, and in severe cases, may be in respiratory distress.

Routine blood tests, including a complete metabolic panel, brain natriuretic peptide level, lactate, uric acid, and complete blood cell count, can help clinicians narrow down the differential diagnosis of new-onset ascites. Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormality observed in pancreatic ascites cases and is likely to be dilutional due to fluid retention. Hypoalbuminemia is also reported in most cases and is often secondary to severe malnutrition in the setting of chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic ascites.

On complete blood cell count, patients typically show low hemoglobin with a normal to mildly elevated white blood count, even in the absence of an underlying infection. Platelet count and coagulation factors, such as prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and international normalized ratio, are usually normal. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rates may also be measured to assess inflammation.

### Xpertmtb/rif assay for extrapulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance [^114uEZRX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Cell counts and chemistries should be performed on amenable fluid specimens collected from sites of suspected extrapulmonary TB. This includes pleural, cerebrospinal, ascitic, and joint fluid. Adenosine deaminase levels should be measured on fluid collected from patients with suspected pleural TB, TB meningitis, peritoneal TB, or pericardial TB. Free IFN-γ levels should also be measured on fluid collected from patients with suspected pleural TB or peritoneal TB. These are conditional recommendations based on very low to low-quality evidence.

NAA test is a molecular technique that can detect small quantities of genetic material (DNA or RNA) from microorganisms, such as M. tuberculosis. The key advantage of NAA tests is their rapid diagnostic capability, potentially providing results in a few hours. This feature is particularly important in life-threatening forms of extrapulmonary TB, such as TB meningitis. Various molecular amplification methods are available, with PCR being the most common. NAA tests are available as commercial kits and in-house tests (based on laboratory-developed protocols) and are routinely used in high-income countries for TB detection. In-house PCR is widely used in low-income countries because these tests are less expensive than commercial kits. An older editorial summarized three systematic reviews (140 studies) of commercial and in-house NAA tests (other than Xpert) for different forms of extrapulmonary TB.

### Pancreatic ascites: Update on diagnosis and management [^111NHHzj]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

Pancreatic ascites is a rare condition characterized by the accumulation of high-amylase ascitic fluid in the peritoneal cavity. This condition is often associated with chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic trauma, or pseudocyst rupture. Due to its rarity and ill-defined clinical presentation, pancreatic ascites poses both diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in clinical practice. The diagnostic criteria include an amylase level greater than 1000 mg/dL, a protein level greater than 3 g/dL, and a serum ascites albumin gradient less than 1.1 g/dL. Clinical features vary but may include progressive abdominal distention, diffuse abdominal pain, weight loss, and peritonitis.

The management of pancreatic ascites remains controversial, with no consensus regarding the optimal approach. Conservative medical management — which includes nutritional support, pain control, therapeutic paracentesis, and the use of somatostatin analogs — has been associated with a high failure rate and significant morbidity. Interventional therapies such as surgery and endoscopic transpapillary stenting have shown more promising outcomes. However, the choice between these methods is still debated, with some advocating for endoscopic approaches due to their minimally invasive nature and reduced morbidity compared to surgical options. Endoscopic approaches remain underutilized in practice, likely due to the need for repeated interventions, potential risks associated with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, or a lack of skilled personnel. Although they show significant perioperative morbidity, they offer a less invasive treatment option.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^112vWWff]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

Large volume paracentesis is the standard of care for managing large volume ascites. It is used both in conjunction with diuresis to relieve symptoms of a tense abdomen and in the management of refractory ascites, when diuretics become ineffective or their side effects preclude continued use. The development of refractory ascites holds prognostic significance; therefore, at its onset, the suitability of liver transplantation should be considered and assessed as a priority.

- **Performance standards**: An efficient large volume paracentesis (LVP) service can be safely provided in a day-case or outpatient setting. Non-physician healthcare providers, such as GI endoscopy assistants and specialist nurses, can be trained to perform therapeutic paracentesis and effectively lead the service. Exemplar training programs indicate that 10 supervised procedures are optimal for training to achieve competence in therapeutic paracentesis; the mean duration of an LVP was 97 ± 24 minutes, and the mean volume of ascitic fluid removed was 8.7 ± 2.8 liters.

Patients should provide informed consent before the procedure. In a study involving 52 patients (15% obese) with ascites due to cirrhosis, ultrasound demonstrated that the left lower quadrant abdominal wall was thinner with a greater depth of ascites. Thus, it is a suitable site for drain insertion. To minimize the risk of injury to the inferior epigastric artery (and avoid the liver and spleen) during paracentesis, the point of puncture should be at least 8 cm from the midline and 5 cm above the symphysis. All ascitic fluid should be drained to dryness.

### Paracentesis is associated with reduced mortality in patients hospitalized with cirrhosis and ascites [^111aXzxq]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Diagnostic paracentesis is recommended for patients with cirrhosis who are admitted to the hospital for ascites or encephalopathy. However, it is not known whether clinicians in the United States adhere to this recommendation; a relationship between paracentesis and clinical outcome has not been reported. We analyzed a U.S. database to determine the frequency of paracentesis and its association with mortality.

- **Methods**: The 2009 Nationwide Inpatient Sample, which contains data from approximately 8 million hospital discharges each year, was used to identify patients with cirrhosis and ascites who were admitted with a primary diagnosis of ascites or encephalopathy. In-hospital mortality, length of stay, and hospital charges were compared for those who did and did not undergo paracentesis. Outcomes were compared for those who received an early paracentesis (within 1 day of admission) and those who received one later.

- **Results**: Of 17,711 eligible admissions, only 61% underwent paracentesis. In-hospital mortality was reduced by 24% among patients who underwent paracentesis (6.5% vs 8.5%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.41–0.74). Most paracenteses (66%) occurred within 1 day after admission. In-hospital mortality was lower among patients who received early paracentesis than those who received it later (5.7% vs 8.1%, P = 0.049), although this difference was not significant after adjustment for confounders (odds ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.78–2.02). Among patients who underwent paracentesis, the mean hospital stay was 14% longer and hos…

### Meeting the challenge of ascites in ovarian cancer: new avenues for therapy and research [^11674Zor]. Nature Reviews Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Malignant ascites presents a considerable clinical challenge to the management of ovarian cancer but also provides a wealth of opportunities for translational research. The accessibility of ascitic fluid and its cellular components makes it an excellent source of tumor tissue for the investigation of prognostic and predictive biomarkers, pharmacodynamic markers, and for molecular profiling analysis.

In this opinion article, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of its pathophysiology, the development of new methods to characterize its molecular features, and how these findings can be used to improve the treatment of malignant ascites, particularly in the context of ovarian cancer.

### Total ascitic fluid leukocyte count for reliable exclusion of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with ascites [^115NqTT1]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in patients with ascites is established by definition with a polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell count in the ascitic fluid greater than 0.250 g/l, determined via cytological (microscopic) examination. In this study, we correlated the automatically assessed total ascitic nucleated cell count with PMN and determined its predictive value for the diagnosis of SBP.

- **Methods**: Six hundred and eleven consecutive paracenteses of 179 patients with ascites of various etiologies (liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, peritoneal carcinomatosis, and ascites of other etiology) were studied retrospectively.

- **Results**: The most reliable diagnostic cut-off level was determined for differentiation between SBP and non-SBP via receiver operating characteristics analysis. A total ascitic nucleated cell count less than 1.0 g/l is unlikely to represent SBP (negative predictive value, 95.5%).

- **Conclusions**: If ascitic fluid samples with machine-measured total ascitic nucleated cell count below 1.0 g/l are not followed by additional laboratory tests, the risk of missing the diagnosis of SBP is low. Applying these criteria, we would have classified 51 samples of 611 samples (20 of 179 patients) wrongly using the cut-off value of 1 g/l. On the other hand, we would have spared cytologic evaluation in about 63% of paracentesis performed in our hospital. Nevertheless, to ensure patient safety, standard laboratory analysis is recommended in circumstances of clinical uncertainty. Thus, patients with the first manifestation of ascites should always be thoroughly evaluated.

### Ascites as the initial presentation of gastrointestinal carcinoma [^114xcotg]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). High credibility.

The rapid development of ascites in a patient without known liver disease is an uncommon occurrence in the emergency department. Initial stabilization may include therapeutic peritoneal lavage to reduce diaphragmatic pressure and halt the progression of respiratory compromise. In the absence of liver disease, the differential diagnosis should include a search for malignancy, which has been reported to account for up to 10% of all cases of newly diagnosed ascites.

- **Objectives**: To discuss the differential diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment options associated with the development of acute malignant ascites.

- **Case report**: We report the case of an 86-year-old woman who presented with the chief complaint of an enlarging abdomen and worsening shortness of breath of 1 week's duration. Bedside ultrasound rapidly revealed a large amount of intraperitoneal free fluid as a cause for her abdominal distension and respiratory compromise. Laboratory analysis of her blood along with computed tomography scan of her abdomen and pelvis were unremarkable. Diagnostic and therapeutic peritoneal lavage was done, and the patient's symptoms improved. Pathologic examination of the peritoneal fluid revealed metastatic gastrointestinal carcinoma.

- **Conclusion**: Rapidly progressing ascites may be the sole presenting symptom of metastatic gastrointestinal carcinoma.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^113snnRy]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

Recommendations:

- **Albumin infusion after paracentesis**: Albumin (as a 20% or 25% solution) should be infused after paracentesis of > 5 L is completed at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed (quality of evidence: high; recommendation: strong).

- **Consideration for paracentesis < 5 L**: Albumin (as a 20% or 25% solution) can be considered after paracentesis of < 5 L at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed in patients with ACLF or high risk of post-paracentesis acute kidney injury (quality of evidence: low; recommendation: weak).

- **Infusion in patients with SBP**: In patients with SBP and an increased serum creatinine or a rising serum creatinine, infusion of 1.5 g albumin/kg within 6 hours of diagnosis, followed by 1 g/kg on day 3, is recommended (quality of evidence: low; recommendation: weak).

### Nitric oxide in ascitic fluid is an independent predictor of the development of renal impairment in patients with cirrhosis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^115Bdgo7]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

- **Aims**: Cirrhotic patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis show a marked activation of the cytokine cascade, and cytokines induce the synthesis of nitric oxide in vitro. Our aim was to assess whether patients with ascitic fluid infection show increased levels of nitric oxide and whether this is related to the development of renal impairment.

- **Methods**: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected specimens from 168 patients with cirrhosis and the presence of sterile or infected ascitic fluid. Routine biochemical data together with nitric oxide metabolites, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-6 were measured. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors related to the development of renal impairment.

- **Results**: Patients with infected ascites showed increased serum and ascitic-fluid levels of nitric oxide metabolites and cytokines compared with patients with sterile ascites. A significant direct correlation was observed between serum and ascitic fluid nitric oxide metabolite levels. Multivariate analysis identified ascitic-fluid nitric oxide metabolites as an independent predictor of renal impairment.

- **Conclusions**: The increased serum and ascitic fluid nitric oxide found in patients with infected ascites might induce a deterioration of the increased peripheral vasodilation found in this setting, leading to the development of renal impairment in a series of patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^116sj21P]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

- **Recommendations**: Diagnostic paracentesis should be carried out without delay to rule out SBP in all cirrhotic patients with ascites upon hospital admission. A diagnostic paracentesis should also be performed in patients with GI bleeding, shock, fever, or other signs of systemic inflammation, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatic encephalopathy, and in patients with worsening liver or renal function.

- **Ascitic neutrophil count**: An ascitic neutrophil count greater than 250/mm³ remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of SBP. This can be performed either by manual microscopy or using automated counts based on flow cytometry for counting and differentiating cells.

- **Ascitic fluid culture**: Ascitic fluid culture with bedside inoculation of blood culture bottles should be performed to guide the choice of antibiotic treatment when SBP is suspected.

- **Antibiotic therapy**: Immediate empirical antibiotic therapy should be determined with due consideration of the context of SBP (community-acquired or healthcare-associated), severity of infection, and local bacterial resistance profile. Cefotaxime has been widely studied; however, the choice of antibiotic should be guided by local resistance patterns and protocol.

A second diagnostic paracentesis at 48 hours from the start of treatment to check the efficacy of antibiotic therapy should be considered in those who have an apparently inadequate response.

### The use of non-routine pleural fluid analysis in the diagnosis of pleural effusion [^113nDEdW]. Respiratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The investigation of a pleural effusion is, in general, a straightforward process, with the combination of clinical history, examination, radiology, and pleural fluid analysis leading to diagnosis in most cases. While most fluid samples are sent for routine analysis, including protein, LDH, glucose, cytology, and microbiology, a number of more unusual fluid analyses are available, which in some cases directly lead to, and in others are suggestive of, the diagnosis. Moreover, other fluid markers are constantly being evaluated as a diagnostic tool. In this review, we describe these non-routine pleural fluid analyses in detail. English-language publications in MEDLINE and references from relevant articles from January 1, 1990, to August 1, 2009, were reviewed. Keywords searched in combination were pleural fluid, effusion, analysis, transudate, exudate, and diagnosis.

Even though the analysis of peritoneal fluids (PF) is often requested by medical laboratories for biochemical and morphological tests, there is still no mutual agreement on the most appropriate way to manage PF samples and which tests should be appropriately executed. In this update, we aimed to identify the most useful tests for PF analysis to establish best practice guidelines. We performed a literature review and examined available guidelines to select the most appropriate tests through an evidence-based approach. Accordingly, the basic PF profile should include:

- **Serum to effusion albumin gradient and automated cell counts**: This profile involves differential analysis to determine the PF nature, differentiating between 'high-albumin gradient' and 'low-albumin gradient' effusions, which helps to identify the pathophysiological process causing ascites formation.
- **Additional tests restricted to specific clinical situations**:
	- PF lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and glucose to exclude (LDH) or confirm (glucose) secondary bacterial peritonitis
	- PF total protein to differentiate ascites of cardiac origin from other causes
	- PF (pancreatic) amylase for the identification of pancreatic ascites
	- PF bilirubin when a choleperitoneum is suspected
	- PF triglycerides in differentiating chylous from pseudochylous ascites
	- PF creatinine to detect intraperitoneal urinary leakage

These tests can be requested as needed based on the clinical context.

### The clinical management of abdominal ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: A review of current guidelines and recommendations [^112EBY1E]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Several pathogenic processes have been implicated in the development of abdominal ascites. Portal hypertension, most usually in the context of liver cirrhosis, accounts for about 75% of the cases, whereas infective, inflammatory, and infiltrative etiologies can explain the remainder. This article discusses the consensus best practices published by three professional bodies for managing ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The aim of this study was to compare available clinical guidelines and identify areas of agreement and conflict.

We conducted a review of the guidance documentation published by three expert bodies, including the British Society of Gastroenterology, the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD). Additionally, a broader literature search was performed for ascites, SBP, and HRS. Abdominal ultrasonography, diagnostic paracentesis, and ascitic fluid cultures are recommended by all three guidelines, especially when there is strong clinical suspicion of infection. EASL and AASLD advocate the use of ascitic amylase and mycobacterial cultures/PCR when there is strong suspicion of tuberculosis and pancreatitis, respectively. Ascitic cytology is beneficial when cancer is suspected and has a good diagnostic yield if performed correctly.

EASL supports using urinary electrolytes for all patients. However, the British Society of Gastroenterology and AASLD recommend their use only for therapy monitoring. All three societies recommend cefotaxime as an appropriate treatment option.

### Does this patient have bacterial peritonitis or portal hypertension? How do I perform a paracentesis and analyze the results [^114Qadwe]. JAMA (2008). Low credibility.

Abdominal paracenteses are performed in patients with ascites, most commonly to assess for infection or portal hypertension and to manage refractory ascites.

- **Objectives**: To systematically review evidence for paracentesis methods that may decrease the risk of adverse events or improve diagnostic yield and to determine the accuracy of ascitic fluid analysis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or portal hypertension.

- **Data sources**: Relevant English-language studies from Medline (1966-April 2007) and EMBASE (1980-April 2007).

- **Study selection**: Paracentesis studies evaluating interventions (use of pre-procedure coagulation parameters, needle type, insertion location, ultrasound guidance, bedside inoculation into blood culture bottles, and use of plasma expanders in therapeutic taps) for reducing adverse events or improving the diagnostic yield, and studies assessing the accuracy of ascitic fluid biochemical analyses for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or portal hypertension.

- **Data extraction**: For technique studies, data on intervention and outcome; and for diagnostic studies, data on parameters for diagnosing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and portal hypertension (i.e. ascitic fluid white blood cell and polymorphonuclear leukocyte [PMN] count, ascitic fluid pH, blood-ascitic fluid pH gradient, and serum-ascites albumin gradient).

- **Data synthesis**: Thirty-seven studies met inclusion criteria: two showed that obtaining pre-procedure coagulation was likely unnecessary prior to paracentesis; one showed the 15-gauge, 3.25-inch needle-cannula results in less multiple peritoneal p.

### Noninvasive assessment of hepatic decompensation [^116ph2ps]. Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

The presence of ascites is commonly clinically overt. However, patients with compensated cirrhosis have regular ultrasound examinations, which occasionally detect small amounts (grade 1) of ascites. Although minimal ascites are not considered decompensation, affected patients appear to have poorer prognoses. Interestingly, grade 1 ascites were not associated with a higher rate of progression to overt ascites, suggesting that these patients do not necessarily need diuretic treatment. However, it was associated with a higher level of systemic inflammation compared with no ascites.

Overt HE (West Haven grade ≥ II) is usually diagnosed on clinical grounds. Because normal values of plasma ammonia rule out overt HE with a high negative predictive value, measurement of ammonia may be done in patients with acute encephalopathy to exclude other causes of cognitive impairment. On a more exploratory note, elevated levels of ammonia have been shown to predict hospitalization with liver-related complications in stable outpatients with cirrhosis. However, one should be aware that measuring and using serum ammonia has limitations, including handling and processing time of the sample having a significant impact on the ammonia levels. Further, no upper limit of normal or generally accepted diagnostic cutoff exists, and ammonia levels overlap in patients with HE of various grades.

A diagnosis of covert HE requires neuropsychological or psychometric tests. These tests include the simple Animal Naming Test, for bedside use, and the gold standard psychometric HE score.

### Differential diagnosis of gynecologic organ-related diseases in women presenting with ascites [^115V5JmH]. Taiwanese Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology (2008). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on ascites:

- **Definition**: Ascites is a pathologic accumulation of fluid within the peritoneal cavity that usually develops as a result of liver disease, congestive heart failure, or nephrotic syndrome.

- **Pathophysiology**: Ascites is most frequently caused by portal hypertension occurring in the setting of cirrhosis. Other causes are broadly divided into pre-hepatic (portal vein thrombosis, lymphoma, abdominal lymphatic injury or obstruction, bowel perforation, renal failure, pancreatitis, peritoneal tuberculosis, or malignancy with peritoneal implants) and post-hepatic (congestive heart failure, constrictive pericarditis, Budd-Chiari syndrome, and stricture/web formation in the inferior vena cava) causes.

- **Disease course**: Ascites causes clinical manifestations of abdominal distention, abdominal fullness, discomfort, shortness of breath, early satiation, and a sense of reduced mobility.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Ascites is associated with a 1-year mortality rate of 40%. Refractory ascites has a median survival rate of 6 months.

### Contemporary management of malignant ascites [^1117NdAR]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2025). Low credibility.

Malignant ascites (MA) develops when malignant disease of the peritoneum causes excess fluid to accumulate in the abdominal cavity. It portends a poor prognosis and is associated with debilitating symptoms. While several palliative therapies exist, none have proven curative or free from side effects and complications. This review article describes experimental therapies on the horizon and the contemporary management of MA.

- **Materials and methods**: A literature review was performed using MEDLINE/PubMed, in which studies of emerging or experimental therapies under investigation for the management of MA were reviewed. Therapies were reviewed to provide important context. Data, including study design, sample size, primary and secondary outcomes, and side effects, were recorded and described. Studies were then categorized into distinct sections and subsections, with tables corresponding to each section.

- **Results**: Five therapies, including paracentesis, diuretics, peritoneovenous shunting, permanent catheters, and intraperitoneal chemotherapy, are described. Their limitations in effectively managing MA are highlighted. The "Experimental therapies" section is subsectioned into several categories, with the major studies corresponding to each section thoroughly described regarding methods, results, and validity. A final section describes treatments for mucinous ascites, which has distinct characteristics.

- **Conclusions**: While each of the experimental therapies described offers unique benefits and has demonstrated some promise in managing MA, they all…

### Rapid diagnosis of infected ascitic fluid using leukocyte esterase dipstick testing [^116h4W5A]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Ascitic fluid infection is presumptively diagnosed when the fluid polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) concentration equals or exceeds 250 cells/microliter. The leukocyte esterase (LE) test has been shown to be a good predictor of the presence of PMNs and bacteria in urine and other body fluids. This study examines the value of the Multistix 10 SG LE Dipstick test for the rapid diagnosis of infected ascitic fluid.

- **Methods**: One hundred thirty-six ascitic fluid samples were evaluated by PMN count, culture, and LE Dipstick testing. LE dipstick values of "small" or greater were considered positive. For each sample, the LE test result was compared to the corresponding PMN count and culture result.

- **Results**: Ten of the 11 LE-positive samples had a PMN count of 250 cells/microliter or more, while 10 of 12 samples with PMN counts of 250 cells/microliter or more were also LE-positive. Of the 125 LE-negative samples, 123 were also negative by PMN count. Of the 124 samples with PMN counts less than 250 cells/microliter, 123 were negative. The sensitivity and specificity of the LE dipstick for detecting PMN counts of ≥ 250 cells/microliter were 83% and 99%, respectively, with a positive predictive value of 91% and a negative predictive value of 98%.

- **Conclusions**: The Multistix leukocyte esterase test is useful for the prompt detection of an elevated ascitic fluid PMN count and represents a convenient new method for the rapid diagnosis of infected ascitic fluid.

### Effect of paracentesis of ascitic fluids on urinary output and blood indices in patients with severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome [^111T2Cgy]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the isolated effect of abdominal paracentesis of ascitic fluid in women with severe OHSS on urine production and blood indices.

- **Design**: Retrospective interventional study.

- **Setting**: Gynecology department at the Lis Maternity Hospital, affiliated with Tel Aviv University.

- **Patients**: Thirty women with severe OHSS.

- **Interventions**: Abdominal paracentesis according to clinical indications.

- **Main outcome measures**: Urinary output, blood urea nitrogen, and a complete blood count were measured before and following the procedure.

- **Results**: Urinary output increased from 1890 ± 128 mL per 24 hours on the day before paracentesis to 2660 ± 226 mL per 24 hours after the procedure. Blood urea nitrogen values were 8.9 ± 0.56 mg/dL and 7.8 ± 0.53 mg/dL on the days before and after paracentesis, respectively. White blood cell count decreased from 15.4 ± 1.1 (× 10³ cells/mm³) before the paracentesis to 13.3 ± 0.9 (× 10³ cells/mm³) after the procedure. Hematocrit was significantly reduced from 35.2 ± 1.0% before the paracentesis to 33.4 ± 0.8% after paracentesis.

- **Conclusions**: Paracentesis of ascitic fluids in women with severe OHSS has an isolated effect in improving renal function, as is evident by the increased urinary output and reduced blood urea nitrogen.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^116hzk29]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for ascites, specifically in relation to diagnostic paracentesis, the EASL 2018 guidelines recommend obtaining a neutrophil count and culture of ascitic fluid (using bedside inoculation in blood culture bottles with 10 mL fluid each) to exclude bacterial peritonitis. Diagnose spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in the presence of a neutrophil count greater than 250 cells/L.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^1126Jq5n]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

The most common organisms isolated in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) include Escherichia coli, Gram-positive cocci (mainly Streptococcus species), and enterococci. Empirical antibiotic therapy must be initiated immediately after the diagnosis of SBP. In the 1990s, cefotaxime, a third-generation cephalosporin, was extensively investigated in patients with SBP because it was found to cover 95% of organisms and high ascitic fluid concentrations could be achieved.

The take-home message from these studies is that matching an effective antibiotic to the cultured organism is key to successful treatment, rather than any apparent superiority of one drug over another. Since these studies, the landscape of bacterial resistance has significantly changed with an increase in antimicrobial-resistant organisms, and therefore recommending a specific single empirical antibiotic is challenging.

Thus, it is crucial to separate community-acquired SBP from healthcare-associated SBP (nosocomial — defined as infection > 48 hours after hospital admission) and to consider both the severity of infection and the local resistance profile to decide the empirical antibiotic treatment of SBP. Over recent years, there has been a significant increase in infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms, defined by acquired non-susceptibility to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial categories. It is also important to highlight the shift to extensively drug-resistant bacteria, defined by non-susceptibility to at least one agent in all but two or fewer antimicrobial categories.

### Biochemical analysis of ascites fluid as an aid to etiological diagnosis: a series of 100 cases of nonimmune fetal ascites [^115fK4xf]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to analyze the contribution of biochemistry and cytology of fetal ascites fluid to the etiological diagnosis of ascites following ultrasonographic scan, maternal blood sampling, and fetal karyotyping.

- **Method**: This is a retrospective study of 100 consecutive cases of nonimmune fetal ascites in which ascites fluid was sampled. All women underwent referral ultrasound scan and fetal karyotyping. All cases of fetal ascites were studied by biochemistry (total protein, β2-microglobulin, IgM, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, aspartate aminotransferase, aminopeptidase M, and intestinal isoform of alkaline phosphatase) and cytology (lymphocyte count and vacuolated cells).

- **Results**: The etiology of ascites was diagnosed at ultrasound scan in only 50% of cases. We observed significantly (P < 0.001) low levels of total protein in ascites of urinary origin, high levels of digestive enzymes in ascites of digestive origin, and high β2-microglobulin in infectious ascites. Vacuolated cells were observed in all ten storage metabolic diseases.

- **Conclusion**: Sampling of fetal ascites fluid for biochemical and cytological examination provides important additional information. We propose a two-step management: (1) detailed ultrasound scan examination, maternal blood analysis, and fetal karyotyping, and (2) biochemical and cytological analyses. Based on such an approach, 63% and 96% of etiologies would have been identified in our series after the first and second steps, respectively. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

### Management of drainage for malignant ascites in gynaecological cancer [^116Pu2co]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Most patients with advanced ovarian cancer and some patients with advanced endometrial cancer require repeated drainage for malignant ascites. Locally produced guidelines, which are generally not evidence-based but mainly based on clinicians' anecdotal evidence and experience, usually advise those involved in the drainage of ascites. It is crucial to identify management strategies for drains that have been demonstrated to improve the efficacy and quality of the procedure. These recommendations could enhance the quality of life for women during this critical period of their lives.

- **Objectives**: Evaluate the benefits and harms of different practices in the management of drains for malignant ascites in the care of women with advanced gynaecological cancer. The review aimed to evaluate evidence regarding the following questions: How long should the drain stay in place? Should the volume of fluid drained be replaced intravenously? Should the drain be clamped to regulate the drainage of fluid? Should any particular vital observations be regularly recorded?

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 1, 2009, Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Trials Register, MEDLINE 1950 to February Week 3, 2009, and Embase 1980 to 2009 Week 8, 2009. Registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings, reference lists of review articles were also searched, and experts in the field were contacted.

- **Selection criteria**: We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and non-randomised studies.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^1116aGS6]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

Where peritoneal TB is considered plausible, ascites can be sent for acid-fast bacilli smear and culture. Culture positivity occurs in the presence of 1000 IU/L or greater than six times the serum amylase, with mean values exceeding 4000 IU/L in a recent cohort of 80 patients. Raised polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) count may also be found in pancreatic ascites.

- **Recommendations**:
	- A diagnostic paracentesis is recommended in all patients with new-onset ascites (quality of evidence: moderate; recommendation: strong). The initial ascitic fluid analysis should include total protein concentration and calculation of SAAG (quality of evidence: moderate; recommendation: strong). Ascites fluid analysis for cytology, amylase, BNP, and adenosine deaminase should be considered based on pretest probability of specific diagnosis (quality of evidence: moderate).

The ascitic fluid samples required from the diagnostic paracentesis are summarized in Figure 2. These investigations should be considered based on the pretest probability of a specific diagnosis. BNP refers to brain natriuretic peptide.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^1137xgd3]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

The British Society of Gastroenterology, in collaboration with the British Association for the Study of the Liver, has prepared this document. The aim of this guideline is to review and summarize the evidence that guides the clinical diagnosis and management of ascites in patients with cirrhosis. Substantial advances have been made in this area since the publication of the last guideline in 2007.

These guidelines are based on a comprehensive literature search and include systematic reviews in key areas such as diagnostic tests, diuretic use, therapeutic paracentesis, use of albumin, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and beta-blockers in patients with ascites. Where recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses are available, these have been updated with additional studies.

In addition, the results of prospective and retrospective studies, evidence obtained from expert committee reports, and, in some instances, reports from case series have been included. Where possible, a judgment has been made on the quality of information used to generate the guidelines, and specific recommendations have been made according to the 'Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)' system.

These guidelines are intended to inform practicing clinicians, and it is expected that they will be revised in three years' time.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for ascites, particularly in the management of refractory ascites, AASLD 2021 guidelines recommend the administration of albumin infusion at the time of large-volume paracentesis of more than 5 liters to mitigate the risk of precipitate post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction. It is important to recognize that the risk of precipitate post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction may increase with more than 8 liters of fluid evacuated in a single session.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^114Kcsj1]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

The development of ascites is a landmark in the natural history of cirrhosis and should be considered an important time point at which an individual patient's suitability for liver transplantation, which is a definitive treatment of ascites and its complications, should be determined. Over the years, there has been a substantial improvement in the care of patients with cirrhosis, including those with ascites. A study involving over 780,000 hospitalizations of patients with cirrhosis demonstrated an improvement in inpatient survival over a decade despite higher age and more medically complex disease. This was remarkably consistent across several cirrhosis complications, suggesting improved cirrhosis care beyond general improvements in inpatient care. Future research should focus on areas of need and questions where there is no high-quality evidence to guide the management of ascites.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^114ehLt6]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

Contemporary data from an NHS hospital serving a population of 700,000 found 164 adults with a new diagnosis of ascites over a period of five years. Of these, 55% had cirrhosis, with alcohol-related liver disease in 58, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in 21, chronic viral hepatitis in 4, autoimmune liver diseases in 3, and cryptogenic cirrhosis in 4. Additionally, 29% had malignancies, with gynaecological in 12, gastrointestinal in 25, and others in 11. Six percent had cardiac failure (CF), 3% had end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and 7% had other aetiologies.

The development of ascites is a significant milestone in the natural history of cirrhosis. Approximately 20% of patients with cirrhosis have ascites at their first presentation, and 20% of those presenting with ascites die in the first year of the diagnosis. The aim of this guideline is to review and summarise the evidence that guides the clinical diagnosis and management of ascites in patients with cirrhosis.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^116DesEd]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

The terms used in this article have been defined by the International Ascites Club.

- **Uncomplicated ascites**: Ascites that is not infected and which is not associated with the development of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Ascites can be graded as mild when ascites is detectable only by ultrasound examination, moderate when it causes moderate symmetrical distension of the abdomen, and large when it causes marked abdominal distension.

- **Refractory ascites**: Ascites that cannot be mobilized, or the early recurrence of which (i.e. after therapeutic paracentesis) cannot be satisfactorily prevented by medical treatment. This category includes two different subgroups:
	- **Diuretic-resistant ascites**: Ascites that is refractory to dietary sodium restriction and intensive diuretic treatment.
	- **Diuretic-intractable ascites**: Ascites that is refractory to treatment due to the development of diuretic-induced complications that preclude the use of an effective diuretic dosage.

- **Evaluation of patients with ascites**: Clinical evaluation should include a history of exposure to risk factors for cirrhosis and a physical examination to look for evidence supporting chronic liver disease or an alternative diagnosis. Shifting dullness is detectable when approximately one and a half liters of free fluid accumulate in the abdomen; this physical sign has 83% sensitivity and 56% specificity in detecting ascites. However, in the presence of obesity or a smaller amount of fluid, imaging such as ultrasound or CT is necessary to confirm the presence of ascites.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^111vWbop]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

The diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is confirmed when the ascitic neutrophil count is greater than 250 cells/mm³ in the absence of an intra-abdominal and surgically treatable source of sepsis. A cut-off point of 250 neutrophils/mm³ offers the greatest sensitivity, although a cut-off point of 500 neutrophils/mm³ provides greater specificity. A meta-analysis of primary data from 14 prospective trials has defined the positive and negative likelihood ratios of SBP at different thresholds for total white cell count (WCC) and polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) in ascitic fluid. A WCC greater than 1000 cells/µL or PMN greater than or equal to 500 cells/µL are most accurate, yielding positive likelihood ratios of 9.1 (95% CI 5.5 to 15.1) and 10.6 (95% CI 6.1 to 18.3), respectively. Likelihood ratios for WCC greater than 500 cells/µL (5.9; 95% CI 2.3 to 15.5) and PMN greater than 250 cells/µL (6.4; 95% CI 4.6 to 8.8) support routine clinical practice of using lower thresholds, where the greater risk lies with underdiagnosing SBP.

Historically, ascitic neutrophil counts have been performed by manual microscopy, but this method is time and cost intensive. Automated counts, based on flow cytometry for counting and differentiating cells, are now used in most centers. This technique has been shown to have sensitivity and specificity close to 100%, allowing a tube containing ethylenediamine tetra-acetate (EDTA), as used for plasma full blood counts, to be inoculated with ascitic fluid and processed on a standard blood count analyzer. Reagent strips have insufficient sensitivity for reliable use in this context and hence cannot be recommended to replace cell counts for diagnosing SBP.
