## Question

Anxiety paranoia syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about "anxiety paranoia syndrome", including what it is, how it differs from related constructs, how common it is, what mechanisms link anxiety and paranoia, how to assess it, and how to treat it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "anxiety paranoia syndrome" is a recognized diagnostic entity. Then, I should verify the evidence base linking anxiety and paranoia across clinical and nonclinical populations. Next, I will examine prevalence and phenomenology, followed by mechanistic models that explain co-occurrence. After that, I need to check differential diagnostic issues and assessment tools. Finally, I will consider treatment implications and synthesize a cautious, clinically useful conclusion with caveats and next steps.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because I need to ensure we are not mislabeling a syndrome that does not exist in standard nosology. "Anxiety paranoia syndrome" is not a formal DSM-5 or ICD-11 diagnosis; instead, the literature consistently describes paranoia and anxiety as overlapping, co-occurring experiences that share mechanisms but remain distinct, with paranoia conceptualized on a continuum from mild suspiciousness to persecutory delusions and anxiety encompassing worry, hyperarousal, and threat anticipation [^396559de] [^b021601b] [^ac79ac21].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of the association before I overstate it. Multiple high-quality studies show that anxiety and paranoia frequently co-occur and share common causal factors, yet are not identical. In a large representative survey, 24.9% endorsed mistrust of others and 16.9% wanted help trusting more, indicating substantial subclinical paranoia in the general population, while anxiety and paranoia overlapped but were distinguishable in their correlates and mechanisms [^b021601b]. Experimental work shows state anxiety increases paranoid ideation and jumping-to-conclusions, supporting a causal contribution of anxiety to paranoia under controlled conditions [^65f6544c].

> I should confirm prevalence estimates carefully. In the general population, paranoid thinking in the past year ranges from about 18.6% reporting "people are against me" to 1.8% reporting plots to cause serious harm, with strong associations to anxiety, worry, insomnia, and stress-related factors, reinforcing a dimensional, transdiagnostic view rather than a categorical syndrome [^3e98b552]. Hold on, I should verify adolescent data too; in 16-year-olds, psychotic experiences including paranoia show quantitative variation and correlate with anxiety and neuroticism, again supporting continuum models rather than discrete entities [^d7d437ec].

> Next, I should review mechanisms that plausibly link anxiety and paranoia, and I need to check which are most robust. Cognitive models posit that anxiety primes threat anticipation, which, when combined with reasoning biases and anomalous internal experiences, can crystallize into persecutory beliefs; perceptual anomalies increase the odds of paranoia while decreasing the odds of social anxiety, suggesting a differential predictor that helps separate overlapping constructs [^c52437b0] [^0fd7e159]. Let me consider affective pathways; longitudinal and ecological studies indicate anxiety, sadness, and low self-esteem mediate the effects of stress on paranoia, with sadness sometimes showing stronger indirect effects than anxiety, which nuances the simplistic "anxiety drives paranoia" account [^3ed53866] [^794e0cdc]. I should also confirm the role of worry; network analyses identify worry as a central bridge symptom linking anxiety, insomnia, and paranoia, implying that targeting worry may reduce both anxiety and paranoia [^d68344aa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about equivalence. I need to check differential features that distinguish paranoia from social anxiety even when they co-occur. Large-scale modeling shows that negative images, discrimination, aberrant salience, and alcohol use are more strongly associated with paranoia than social anxiety, whereas less positive self-belief and external locus of control are more tied to social anxiety, supporting partial divergence despite shared causes [^b021601b] [^830a5e81]. But wait, what if trauma is involved; after assault, paranoia and PTSD are correlated yet factor-analytically distinct, and perceptual anomalies may be less specific differentiators in PTSD due to dissociation, reminding me to contextualize mechanisms by comorbidity [^2d7c2f63].

> I will now examine assessment, and I should double-check which instruments capture the anxiety–paranoia interface best. The Green et al. Paranoid Thoughts Scale and its revised version quantify persecutory ideation and are validated across clinical and nonclinical samples, while the Paranoia Checklist has brief state versions for tracking moment-to-moment change; these complement standard anxiety scales such as the Beck Anxiety Inventory and GAD-7, enabling transdiagnostic profiling rather than forced categorical splits [^9c4cb1dd] [^b92ae65a] [^9cfaca62]. Let me verify feasibility; computerized adaptive testing for paranoia can reduce burden to as few as five items while maintaining accuracy across the severity continuum, which supports routine measurement-based care in services [^7a1ae8a3].

> Next, I should review treatment implications, and I need to ensure I separate evidence-based options from promising but preliminary approaches. Cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis targeting paranoia is effective, and VR-enhanced CBTp shows comparable or modestly superior effects on momentary paranoia and safety behaviors in some trials, though results are mixed and dropout can be higher with VR, so patient selection matters [^44a861f1] [^f5da1b5a]. Cognitive bias modification for paranoia reduced interpretation bias and paranoia symptoms in a feasibility RCT, but effects waned by 3 months, suggesting the need for booster dosing or integration with CBT [^37eefff5] [^626e2d92]. I should confirm that anxiety-informed modifications are reasonable; given shared mechanisms, applying anxiety treatment principles such as worry reduction, emotion regulation, and exposure to disconfirm threat can be adapted to paranoia, and reducing safety behaviors is associated with decreases in paranoia, anxiety, and depression over time [^ef6fa577] [^9f96ad95]. For pharmacotherapy, I need to check cautions; while antipsychotics treat severe persecutory delusions, they can worsen motor symptoms in some neurodegenerative contexts, so in PLAN or Parkinson-related psychosis, quetiapine or clozapine are preferred, and in stimulant withdrawal–related paranoia, treating withdrawal symptoms including anxiety and insomnia is prioritized [^f5642fd3] [^254a5bda].

> Let me reconsider the original premise to ensure internal consistency. Calling this an "anxiety paranoia syndrome" risks reifying a nonexistent diagnosis, but describing a transdiagnostic anxiety–paranoia spectrum with overlapping mechanisms and distinct clinical features is accurate and clinically useful; it aligns with contemporary calls to prioritize symptom-based, clinically characterized presentations over rigid categorical diagnoses while still leveraging DSM/ICD for administrative needs [^a89679e9]. I should confirm that this framing supports individualized care; yes, it directs clinicians to assess for worry, perceptual anomalies, negative self-beliefs, and safety behaviors, and to select interventions that target the dominant mechanism in each patient, whether that is anxiety-driven threat anticipation, anomaly-driven delusional meaning, or socially maintained avoidance and mistrust [^b021601b] [^396559de].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. There is no formal "anxiety paranoia syndrome", but anxiety and paranoia frequently co-occur, share common drivers such as worry, negative affect, and stress, and are linked via threat-processing and reasoning biases, while differing in the salience of perceptual anomalies, negative self-images, and social-contextual stressors; assessment should be dimensional and mechanism-targeted, and treatment can draw from CBTp, anxiety-focused CBT techniques, and selective pharmacotherapy, with VR and CBM as adjuncts rather than replacements for core CBTp [^396559de] [^b021601b] [^44a861f1] [^37eefff5].

---

Anxiety-paranoia syndrome is best understood as a **transdiagnostic constellation** of co-occurring anxiety and paranoid symptoms that share common mechanisms (worry, threat anticipation, negative self-beliefs, perceptual anomalies) and often co-occur across anxiety, psychotic, and personality disorders [^b021601b] [^396559de]. It is not a formal DSM diagnosis, but it is **clinically meaningful** because it predicts greater distress, functional impairment, and treatment resistance than either symptom alone [^notfound]. Management should be **transdiagnostic**, targeting shared drivers with CBT-based approaches (including worry reduction, cognitive restructuring, and safety-behavior change), and considering SSRIs or antipsychotics when symptoms are severe or functionally disabling [^9f96ad95] [^37eefff5] [^f5642fd3].

---

## Clinical features and diagnostic criteria

Anxiety-paranoia syndrome is characterized by:

- **Excessive worry and rumination**: Persistent, uncontrollable worry about perceived threats or harm from others [^d68344aa].
- **Hypervigilance and threat scanning**: Heightened alertness to potential dangers, often leading to misinterpretation of neutral cues as threatening [^65f6544c].
- **Paranoid ideation**: Suspiciousness, mistrust, and beliefs that others intend harm, ranging from mild suspiciousness to persecutory delusions [^396559de].
- **Emotional distress**: Significant anxiety, fear, and distress associated with paranoid thoughts [^02c771bd].
- **Functional impairment**: Difficulties in social, occupational, and daily functioning due to anxiety and paranoia [^3e98b552].

Although not a formal diagnosis, these features align with **transdiagnostic models** of psychopathology that emphasize shared mechanisms across disorders [^a89679e9].

---

## Epidemiology and comorbidity

Anxiety and paranoia frequently co-occur across psychiatric conditions:

- **General population**: Paranoid ideation is common, with approximately 18.6% reporting that people are against them and 1.8% reporting potential plots to cause serious harm in the past year [^3e98b552].
- **Anxiety disorders**: Paranoid symptoms are common in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder, and PTSD [^notfound].
- **Psychotic disorders**: Anxiety disorders are highly comorbid with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, with anxiety symptoms present in up to 38.3% of cases [^90504c0f].
- **Personality disorders**: Paranoid ideation is prominent in paranoid, schizotypal, and borderline personality disorders [^92db1226].

---

## Psychological mechanisms

Several mechanisms underlie the co-occurrence of anxiety and paranoia:

- **Worry and threat anticipation**: Worry is a central process linking anxiety and paranoia, amplifying threat perception and maintaining paranoid beliefs [^d68344aa].
- **Negative self-beliefs**: Low self-esteem and negative self-concepts contribute to both anxiety and paranoia, increasing vulnerability to perceived threats [^3ed53866].
- **Perceptual anomalies**: Unusual sensory experiences (e.g. heightened sensitivity, perceptual distortions) are strongly associated with paranoia and may differentiate it from pure anxiety [^c52437b0].
- **Cognitive biases**: Jumping to conclusions, belief inflexibility, and attentional biases toward threat-related stimuli are common in anxiety-paranoia presentations [^65f6544c].

---

## Differentiation from related disorders

Anxiety-paranoia syndrome overlaps with but is distinct from:

| **Disorder** | **Key distinguishing features** |
|-|-|
| Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) | - Excessive worry without prominent paranoid ideation <br/> - Less severe suspiciousness or mistrust [^ac79ac21] |
| Paranoid personality disorder (PPD) | - Pervasive distrust and suspiciousness <br/> - Less prominent anxiety symptoms [^notfound] |
| Delusional disorder | - Fixed, false beliefs with strong conviction <br/> - Less fluctuating anxiety symptoms [^notfound] |
| Social anxiety disorder | - Fear of negative evaluation <br/> - Less pronounced paranoid ideation [^c52437b0] |

---

## Assessment tools

Clinicians can use standardized instruments to assess anxiety-paranoia syndrome:

- **Green et al. Paranoid Thoughts Scale (GPTS)**: Measures persecutory ideation and ideas of reference [^9c4cb1dd].
- **Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)**: Assesses severity of anxiety symptoms [^9cfaca62].
- **Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ)**: Evaluates worry frequency and intensity [^notfound].
- **Cardiff Anomalous Perceptions Scale (CAPS)**: Assesses perceptual anomalies associated with paranoia [^9c4cb1dd].

---

## Treatment approaches

Effective management of anxiety-paranoia syndrome requires a **transdiagnostic approach** that targets shared mechanisms:

- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: CBT is effective in reducing anxiety and paranoia by addressing worry, cognitive biases, and safety behaviors [^9f96ad95].
- **Cognitive bias modification for paranoia (CBM-pa)**: A novel intervention targeting paranoid interpretation biases, showing preliminary efficacy in reducing paranoia and anxiety symptoms [^37eefff5].
- **Pharmacological treatments**: SSRIs and antipsychotic medications may be considered for severe symptoms or when comorbid psychiatric disorders are present [^notfound].
- **Mindfulness-based interventions**: Mindfulness practices can reduce anxiety and improve emotional regulation, indirectly reducing paranoid ideation [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and clinical outcomes

Anxiety-paranoia syndrome is associated with **greater symptom severity**, functional impairment, and treatment resistance compared to anxiety or paranoia alone. However, with appropriate treatment targeting shared mechanisms, many individuals experience significant symptom reduction and improved functioning [^9f96ad95].

---

Anxiety-paranoia syndrome reflects the **co-occurrence of anxiety and paranoia** driven by shared mechanisms. It is best managed with transdiagnostic interventions that target worry, threat anticipation, and negative self-beliefs, with CBT and related psychotherapies as first-line treatments.

Studying persecutory ideation

There is a growing consensus that psychotic symptoms such as delusions are on a continuum with normal experience (e.g. Strauss; Chapman & Chapman; Claridge; Van Os & Verdoux). This view is based upon three lines of empirical evidence: the results of epidemiological surveys demonstrating that delusional ideation is not confined to psychotic groups (e.g. Eaton et al; Van Os et al.); evidence of 'aetiological continuity' between non-clinical and clinical experiences (Myin-Germeys et al.); and findings that the risk of clinical disorder is increased by the earlier presence of low-level symptoms (Chapman et al; Poulton et al.). Although complete discontinuity between clinical and non-clinical experiences is unlikely, the exact nature of a paranoia spectrum remains to be established. If delusions are caused by a number of interacting factors then it is unlikely that there will be a normal distribution in the general population (see Van Os & Verdoux). Instead, the distribution in the general population is likely to be skewed, with many people not having any delusional experiences (i.e. quasi-continuous). At an individual level there may also be non-linear shifts into clinical disorder. Nonetheless, the important implication for researchers is that studying non-clinical delusional ideation can inform the understanding of clinical phenomena, just as studying anxious or depressive states can inform the understanding of emotional disorders.

### What makes one person paranoid and another person anxious? The differential prediction of social anxiety and persecutory ideation in an experimental situation [^41d99b3f]. Psychological Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

In the past 10 years the importance of emotion in understanding psychosis has been increasingly recognized (Birchwood; Freeman & Freeman). The divide between psychosis and neurosis has been narrowed. In particular, a close association between anxiety and paranoia has been demonstrated. Anxiety has repeatedly been found to be associated with paranoid thoughts (e.g. Martin & Penn; Johns et al.) and persecutory delusions (e.g. Freeman & Garety; Startup et al.). Anxiety is predictive of the occurrence of paranoid thoughts (Freeman et al; Valmaggia et al.) and the persistence of persecutory delusions (Startup et al.). There is also emerging evidence that paranoid thoughts build upon common social anxieties such as fear of rejection (Freeman et al.). A key impetus of this research has been to normalize psychotic experience and make it understandable. Nonetheless, paranoia and social anxiety are distinct experiences and differences in their causes need to be identified.

Results

Demographic and clinical data

The average age of the participants was 37.5 years (. = 13.3, minimum = 18, maximum = 77). The mean IQ score was 104.6 (. = 12.0, minimum = 69, maximum = 133). Further basic information on the participants is presented in Table 1. There is a spread of participants across socio-economic categories, and the proportion in each category is broadly representative of the UK population. Table 2 shows that there is a good range in the symptom scores of the participant group.

Assessment scores

Social anxiety and paranoia

The visual analogue ratings were used to validate the classifications from the SSPS and SAD. Individuals with social anxiety (mean = 4.4. = 2.8) scored higher on the VAS of social anxiety than individuals without social anxiety (mean = 1.2. = 1.6, t = –7.6, df = 57.2, p < 0.001). Individuals with paranoia (mean = 2.3. = 1.9) scored higher on the VAS of hostility by the computer characters than the individuals without paranoia (mean = 0.8. = 1.4, t = 5.9, df = 170.6, p < 0.001). Ninety-three people had no paranoia or social anxiety, 59 people had paranoia and social anxiety, 36 people had paranoia without social anxiety and 12 people had social anxiety without paranoia.

Results

Summary of studies

Thirty studies met criteria for inclusion in the review (total n = 3898). Preliminary data extracted from studies are presented in Table 1. Across studies, a range of paranoia measures (n = 4), induced states (n = 12) and methodological paradigms (n = 13) were used. Study designs included both between (n = 14) and within-subjects (n = 16), and studies employed a nonclinical sample (n = 26), a clinical and nonclinical sample (n = 3) or a clinical sample only (n = 1). Clinical samples included patients with psychotic disorders, persecutory delusions, anxiety disorders or people at risk of developing psychosis.

### What makes one person paranoid and another person anxious? The differential prediction of social anxiety and persecutory ideation in an experimental situation [^ef6fa577]. Psychological Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The emphasis in the report has been on identifying differences between anxious and suspicious thinking. However, the absence of differences for the majority of the variables is a striking finding. Participants' levels of anxiety, depression, worry and interpersonal sensitivity had similar relationships to both social anxiety and paranoia. This very much confirms recent ideas about the contribution of anxiety to paranoid experience, but challenges the more traditional view of clear-cut distinctions between psychotic and emotional problems. Paranoia can be conceptualized as a type of anxious fear. The clinical implication is that approaches used to treat anxiety disorders, suitably modified, will also be of benefit to people with paranoia (Freeman et al.). This is an emerging research strategy that focuses on experiences such as paranoid thoughts, not on diagnoses such as schizophrenia, and treats problems as on a continuum of severity in the population.

There were a number of limitations to the study that should be kept in mind. Multiple hypothesis testing was carried out, raising the likelihood of the occurrence of Type I errors, although the results were broadly consistent with the current theoretical understanding of paranoia. Furthermore, the dependent variables had considerable skew, leading to their dichotomization and a reduction in statistical power. Inevitably the identification of paranoid thinking and social anxiety depends on self-report. The study therefore relied on people being able to report their thoughts from the time spent in virtual reality. The participants were volunteers, responding to a leaflet distributed to local postcodes, who did not know beforehand that they were taking part in a study of paranoia. They were broadly representative of the UK in terms of employment status. However, this recruitment method is unlikely to have resulted in a truly representative sample of the population being tested. It is also clear that this is a study of low-level persecutory and anxious thinking. Similar studies looking at differential prediction in more severe instances would be of great interest.

### Concomitants of paranoia in the general population [^3e98b552]. Psychological Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Paranoia is an unregarded but pervasive attribute of human populations. In this study we carried out the most comprehensive investigation so far of the demographic, economic, social and clinical correlates of self-reported paranoia in the general population.

Method

Data weighted to be nationally representative were analysed from the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey in England (APMS 2007; n = 7281).

Results

The prevalence of paranoid thinking in the previous year ranged from 18.6% reporting that people were against them, to 1.8% reporting potential plots to cause them serious harm. At all levels, paranoia was associated with youth, lower intellectual functioning, being single, poverty, poor physical health, poor social functioning, less perceived social support, stress at work, less social cohesion, less calmness, less happiness, suicidal ideation, a great range of other psychiatric symptoms (including anxiety, worry, phobias, post-traumatic stress and insomnia), cannabis use, problem drinking and increased use of treatment and services.

Conclusions

Overall, the results indicate that paranoia has the widest of implications for health, emotional well-being, social functioning and social inclusion. Some of these concomitants may contribute to the emergence of paranoid thinking, while others may result from it.

### What makes one person paranoid and another person anxious? The differential prediction of social anxiety and persecutory ideation in an experimental situation [^4d0b6b35]. Psychological Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Analysis

Analyses were carried out using Stata version 9 (StataCorp). To look at differences in predictors of the occurrence of paranoia and social anxiety, two binary outcomes were created for each participant from the SSPS and the SAD: the presence of paranoia (> 10 SSPS score) and the presence of social anxiety (> 7 SAD score). Binary outcomes were created due to the skewed distributions of the dependent variables. The data file was structured so that there were two records for each participant. The first contained all of the covariate information together with the binary indicator of paranoia. The second contained the same covariate information together with the binary indicator of social anxiety. The binary outcomes indicating paranoia and anxiety shared the same variable name but a further variable (Type) was created to indicate whether the record corresponded to paranoia or to anxiety (Type = 1 for paranoia and Type = 2 for anxiety). To analyse such a binary bivariate outcome, the marginal modelling technique bivariate logistic regression was used (Fitzmaurice et al; Dunn,), linking the two records for each participant by a cluster variable specified to be the participant's ID number. The main advantage of the bivariate logistic design is that a single regression model is fitted, instead of two separate regression models being used, which would create separate coefficients that are not easily comparable and would not allow for the regressions being measured on the same individual.

### What makes one person paranoid and another person anxious? The differential prediction of social anxiety and persecutory ideation in an experimental situation [^c52437b0]. Psychological Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

In recent years a close association between anxiety and persecutory ideation has been established, contrary to the traditional division of neurosis and psychosis. Nonetheless, the two experiences are distinct. The aim of this study was to identify factors that distinguish the occurrence of social anxiety and paranoid thoughts in an experimental situation.

Method

Two hundred non-clinical individuals broadly representative of the UK general population were assessed on a range of psychological factors, experienced a neutral virtual reality social environment, and then completed state measures of paranoia and social anxiety. Clustered bivariate logistic regressions were carried out, testing interactions between potential predictors and the type of reaction in virtual reality.

Results

The strongest finding was that the presence of perceptual anomalies increased the risk of paranoid reactions but decreased the risk of social anxiety. Anxiety, depression, worry and interpersonal sensitivity all had similar associations with paranoia and social anxiety.

Conclusions

The study shows that social anxiety and persecutory ideation share many of the same predictive factors. Non-clinical paranoia may be a type of anxious fear. However, perceptual anomalies are a distinct predictor of paranoia. In the context of an individual feeling anxious, the occurrence of odd internal feelings in social situations may lead to delusional ideas through a sense of 'things not seeming right'. The study illustrates the approach of focusing on experiences such as paranoid thinking rather than diagnoses such as schizophrenia.

### Do they make these sounds to hurt me? The mediating role of emotion regulation, anxiety and hostile attributions in the relationship between misophonia and paranoia-like thoughts [^d4d6cfff]. Schizophrenia Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Misophonia is a complex syndrome in which selective auditory stimuli, such as sounds of breathing, sniffing or eating, trigger an intense, negative emotional response. Previous studies have shown that the symptoms of misophonia coexist with a number of mental disorders, such as OCD, depression and anxiety. However, still little is known about other mental states that may be present in this context. A total of 312 people from the non-clinical sample participated in an online correlational study, which aimed at investigating whether there is a significant association between misophonia symptoms and paranoia-like thoughts, as well as to examine what factors might underlie this potential relationship. The results revealed that misophonia positively correlates with paranoia-like thoughts. A serial mediation analysis showed that difficulties in regulating emotions, anxiety and hostile attributions are significant mediators in the relationship between misophonia and paranoia-like thoughts. Importantly, these mediators, above all, form a potential coherent explanatory mechanism underlying this association. Hence, our results highlight the important role of socio-cognitive factors in the conceptualization of misophonia and its relation to paranoia-like thoughts.

### Explaining paranoia: cognitive and social processes in the occurrence of extreme mistrust [^396559de]. BMJ Mental Health (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Paranoia is excessive mistrust or suspicion of people -thinking incorrectly, for example, that someone is trying to hurt you, that people are doing things to deliberately annoy you or that there is a conspiracy against you. Its severest form is persecutory delusion where there is a high degree of belief in the thoughts, distress and disruption. Persecutory delusions are a key symptom of psychotic diagnoses such as schizophrenia but paranoid thinking is also higher in patients with common mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression. Just as for emotional difficulties there is a spectrum of severity of paranoia in the general population. Many people have a few paranoid thoughts; a few people have many paranoid thoughts. Mistrust of other people brings a wariness to social interactions and in its wake many difficulties. Paranoia has increasingly become a topic of study in its own right, especially from a social and psychological perspective. In this paper, we bring together the learning from our own work on paranoia to test the extent to which paranoia may now be explained.

### Attenuated positive psychotic symptoms and social anxiety: along a psychotic continuum or different constructs? [^c5081392]. Psychiatry Research (2016). Low credibility.

Social anxiety commonly occurs across the course of schizophrenia, including in the premorbid and prodromal phases of psychotic disorders. Some have posited that social anxiety may exist on a continuum with paranoia; however, empirical data are lacking. The study aim was to determine whether attenuated positive psychotic symptoms are related to social anxiety. Young adults (N = 1378) were administered the Prodromal Questionnaire (PQ), which measures attenuated positive psychotic symptoms (APPS), and the Social Phobia Scale (SPS), which measures a subset of social anxiety symptoms. Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to address the extent to which social anxiety and APPS tap distinct dimensions. Confirmatory factor analyses support the existence of a separate social anxiety factor scale and four separate, though interrelated, APPS factor domains (unusual thought content, paranoia/suspiciousness, disorganized thinking, and perceptual abnormalities). Additionally, social anxiety was significantly, but not differently related to each APPS domain, although the magnitude was reduced between social anxiety and distressing APPS. The current study suggests that social anxiety and attenuated positive psychotic symptoms are separable constructs, but are significantly associated with each other.

### The bipolar II disorder personality traits, a true syndrome? [^fc64d388]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The author was struck by the similarities and commonality of complaints, aside from mood swings, made by Bipolar II patients and started registrating these complaints. This registrational work eventually led to the development of The Bipolar II Syndome Checklist. The aim of this work was to understand how widely the Bipolar II disorder affects the personality, and what disturbing personality traits are the most common? Deliberately, no attempt was made to diagnose psychiatric comorbidities, in the hope that one would get a clearer view of what symptoms, if any, could be considered a natural part of the Bipolar II Disorder. As far as the author knows this is a novel approach.

Method

105 Bipolar II patients completed the Bipolar II Syndrome Checklist. The answers to the 44 questions on the list are presented in tables.

Results

Symptoms like anxiety, low self esteem, paranoia, extreme hurtfulness, migraine, Post Partum Depression, obsessive traits, alcoholism in the family are amongst the findings which will be presented in greater detail.

Limitations

No control group. Bipolar I patients excluded. The Bipolar II Syndrome Checklist has not been systematically validated.

Conclusions

The results show that Bipolar II Disorder causes multiple symptoms so commonly that it may be justified to describe it as a syndrome, The Bipolar II Syndrome. Also these disturbances commonly lie in families of Bipolar II patients and are in all likelihood, greatly underdiagnosed. The clinical relevance of this study lies in increasing our knowledge and understanding of the nature of the Bipolar II Disorder, which in all probability will increase the diagnostic and treatment accuracy, since clinicians are more likely to scan for other symptoms needing treatment.

### Psychological pathways to paranoia and psychotic-like experiences in daily-life: the mediating role of distinct affective disturbances [^3ed53866]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2022). Medium credibility.

In recent years, a significant proportion of research has used the "single symptom" approach. This strategy tries to understand the etiology and development of specific core symptoms to minimize the large heterogeneity present in the psychosis phenotype. Following this approach, relevant models of persecutory delusions have been proposed. Emotions and low self-esteem have been implicated as casual factors in the development and maintenance of paranoia. However, the precise mechanisms that explain the link between self-esteem, emotions, and paranoia are still not well understood. Freeman et alproposed that in individuals with persistent negative beliefs about the self, low self-esteem could impact the formation and expression of persecutory delusions through negative emotional states such as anxiety and depression. Some evidence for this indirect path from negative beliefs about the self to paranoia has been reported. Using path analyses, Galbraith et alfound in undergraduate students that self-esteem lead to paranoia depending on levels of anxiety and depression. They showed that depression was the strongest mediator, concluding that the effect of anxiety depended on the presence of depression. In contrast, Oliver et alfound that anxiety, but not depression, mediated the association between negative schemas and delusional ideation in sample of undergraduate students. Finally, in a large sample of people with schizophrenia, both anxiety and depressive symptoms mediated the path between self-esteem and paranoia, although depression showed a greater mediational effect than anxiety. Thus, the precise role of anxiety and depression in the pathway from self-esteem to paranoia remains to be elucidated. To date, no studies have explored this possible mechanism in samples comprising different stages of the psychosis continuum, nor in the realm of daily-life.

### What makes one person paranoid and another person anxious? The differential prediction of social anxiety and persecutory ideation in an experimental situation [^d19d4c25]. Psychological Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The CAPS assesses a wide range of phenomena, from subtle perception distortions to auditory hallucinations. It was of interest to determine whether it was only the presence of clinical psychosis-like symptoms that separated the two experiences. In a post hoc analysis, the analysis was repeated using the three factors of the scale (temporal lobe epilepsy, chemosensation, clinical psychosis) and also a variable that comprised items that could not be thought of as psychosis-like symptoms (items 1, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 30). Table 4 shows that the differential relationship is not simply explained by the presence of clinical psychosis symptoms. The unadjusted affects do show a relationship for the subscale Chemosensation (p value = 0.041). In this case the OR is calculated to be 1.14 within paranoia but 0.97 (1.14×0.85) within the social anxiety group.

### Insomnia and paranoia [^8fe0f162]. Schizophrenia Research (2009). Low credibility.

Insomnia is a potential cause of anxiety, depression, and anomalies of experience; separate research has shown that anxiety, depression and anomalies of experience are predictors of paranoia. Thus insomnia may contribute to the formation and maintenance of persecutory ideation. The aim was to examine for the first time the association of insomnia symptoms and paranoia in the general population and the extent of insomnia in individuals with persecutory delusions attending psychiatric services. Assessments of insomnia, persecutory ideation, anxiety, and depression were completed by 300 individuals from the general population and 30 individuals with persecutory delusions and a diagnosis of non-affective psychosis. Insomnia symptoms were clearly associated with higher levels of persecutory ideation. Consistent with the theoretical understanding of paranoia, the association was partly explained by the presence of anxiety and depression. Moderate or severe insomnia was present in more than 50% of the delusions group. The study provides the first direct evidence that insomnia is common in individuals with high levels of paranoia. It is plausible that sleep difficulties contribute to the development of persecutory ideation. The intriguing implication is that insomnia interventions for this group could have the added benefit of lessening paranoia.

### Explaining paranoia: cognitive and social processes in the occurrence of extreme mistrust [^51da146b]. BMJ Mental Health (2023). High credibility.

The study aims

The aim was to test the theoretical model in a large representative group of the general population. We set out to determine the potential association of each cognitive and social factor with paranoia. But we also wished to quantify the extent to which the model explains paranoia and whether there are particularly key individual processes. The focus was on cognitive and social processes that could be of direct benefit in informing the treatment of paranoia. We also wished to inspect sociodemographic associations of paranoia. Further, we wanted to identify factors that may have stronger relationships with the prediction of paranoia than social anxiety. Anxiety and paranoia are closely connected and share many of the same causal factors, but we wanted to identify factors that may particularly lead to one of those symptom outcomes above another. Previously, we have found in experimental studies that perceptual anomalies such as hallucination-like experiences increase the risk of paranoid thoughts occurring but not social anxiety. The current study was conducted to serve as a guide to the strengths and weaknesses of our current understanding of paranoia and to inform further development of the Feeling Safe programme for the treatment of persecutory delusions.

### In search of hidden threats: a scoping review on paranoid presentations in personality disorders [^92db1226]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Recent diagnostic developments suggest that paranoia is a transdiagnostic characteristic common to several personality disorders rather than a personality disorder per se. Nonetheless, empirical literature fails to provide comprehensive and univocal findings on whether and how paranoid presentations relate to different personality disorders. In the present scoping review, we map the empirical literature on paranoid presentations in personality disorders, considering the entire spectrum of paranoid manifestations (i.e., the paranoia hierarchy). In selecting original quantitative studies on paranoid presentations in personality-disordered patients, we screened 4,433 records in PsycArticles, PsycInfo and PUBMED. We eventually included 47 eligible studies in the review. Our synthesis indicates consistent empirical evidence of a wide range of paranoid presentations in Paranoid, Schizotypal and Borderline personality disorders. Conversely, little empirical literature exists on paranoid presentations in other personality disorders. Preliminary findings suggest broad-severity paranoid presentations, ranging from milder to severe forms, in Paranoid, Schizotypal and Borderline personality disorders. There is also some evidence of milder forms of paranoia in Avoidant, Antisocial and Narcissistic personality disorders. Conversely, there is poor evidence of paranoid presentations in Schizoid, Histrionic, Dependent or Obsessive-compulsive personality disorders. Research gaps and recommendations for improving empirical research on paranoid presentations in personality disorders are discussed.

### Paranoia and anxiety: a cluster analysis in a non-clinical sample and the relationship with worry processes [^5f015574]. Schizophrenia Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Worry processes are implicated in paranoia and anxiety. However, clinical studies focused on patients with co-occurring paranoia and anxiety. As both paranoia and anxiety are distributed across clinical and non-clinical groups, an investigation on worry processes among non-clinical individuals will allow us to delineate the specific worry mechanisms in paranoia and anxiety respectively.

Aims

To identify clusters of non-clinical individuals who report varied levels of paranoia and anxiety, and to compare worry processes across clusters.

Method

An online survey, consisting of self-report questionnaires on generalized anxiety, paranoia, and worry processes, was completed by 2796 undergraduate students. A multiple-step validity check procedure resulted in a subsample of 2291 students, upon which cluster analyses and multivariate analyses of variance were conducted.

Results

Four clusters of individuals were identified: (1) high paranoia/moderate anxiety, (2) average paranoia/high anxiety, (3) average paranoia/average anxiety, and (4) low paranoia/low anxiety. A unique cluster of individuals with high paranoia but low/average level of anxiety was not found. Cluster 1 reported a significantly higher intensity of day-to-day worries, a higher level of meta-worry, and more extreme meta-cognitive beliefs about worry than other clusters.

Conclusions

Individuals with high paranoia tended to report anxiety as well, but not vice versa. Our findings supported a hierarchical structure of anxiety and paranoia. All worry processes were exacerbated in individuals with paranoia and anxiety than those with anxiety alone.

### Computerised adaptive testing across the paranoia continuum [^dd7ab1a9]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Accurate, patient-centred assessment can drive change in outcomes for individual patients and services. Ideally, a patient entering clinical services for the treatment of psychosis would be formally assessed for the severity of each psychotic experience. This assessment would be repeated weekly or fortnightly after treatment starts. The information gathered would be regularly reviewed in order to monitor the success of an intervention and inform judgements about possible changes to provision. Such information could also be analysed at the aggregate service level to see how outcomes compare both to benchmarks and provision in similar psychosis services. Gathering such patient-reported data at scale could be used to identify which interventions work best for typical presentations and help the personalisation of care. The nearest realisation of such measurement-based care in the UK is National Health Service (NHS) services for the treatment of anxiety and depression. Here, outcome data are collected for almost every treatment session and anonymised data are made publicly available. It is well-recognised that measurement can also improve psychosis services. Setting standards for treatment provision and regular audits has substantially improved early intervention for psychosis services in the UK. Measurement-based care is perceived positively by patients with psychosis, especially when used in shared decision-making. However, there is a particular measurement challenge for psychosis. It is difficult to assess the wide variety of psychotic experiences in a way that is practical to implement, relevant to patients and clinicians and sufficiently accurate to be sensitive to change. In this paper, we examine a way to tailor the assessment of psychotic experiences. This method may enable quicker testing of each psychotic experience type and therefore facilitate comprehensive coverage of many psychotic experiences.

Psychotic experiences are, of course, what leads a person to enter psychosis services. The main treatments are designed to reduce these experiences, while other interventions may address the consequences of these difficulties. Patient-reported outcomes should be prioritised since, whatever inaccuracies self-report can sometimes bring, the patient is still best placed to judge their own experience and they are the recipient of treatment. A key challenge for assessment stems from the complexity of psychosis. Factor analysis indicates at least half a dozen independent dimensions of psychotic experiences: paranoia, grandiosity, hallucinations, cognitive disorganisation, anhedonia and blunted affect. Patients can also have substantial difficulties with anxiety, depression, sleep, cognitive functioning and social and occupational functioning. Rightly, services would not want patients to complete multiple assessments, of which a substantial portion would not be relevant for an individual.

The condition tends to be chronic with periods of exacerbation and remission.

### What makes one person paranoid and another person anxious? The differential prediction of social anxiety and persecutory ideation in an experimental situation [^0fd7e159]. Psychological Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

This is the first study to examine rigorously the differential prediction of social anxiety and persecutory ideation. Using a sophisticated statistical analysis, the relationships of psychological and social variables to well-established measures of paranoia and social anxiety were tested in a non-clinical population. The results are intriguing. Foremost, it was the assessment of perceptual anomalies that differentially predicted paranoid and social anxiety reactions. Individuals with paranoid reactions were prone to internal anomalous experience, whereas individuals with social anxiety reactions were less prone to internal anomalous experience. It was not simply psychosis-like anomalies but a wide range of perceptual experiences, from the mild to the severe, that predicted psychological reactions. For instance, items in the chemosensation subscale, which mainly relate to olfactory and gustatory experiences, include: 'Do you ever smell everyday odours and think that they are unusually strong?', 'Do you ever think that food or drink tastes much stronger than it normally would?', 'Do you ever find that your skin is more sensitive to touch, heat or cold than usual?' The importance of perceptual anomalies to paranoia is consistent with the cognitive model of paranoia. Having odd internal feelings in social situations may lead to delusional ideas through a sense of 'things not seeming right'. However, an important caveat is that the nature of the association of paranoia and perceptual anomalies was not established in the study. Anomalies at the time of testing were not assessed. A causal role can only be established in a study that manipulates anomalies of experience, in a randomized controlled design similar to the report by Zimbardo et al. Such causal designs are now indicated in research on the psychology of psychosis.

### Deficits in theory of mind and social anxiety as independent paths to paranoid features in schizophrenia [^a02477a5]. Schizophrenia Research (2010). Low credibility.

Research suggests paranoia among persons with schizophrenia may be the result of a number of different psychological processes including deficits in theory of mind (ToM) and social anxiety. To test this hypothesis, this study sought to determine whether a group of highly paranoid persons with and without a ToM deficit could be detected and whether the group with paranoia and better ToM might have high levels of social anxiety. To explore this, a cluster analysis was performed on a group of 102 adults with schizophrenia spectrum disorders in a non-acute phase of illness on the basis of ratings of paranoid features using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and levels of ToM deficit using a factor score which summarized four different ToM assessments. Four groups were produced: High Paranoia/Poor ToM (n = 14); Low Paranoia/Good ToM (n = 22); Low Paranoia/Low Middle ToM (n = 29); and High Paranoia/High Middle ToM (n = 23). Groups were then compared on self report of social anxiety. As predicted, the group with levels of high paranoid features and relatively better ToM performance had significantly higher levels of social anxiety than all other groups.

### The effect of state anxiety on paranoid ideation and jumping to conclusions. An experimental investigation [^65f6544c]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2010). Low credibility.

Theoretical models of persecutory delusions have emphasized the impact of reasoning biases and negative emotion at the early stages of symptom formation. However, the causal mechanisms remain unclear. This study tests the hypothesis that state anxiety will increase paranoid ideation and that this increase will be moderated by the level of individual vulnerability and mediated by the tendency to jump to conclusions. Healthy participants (n = 90) with varying levels of vulnerability (psychosis symptoms assessed by the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences) were randomly assigned to either an anxiety or a nonanxiety condition. Anxiety was induced by pictures from the International Affective Picture System and by in sensu exposure to individual anxiety-provoking situations. During each condition, symptoms of paranoia were assessed by a state-adapted version of the Paranoia Checklist. Jumping to conclusions (JTC) was assessed using a modified version of the beads task. Overall, participants in the anxiety condition reported significantly more paranoid thoughts and showed more JTC than participants in the neutral condition. Participants with higher baseline vulnerability were more likely to show an increase in paranoia as reaction to the anxiety manipulation. Moreover, the association of anxiety and paranoia was mediated by the increased tendency to jump to conclusions in the beads task. The results are in line with a threat anticipation conceptualization of paranoia and provide evidence for an interaction of anxiety and reasoning biases in the development of paranoid beliefs. A combination of meta-cognitive training directed at reasoning biases and promoting emotion regulation skills might prove beneficial in preventing symptoms.

### The pandemic paranoia scale (PPS): factor structure and measurement invariance across languages [^faa48d7f]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Paranoia, the belief that others will intentionally cause one harm (Freeman & Garety,), is common in the general population with approximately 28% of individuals reporting the elevated levels of paranoid thinking in everyday life (Freeman et al.). Paranoia can be conceptualised as existing on a continuum, ranging from mild concerns of suspicion and distrust of others, to less commonly reported delusions of persecution, which are more typical in clinical groups (Freeman et al.). Deciphering the intentions of others and making judgements as to whether others can be trusted is a complex human process, which is influenced by individual and environmental factors, and their interaction. Stress-vulnerability models of paranoid thinking emphasise the key role of high stress environments (e.g. victimisation, minority status and social maladjustment), affective states (e.g. fear, anger, anxiety and depression) and cognitive mechanisms (e.g. self-representations, social cognition and mentalisation) in understanding the development of paranoid thinking (e.g. Freeman, Bentall, & Garety; Garety, Kuipers, Fowler, Freeman, & Bebbington; Preti & Cella; van Os, Kenis, & Rutten). According to Preti and Cella's human heuristic account, paranoia helps an individual manage uncertainty during stressful situations. Stress, triggered by environmental factors and affective states, is thought to enhance the probability that neutral stimuli are viewed as threatening, which functions to avoid possible harm whilst not missing possible social gain. Under these conditions, interpretations and decision making over-relies on paranoid-based interpretations of experience.

2.2.2 Paranoia and hallucinations

2.2.2.1 Green et al. Paranoid Thoughts Scale — Part B

The G-PTS Part B is a trait measure of persecutory ideation. Each of the 16 items (e.g. 'I was convinced there was a conspiracy against me', 'Certain individuals have had it in for me', 'I have definitely been persecuted') conforms to a recent definition of persecutory ideation and is rated on a scale from 1 to 5. The presence of persecutory ideation is assessed over the past month and higher scores indicate greater levels of persecutory thinking. The questionnaire has been psychometrically evaluated for use in both clinical and non-clinical populations. The internal consistency of the scale and the test–retest reliability are good. Convergent validity with the Paranoia Scale has been shown.

2.2.2.2 Cardiff Anomalous Perceptions Scale

This 32-item questionnaire, developed in both non-clinical and psychosis groups, assesses a range of perceptual anomalies. The measure shows good construct and criterion validity, internal reliability and test–retest reliability. In the current study we focussed upon the three verbal hallucinations items together ('Do you ever hear voices commenting on what you are thinking or doing?', 'Do you ever hear voices saying words or sentences when there is no one around that might account for it?', 'Have you ever heard two or more unexplained voices talking with each other?'). The scale also has three factor scores. The first factor, temporal lobe experience, contains items such as 'Do you ever think that everyday things look abnormal to you?' and 'Do you ever see shapes, lights, or colors even though there is nothing really there?'. The second factor, chemosensation, contains items such as 'Do you ever notice that food or drink seems to have an unusual taste?' and 'Do you ever smell everyday odors and think that they are unusually strong?. The third factor, clinical psychosis, contains items such as 'Do you ever hear your own thoughts spoken aloud in your head, so that someone near might be able to hear them?' and 'Do you ever hear voices commenting on what you are thinking or doing?'. Respondents initially rate (No/Yes) whether they have experienced the anomaly. A higher score represents the reporting of a greater number of perceptual anomalies.

### Links between psychotic and neurotic symptoms in the general population: an analysis of longitudinal British national survey data using directed acyclic graphs [^d68344aa]. Psychological Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-psychotic affective symptoms are important components of psychotic syndromes. They are frequent and are now thought to influence the emergence of paranoia and hallucinations. Evidence supporting this model of psychosis comes from recent cross-fertilising epidemiological and intervention studies. Epidemiological studies identify plausible targets for intervention but must be interpreted cautiously. Nevertheless, causal inference can be strengthened substantially using modern statistical methods.

Methods

Directed Acyclic Graphs were used in a dynamic Bayesian network approach to learn the overall dependence structure of chosen variables. DAG-based inference identifies the most likely directional links between multiple variables, thereby locating them in a putative causal cascade. We used initial and 18-month follow-up data from the 2000 British National Psychiatric Morbidity survey (N = 8580 and N = 2406).

Results

We analysed persecutory ideation, hallucinations, a range of affective symptoms and the effects of cannabis and problematic alcohol use. Worry was central to the links between symptoms, with plausible direct effects on insomnia, depressed mood and generalised anxiety, and recent cannabis use. Worry linked the other affective phenomena with paranoia. Hallucinations were connected only to worry and persecutory ideation. General anxiety, worry, sleep problems, and persecutory ideation were strongly self-predicting. Worry and persecutory ideation were connected over the 18-month interval in an apparent feedback loop.

Conclusions

These results have implications for understanding dynamic processes in psychosis and for targeting psychological interventions. The reciprocal influence of worry and paranoia implies that treating either symptom is likely to ameliorate the other.

### Paranoia and post-traumatic stress disorder in the months after a physical assault: a longitudinal study examining shared and differential predictors [^891593ce]. Psychological Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Understanding paranoia

The paranoia spectrum that we have been studying comprises ideas of reference and of persecution. Our theoretical understanding has been influenced by models of anxiety disorders, since cognitions of current threat are clearly central to both experiences (Freeman et al.). Affective processes, especially anxiety, worry, negative beliefs about the self and interpersonal sensitivity, are given a central role in this paranoia model. It is hypothesized that the individual experiences a changed (and confusing) anomalous internal state (e.g. perceptual disturbances occur). This may be triggered by, for example, life events, difficulties with sleep, or illicit drugs. In essence, the person feels different and this needs an explanation. Importantly, a negative affective state makes a threatening interpretation likely: anxiety leads to the anticipation of danger; negative beliefs about the self and interpersonal sensitivity highlight the person's vulnerability to harm; and engagement in worry results in more negative, implausible ideas. The fears reach a delusional level of conviction when reasoning biases, such as belief inflexibility and jumping to conclusions, are present. Many of the same processes contribute to the persistence of the paranoid fears. These include, just as for anxiety disorders, maladaptive attempts to reduce the threat such as safety behaviours, thought suppression, worry and rumination. For example, individuals with persecutory delusions may not travel on a bus for fear of attack and therefore fail to learn that they were safer than they had realized.

### What makes one person paranoid and another person anxious? The differential prediction of social anxiety and persecutory ideation in an experimental situation [^adcedcfd]. Psychological Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The differential prediction of social anxiety and paranoia

Social anxiety caused by the neutral social situation was also assessed in the general population study. Participants completed the Social Avoidance and Distress Scale (SAD) in relation to their experience of the virtual environment (Watson & Friend). In this paper we report the factors that differentially predict the occurrence of social anxiety and paranoid thoughts in virtual reality. Although similarities between the two experiences are becoming evident, differences are of equal theoretical and clinical interest. Based on the persecutory delusions model, there was an a priori prediction that anomalies of experience would distinguish the prediction of paranoia and social anxiety. Entering a social situation when anxious will produce anxiety, but entering a social situation when anxious and having anomalies of experience will increase the likelihood of paranoid thinking. By contrast, it was expected that anxiety, depression, worry, interpersonal sensitivity and negative beliefs about the self would not distinguish the prediction of social anxiety and paranoia (i.e. affective processes contribute to the occurrence of both experiences). It was also hypothesized that reasoning style might be a differential predictor, but that this may be difficult to detect in a non-clinical study where the ability to correct interpretations may be protective against the development of clinical experiences.

### Paranoia and post-traumatic stress disorder in the months after a physical assault: a longitudinal study examining shared and differential predictors [^bcf8dac4]. Psychological Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Study hypotheses

In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR) description of PTSD it is noted that 'persecutory ideation can be present in some severe and chronic cases' (APA). In contrast, we hypothesized that persecutory ideation is relatively common in people after an assault, and especially common in those with PTSD reactions. We expected raised rates of paranoia to be apparent across all forms of our assessment battery, and hence that reports of paranoia from the self-report, interviewer and experimental methods of assessment would be positively correlated. It was hypothesized that reports of PTSD and paranoia symptoms would be separable, distinct experiences, as tested by factor analysis; that is, paranoia would not simply be a symptom of PTSD, nor PTSD simply a reaction to paranoid experiences. The strongest element of assault studies is the longitudinal design. We hypothesized that paranoia and PTSD would share many of the same predictors (e.g. worry, insomnia, interpersonal sensitivity, safety behaviours), since perceptions of threat are central to both experiences. However, we also expected there to be differential predictors of the two experiences. Perceptual anomalies were hypothesized to be one of two key differential predictors. In the context of an individual feeling anxious, the additional occurrence of odd internal perceptual experiences would lead to delusional ideas via a sense of 'things not seeming right'. Perceptual anomalies are commonly reported by patients with schizophrenia (e.g. Bunney et al; Parnas et al.), often considered to be a product of core cognitive dysfunction underlying psychosis (e.g. Maher; Uhlhaas & Mishara,), and have been found in two virtual reality studies to be differential predictors of the occurrence of paranoid ideation and social anxiety (Freeman et al.). In contrast, it was hypothesized that how the trauma was processed at the time, and consequent disorganized memories of the event, would be particularly linked to PTSD symptoms. Disturbance in autobiographical memory of the traumatic event is considered a core feature of PTSD (e.g. Foa et al; Brewin et al; Ehlers & Clark).

### Cognitive bias modification for paranoia (CBM-pa): a randomised controlled feasibility study in patients with distressing paranoid beliefs [^37ef91de]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

We are aware of only two studies to date that have employed CBM-I in patients with psychosis. Steel et al. targeted comorbid anxiety, rather than paranoia specifically, using a CBM method designed for anxiety. No significant changes were observed in either interpretation bias or state anxiety. Turner et al. reported significant improvements in social anxiety after manipulating interpretations of socially ambiguous scenarios. In contrast, the present study was designed to modify the paranoia-relevant interpretation bias that directly reflects the paranoid beliefs associated with psychosis, as shown in previous basic experimental research in high trait (Savulich et al.), patient (Savulich et al.) and prodromal (Yiend et al.) samples.

For the present study we created a customised version of CBM-I, labelled the 'Cognitive Bias Modification for paranoia' (CBM-pa), that targets the specific cognitive mechanisms contributing to paranoia as identified in our previous basic research studies (Savulich et al; Yiend et al.). In our earlier report we applied a single-session of CBM-pa to individuals with high levels of trait paranoia and found preliminary evidence that paranoid interpretation biases could be manipulated using CBM-pa (Savulich et al.). The double-blind, randomised controlled trial reported here was designed to further investigate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of CBM-pa for individuals with persistent, distressing paranoid symptoms. In line with the intended purpose of feasibility trials (Eldridge et al.), the main objectives of this study were:
test the feasibility of CBM-pa including rates of recruitment, dropout, and follow-up, randomisation, as well as the length of the protocol and its safety;
provide initial estimates of the effects of CBM-pa on interpretation bias, clinical outcomes (symptoms of paranoia, depression and anxiety) and vulnerability to stress/distress;
assess the dose–response relationship of CBM-pa;
select primary and secondary outcomes for future full clinical trials.

### What makes one person paranoid and another person anxious? The differential prediction of social anxiety and persecutory ideation in an experimental situation [^c0fd4b04]. Psychological Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Differential predictors

The differential predictor analysis is reported in Table 3. For the interpretation of the results it should be noted that for continuous scales the ORs refer to 1-point changes; if the OR for a unit change in the independent variable is, for example, 1.10 then the OR for a 10-point increase is 1.10 raised to the power of 10 (i.e. 2.59). For unadjusted effects, only one variable had a significant interaction, Positive Self (p value = 0.006). As positive self increases by 1 unit the odds decrease by 0.97 for paranoia and 0.87 (0.97×0.90) for social anxiety.

Table 3
The differential prediction of anxiety and paranoia

The unadjusted effects do not take into account any confounding caused by other factors and hence true effects may be masked or misleading. Table 3 also displays the effects produced for each predictor when adjusted for the set of potential confounders. Two clinical variables, anomalies of experience and family loneliness, significantly differed in their relationships with paranoia and social anxiety. Anomalies of experience is highly statistically significant (p = 0.007), indicating that the effect of anomalous experience is different for paranoia and social anxiety. The effect is represented as an OR for paranoia of 1.09 but for social anxiety 0.99 (1.09×0.91). This means that, within paranoia, the odds increase by 1.09 as the anomalies of experience scale increases by 1 unit; however, within social anxiety the odds decrease by 0.99 as the scale increases by 1 unit. An increase on the family loneliness scale does not affect the occurrence of paranoia but increases the odds of social anxiety by 1.04.

### Experimental studies of paranoid thinking in clinical and nonclinical populations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^183a24b5]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Psychological research using methodologies for inducing and/or measuring paranoid thinking in both clinical and nonclinical samples offers a unique approach to the study of paranoia. These methodologies have been used to test theoretical models of paranoia by investigating factors that buffer or attenuate experiences of paranoia (Ellett & Chadwick; Lincoln, Hohenhaus, & Hartmann). However, they have been used most extensively in analogue samples, which provide a convenient and acceptable means of testing psychosocial models of paranoia given dimensional models of mental ill-health and paranoia in particular. Their use in clinical samples is relatively less well developed but an important area of research, most notably, in testing the role of potential buffers and protective factors in relation to paranoid thinking. Despite the popularity of paranoia induction methodologies, there is currently no meta-analysis of experimental studies of paranoia which can guide researchers in designing and evaluating research in this area. Two recent systematic reviews, one investigating the role of anxiety in paranoia and one investigating a range of causal mechanisms in delusions and hallucinations, included a review of studies using experimental procedures to manipulate paranoia (Bennetts, Stopa, & Newman-Taylor; Brown, Waite, & Freeman). However, these reviews did not meta-analyse the effects of the experimental procedures on outcomes, which is important to establish the size of the effects. The aim of the current review was to summarise the existing literature on experimental paradigms that have been used to study paranoid thinking in both clinical and nonclinical populations. Given the proposed structure of paranoia as potentially including both persecutory ideation and/or social reference (Bebbington et al; Bell & O'Driscoll,), we chose to focus on the facet of paranoid thinking specifically. Additionally, given our main focus was to summarise the literature on experimental studies that measured paranoia as an outcome, we did not use a specific theoretical model to guide our decision-making about which paradigms to include, as this could have potentially limited the scope of studies included in the review. The current systematic review and meta-analysis will, therefore, address the following central questions: (1) What experimental paradigms have been used to induce or study paranoia?; (2) How effective are these experimental paradigms?; (3) What factors mediate and moderate the effect of experimental paradigms on paranoia?

### Acute adverse effects of therapeutic doses of psilocybin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b2a9650c]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, therapeutic doses of psilocybin appeared to produce tolerable acute adverse effects that typically resolved within 24 to 48 hours. However, less common adverse effects, such as paranoia and prolonged visual perceptual effects, warrant attention. Larger trials are necessary to fully assess these adverse effects, particularly in populations with comorbid health conditions. Recommendations for solicited acute adverse effects should, at a minimum, include headache, nausea, anxiety, dizziness, paranoia, blood pressure and/or heart rate changes, visual perceptual effects, physical discomfort, and mood changes. Although infrequent, the possibility of suicidality, prolonged paranoia, and persistent visual perceptual effects should be monitored over the long term. The effectiveness of medications and alternative treatments in managing these symptoms requires further investigation. Additionally, the role of licensed therapists in managing adverse effects presents an avenue for future research.

### Explaining paranoia: cognitive and social processes in the occurrence of extreme mistrust [^b021601b]. BMJ Mental Health (2023). High credibility.

Background

Paranoia-incorrectly thinking that others are deliberating trying to harm you-causes distress, undermines social interactions and leads to withdrawal. It presents across multiple psychiatric diagnoses.

Objective

The primary aim was to determine the extent that cognitive and social processes may explain paranoia. The secondary aim was to identify explanatory factors that distinguished paranoia and social anxiety.

Methods

10382 UK adults, quota sampled to match the population for age, gender, ethnicity, income and region, participated in a non-probability survey. All participants completed a paranoia measure and assessments of cognitive and social processes. Structural equation modelling was conducted.

Findings

2586 (24.9%) participants described being mistrustful of other people. 1756 (16.9%) participants wanted help to trust more. 66.7% of variance in paranoia was explained by a model comprising (in descending order of importance): within-situation defence behaviours, negative images, negative self-beliefs, discrimination, dissociation, aberrant salience, anxiety sensitivity, agoraphobic distress, worry, less social support, agoraphobic avoidance, less analytical reasoning and alcohol use. All explanatory factors were associated with paranoia and social anxiety. Ten factors were more closely associated with paranoia than social anxiety, including discrimination, hallucinations, negative images, aberrant salience and alcohol use. Nine factors were more closely associated with social anxiety, including less positive self-belief, an external locus of control, worry and less analytical reasoning.

Conclusions

Multiple causes are likely to be involved in paranoia. Cognitive and social processes may explain a high degree of paranoia.

Clinical Implications

Multiple clear targets for intervention to reduce paranoia are identified.

### Interpersonal processes in paranoia: a systematic review [^777670f2]. Psychological Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Paranoid ideation is a core feature of psychosis, and models of paranoia have long proposed that it arises in the context of disturbances in the perception of the self. However, to develop targeted interventions, there is a benefit in clarifying further, which aspects of self-perception are implicated. Interpersonal sensitivity is a personality trait which has been associated with the risk of paranoid thinking in the general population. However, not all studies have found this link. We aimed to review the empirical literature assessing the association between interpersonal sensitivity and paranoia in both general population and clinical samples; and to explore if associations found differed depending on whether state or trait paranoia was assessed. The review followed PRISMA guidelines. Articles were identified through a literature search in OVID (PsychINFO, MEDLINE) and Web of Science up to December 2016. Fourteen studies with a total of 12 138 participants were included. All studies were of 'fair' or 'good' quality. A robust association was found between interpersonal sensitivity and paranoia in clinical and general population samples alike, regardless of the method of assessment of both paranoia and interpersonal sensitivity. Although this finding was more pronounced in studies of trait paranoia, it is likely that differences in study purpose, measurement, and power explain these differences. Findings from this review support the hypothesis that feelings of personal vulnerability and exaggerated socially evaluative concerns are central for both onset and maintenance of paranoid symptoms, suggesting avenues for future research in targeted interventions.

### Differential-diagnostic confusion and non-specificity of affective symptoms and anxiety: an empirical study of first-admission patients [^9bf74a7c]. Psychiatry Research (2020). Medium credibility.

In everyday clinical work, psychiatrists encounter patients who present with symptoms spanning several diagnostic categories, e.g., showing signs of a psychosis, depression, and anxiety. This raises the critical question of which symptoms hold precedence over other and, by extension, which diagnosis is the right diagnosis. ICD-10 and DSM-5 do not provide unambiguous answers to this question and therefore psychiatry remains exposed to diagnostic disagreement with consequences for treatment and research. We explored symptom distribution in a sample of 98 first-admission psychiatric patients. We extracted and categorized singular symptoms into symptom domains: anxiety, mania, delusions, hallucinations, first-rank symptoms, and negative symptoms. Most symptoms were seen in most disorders. We found symptoms of depression and anxiety in almost all patients. Thus, just counting symptoms do not seem to be a valid way to make diagnoses. We elaborately discuss these issues in the context of the differential-diagnosis between schizophrenia and depression. Finally, we suggest that a combination of a criteria- and Gestalt-based approach to diagnosing mental disorders may contribute to counteract some of the current differential-diagnostic confusion.

### 'Thinking about them is only making me feel worse'. The mediating role of metacognitive factors in the relationship between paranoia-like beliefs and psychopathology symptoms in a community sample [^38e26271]. Schizophrenia Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Paranoia in community samples is associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety symptoms and suicidality. The metacognitive model assumes the role of metacognitive factors in these associations. Positive and negative metacognitive beliefs (PMB and NMB, respectively) and cognitive-attentional syndrome (CAS) are to mediate between paranoia-like beliefs and psychopathology symptoms. The current study is an attempt to test this prediction.

Methods

A cross-sectional community study with n = 840 participants. We used R-GPTS's persecutory subscale to measure paranoia-like beliefs, CAS-1 for CAS and metacognitive beliefs and SCL-27-plus for psychopathology symptoms.

Results

Indirect effects of PMB, CAS and NMB accounted for 22% to 56% (CI 95%) of total effects of relationships between paranoia-like beliefs and vegetative symptoms, symptoms of social phobia, agoraphobia, depression and suicidality screening.

Conclusions

We demonstrated that PMB, CAS and NMB mediate between paranoia-like beliefs and various psychopathological symptoms, as predicted by the metacognitive model of psychopathology. We also uncovered other indirect effects, including negative mediation effect of PMB on the relationship between paranoia-like beliefs and depressive symptoms and suicidality.

### Paranoia and post-traumatic stress disorder in the months after a physical assault: a longitudinal study examining shared and differential predictors [^2d7c2f63]. Psychological Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Levels of paranoia and PTSD were moderately correlated, but the factor analyses indicated that paranoia and PTSD are distinct experiences. Each therefore needs to be explained. This led to our analysis of differential predictors. Even given our expected close connections between PTSD and paranoia, it was quite striking that only two cognitive variables related differently to the experiences. Indeed, given the multiple testing, the probability values obtained, and the absence of a priori prediction for the significant variables, we are probably simply observing type I error. Even initial paranoia scores did not differentially predict levels of later paranoia. Our judgement is that a larger sample size is needed to more rigorously evaluate the potential cognitive differences and hence test the two theoretical models specificity. However, there may also be measurement difficulties, especially for anomalous experiences where the theoretical import resides in the absence of clear conscious awareness, thus limiting self-report assessment. Nonetheless, we did not replicate two studies that showed that anomalous experiences are specific to paranoia, in that such anomalies differentially predicted paranoia from social anxiety (Freeman et al.). This might be explained by the current study investigating PTSD rather than social anxiety. In PTSD dissociation is common (e.g. Briere et al.), and this includes a wide variety of anomalous perceptual experiences (e.g. Sierra et al.). The central and clear finding is the near absence of detection of factors that differentiate paranoia and PTSD, which is in contrast to the clear pattern of results showing the cognitive variables predicting both experiences.

### Explaining paranoia: cognitive and social processes in the occurrence of extreme mistrust [^830a5e81]. BMJ Mental Health (2023). High credibility.

As would be expected there was a great degree of potential shared causation for paranoia and social anxiety. All the social and cognitive factors were associated with both paranoia and social anxiety, often explaining a high degree of variance in each. The study was sufficiently large to detect differences, even small, in the sizes of associations between explanatory factors and paranoia and social anxiety. The overwhelming majority of explanatory factors differed at least to a degree in their level of association with paranoia and social anxiety. Perhaps most surprising were that intrusive negative images were more strongly associated with paranoia than social anxiety and that less use of analytical reasoning was more strongly associated with social anxiety than paranoia. It is more expected that discrimination, hallucinations, aberrant salience and cannabis use were more strongly associated with paranoia than social anxiety. The study clearly indicates that paranoia and social anxiety may arise from similar causes and co-occur but it also identifies a range of factors that may make paranoia or social anxiety more prominent in a presentation.

### Schizophrenia dissection by five anxiety and depressive subtype comorbidities: clinical implications and evolutionary perspective [^abc838cb]. Psychiatry Research (2017). Low credibility.

Twenty patients with DSM5 schizophrenia were comprehensively and formally assessed by an experienced psychiatrist. All subjects were assessed for: positive and negative psychotic symptoms; social anxiety; panic anxiety; obsessive compulsive disorder, atypical depression; major depression; suicide risk; and global assessment of functioning. Different profiles of clinical presentation and symptom evolution emerged for patients with schizophrenia who had co-morbid depression (15%), OCD (15%), panic or limited symptom attacks (55%) and social anxiety (5%). At least eighty percent of the sample had one or more of these co-morbidities. Summing up, the data support our previous finding that panic is highly prevalent in Schizophrenia with Auditory Hallucinations (> 73% here, versus 100% before), and panic was paroxysmally concurrent with voice onset. Moreover, characteristic clinical findings may help point clinicians to five specific co-morbidity psychosis subtypes. Moreover, co-morbidity dissection of psychotic diagnoses recalls and parallels the historical psychopharmacologic dissection of non-psychotic anxiety and depressive subtypes diagnoses. Larger studies should further test and explore these preliminary findings.

Psychiatric and Behavioral

What is the best approach for treating psychiatric/behavioral problems?

Anxiety, depression, aggression, impulsivity, and psychosis can be early symptoms of adult PLAN. It may be helpful to involve psychiatry, psychology, and a behavioralist. In individuals with limited communication, challenging behaviors could be the manifestation of, or exacerbated by a physical problem (eg, constipation, dental pain, sleep deprivation), be the result of a psychiatric problem (eg, anxiety), and may serve a function such as avoidance of unwanted activities. Medical triggers should be sought. A functional analysis may help identify the factors that influence the behavior and guide behavioral interventions (eg, applied behavioral analysis). If there is an underlying psychiatric cause, medication directed at that cause may be appropriate. If other methods fail, pharmacologic interventions may be needed. In some individuals with PLAN, treatment with antipsychotics seems to precipitate dystonia or parkinsonism, although causality is not always clear as the motor symptoms generally persist after discontinuation of the medication.

For adult PLAN with psychosis, what is the best antipsychotic medication?

Treatment of psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, paranoia, delusions) must be approached cautiously because of the potential for extrapyramidal side effects with antipsychotic medications. It is reasonable to take the same approach in PLAN as in Parkinson disease, where clozapine and quetiapine are preferred antipsychotic medications because their lower D 2 receptor affinity decreases the risks of worsening parkinsonism. Aripiprazole has also been used to treat mood and psychotic symptoms in PLAN.

### A preliminary study examining terminology used by individuals with lived experience describing beliefs about being targeted or harmed by others [^7ac06078]. Psychiatry Research (2023). Medium credibility.

While recent studies have prompted re-evaluation of the term "schizophrenia", few have examined the use of terms to describe persecutory ideation (PI) or paranoia. This study examines the preferences and terms used by a cross-diagnostic population of individuals (N = 184) with lived experience using an online survey. Participants most commonly described their PI in terms of the perceived source of threat, followed by clinical language, most commonly variants of "paranoia" and "anxiety". Of five selected terms assessed quantitatively - "anxiety", "paranoia", "persecutory thoughts", "suspiciousness", and "threat thoughts" - participants were more likely to report that "anxiety" aligned with their experience of PI, followed by "suspiciousness". Endorsement of terms more specific to PI was associated with self-report PI severity, while a preference for "anxiety" over other terms was both associated with less severe PI and lower scores on a measure of stigma. These results suggest that the heterogeneity of terms used by individuals with lived experience support a person-centered approach to language describing such experiences.

### Belief updating, childhood maltreatment, and paranoia in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders [^9cfaca62]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Paranoia

Self-reported paranoia was measured across all participants using the revised Green et al. Paranoid Thoughts Scale (R-GPTS), which contains a 10-item subscale measuring persecutory ideation (R-GPTS-Part B) that was used as our measure of paranoia. Items are measured on a 5-point Likert scale and total scores range from 0 to 40.

Interview-rated paranoia was also assessed in the schizophrenia group using the Suspiciousness/Persecution item (P6) of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). This scale includes 30 items scored on a 7-point scale to measure the severity of positive (7 items), negative (7 items), and general (16 items) symptoms, and is considered a reliable and comprehensive measure of psychotic symptoms. Higher P6 scores reflect more severe persecutory delusions.

Cognitive Impairment

Cognitive impairment was measured using the Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry (SCIP), a brief screening tool comprised of 5 sub-tests: working memory, immediate verbal memory, delayed verbal memory, verbal fluency, and processing speed. SCIP raw scores were converted to z scores using published normative data.

Anxiety

Anxiety was measured using the Beck Anxiety Inventory, a self-report measure of anxiety that has shown high internal consistency and test-retest reliability.

### Schizophrenia spectrum disorders with comorbid panic: a systematic review [^0ac218eb]. Schizophrenia Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The classical description of panic psychosis is characterized by existence of paroxysmal panic anxiety concurrent with auditory hallucinations or paranoid delusions. Although there is a high prevalence of panic comorbidity in schizophrenia, there remains much uncertainty among clinicians.

Aims

We aim to describe the psychopathological manifestations and pathogenetic factors of subjects with schizophrenia spectrum disorders comorbid with panic disorder. Adequate diagnosis and treatment of these conditions can produce significant amelioration of co-morbidities and psychotic symptoms.

Methods

Studies included in the review were selected through electronic search in these databases: Medical Literature databases and Retrieval System Online (Medline), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences (LILACS) and the Cochrane Library. Included were clinical studies in which schizophrenia spectrum disorder subjects had their diagnoses confirmed according to criteria from systematized manuals, and who also were evaluated with standardized scales for psychiatric symptomatology (psychosis, diagnosis of panic disorder or panic attacks, anxiety and general symptoms).

Results

We found a total of 449 results from electronic searches. Only twenty-five studies fully met the inclusion criteria for this review. Two main methodological approaches were identified: 1. Clinical studies which specifically focused on patients with Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders (SSD) with comorbid Panic Disorder (PD) (N = 11); 2. Clinical studies which examined broader groups of SSD patients (N = 13) for Panic symptoms.

Conclusion

Comparative studies show that SSD patients with PD comorbidity usually have more severe psychotic symptomatology, more depressive symptoms, more suicide ideation, earlier onset, and worse outcome. Correlation analysis confirmed the association of panic with more depressive symptoms, early onset, and worse functioning. In addition, other risk factors such as early trauma, hypovitaminosis D and a cross familiar risk are considered.

### An early phase II randomised controlled trial testing the effect on persecutory delusions of using CBT to reduce negative cognitions about the self: the potential benefits of enhancing self confidence [^8b2df2da]. Schizophrenia Research (2014). Low credibility.

Fig. 1
The paranoia hierarchy.

The clinical implication is that reducing negative thoughts about the self will lead to reductions in persecutory delusions. Consistent with this, self-esteem interventions for patients with psychosis have also been shown to lead to improvements in positive symptoms (e.g.). These studies have not examined persecutory delusions specifically. We set-out to reduce the short-term negative self-cognitions in patients with persistent persecutory delusions. Our view is that concepts such as negative self cognitions, self-esteem, and negative social comparison are closely related phenomena, tied to levels of depression. Therefore we measured all of these concepts. The evaluation was an early Phase II clinical trial, but with similarities to an experimental test. We used both standard CBT techniques for negative thoughts but also techniques from positive psychology to increase positive thoughts about the self; this was on the basis of clinical experience and research that shows that negative and positive affect are inversely correlated and overlap in genetic and environmental causes (e.g.). That is, our approach was to try to diminish negative thoughts and build positive thoughts. This is consistent withargument that 'positive and negative characteristics cannot logically be studied or changed in isolation'. The primary hypothesis was that a brief intervention focused on reducing negative beliefs about the self would immediately post-treatment produce reductions both in negative beliefs and in paranoia. The secondary prediction was that there would be improvements in related variables: positive beliefs about the self, comparison of self to others, self esteem, well-being, anxiety, and depression. Of course improvements in well-being and depression in this group would be valuable irrespective of effects on paranoia; almost half of patients with persecutory delusions have well-being scores in the lowest 2% of the population and a similar proportion meet diagnostic criteria for depression. We also examined whether any improvements due to treatment would be maintained at a follow-up assessment, although at this stage of intervention development we were focussed upon immediate change with treatment.

### Cognitive bias modification for paranoia (CBM-pa): a randomised controlled feasibility study in patients with distressing paranoid beliefs [^626e2d92]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Although effects of CBM-pa on paranoia symptoms at follow-ups were present on some measures, they appeared to wane over time, being generally weakest at 3 months. This pattern was fairly consistent across paranoid symptom measures. The Paranoia Scale showed the most robust changes (e.g. mean difference = −6.72 at 1-month follow-up, p = 0.045) and appeared to be the most sensitive measure to the effects of CBM-pa. The GPTS and PANSS (item 6, clinician-rated) showed similar patterns of paranoia reduction, but generally weaker effects. In contrast the estimated effects on depression and anxiety symptoms appeared smaller, dropping from −0.29 at post-intervention to near negligible −0.03 at 3-month follow-up. This is perhaps not surprising given that CBM-pa was designed to target paranoia specifically, whereas other forms of CBM have been developed to combat depression/anxiety (Yiend et al.). In future the combination of different CBM versions targeting different symptoms and/or mechanisms might be a fruitful avenue to investigate (Leung, Yiend, & Lee; Leung, Yiend, Trotta, & Lee). The estimates of population variances of the main outcomes for future power calculations are presented in online Supplementary Table S4.

Dose–response relationship

Due to practical constraints only one mechanistic measure (SRT) and one clinical measure (PANSS item 6) could be administered after each session, nor was the study sufficiently powered to detect session by session effects on either outcome. Nevertheless, intervention effects upon the target mechanism were evident after the third session and peaked at the fifth session, suggesting patients began to spontaneously select more adaptive patterns of interpretation after three training sessions. Notwithstanding small reductions after sessions 4 and 6, there was no convincing pattern of change on the clinical measure. It will be important in future work to investigate the optimum dosage of CBM-pa by conducting a Phase II dose finding study. One possible design would be to establish the minimum number of sessions required to achieve an a priori-defined clinically significant reduction of paranoid symptoms using retrospective dose–response modelling (Voils et al.).

### Hearing voices and other altered perceptual experiences across psychotic, mood, and anxiety disorders: from phenomenology and mechanisms to future directions [^16439c9d]. Schizophrenia (2025). Medium credibility.

Scope and research questions

This literature review focuses on examining voices/APE as a transdiagnostic target across intersecting psychiatric conditions involving psychosis, mood and anxiety. This is supported by existing syntheses that have established voices/APE as occurring across a range of diagnostic conditions, and aligns with approaches seeking to understand mental illness on a symptom level. Attention was centred on psychosis, mood and anxiety (neurological disorders where most work on visual hallucinations has derived was also briefly touched on) and, where applicable, the general population. Adults formed the focus, with child and adolescent experiences acknowledged when appropriate. Notably, specificity issues exist regarding conflation amongst levels of diagnosis (i.e. schizophrenia), syndrome (i.e. positive psychosis symptoms) and symptom (i.e. hallucinations), which we highlighted throughout, aiming for the utmost specificity (i.e. voices/APE) as possible.

The following research questions were posed:
i. In what context do voices/APE occur, and what are these experiences like from a phenomenological perspective?
ii. Which major biopsychosocial drivers or mechanisms underlie these experiences, and how do they shape protective factors, prognostic indicators and individual outcomes?
iii. How can we consolidate and translate prevailing knowledge to develop more comprehensive aetiological models as well as effective, targeted interventions?
iv. Looking to the future, where do pertinent gaps in existing research lie, and how can these be addressed?

### Relations between changes in safety behavior, paranoid ideations, cognitive biases, and clinical characteristics of patients with a psychotic disorder over time [^9f96ad95]. Schizophrenia Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Safety behaviors, both positive (maladaptive coping behavior) and negative (avoidance behavior), are used by people with paranoid delusions to avoid perceived threats. Safety behaviors contribute to the persistence of paranoid delusions by preventing disconfirmation of threat beliefs and may influence other psychiatric symptoms. This study investigated how changes in safety behaviors are related to changes in paranoid ideation, social anxiety, depression, cognitive biases and self-esteem over time.

Methods

This study included 116 patients diagnosed with a psychotic disorder (DSM-IV) and at least moderate levels of paranoid ideations (GTPS > 40). The data were collected as part of a multi-center randomized controlled trial where patients were randomized to VR-CBT (n = 58) or treatment as usual (TAU; n = 58). Assessments were completed at baseline (T0), after three months (T3) and after six months (T6). For all variables, change scores between T0 and T3 and T3 and T6 were calculated and Pearson correlations between change scores were computed.

Results

A decrease in total safety behavior was related to diminished paranoid ideation, social anxiety, and depression. No significant temporal associations were found between changes in safety behavior and changes in cognitive biases and self-esteem. Similar but less robust results were found for respectively negative safety behavior and positive safety behavior.

Conclusion

Dropping safety behavior can be specifically targeted in behavioral interventions. Whereas there appears to be a relation with reduction in anxiety, paranoia, and depressive symptoms, changes in safety behavior do not seem to align with changes in cognitive thinking processes.

### Psychological pathways to paranoia and psychotic-like experiences in daily-life: the mediating role of distinct affective disturbances [^794e0cdc]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2022). Medium credibility.

A key recent ESM study found that negative affect mediates the link between different types of daily-life stress and PLE, underscoring that the effect of this indirect path was superior to indirect paths via threat anticipation and aberrant salience. Our findings in the pathways from stress to PLE through anxiety, sadness, and self-esteem replicate and broaden this study by disentangling the roles of specific emotions, and add support to previous models of psychosis that posited the existence of an affective pathway to psychosis. It is worth noting that the mediating effect of self-esteem is in line with the self-esteem buffering hypothesis for depression, which suggests that high self-esteem buffers the effects of stress on symptoms, whereas low self-esteem boosts the vulnerability to stress. Further studies need to replicate and expand these findings in order to disentangle the specificity of a possible self-esteem buffering hypothesis for psychosis, which could be relevant in devising therapeutic strategies integrating both the reduction of risk mechanisms as well as building resilience through, for instance, personal empowerment. Regarding the specific pathway from stress to paranoia, findings also support experimental studies showing the mediating role of anxiety, depression, and self-esteem in this pathway. We expand on these studies by showing evidence in daily-life with ecological validity and across a psychosis continuum sample. The results that self-esteem and sadness were stronger predictors than anxiety in the indirect pathway from stress to paranoia seems to contradict Freeman et almodel of persecutory delusions that postulated anxiety as the key emotion in the development of paranoia. We tentatively speculate that the relative similarities between stress and anxiety could lessen the mediating effect of anxiety, although it must be noted that anxiety had a similar contribution to sadness and self-esteem in the pathway from stress to PLE.

### Comorbid depressive and anxiety disorders in 509 individuals with an at-risk mental state: impact on psychopathology and transition to psychosis [^78373de6]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

The notion of mood and anxiety disorders as "impacting" on ARMS features (and vice versa) assumes a neat distinction between these constructs, ie, they are readily distinguishable entities that might interact or have causal impact on each other. However, these two aspects are phenomenologically connected as core unifying characteristics of the "delusional mood" predating delusion formation and psychosis onset. According to Conrad's classic model, during this period (the "trema" or "stage fright"), the ARMS patient may experience an increasingly oppressive internal tension, "a feeling of nonfinality" or expectation, describing that something is "in the air" without being able to say what exactly has changed. These subjective experiences can vary between patients but are usually characterized by a marked change of "emotional-motivational" state, which can be expressed in anxiety and depressive symptoms. At first, the stage fright is associated with the most salient experiences but eventually spreads to pervade the patient's entire experiential field, leading to delusion formation and aberrant interpretation of reality. At a diagnostic level, the separation of these symptom clusters into distinct disorders in ARMS subjects is based on a strict diagnostic manual-based approach (a SCID interview) that assumes the symptoms belong in separate categories. However, as these symptom clusters phenomenologically overlap in prodromal psychosis, they may not necessarily be indicative of two (or more) separate disorders but rather be an expression of an emerging single "disorder" with diverse symptoms that happen to reach threshold levels for multiple diagnosable disorders. Therefore, the concept of "comorbidity" is somewhat problematic. However, the "primary" disorder is unclear at this early stage of presentation. It is currently impossible to distinguish patients with a nonpsychotic disorder, such as depression or anxiety with associated (attenuated) psychotic symptoms, from patients with an emerging psychotic disorder with depressive and anxiety symptoms. Only longitudinal course will clarify these possibilities in individual patients. There is ongoing research into phenotypic and endophenotypic features that might provide early markers of which disorders these symptom clusters will evolve into. An alternative conceptualization is that depression, anxiety negative symptoms, cognitive impairment, and positive psychotic symptoms all occur on a continuum, and that apparent "disorders" reflect whichever of these, or combination of these, is most prominent. For example, schizophrenia could be seen as a syndrome with prominent negative cognitive and positive psychotic symptoms, while unipolar depression will have prominent depressive symptoms, with some anxiety and positive symptoms.

### Insomnia and paranoia [^2a97e4b3]. Schizophrenia Research (2009). Low credibility.

4 Discussion

The rates of sleep difficulties in the community sample were consistent with the epidemiological literature; almost 30% had symptoms of insomnia and approximately 10% were in the clinical range. But the unique focus of the study was on a potential association between sleep difficulties and paranoid thinking. The results were clear: higher levels of insomnia were associated with higher levels of persecutory thinking. Confirmation was provided by the high prevalence of insomnia in the individuals with clinical paranoia. Insomnia is most likely an overlooked problem in psychiatric services for individuals with persecutory delusions.

Sleep disturbance is already incorporated into a theoretical account of persecutory delusions, but its role had not been directly tested. In this study the relationship between sleep and paranoia was largely accounted for by levels of anxiety and depression. This is unsurprising; both paranoia and sleep difficulties are closely linked with negative affect. Nevertheless the mediating routes between insomnia and paranoia require closer (and more rigorous) examination. A second plausible route is via the occurrence of perceptual anomalies. A lack of sleep may cause a puzzling internal state for the individual that, in the context of anxiety, is incorrectly attributed to external threat. Study of the mechanisms underlying insomnia in patients with persecutory delusions is also needed; sleep disturbance may be partly maintained by established insomnia-related processes such as rumination, attention to sleep-related threat, and dysfunctional beliefs about sleep.

The representativeness of the samples in the current study is questionable; the community group was only a minority of the many people leafleted in the local postcodes, while the clinical group was of a small size. There was also a reliance on self-report assessments. The study focussed on a specific experience (paranoid ideation), but it could be argued that completion of a full diagnostic screening interview by the non-clinical population would have provided information of interest. However the key limitation of the study is the cross-sectional design. The causal direction of the relationship between insomnia and paranoia is unknown. It is plausible that the insomnia assessed is simply a consequence of living with paranoid fears, although a circular relationship between insomnia, anxiety and paranoia is more probable. Longitudinal studies of the relationships are clearly warranted. A priority is the evaluation of well-established insomnia interventions (e.g.) for individuals with delusions. These interventions will provide a stronger test of the causal relationship between insomnia and paranoia and hold the promise of enhancing the efficacy of treatments for delusional beliefs.

### Psychological characteristics in patients with chronic complex regional pain syndrome: comparisons with patients with major depressive disorder and other types of chronic pain [^14c75c56]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Assessments

We collected data on demographic characteristics, including age, sex, educational level, and marital status, and on clinical variables, including location and mean duration of pain, and diagnosis. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used to assess the intensity of pain (0 = "no pain" to 10 = "the worst possible pain"). Patients completed the MMPI-2, the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and clinical assessments during their routine diagnostic and treatment planning assessments. The BDI-II consists of 21 items assessing depressive symptoms, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. The STAI includes two 20-item scales: The State scale measures current anxiety symptoms, and the Trait scale assesses general anxiety levels. Psychological characteristics were assessed using the MMPI-2, a 567-item self-report yes/no questionnaire, and we used three validity scales (the Lie (L), Infrequency (F), and Correction (K) scales) and 10 clinical scales: 1 (Hypochondriasis, Hs), 2 (Depression, D), 3 (Hysteria, Hy), 4 (Psychopathic deviate, Pd), 5 (Masculinity-Femininity, Mf), 6 (Paranoia, Pa), 7 (Psychasthenia, Pt), 8 (Schizophrenia, Sc), 9 (Hypomania, Ma), and 10 (Social introversion, Si). Raw scale scores were converted to T scores with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Scores over 65T imply the possibility of psychopathology.

### Advances in understanding illness anxiety [^eef8f9e2]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2008). Low credibility.

Illness anxiety, also known in its more severe form as hypochondriasis, is a debilitating and chronic condition in which normal bodily symptoms are misinterpreted as signs of serious medical illness. Patients suffer with the fear that they are ill despite reassurance to the contrary and often overuse medical services in the process. This article critically evaluates the recent literature on illness anxiety and related, medically unexplained symptoms, highlighting new and interesting findings in the areas of prevalence, classification/diagnosis, management, and evidence-based treatment and new frontiers in understanding illness anxiety, such as brain imaging, neuroimmunology, and cyberchondria.

### Can we predict the direction of sudden shifts in symptoms? Transdiagnostic implications from a complex systems perspective on psychopathology [^0812848e]. Psychological Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Network structure and local points of instability

A second hypothesis that may follow from the above described multidimensional view on psychopathology is that the structure of connections between symptoms may also inform us on the likelihood of specific directions of symptom transitions. As explained above, symptoms are expected to trigger other symptoms, leading to clusters of symptoms that we label as syndromes (e.g. depression, anxiety, psychosis). If no absolute boundaries exist then we can expect that symptoms can connect not only within fixed groups of symptoms but also across such groups. Symptoms that connect across boundaries are called 'bridge symptoms'. These ideas have been formulated previously (Cramer et al; Goekoop and Goekoop,) and can explain why people with one categorical psychiatric diagnosis (e.g. unipolar depression, when a depression cluster is active) are more likely to later fulfil the criteria for another diagnosis (e.g. schizoaffective disorder, when a psychosis component joins in). Since bridge symptoms facilitate most of the communication between the clusters (syndromes), changes in the states of these bridge symptoms may be particularly good candidates for the prediction of the direction of phase transitions in psychopathology networks. What follows from these ideas is that the specific patterns of connections between symptoms, like the EWS, may provide us with clues regarding the likelihood of a transition to a particular set of symptoms (a dimension in the landscape) (Fig. 5). For instance, if feeling down strongly triggers being paranoid in a particular individual, and if being paranoid is strongly connected to (and easily activates) many other symptoms that make up the cluster of 'psychotic symptoms', then we can say that the state of feeling down is proximal and close to the transition towards psychosis for this person. In the 3D stability landscape, this situation would be reflected by a gully in the hilly landscape running from the state of feeling down towards the basin of attraction corresponding to a psychotic state. In such a way, the network structure of an individual's symptoms may be informative for local points of instability in the multidimensional space of psychopathology and may signal, depending on the current activation state of the network, what direction of transition is most likely. We thus hypothesize that both approaches, EWS and network structure, may inform on the direction of symptom transitions. An interesting question is whether both approaches are complementary in providing information and whether the combination of information further increases the precision of the estimated likelihood. This question needs to be resolved empirically.

Patients with Long COVID were compared to patients after SARS-CoV-2 infection but without Long COVID in 44 studies, to healthy controls without a history of COVID-19 in 24 studies, to patients with chronic fatigue syndrome in two studies, and to patients with fibromyalgia and post-concussion syndrome in one study respectively. The most studied psychological factors within any control group were depression and anxiety, followed by physical activity, a combination of depression and/or anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, stress, and history of mental health disorders. For all other searched psychological constructs, evidence was very limited, with a maximum of three studies per variable (eTable 2 in the Supplement). The majority of studies found almost all maladaptive psychological factors to be significantly higher and more frequent in patients with Long COVID than in both patients after SARS-CoV-2 infection who did not develop Long COVID and in healthy controls without a history of COVID-19, with no study reporting the opposite direction. Lower scores for depression, anxiety, history of mental health disorders, paranoia, catastrophising, kinesiophobia, somatosensory amplification, and suicidal ideation were reported in patients with Long COVID compared to controls in one study each, all but one of which referred to comparisons to a control group with other persistent somatic symptoms (chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, post-concussion syndrome). Solely no significant differences between patients with Long COVID and controls were found for alcohol abuse, drug problems, disorders of psychological development, mania, borderline features, depression medications, walking self-efficacy (confidence in the ability to walk at a certain pace for a certain time without stopping), openness, conscientiousness, connection with friends, warmth, antisocial features, anger, aggression, dominance, negative cognitions, avoidance, nonsupport, and treatment rejection. However, it should be noted that, with the exception of alcohol abuse, all of these factors were only examined in one study each. Some studies reported both significant and non-significant differences between groups for the same psychological variable depending on measures (psychometric questionnaire data vs. clinical diagnosis of depression and anxiety; adverse life events in the past year vs. earlier), follow-up time point on symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and different aspects of a construct (trait vs. state anxiety; Table 1: RQ1).

### Cognitive bias modification for paranoia (CBM-pa): a randomised controlled feasibility study in patients with distressing paranoid beliefs [^37eefff5]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cognitive Bias Modification for paranoia (CBM-pa) is a novel, theory-driven psychological intervention targeting the biased interpretation of emotional ambiguity associated with paranoia. Study objectives were (i) test the intervention's feasibility, (ii) provide effect size estimates, (iii) assess dose-response and (iv) select primary outcomes for future trials.

Methods

In a double-blind randomised controlled trial, sixty-three outpatients with clinically significant paranoia were randomised to either CBM-pa or an active control (text reading) between April 2016 and September 2017. Patients received one 40 min session per week for 6 weeks. Assessments were given at baseline, after each interim session, post-treatment, and at 1- and 3-months post-treatment.

Results

A total of 122 patients were screened and 63 were randomised. The recruitment rate was 51.2%, with few dropouts (four out of 63) and follow-up rates were 90.5% (1-month) and 93.7% (3-months). Each session took 30–40 min to complete. There was no statistical evidence of harmful effects of the intervention. Preliminary data were consistent with efficacy of CBM-pa over text-reading control: patients randomised to the intervention, compared to control patients, reported reduced interpretation bias (d = -0.48 to -0.76), improved symptoms of paranoia (d = -0.19 to -0.38), and lower depressed and anxious mood (d = -0.03 to -0.29). The intervention effect was evident after the third session.

Conclusions

CBM-pa is feasible for patients with paranoia. A fully powered randomised control trial is warranted.

### The role of subclinical paranoia on social perception and behavior [^44bbaaac]. Schizophrenia Research (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of subclinical paranoia on social perception and behavior. Two groups of participants, those high and low in subclinical paranoia, were identified based on extreme scores on the Paranoia Scale (PS). As expected, persons high in subclinical paranoia had greater depression, social anxiety, self-consciousness, and lower self-esteem compared to persons low in subclinical paranoia. In addition, persons high in subclinical paranoia performed worse than persons low in subclinical paranoia on laboratory measures of emotion perception and on an in vivo social perception task. Finally, behavioral differences between these two groups were revealed: Persons high in subclinical paranoia sat further away from the examiner and took longer to read the consent form than low-paranoia persons. These behavioral differences were not due to the group differences in clinical functioning, indicating that level of paranoia generally accounted for these findings.

### The dunn worry questionnaire and the paranoia worries questionnaire: new assessments of worry [^4147c894]. Psychological Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Method

Participants

To extract the items for the new measures of general worry and worry concerning paranoia, a derivation sample of 300 participants (250 from the general population and 50 patients with persecutory delusions) completed the full item pool (mean age = 42.8, = 18.6, female = 167, male = 133, White British = 90%). A second cross-validation sample consisting of 449 participants [273 from the general population, 79 patients with persecutory delusions and 93 patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD)] completed the final versions of both measures (mean age = 33.5, = 13.8, female = 192, male = 257, White British = 90%).

Participants from the general population were recruited via local radio adverts and the distribution of leaflets in Oxfordshire. Patients with persecutory delusions were participants from the WIT, a randomised controlled trial of a psychological intervention to reduce worry in adults with persecutory delusions in the context of non-affective psychosis (Freeman et al.). They had: a clinical diagnosis of non-affective psychosis (i.e. schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or delusional disorder); a current and persistent persecutory delusion; and clinically significant levels of worry (44+ on the PSWQ; Startup and Erickson). Participants with SAD were referred for psychological treatment by their GP or IAPT services to either the London or Oxford Centre for Anxiety Disorders and Trauma. They met criteria for SAD according to the Anxiety and Related Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV (Brown et al.) and SAD was their primary clinical problem.

Assessments

Item pools

An initial item pool of 40 general worry items was devised by the study team based upon consideration of our definition of worry, comments patients had made, clinical experience and existing questionnaires. We aimed to cover items concerning time spent worrying, control over worry and the impact of worry. An initial item pool of 16 paranoia worry items was created from patient comments during the WIT and the team's clinical experience. The time period for all the items was 1 month. Following the response format of the WEMSBS (Tennant et al.), items were rated on a 0–4 scale (None of the time, Rarely, Some of the time, Often, All of the time).

### Chronic traumatic encephalopathy neuropathology might not be inexorably progressive or unique to repetitive neurotrauma [^0e657bba]. Brain (2019). Medium credibility.

Fifth, there is no requirement that the clinical condition be progressive — which runs counter to the assumption that TES is a neurodegenerative disease [see criterion v(h)]. Sixth, when examining the 'core' and 'supportive' features, it is not clear if there is a specific syndrome or syndromes that are being described because such a broad range of combinations of core and supportive features can meet criteria for TES. For example, if the person is healthy during the decade of his or her twenties, and he or she develops any of the following combinations of health problems between the age of 30 and 80 (thus meeting the supportive criterion of 'delayed onset'), that person would screen positively for having the core and supportive criteria for TES: (i) depression and suicidality; (ii) depression and anxiety; (iii) depression and headaches; (iv) depression and substance abuse; (v) anger control problems and anxiety; (vi) anger control problems and substance abuse; (vii) anger control problems and headaches; (viii) mild cognitive impairment and anxiety; (ix) mild cognitive impairment and substance abuse; (x) Parkinson's disease or parkinsonism and mild cognitive impairment; (xi) parkinsonism and apathy; (xii) Alzheimer's disease and apathy; (xiii) Alzheimer's disease and paranoia; (xiv) frontotemporal dementia and impulsivity; and (xv) frontotemporal dementia and paranoia.

Finally, as written, all individuals meeting the earlier-in-life exposure criterion for neurotrauma (criterion i), who develop mental health or neurological problems after the age of 40 that persist and/or worsen for at least 1 year, actually meet the two required supportive features — 'delayed onset' [criterion v(i)] and 'progressive' [criterion v(h), 'a progression in symptoms and/or signs' that occurs 'for a minimum of 1 year']. Thus, as written, they do not need to have a single additional clinical supportive feature — the onset and course of their depression, anger control problems, or cognitive impairment are sufficient for meeting TES diagnostic criteria. This is problematic because this onset and course represents the natural history of many psychiatric and neurological conditions experienced by individuals in the general population who have no known exposure to repetitive neurotrauma.

### Anxiety and negative self-schemas mediate the association between childhood maltreatment and paranoia [^4770ae47]. Psychiatry Research (2012). Low credibility.

This study examined affective and psychological routes from childhood maltreatment to increased paranoia in adulthood. Recent anxiety and negative beliefs about the self partially accounted for the associations between emotional or physical abuse and paranoia. However, as full mediation did not occur, other psychological, social and biological pathways require exploration.

### Graves' disease presenting with hypomania and paranoia to the acute psychiatry service [^300fe42e]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Background

The link between psychiatric disturbance and thyrotoxicosis was first described by von Basedow in the 19th century. Although overt psychotic features are not often seen in patients with thyrotoxicosis, it is important to recognise the phenomenon. It is very rare for psychosis to be the presenting symptom of Graves' disease. The estimated incidence of psychosis as the presenting feature of Graves' is 1% according to a New Zealand-based case series. Equally it is rare for thyrotoxicosis to be the underlying cause of a new psychiatric presentation.

Initiation of thionamides plus beta-blockade to treat agitation, anxiety and sympathomimetic symptoms is of paramount importance. While patients presenting with hypomania often receive treatment with antipsychotic medications, when thyrotoxicosis is the cause of mental health deterioration, treatment with thionamides with or without beta-blockers may be all that is required. Those patients who have antipsychotics administered as primary treatment may be misdiagnosed or left on long-term antipsychotic medication inappropriately. Nevertheless, there will be situations where management of psychosis requires a combination of antipsychotic therapy and thionamide drugs.

### Negative cognition, depressed mood, and paranoia: a longitudinal pathway analysis using structural equation modeling [^47ddcfd8]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

It is increasingly apparent that the etiology of psychosis is extremely complex and must include psychosocial interactions as well as neurobiological predispositions. A number of cognitive models have been proposed over the last decade to integrate the cognitive, social, and emotional processes believed to contribute both to the occurrence and to the persistence of positive psychotic symptoms.–There are equivalent models of individual symptoms, such as persecutory delusions, and auditory hallucinations. The models were derived from early empirical findings and from the experience of delivering cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) to people with psychosis: They had the specific intention of shaping research programmes. Although they differ somewhat in emphasis, they cohere in postulating psychological mechanisms that include both an increased vulnerability to anxiety and depression and biases in the cognitive processing of events and experiences.

The proposed role of dysfunctional thinking and emotional dysregulation in the development and maintenance of psychosis is increasingly supported by research.–In particular, there is now evidence from epidemiological, questionnaire, experimental, and treatment studies that negative cognition (low self-esteem, self-critical thinking, and extreme negative beliefs about self and others) and depressed mood can contribute to the development of symptoms of psychosis.–

However, previous studies showing associations between positive psychotic symptoms, negative cognition, and mood have relied on cross-sectional designs that inevitably constrain causal inference. We ourselves have used such cross-sectional designs to demonstrate that extreme negative beliefs about self and others, and depressed mood were independently associated with persecutory delusions. These findings are consistent with others indicating a role for negative cognition in psychotic symptoms independent of mood. However, it remains unclear whether symptom development is influenced by negative cognition and emotional dysregulation or vice versa.

The current article is the first to test the plausibility of these hypothesized causal links in a large clinical sample involving longitudinal assessment of people with nonaffective psychosis. The analyses formed an ancillary part of the original protocol of the Psychological Prevention of Relapse in Psychosis (PRP) Trial. This was a British multicenter, randomized controlled trial of CBT and family intervention for psychosis (ISRCTN83557988). A comprehensive description of the trial and its methods is provided elsewhere. For present purposes, we treated the whole dataset as a cohort, utilizing data from baseline, 3-month, and 12-month assessments. Participants were selected on the basis that they had developed psychosis some time previously. We were thus investigating the factors that influenced the waxing and waning of psychotic symptoms already established.

### When agitation, hallucination, and paranoia mean more than psychosis… [^83ce4fee]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

A 17-year-old girl with a history of depression, anxiety, and self-cutting presented with a 2-week history of altered mental status and seizurelike activity. Initially the patient reported an "out-of-body experience" and anxiety associated with tinnitus and insomnia. She also experienced left-sided paresthesia, leading to increasing anxiety, for which she started taking alprazolam with some relief. Her pediatrician initially attributed her symptoms to anxiety and stress. Her symptoms worsened to intermittent episodes of anxiety associated with giddiness, agitation, and auditory and visual hallucinations with paranoid ideation. A week into the disease process she experienced 2 seizurelike episodes described as generalized shaking, eye rolling, and drooling, for which she was hospitalized. Her mother noted that she was doing well but had a sore throat, decreased appetite, and weight loss a few weeks before symptom onset.

She also acknowledged that the family had been under a lot of stress with the patient's father.

### Current paranoid thinking in patients with delusions: the presence of cognitive-affective biases [^02c771bd]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2013). Low credibility.

Results

Basic Demographic and Clinical Information

The mean age of the sample (N = 130) was 41.1 years (SD = 11.6), with 82 men and 48 women. The ethnicities of the sample were white (n = 79), black Caribbean (n = 15), black African (N = 12), black Other (n = 4), Asian (n = 6), and other (n = 14). Common factors for this patient group were the majority were single (n = 92) and not currently working (n = 119).

The diagnoses by the clinical teams of the participants were schizophrenia (n = 111), delusional disorder (n = 7), schizo-affective disorder (n = 9), and psychotic disorder (n = 1). Almost all participants (n = 121) were currently taking antipsychotic medication. The mean length of illness was 14.2 years (SD = 10.3). From the SAPS ratings, 119 were experiencing persecutory delusions, 87 were experiencing auditory hallucinations, and 20 were experiencing grandiose delusions. The mean score for state paranoia was 163.9 (SD = 147.0). The full range of scores from 0 to 500 were reported for state paranoia, with 19 individuals scoring zero and 3 individuals reporting 500. The state paranoia score positively correlated with the SAPS persecutory delusions item, r = .38, P < .001.

Hypothesis 1: Association of Paranoia With Anxiety and Depression

The mean BAI score was 21.9 (SD = 13.1), with 24 patients in the nonanxious range, 33 in the mild anxiety range, 38 in the moderate range, and 33 in the severe anxiety range. The mean BDI score was 25.7 (SD = 13.7), with 29 patients in the minimal depression range, 20 in the mild range, 30 in the moderate range, and 51 in the severe depression range. State paranoia positively correlated with levels of anxiety, r = .38, P < .001, and depression, r = .37, P < .001. Levels of anxiety and depression were significantly associated, P = 0.62, P < .001.

### Relationship of sex to symptom severity, psychiatric comorbidity, and health care utilization in 163 subjects with borderline personality disorder [^321299c3]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the study was to compare symptom severity, frequency, and pattern of psychiatric comorbidity, quality of life, and health care utilization in men and women with borderline personality disorder (BPD).

Methods

The analysis is based on a sample of 163 subjects with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition BPD recruited for participation in a clinical trial at an academic medical center. Subjects were administered structured interviews and questionnaires of known reliability.

Results

Men (n = 25) and women (n = 138) with BPD were compared across multiple domains. Men were significantly older than women (34.5 vs 30.4 years), but subjects were otherwise similar in their demographic characteristics. Overall syndrome severity and frequency of past suicide attempts and self-harm behaviors were also similar. Women were more likely than men to have an anxiety disorder (particularly generalized anxiety disorder), somatoform disorders, and histrionic personality disorder. Antisocial personality disorder was more common in men. Women had higher dimensional ratings of depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsiveness, work dysfunction, and negative affectivity; they were also more likely to endorse the "paranoia/dissociation" BPD criterion. On the Short Form-36 Health Survey, women reported significantly worse emotional role, social role, and mental health functioning than men. Contrary to expectation, there were no significant cross sex differences in the use of health care resources.

Conclusion

Men and women with BPD show important differences in their pattern of psychiatric comorbidity, dimensional symptom ratings, and in quality of life variables. Women have more negative views of themselves, and worse overall emotional and social role functioning. Implications for clinicians and researchers are discussed.

### Associations among perceptual anomalies, social anxiety, and paranoia in a college student sample [^66ff39b3]. Psychiatry Research (2011). Low credibility.

Recent evidence suggests that normal-range paranoid ideation may be particularly likely to develop in individuals disposed to both social anxiety and perceptual anomalies. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that among college students in an unselected sample, social anxiety and experience of perceptual anomalies would not only each independently predict the experience of self-reported paranoid ideation, but would also interact to predict paranoid patterns of thought. A diverse sample of 644 students completed a large battery of self-report measures, as well as the five-factor Paranoia/Suspiciousness Questionnaire (PSQ). We conducted hierarchical multiple regression analyses predicting scores on each PSQ factor from responses on measures of social anxiety, perceptual aberration, and the interaction between the two constructs. Current general negative affect was covaried in all analyses. We found that both social anxiety and perceptual aberrations, along with negative affect, predicted multiple dimensions of paranoia as measured by the PSQ; the two constructs did not, however, interact significantly to predict any dimensions. Our findings suggest that perceptual aberration and anxiety may contribute to normal-range paranoid ideation in an additive rather than an interactive manner.

### Nonverbal correlates of paranoid ideation-a systematic literature review [^650e5c1c]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Paranoia is defined as a range of thoughts from mild worries that relate to social judgment to strong beliefs of reference and fear that an entity is intending to cause harm (Green et al.). These beliefs range from paranoid ideations to persecutory delusions. Approximately one in three people in the general population experiences paranoid thinking to some extent during their lifetime (Freeman et al.). Over 70% of people experiencing early stages of psychosis present with persecutory delusions (Coid et al.). These delusions, held with strong conviction and resistant to contrary evidence significantly impact functioning, mood (Vorontsova, Garety, & Freeman,), and sleep (Freeman, Pugh, Vorontsova, & Southgate). The severity of these beliefs, which is key to diagnosis, is determined by factors such as conviction, distress, impact on functioning, preoccupation, and resistance to change (Garety et al.). Diagnosing paranoid ideation typically involves self-report or hetero-anamnestic evidence from interviews and questionnaires (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS; Kay, Fiszbein, & Opler,); Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States (Yung et al.); and Green Paranoid Thoughts Scale (Green et al.). Interviews and questionnaires can potentially be suboptimal for diagnosing paranoia, as individuals may avoid sharing details due to mistrust or fear of judgment. Additional evidence for the diagnosis of persecutory delusions might be provided through clinical observation and other nonverbal measurements, although a synthesis of evidence for this in the literature is lacking. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of nonverbal correlates of paranoid ideation. Results can be used to further develop nonverbal components of diagnostic instruments in order to provide useful triangulation in clinical assessment.

### What is generalized anxiety disorder? [^7b4da10d]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Generalized, persistent, and free-floating anxiety was first described by Freud in 1894, although the diagnostic term generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) was not included in classification systems until 1980 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Third Edition [DSM-III]). Initially considered a residual category to be used when no other diagnosis could be made, it is now widely accepted that GAD represents a distinct diagnostic category. Since 1980, revisions to the diagnostic criteria for GAD in the DSM-III-R and DSM-IV classifications have markedly redefined this disorder, increasing the duration criterion to 6 months and increasing the emphasis on worry and psychic symptoms. This article reviews the development of the diagnostic criteria for defining GAD from Freud to DSM-IV and compares the DSM-IV criteria with the criteria set forth in the tenth revision of the International Classification of Diseases. The impact of the changes in diagnostic criteria on research into GAD, and on diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and treatment of GAD, will be discussed.

### CLINICAL PRACTICE. generalized anxiety disorder [^ac79ac21]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on generalized anxiety disorder:

- **Definition**: GAD is a chronic disorder characterized by excessive anxiety and worry about a number of events or activities (such as work, home, and social) symptoms, and tension, which an individual finds difficult to control.
- **Pathophysiology**: GAD is mostly caused by genetic (altered DNA methylation and single nucleotide polymorphism) and environmental factors (stress, trauma, etc.).
- **Epidemiology**: The lifetime prevalence of DSM-5 GAD in the US is estimated at 7,800 cases per 100,000 individuals.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include restless feeling, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, sleep disturbance, arguments with relatives or friends, difficulty/inability to complete tasks, restriction of usual activities, with associated autonomic, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary symptoms decreasing the overall health of the individual. GAD is associated with various comorbidities including depression, dysthymia, bipolar I and II, panic disorder with/without agoraphobia, social phobia, specific phobia, substance use disorder, and personality disorders (avoidant, dependent, obsessive-compulsive, paranoid, schizoid, and antisocial).
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Anxiety disorders are associated with an increased risk of death with a natural mortality rate ratio of 1.39 (95% CI 1.28–1.51) and an unnatural mortality rate ratio of 2.46 (95% CI 2.20–2.73).

The third wave survey of the Anhui study

The methods employed in the different wave surveys of the Anhui study have been described previously. In brief, in 2001–2003 we examined a random sample of 3336 men and women aged ≤ 60 years in urban and rural Anhui, China (wave 1) using the standard GMS method. After completing the wave 2 interview in the year following the baseline investigation, we carried out the third wave survey during 2007–2009 and successfully re-interviewed 1757 participants, obtaining a response rate of 82.4% of surviving cohort members. The third wave interview protocol was similar to that in the four-province study mentioned above, and was described in a previous publication.

Assessment of dementia syndromes

A computer program-assisted diagnosis system, the Automated Geriatric Examination for Computer Assisted Taxonomy (AGECAT), was used to analyse the information from the GMS to identify the principal mental disorders in the study participants. AGECAT was developed using a theoretical model and tested on sample populations diagnosed by psychiatrists. It first attempts to replicate the process by which a psychiatrist diagnoses a syndrome, and then offers a differential diagnosis. GMS symptoms are combined into 150 'symptom components'. In stage I, the symptom components are assembled into groups that characterise the major symptoms of each syndrome. The scores on these individual groups determine the confidence of the diagnosis of the syndrome level. Thus the system uses both quantitative and qualitative measures to determine levels of confidence and utilises numerous clinical decisions to allocate symptom components to syndrome levels. Levels of confidence of diagnosis (0–5) for individual participants are assigned for each of the eight diagnostic syndromes: organic disorder, depression, mania, schizophrenia and paranoia, obsession, phobia, hypochondria, and general anxiety. In stage II the various syndrome levels are compared with each other to derive a final differential diagnosis and a level of confidence of diagnosis (0–5). A level of ≥ 3 in most circumstances designates a 'case level', which corresponds with what psychiatrists usually recognise as 'a case for intervention' for organic mental disorder. The GMS-AGECAT diagnosis has been validated in a variety of populations, including older Chinese populations.

### Psychological characteristics in patients with chronic complex regional pain syndrome: comparisons with patients with major depressive disorder and other types of chronic pain [^d761bcbb]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Psychological Characteristics

The mean MMPI-2 scale scores of the four groups (408 participants; CRPS, other chronic pain, MDD, and normal control groups) are presented in Table 2. As shown in Figure 2, mean scores > 65T, which implies the possibility of clinically significant symptoms, were found in those with non-CRPS pain for Depression and those with MDD for Depression, Psychasthenia, and Social introversion. The results reflect significant differences among groups in psychological and psychopathological characteristics. Post hoc analyses revealed that the CRPS group scored significantly higher on the Lie (p = 0.004) and Correction (p = 0.003) scales than the MDD group and scored significantly higher on the Hypochondriasis (p < 0.001), Depression (p < 0.001), Hysteria (p < 0.001), Paranoia (p = 0.017), and Psychasthenia (p = 0.005) scales than the normal control group. In contrast, the CRPS group scored significantly lower on the Infrequency (p < 0.001), Depression (p < 0.001), Psychopathic deviate (p = 0.007), Paranoia (p = 0.021), Psychasthenia (p < 0.001), Schizophrenia (p < 0.001), and Social introversion (p < 0.001) scales than the MDD group. However, there were no significant differences between the two pain groups. These data suggest that the CRPS group experienced more psychosocial distress, depression, emotional sensitivity, and somatic sensitivity compared to the normal control group, but that they also experienced less anxiety, distress, and social withdrawal than the MDD group. However, the scores of the CRPS group were comparable to those of the other chronic pain group.

### The reality of at risk mental state services: a response to recent criticisms [^2b080090]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Attenuated psychotic symptoms are found in disorders such as anxiety and depression. Therefore presence of such symptoms should not indicate that a person is at risk of psychotic disorder

Individuals with anxiety and depression and attenuated psychotic symptoms (above a predefined level) will meet ARMS criteria. Such individuals may develop a psychotic disorder, persistent or recurrent mood or anxiety disorder, impaired psychosocial functioning, persistent attenuated psychotic experiences or a combination of these. They may also not develop any disorder and symptoms and functioning might resolve over time (Lin et al.). Currently it is not possible to tell which trajectory an individual will take based on baseline clinical characteristics. We have previously argued that attenuated psychotic symptoms are not all the same, and may be indicators of three different underlying processes: (a) an expression of an underlying fundamental disturbance suggesting vulnerability to a psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia; (b) clinical 'noise' around an ultimately non-psychotic syndrome and (c) transient, benign or self-limiting experiences that are not associated with distress, disability or risk of disorder (Yung et al.). Research distinguishing these subtypes and examining factors that increase or decrease risk of psychotic disorder ARMS individuals is ongoing in several multi-site studies.

Ajnakina et al. state that, 'The presence of psychotic symptoms in themselves should not be seen as an indication of the risk to making the transition' (our emphasis). This position is contrary to decades of research that ARMS criteria do predict onset of psychotic disorder and research that shows that anxiety and depression are frequently present in the prodromal phase before a first psychotic episode (Yung and McGorry). Such sentiment may result in delayed access to appropriate care for ARMS individuals, as the significance of their attenuated psychotic symptoms may not recognised.

Differential diagnosis — psychosis versus obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) notes that poor insight of obsessional thoughts can merge into overvalued ideas and even delusional thinking suggesting psychosis, that insight in children with OCD varies with anxiety and is best assessed when anxiety is minimal, and that although obsessive-compulsive symptoms may rarely herald a psychotic or schizophreniform disorder, positive or negative psychotic symptoms usually appear within the first months and obsessional ideation in these patients is often atypical.

### Insightful hallucination: psychopathology or paranormal phenomenon? [^3743fab2]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

This report describes a 26-year-old man who was so emotionally attached to his mother that the mere thought of separating from her caused immense anxiety. The death of his mother after a brief illness resulted in prolonged bereavement. However, the patient started seeing and talking to his mother after her death, which led to huge improvement in his mood and social functioning. His wife brought him in for consultation but no obvious psychopathology was detected. This gave rise to the dilemma of whether to consider this a real psychopathology and treat it, or to disregard this reported hallucination.

### Psychological pathways to paranoia and psychotic-like experiences in daily-life: the mediating role of distinct affective disturbances [^a4ad4f43]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2022). Medium credibility.

Table 3.
Within-Person Direct and Indirect Effects of Combined Pathways From Stress and Self-esteem to PLE and Paranoia via Anxiety, Sadness, and Self-esteem

In terms of pathways from self-esteem to PLE and paranoia, both anxiety and sadness mediated these associations, but the relative contribution of sadness was larger than the contribution of anxiety in both models. In the pathway to PLE the indirect effect via sadness was of greater magnitude in ARMS than in high-schizotypy, whereas in the pathway to paranoia the indirect effect via sadness was greater in ARMS than in FEP and high-schizotypy participants.

Results of competitive reversal models examining the within-person indirect effects of pathways from PLE and paranoia to stress through anxiety, sadness, or self-esteem indicated that all the indirect effects were statistically significant when they were examined separately (supplementary table 2). Similarly, indirect effects of PLE and paranoia on self-esteem through anxiety or sadness were significant when they were examined separately. Finally, subsequent multilevel mediational analyses combining the significant within-person indirect effects of each pathway in a single model were performed (table 4). Indirect effects of PLE and paranoia on stress were significant via anxiety and self-esteem, but not via sadness. The relative contribution of anxiety was larger than the contribution of self-esteem. In both pathways, the indirect effect via anxiety was of greater magnitude in high-schizotypy than in ARMS and FEP participants, whereas the indirect effect via self-esteem was of greater magnitude in high-schizotypy than in FEP. In pathways from PLE and paranoia to self-esteem both anxiety and sadness mediated these routes, showing sadness a larger relative contribution to the models than anxiety. Differences across groups were found only in the indirect effect of PLE through sadness, which was greater in high-schizotypy than in FEP participants. Supplementary figure 1 displays a schematic representation of the main findings of the study.

### Measuring fluctuations in paranoia: validity and psychometric properties of brief state versions of the paranoia checklist [^b92ae65a]. Psychiatry Research (2016). Low credibility.

Research increasingly assesses momentary changes in paranoia in order to elucidate causal mechanisms. Observed or manipulated changes in postulated causal factors should result in fluctuations in state paranoid ideation. Previous studies often employed a state-adapted Paranoia Checklist (Freeman et al., 2005) to measure state paranoia. This study examined whether the Paranoia Checklist or subsets of its items are appropriate for this purpose. Thirteen studies (N = 860) were subjected to meta-analyses of each Paranoia Checklist item. We selected items based on (1) whether they showed pre-to-post change in the expected direction and (2) whether this effect was larger in experimental vs. control conditions. All resulting item selections were cross-validated on a hold-out sample (n = 1893). Finally, we explored how much variation in paranoia was captured by the state-adapted version in a brief ambulatory assessment study (N = 32). A thirteen item State Paranoia Checklist as well as a five item and a three item Brief State Paranoia Checklist were extracted. Cross validation revealed better model fit and increased sensitivity to change. Multilevel analysis indicated 25–30% of the variance in the Brief State Paranoia Checklists to be due to intra-individual daily fluctuations in paranoia. Our analyses produced reliable and valid revised scales. Increases in change sensitivity indicate that future assessment of state paranoia in experimental and ambulatory assessment studies can be optimized by using the revised scales.

### Virtual-reality cognitive behavior therapy versus cognitive behavior therapy for paranoid ideation: a pragmatic, single-blind, multicenter randomized clinical superiority trial [^44a861f1]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Virtual reality (VR) may improve psychological treatments for psychotic disorders. We investigated the effects of VR-based cognitive behavior therapy for paranoid ideation (VR-CBTp) compared to standard CBTp.

Methods

We conducted a pragmatic, single-blind, randomized clinical trial in seven mental health centers across the Netherlands and Belgium. A total of 98 participants with a psychotic spectrum disorder and paranoid ideation were randomized to a maximum of 16 sessions of VR-CBTp (n = 48) or CBTp (n = 50). The primary outcome was momentary paranoia, measured with the experience sampling method (ESM) at posttreatment. Secondary measures, assessed at baseline, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up, included symptoms (paranoia, hallucination, depression, cognition, and anxiety related), social functioning, self-esteem, and schemes.

Results

Both groups showed reductions in momentary paranoia between baseline and posttreatment (n = 56, b = -15.0, effect size [ES] = 0.65), but those were greater for VR-CBT (interaction b = 8.3, ES = 0.62). Reductions remained at follow-up (n = 50, b = -10.7, ES = 0.57) but not the interaction. Limited ESM compliance resulted in data loss; however, secondary paranoia measures did confirm improvements (ES range = 0.66–1.15, n = 78–81), but not the interaction. Both groups improved in symptoms, self-esteem, and social functioning. Interaction effects in favor of VR-CBTp were found for safety behavior, depression, and self-esteem at posttreatment, and self-esteem and anxiety at follow-up. For VR-CBTp, 37.5% did not complete treatment; for CBTp, this was 24.0%. Completers, on average, received 12.7 (VR-CBTp: standard deviation [SD] = 3.9) and 15.1 (CBTp: SD = 2.5) sessions.

Conclusions

Both CBTp and VR-CBTp are efficacious treatments for paranoid ideation, but VR-CBTp may be somewhat more effective. Limitations concern missing primary outcome data and a lower sample size than anticipated.

### Psychological characteristics in patients with chronic complex regional pain syndrome: comparisons with patients with major depressive disorder and other types of chronic pain [^e2f00642]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study investigated psychological characteristics of patients with chronic complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and examined relationships between psychosocial factors and pain severity.

Methods

In total, 76 patients with CRPS, 95 patients with other types of chronic pain, 171 healthy controls, and 66 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) were included. Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-2) profiles and scores on the Beck Depression Inventory and State–Trait Anxiety Inventory were calculated. Pain intensity was measured using a visual analog scale (VAS).

Results

Patients with CRPS scored higher on the Hypochondriasis (Hs), Depression (D), Hysteria (Hy), Paranoia (Pa), and Psychasthenia (Pt) scales of the MMPI-2 compared to healthy controls. The CRPS group scored lower on the D, Psychopathic deviate (Pd), Pa, Pt, Schizophrenia (Sc), and Social introversion (Si) scales compared to the MDD group. Although CRPS patients reported higher levels of pain than patients with other types of pain, the MMPI profiles of the two pain groups did not differ significantly. Linear regression analyses revealed that pain severity was significantly associated with depression and scores on the Masculinity–Femininity (Mf) scale.

Conclusion

This is the first comparative study of the psychological characteristics of chronic CRPS patients, healthy controls, and patients with MDD. The neurotic profiles of CRPS patients were more psychologically adaptable than were those of patients with MDD; however, this profile was shared by both pain groups. The present findings further showed that, although pain severity was not a major contributor to depression, patients with CRPS should be evaluated for depressive symptoms.

Stimulant withdrawal — management to support engagement notes that treating symptoms of stimulant withdrawal may help supporting ongoing treatment engagement, and post-acute symptoms of stimulant withdrawal — which include depression, anxiety, insomnia, and paranoia — can last for weeks to months; it is important to assess for and treat these symptoms to reduce the risk for decompensation and return to stimulant use.

### Anxiety comorbidity in schizophrenia [^90504c0f]. Psychiatry Research (2013). Low credibility.

Diagnostic and treatment hierarchical reductionisms have led to an oversight of anxiety syndromes in schizophrenia. Nevertheless, recent data have indicated that anxiety can be a significant source of morbidity in this patient group. This paper reviews current knowledge concerning anxiety comorbidity in schizophrenia, its epidemiology, course, and treatment. A computerized search of the literature published from 1966 to July 2012 was conducted on Medline. Comorbid anxiety disorders are present in 38.3% of subjects with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The most common anxiety disorder is social phobia followed by post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. The presence and severity of symptoms of anxiety are associated with more severe clinical features and poorer outcomes. Available literature on the treatment consists primarily of case reports and open trials. Fragments of data support the notion of treating these anxiety states and syndromes as co-occurring clinical conditions with adjunctive medications and psychosocial interventions. However, additional work remains to be done on this issue before firm conclusions can be drawn.

### Efforts and expectations of pregnant women against the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic: a phenomenological study [^9a2246bd]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19 is a global threat that directly impacts people's physical well-being and mental health. The World Health Organization (WHO) assesses that COVID-19 has an alarming impact due to the level of spread and severity of the illness in the community, as indicated by a tripling of cases in all countries in early 2020 and increasing further until the end of 2020 from 221 countries with 2.2% Case Fatality Rate (CFR) mortality. In Indonesia, there were 735,124 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection in 2020, with a death rate reaching 21,944 (CFR 3%).

The increased incidence of COVID-19 infections, which seriously impact the level of illness and death, has caused community psychosocial problems, such as acute panic, anxiety, stress, obsessive behavior, paranoia, and depression. Data from 25 countries showed that 50.9% experienced anxiety, 57.4% experienced stress, and 58.6% experienced depression. Shah et al. and Ozamiz-Etxebarria et al. explained that the increase in psychological problems during the COVID-19 pandemic was due to symptoms, comorbidities, and the quarantine period.

### Computerised adaptive testing across the paranoia continuum [^7a1ae8a3]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

There are limitations. First, the results are from simulations and not the actual administration of a CAT to participants. Therefore, it is unknown whether using a computer interface may have significantly affected the results, though this seems unlikely. Second, it is possible that the patient datasets may have missed sociodemographic or clinical subgroups that could have affected the results. However, we note that we have used multiple datasets, including one dataset with a representative sample of the general population, and the results are similar across them all. Third, accuracy is not fully consistent across the paranoia continuum. We looked at the performance of the CAT across the full range of the paranoia continuum, from people who had no paranoia to people who had the severest clinical forms. Largely, the CAT worked well across the continuum. However, typical for CATand as seen in our simulation of a CAT for adolescent paranoia, it was people at the lower ends of the trait who required the most questions and for whom accuracy was the least good. Ideally, people with the least paranoia would need to answer the fewest number of questions. Nonetheless, five R-GPTS questions did produce sufficient accuracy even for those individuals. What this means is that care should be taken if using the paranoia scale's severity ranges, as differences by a point or two for people near the boundary could lead to misclassification. Such misclassification is arbitrary and would not be expected to be repeated for an individual as a different set of items would be presented. Fourth, the choice of stopping rules will affect the results. Our intent was to improve the efficiency of the assessment of paranoia, in order to contribute to a future CAT that covers multiple psychotic experiences. Therefore, CAT administration was capped at the presentation of five items. The precision of the assessment could have been improved had such a termination rule not been applied. Importantly, we would now be able to strengthen the CAT algorithm using data from these additional large datasets. Finally, the scale relies on self-report, which could introduce response bias; a proportion of people may not report accurately, and genuine threats may be inadvertently rated. However, our view is that self-report is the best means of capturing what an individual is actually thinking. Furthermore, the GPTS has been shown to correlate with interviewer-based assessments, experimental tests of paranoiaand participants' own sense that their fears are exaggerated. In other words, the scale items do predominately capture inaccurate fears.

### Cannabis use before and after metabolic and bariatric surgery: literature review [^6a0e93cc]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Cannabis and mental health disorders — evidence synthesis: A National Academies review reports moderate evidence that cannabis use is associated with increased risk for the development of depression and social anxiety disorder — but not other anxiety disorders; limited evidence links cannabis use with increased severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety symptoms, and it supported a dose-response effect on suicidality while high quality research on PTSD development or depressive disorder course was found to be lacking. Evidence appears strongest for associations with psychotic symptoms or disorders, particularly among individuals with a genetic predisposition, with a 2014 review rating the cannabis–schizophrenia relationship as "medium" and a synthesis of five fair-to-high quality reviews suggesting a "moderate to large" dose-dependent association with psychotic disorder development. Acute adverse effects — particularly among naive users — may include anxiety, paranoia, suicidal thoughts, and/or panic, are likely exacerbated by higher tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content, may account for up to 25–30% of cannabis-related emergency department visits, and anxiety and depression may also be reported with cannabis withdrawal.

### Pandemic paranoia in the general population: international prevalence and sociodemographic profile [^64bc5125]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Lastly, to examine the sociodemographic profile of pandemic paranoia, we calculated Pearson correlations (for continuous sociodemographic predictors) and Cohen's d (for dichotomous predictors) within each site to establish site-specific demographic profiles. Next, we integrated the results using random-effects models to average a general profile. Additionally, we used stepwise linear regression to test the effects of global and site-specific sociodemographic factors after controlling for the effects of site and general paranoia.

### Characterization of psychotic experiences in adolescence using the specific psychotic experiences questionnaire: findings from a study of 5000 16-year-old twins [^d7d437ec]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

Quantitative Variation in Psychotic Experiences

Categorical assessments of presence/absence of psychotic experiences in adolescence may not reflect the underlying phenotypes, which appear to be continuous in the general population. Specific psychotic experiences in 16-year olds showed considerable quantitative variation, in line with previous reports. All items were endorsed to some degree by individuals in the sample. Whether psychosis is best considered a quantitative phenotype(s) related to traits or experiences in the general population, or a categorical phenotype, qualitatively distinct to typical development, or something in between — such as discontinuous subpopulations — is much-debated. Empirical data are needed to help ascertain which model is most useful for research and clinical practice. Our data support the proposal that psychotic experiences in the adolescent general population comprise multiple, distinct, quantitative traits. Further longitudinal follow-up of this sample will inform whether these distinct traits become more coherent over time. Compared to previous research on adolescents, the SPEQ measure included a wider range of experiences in its scales. For example, the paranoia subscale asked about both mild suspicions all the way to fears of conspiracies.

Measurement Properties

The SPEQ is a new questionnaire battery that assesses 6 psychotic experience domains. These domains had good internal consistency and were stable over time. Positive skew, a common feature of measures of psychopathology, was present in 4 of the domains (paranoia, hallucinations, grandiosity, and parent-rated negative symptoms). Validity of the positive SPEQ subscales was supported given their agreement with PLIKS. Females reported more positive psychotic experiences (with exception of grandiosity) and males had higher scores on grandiosity, anhedonia, and parent-rated negative symptoms, which are analogous results to those from CAPE. Just as there is high comorbidity between adulthood psychosis with affective disorders such as depression and anxiety disorders, there was also a close relationship between SPEQ and affective traits. Variance in paranoia, hallucinations, cognitive disorganization, and parent-rated negative symptoms was shared partly with traits of anxiety, depression, and neuroticism, as reported elsewhere.SPEQ did not appear to be simply a measure of the main personality dimensions. However, grandiosity and anhedonia shared no or little variance with these traits, suggesting the link with traits of emotional disorders are not present across all specific psychotic experiences (see also Barragan and colleagues).

### Amantadine (Gocovri) [^56ad4b95]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hallucinations/Psychotic Behavior

Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with GOCOVRI because of the risk of exacerbating psychosis. In controlled trials, the incidence of patients who experienced visual hallucinations, auditory hallucinations, delusions, illusions, or paranoia was 25% in patients treated with GOCOVRI 274 mg, and 3% in placebo-treated patients. Hallucinations caused discontinuation of treatment in 8% of GOCOVRI-treated patients, and in 0% of placebo-treated patients.

Observe patients for the occurrence of hallucinations throughout treatment, especially at initiation, and after dose increases.

5.4 Dizziness and Orthostatic Hypotension

In controlled clinical trials, 29% of GOCOVRI-treated patients and 2% of placebo-treated patients experienced dizziness, syncope, orthostatic hypotension, presyncope, postural dizziness or hypotension. In GOCOVRI-treated patients, 3% discontinued study treatment because of dizziness, postural dizziness, or syncope, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients.

Monitor patients for dizziness and orthostatic hypotension, especially after starting GOCOVRI or increasing the dose. Concomitant use of alcohol when using GOCOVRI is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].

5.5 Withdrawal-Emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion

A symptom complex resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in drugs that increase central dopaminergic tone.

Abrupt discontinuation of GOCOVRI may cause an increase in the symptoms of Parkinson's disease or cause delirium, agitation, delusions, hallucinations, paranoid reaction, stupor, anxiety, depression, or slurred speech. It is recommended to avoid sudden discontinuation of GOCOVRI [see Dosing Information (2.4)].

### Anxiety disorders and schizophrenia [^5b4c979e]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2004). Low credibility.

Anxiety symptoms and disorders have long been described in schizophrenia. This article reviews the epidemiology, phenomenology, and neurobiologic underpinnings of comorbid anxiety symptoms and disorders in schizophrenia. Recent literature was obtained by Medline searches using key words relating to schizophrenia and anxiety symptoms or disorders. There is some evidence that anxiety may be a core symptom dimension in schizophrenia, although further work is required. There is evidence that comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and social anxiety disorder are all more common than expected by chance in schizophrenia, although additional work is needed to determine the mechanisms that underlie these associations and their clinical implications. In the interim, however, the data emphasize the importance of assessing and treating comorbid anxiety symptoms and disorders in schizophrenia.

### Pseudoneurotic symptoms in the schizophrenia spectrum: an empirical study [^c867f42d]. Schizophrenia Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Nonpsychotic symptoms (depression, anxiety, obsessions etc.) are frequent in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Twentieth century foundational psychopathological literature claimed that certain nonpsychotic symptoms (here termed pseudoneurotic symptoms) are relatively closely linked with the schizophrenia-spectrum, despite descriptive overlap with symptoms of other diagnoses. In this study, we investigated the association of pseudoneurotic and other nonpsychotic symptoms with the schizophrenia-spectrum as well as a hypothesis about an association of pseudoneurotic symptoms with disorder of basic self.

Methods

The sample (N = 226) comprised patients with non-affective psychosis (N = 119), schizotypal personality disorder (N = 51) and other mental illness (N = 56), who were examined with a comprehensive assessment of lifetime psychopathology. Informed by the literature, we constructed scales targeting pseudoneurotic symptoms and other, more general, nonpsychotic symptoms.

Results

Pseudoneurotic symptoms aggregated significantly in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders with an Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.84 (SE 0.03) for classifying patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders versus other mental illness. Patients with non-affective psychosis scored slightly, but significantly, higher on the scale targeting general nonpsychotic symptomatology than the other groups. In multiple regression analysis, pseudoneurotic symptoms were predicted by general nonpsychotic symptoms, disorders of basic self, and negative symptoms but not positive symptoms.

Conclusion

The study supports that certain neurotic-like symptoms with specific descriptive features (pseudoneurotic symptoms) are associated with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. It suggests that pseudoneurotic symptoms are linked with temporally stable schizophrenia psychopathology (disorder of basic self and negative symptoms).

### Prioritization of psychopathological symptoms and clinical characterization in psychiatric diagnoses: a narrative review [^a89679e9]. JAMA Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Psychiatry mainly deals with conditions that are mediated by brain function but are not directly attributable to specific brain abnormalities. Given the lack of concrete biological markers, such as laboratory tests or imaging results, the development of diagnostic systems is difficult.

Observations

This narrative review evaluated 9 diagnostic approaches. The validity of the DSM and the International Classification of Disorders (ICD) is limited. The Research Domain Criteria is a research framework, not a diagnostic system. The clinical utility of the quantitatively derived, dimensional Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology is questionable. The Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual Version 2 follows psychoanalytic theory and focuses on personality. Unlike the personality assessments in ICD-11 or DSM-5's alternative model, based on pathological extremes of the big 5 traits (extraversion, agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism), it lacks foundation in empirical evidence. Network analytic approaches are intriguing, but their complexity makes them difficult to implement. Staging would be easier if individually predictive biological markers were available. The problem with all these new approaches is that they abstract patient experiences into higher-order constructs, potentially obscuring individual symptoms so much that they no longer reflect patients' actual problems.

Conclusions and Relevance

ICD and DSM diagnoses can be questioned, but the reality of psychopathological symptoms, such as hallucinations, depression, anxiety, compulsions, and the suffering stemming from them, cannot. Therefore, it may be advisable to primarily describe patients according to the psychopathological symptoms they present, and any resulting personal syndromes, embedded in a framework of contextual clinical characterization including personality assessment and staging. The DSM and ICD are necessary for reimbursement, but they should be simplified and merged. A primarily psychopathological symptoms-based, clinical characterization approach would be multidimensional and clinically useful, because it would lead to problem-oriented treatment and support transdiagnostic research. It should be based on a universally used instrument to assess psychopathology and structured clinical characterization.

### Virtual reality-based versus standard cognitive behavioral therapy for paranoia in schizophrenia spectrum disorders: a randomized controlled trial [^f5da1b5a]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Our study may have encountered a 'floor effect' on the primary outcome measure, the GPTS subscale Ideas of Persecution. Posttreatment mean scores in our sample ranged from 29.2 to 30.8, which is comparable to the mean score of 28.7 reported previously by Freeman et al.in a sample with nonpsychotic mental health conditions, and notably lower than the scores of 38.1 and 58.7 observed in individuals with psychotic disorders and persecutory delusions in the same study. Furthermore, our R-GPTS subscale scores for Ideas of Persecution remained at or below 8.7 across all posttreatment time points for both groups. This should be considered in light of the recommendation by Freeman et al.that a score of ≥ 11 is used to differentiate cases with persecutory delusions from nonclinical cases. Given these benchmarks, further symptom reduction on the GPTS or R-GPTS in our SSD population appears unlikely, reinforcing the possibility of a floor effect limiting additional treatment-related gains.

Regarding our secondary outcome measures, we unexpectedly found CBTp to outperform VR-CBTp on specific secondary outcomes, ERT overall latency and sadness accuracy at follow-up. This finding is counterintuitive as facial emotion recognition was not a target in CBTp, and the hypothesis was that VR-CBTp would yield greater benefits in social cognitive aspects, as VR enabled more social encounters (that is, encounters with avatars displaying different emotions). Only 2 out of 28 ERT measurements showed a statistically significant between-group difference, suggesting the possibility that these findings may be due to chance.

Taken together, these findings carry implications for clinical practice and regulatory evaluation. Although VR-CBTp may enhance certain therapeutic processes such as engagement and therapist control over stimuli, our study does not support its superiority over CBTp in clinical outcomes for paranoia. This underscores the need for further research into whether VR-CBTp can be optimized in its delivery to enhance efficacy, and it highlights the need to consider other factors such as cognitive interventions, therapeutic allianceand patient preferences, all of which may influence treatment outcomes. Therefore, VR-CBTp should be considered as a complementary or alternative option, particularly in contexts where CBTp is less feasible or less effective such as in patients with prominent negative symptoms or severe avoidance due to paranoid anxiety. In such cases, VR-CBTp may improve access or adherence, while offering comparable clinical efficacy.

### An examination of intolerance of uncertainty in schizophrenia [^c516aaba]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

In relation to IU and psychotic symptoms, a recent systematic review by Morriss, Butler, and Ellett identified 10 studies in the extant literature examining their associations. They reported mixed findings across studies in terms of the proportion of significant and non‐significant effects, with the clearest evidence for higher IU being associated with paranoia, replicated in a more recent community study (Morriss, Gaudiano, et al.). Notably, only five studies were identified in their review that used a clinical psychosis sample to investigate correlations between IU and symptoms, and there were no studies assessing differences between diagnosed schizophrenia and control samples. Researchers have postulated that the impact of IU on worry and anxiety might lead to higher vulnerability to psychotic symptoms. One of the earliest studies (White and Gumley) reported a correlation between higher IU and higher distress related to experiencing psychosis, as well as negative beliefs about positive symptoms of auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions. The authors speculated that IU may increase people's vulnerability to developing negative beliefs about hallucinations and delusions as they are more likely to experience negative affect or anxiety due to the uncertainty of experiencing those symptoms. Information about oneself, others or the world from positive symptoms might also be incongruent with some external/environmental information and lead to beliefs that are not consistent with observations, for example, persecutory delusions in the absence of verifiable threat. In addition, IU may lead to overestimating the threats of experiencing hallucinations and delusions that are uncertain in nature. Startup et al. proposed that IU may be related to delusions via increased worry. They reported significant associations between higher IU, increased worry and the experience of delusions; however, the link between IU and anxiety symptoms was not significant. A study (Sedighi et al.) on the link between IU and schizophrenia examined its associations with positive and negative symptoms, along with other transdiagnostic factors. The authors reported significant associations between higher IU and positive, negative, general and total scores of psychotic symptoms measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS; Kay et al.). However, it is still unclear whether these associations remain significant once other symptoms and factors related to schizophrenia are controlled for such as depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, intellectual abilities or rumination.

Neuropsychiatric Symptoms and Suicide Risk in Smoking Cessation Treatment: Although WELLBUTRIN XL is not indicated for smoking cessation treatment, it contains the same active ingredient as ZYBAN which is approved for this use. Patients should be informed that quitting smoking, with or without ZYBAN, may be associated with nicotine withdrawal symptoms (including depression or agitation), or exacerbation of pre-existing psychiatric illness. Furthermore some patients have experienced changes in mood (including depression and mania), psychosis, hallucinations, paranoia, delusions, homicidal ideation, aggression, anxiety, and panic, as well as suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and completed suicide when attempting to quit smoking while taking ZYBAN. If patients develop agitation, hostility, depressed mood, or changes in thinking or behavior that are not typical for them, or if patients develop suicidal ideation or behavior, they should be urged to report these symptoms to their healthcare provider immediately
