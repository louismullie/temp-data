## Question

Why are the findings of this hydroxychloroquine postexposure prophylaxis trial important for shaping COVID-19 PEP strategies?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why the findings of the hydroxychloroquine postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) trial are important for shaping COVID-19 PEP strategies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which specific trial is being referenced and whether it is the pivotal randomized controlled trial. Then, I should verify the core efficacy and safety results. Next, I will appraise the study quality and limitations. After that, I should integrate these findings with broader evidence and guidelines. Finally, I will translate this into practical implications for PEP strategies and highlight what would change the conclusion if new data emerged.

> Let me first confirm the trial identity. The most influential PEP trial is the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study by Boulware et al. published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which enrolled 821 asymptomatic adults with high- or moderate-risk exposure to COVID-19 and assigned them to hydroxychloroquine or placebo within 4 days of exposure, with a 5-day regimen and 14-day follow-up for symptomatic illness or PCR-confirmed infection [^114KEKE3] [^111HhnJo].

> I need to check the primary efficacy outcome carefully. The trial found no significant difference in incident COVID-19 illness: 11.8% with hydroxychloroquine versus 14.3% with placebo, an absolute difference of −2.4 percentage points with a 95% CI that crossed zero, indicating no statistically significant benefit, and the authors concluded hydroxychloroquine did not prevent illness after exposure [^114KEKE3] [^113BjiSq].

> Wait, let me verify the safety signal because that often shifts the risk–benefit calculus in prophylaxis. Adverse events were substantially more frequent with hydroxychloroquine than placebo, 40.1% versus 16.8%, driven largely by gastrointestinal symptoms, and while no serious adverse events were reported in this trial, the excess adverse effects without offsetting benefit argue against routine use in exposed but asymptomatic individuals [^114KEKE3] [^113BjiSq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about generalizability without checking limitations. The median time from exposure to first dose was about 2 days, so delays may have reduced efficacy if a narrow post-exposure window exists, and the population was relatively young and healthy, which could limit detection of modest effects or underestimate harm in older adults or those with comorbidities; nonetheless, the trial was well-conducted, double-blind, and adequately powered for the primary endpoint, strengthening confidence in the null result [^114KEKE3] [^113BjiSq].

> Next, I should review how this fits with the broader evidence base. A cluster-randomized trial in Spain likewise found no reduction in PCR-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 with hydroxychloroquine PEP, and pre-exposure prophylaxis trials in healthcare workers also failed to show benefit, while systematic reviews and meta-analyses conclude that hydroxychloroquine does not meaningfully reduce infection risk and increases adverse events, reinforcing the absence of a prophylactic effect across settings [^115NDrQZ] [^115TBFDY] [^115Mm9cC] [^111MF1K8] [^1163FytM].

> I should confirm guideline positions to ensure alignment. The Infectious Diseases Society of America issues a strong recommendation against hydroxychloroquine for post-exposure prophylaxis based on moderate-certainty evidence showing trivial or no benefit and increased adverse effects, and the WHO living guideline similarly recommends against hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis in people without COVID-19, reflecting convergent high-quality evidence and consensus judgments about net clinical value [^115BsdrY] [^112iPQzz] [^1139y1qp] [^1157XAY3].

> Let me consider mechanistic plausibility and whether translational data contradict the clinical findings. In vitro antiviral activity has not translated into in vivo benefit in humans, and in nonhuman primates, hydroxychloroquine neither reduced viral load nor prevented infection when used as pre-exposure prophylaxis, which helps reconcile the disconnect between laboratory signals and clinical outcomes and supports the inference that clinically relevant antiviral activity is absent in PEP contexts [^11238d4G].

> I will now examine the practical implications for PEP strategies. These findings shift practice away from hydroxychloroquine PEP and toward nonpharmacologic measures and, where appropriate, evidence-supported alternatives such as vaccination and, in select high-risk exposed individuals, monoclonal antibodies or antivirals per evolving guidance, while emphasizing that repurposed drugs like hydroxychloroquine should not be used outside trials given the lack of benefit and potential harms, including QT effects and drug–drug interactions [^115BsdrY] [^1139y1qp] [^116z98xm].

> But wait, what if new data emerge that could overturn this conclusion. I should double-check what would change practice: a large, well-conducted RCT demonstrating a clinically meaningful reduction in infection or severe outcomes with acceptable safety, or a meta-analysis with consistent benefit across diverse populations and low heterogeneity would be required; given the weight of negative RCTs and guidelines, the bar for changing recommendations is high, and current evidence does not support hydroxychloroquine PEP [^115BsdrY] [^1139y1qp].

> In summary, the Boulware NEJM trial and corroborating studies establish that hydroxychloroquine PEP does not prevent COVID-19 after exposure and increases adverse effects, leading major guidelines to recommend against its use; this shapes PEP strategies by closing the chapter on hydroxychloroquine and directing clinicians toward nonpharmacologic prevention and evidence-based pharmacologic options with proven benefit, reserving hydroxychloroquine for approved indications rather than COVID-19 prophylaxis [^114KEKE3] [^115BsdrY] [^1139y1qp].

The hydroxychloroquine post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) trial shows **no benefit** in preventing COVID-19 after exposure [^114KEKE3] and a **higher rate of adverse effects** than placebo [^111MF1K8]. This high-quality RCT, along with other trials and meta-analyses [^115NDrQZ] [^111MF1K8], led IDSA and WHO to issue **strong recommendations against HCQ PEP** [^115BsdrY] [^1139y1qp]. The findings shift PEP strategies away from HCQ and toward evidence-based options like vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and antivirals, and highlight the need for rigorous trials to test future prophylaxis candidates [^1139y1qp].

## Key findings of the hydroxychloroquine PEP trial

- **No efficacy**: HCQ did not reduce the incidence of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or compatible illness within 14 days (11.8% vs 14.3% with placebo; absolute difference −2.4 percentage points; 95% CI −7.0 to 2.2; P = 0.35) [^114KEKE3].

- **More adverse effects**: HCQ increased adverse events (40.1% vs 16.8% with placebo), mainly gastrointestinal symptoms and dizziness, though no serious adverse events were reported [^114KEKE3].

- **Timely dosing**: The regimen started within 4 days of exposure, addressing concerns that delays could blunt efficacy [^114KEKE3].

---

## Comparison with other studies and meta-analyses

| **Study type** | **Key findings** |
|-|-|
| Cluster RCT (Mitjà et al.) | No reduction in symptomatic COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 transmission with HCQ PEP; more adverse events with HCQ [^115NDrQZ] |
| Pre-exposure prophylaxis RCTs | No reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers with HCQ [^115TBFDY] [^115Mm9cC] |
| Living WHO meta-analysis | HCQ has little or no effect on infection, hospitalization, or mortality; increases adverse events and discontinuations [^111MF1K8] |
| IDSA guideline | Strong recommendation against HCQ PEP based on moderate-certainty evidence of no benefit and increased adverse effects [^115BsdrY] |

---

## Clinical implications and guideline recommendations

- **IDSA**: Strong recommendation against HCQ PEP for COVID-19 exposure [^115BsdrY] [^112iPQzz].

- **WHO**: Strong recommendation against HCQ prophylaxis in individuals without COVID-19 [^1139y1qp] [^1157XAY3].

- **Shift in strategy**: Emphasis on vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and antivirals for PEP, with HCQ removed from recommended options [^1139y1qp].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Generalizability**: Participants were mostly younger, healthy adults; effects in older adults or those with comorbidities may differ [^114KEKE3].

- **Timing**: Despite initiation within 4 days, a narrower window may exist for optimal effect, which this study could not capture [^114KEKE3].

- **Dosing**: The tested regimen may not reflect the pharmacokinetic profile needed for prophylaxis, though higher doses raise safety concerns [^113HQzso].

---

## Impact on future research and policy

- **Deprioritization**: HCQ is no longer a research priority for COVID-19 prophylaxis [^1139y1qp].

- **Methodological lessons**: Highlights the need for rigorous RCTs with adequate power, clear endpoints, and appropriate populations [^117MUG1T].

- **Policy shift**: Resources should focus on more promising prophylactic candidates and evidence-based interventions [^1139y1qp].

---

The hydroxychloroquine PEP trial demonstrates **no benefit and more adverse effects**, prompting strong guidelines against its use and redirecting PEP strategies toward effective, evidence-based options. This underscores the importance of high-quality trials to guide practice and policy.

### Hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection: a randomized trial [^111HhnJo]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Effective prevention against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is currently limited to nonpharmaceutical strategies. Laboratory and observational data suggested that hydroxychloroquine had biological activity against SARS-CoV-2, potentially permitting its use for prevention.

Objective

To test hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Design

Household-randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of hydroxychloroquine postexposure prophylaxis. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04328961).

Setting

National U.S. multicenter study.

Participants

Close contacts recently exposed (< 96 hours) to persons with diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Intervention

Hydroxychloroquine (400 mg/d for 3 days followed by 200 mg/d for 11 days) or ascorbic acid (500 mg/d followed by 250 mg/d) as a placebo-equivalent control.

Measurements

Participants self-collected mid-turbinate swabs daily (days 1 to 14) for SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. The primary outcome was PCR-confirmed incident SARS-CoV-2 infection among persons who were SARS-CoV-2 negative at enrollment.

Results

Between March and August 2020, 671 households were randomly assigned: 337 (407 participants) to the hydroxychloroquine group and 334 (422 participants) to the control group. Retention at day 14 was 91%, and 10724 of 11606 (92%) expected swabs were tested. Among the 689 (89%) participants who were SARS-CoV-2 negative at baseline, there was no difference between the hydroxychloroquine and control groups in SARS-CoV-2 acquisition by day 14 (53 versus 45 events; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.73 to 1.66]; P > 0.20). The frequency of participants experiencing adverse events was higher in the hydroxychloroquine group than the control group (66 [16.2%] versus 46 [10.9%], respectively; P = 0.026).

Limitation

The delay between exposure, and then baseline testing and the first dose of hydroxychloroquine or ascorbic acid, was a median of 2 days.

Conclusion

This rigorous randomized controlled trial among persons with recent exposure excluded a clinically meaningful effect of hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### A randomized trial of hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis for COVID-19 [^114KEKE3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) occurs after exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). For persons who are exposed, the standard of care is observation and quarantine. Whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent symptomatic infection after SARS-CoV-2 exposure is unknown.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial across the United States and parts of Canada testing hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis. We enrolled adults who had household or occupational exposure to someone with confirmed Covid-19 at a distance of less than 6 ft for more than 10 minutes while wearing neither a face mask nor an eye shield (high-risk exposure) or while wearing a face mask but no eye shield (moderate-risk exposure). Within 4 days after exposure, we randomly assigned participants to receive either placebo or hydroxychloroquine (800 mg once, followed by 600 mg in 6 to 8 hours, then 600 mg daily for 4 additional days). The primary outcome was the incidence of either laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 or illness compatible with Covid-19 within 14 days.

Results

We enrolled 821 asymptomatic participants. Overall, 87.6% of the participants (719 of 821) reported a high-risk exposure to a confirmed Covid-19 contact. The incidence of new illness compatible with Covid-19 did not differ significantly between participants receiving hydroxychloroquine (49 of 414 [11.8%]) and those receiving placebo (58 of 407 [14.3%]); the absolute difference was -2.4 percentage points (95% confidence interval, -7.0 to 2.2; P = 0.35). Side effects were more common with hydroxychloroquine than with placebo (40.1% vs. 16.8%), but no serious adverse reactions were reported.

Conclusions

After high-risk or moderate-risk exposure to Covid-19, hydroxychloroquine did not prevent illness compatible with Covid-19 or confirmed infection when used as postexposure prophylaxis within 4 days after exposure.

### Efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine vs placebo for pre-exposure SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis among health care workers: a randomized clinical trial [^116nNZuy]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

Among hospital-based HCWs at high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, hydroxychloroquine, 600 mg, daily, for 8 weeks did not reduce the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with placebo. Our findings are consistent with what is to our knowledge the only other randomized COVID-19 prophylaxis trial published to date. In that study, Boulware et alrandomized 821 asymptomatic adults to hydroxychloroquine or placebo following a postexposure prophylaxis strategy in which participants self-identified as having a significant exposure and were treated with a 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine or placebo. The treatment protocol allowed for therapy initiation up to 4 days after exposure; more than 50% of participants started taking medication 3 to 4 days after exposure. This time variability prompted a critiquethat delayed initiation of hydroxychloroquine may have missed a key biologic window to prevent transmission. We elected to follow a pre-exposure prophylaxis strategy under the presumption that (1) prevention might depend on the timing of therapy, and (2) clear identification of a true exposure likely to result in transmission is challenging.

Our study also differed from the work of Boulware et alregarding SARS-CoV-2 testing. Following a pragmatic study design, there was a paucity of viral testing at either study initiation or at the time of the primary outcome (laboratory-confirmed transmission or illness compatible with COVID-19). Fewer than 25% of participants with a positive primary outcome had laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, participants may have become SARS-CoV-2 positive while remaining asymptomatic (contributing to type II error), or participants may have contracted another viral illness resulting in fever or cough that was not COVID-19 (contributing to type I error). By contrast, in our study, all participants had baseline SARS-CoV-2 testing and were excluded if found to have a positive result, and our primary outcome was defined as laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

IDSA COVID-19 guidelines — post-exposure prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ): The panel made an explicit decision that the primary outcome driving the decision for any post-exposure prophylaxis is the ability to prevent infection; when the evidence demonstrates a very low likelihood of effective post-exposure prophylaxis, other outcomes become secondary; and when healthy persons are considered for preventive medications (such as would occur in post-exposure settings), a higher threshold for benefits is required and (even putative) harms become more important. The panel agreed that the overall certainty of the evidence against prophylaxis treatment with HCQ was moderate (failure to prevent infection) due to concerns with imprecision, and the panel balanced the lack of clear benefit with the increased risk of harms from the body of evidence reported in the treatment section, in addition to the side effects reported in the trials to make a strong recommendation. The guideline panel recommended against the use of HCQ as post-exposure prophylactic treatment for persons exposed to COVID-19.

### A cluster-randomized trial of hydroxychloroquine for prevention of COVID-19 [^115NDrQZ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Current strategies for preventing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are limited to nonpharmacologic interventions. Hydroxychloroquine has been proposed as a postexposure therapy to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), but definitive evidence is lacking.

Methods

We conducted an open-label, cluster-randomized trial involving asymptomatic contacts of patients with polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR)-confirmed Covid-19 in Catalonia, Spain. We randomly assigned clusters of contacts to the hydroxychloroquine group (which received the drug at a dose of 800 mg once, followed by 400 mg daily for 6 days) or to the usual-care group (which received no specific therapy). The primary outcome was PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19 within 14 days. The secondary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined by symptoms compatible with Covid-19 or a positive PCR test regardless of symptoms. Adverse events were assessed for up to 28 days.

Results

The analysis included 2314 healthy contacts of 672 index case patients with Covid-19 who were identified between March 17 and April 28, 2020. A total of 1116 contacts were randomly assigned to receive hydroxychloroquine and 1198 to receive usual care. Results were similar in the hydroxychloroquine and usual-care groups with respect to the incidence of PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19 (5.7% and 6.2%, respectively; risk ratio, 0.86 [95% confidence interval, 0.52 to 1.42]). In addition, hydroxychloroquine was not associated with a lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission than usual care (18.7% and 17.8%, respectively). The incidence of adverse events was higher in the hydroxychloroquine group than in the usual-care group (56.1% vs. 5.9%), but no treatment-related serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusions

Postexposure therapy with hydroxychloroquine did not prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection or symptomatic Covid-19 in healthy persons exposed to a PCR-positive case patient. (Funded by the crowdfunding campaign YoMeCorono and others; BCN-PEP-CoV2 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04304053.).

### Prophylaxis for COVID-19: a systematic review [^1163FytM]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

While the landscape of vaccine and treatment candidates against the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reviewed systematically, prophylactic candidates remain unexplored.

Objectives

To map pre- and postexposure prophylactic (PrEP and PEP) candidate for COVID-19.

Data Sources

PubMed/Medline, Embase, International Committee of Medical Journal Editors and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform clinical trial registries and medRxiv.

Study Eligibility Criteria and Participants

All studies in humans or animals and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in humans reporting primary data on prophylactic candidates against COVID-19, excluding studies focused on key populations.

Interventions

PrEP and PEP candidate for COVID-19.

Methods

Systematic review and qualitative synthesis of COVID-19 PrEP and PEP studies and RCTs complemented by search of medRxiv and PubMed and Embase for studies reporting RCT outcomes since systematic review search completion.

Results

We identified 13 studies (from 2119 database records) and 117 RCTs (from 5565 RCTs listed in the registries) that met the inclusion criteria. Non-RCT studies reported on cross-sectional studies using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in humans (n = 2) or reported on animal studies (n = 7), most of which used antibodies. All five completed RCTs focused on the use of HCQ as either PrEP or PEP, and these and the cross-sectional studies reported no prophylactic effect. The majority of ongoing RCTs evaluated HCQ or other existing candidates including non-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines, anti(retro)virals or use of vitamins and supplements.

Conclusions

The key message from completed studies and RCTs seems to be that HCQ does not work. There is little evidence regarding other compounds, with all RCTs using candidates other than HCQ still ongoing. It remains to be seen if the portfolio of existing molecules being evaluated in RCTs will identify successful prophylaxis against COVID-19 or if there is a need for the development of new candidates.

### Finding the dose for hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis for COVID-19: the desperate search for effectiveness [^113HQzso]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug being tested as a potential treatment for the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Although the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 remains uncertain, it may serve as a potential prophylactic agent especially in those at high risk, such as healthcare workers, household contacts of infected patients, and the immunocompromised. Our aim was to identify possible hydroxychloroquine dosing regimens through simulation in those at high risk of infections by optimizing exposures above the in vitro generated half maximal effective concentration (EC 50) and to help guide researchers in dose-selection for COVID-19 prophylactic studies. To maintain weekly troughs above EC 50 in > 50% of subjects at steady-state in a pre-exposure prophylaxis setting, an 800 mg loading dose followed by 400 mg twice or 3 times weekly is required. In an exposure driven, post-exposure prophylaxis setting, 800 mg loading dose followed in 6 hours by 600 mg, then 600 mg daily for 4 more days achieved daily troughs above EC 50 in > 50% subjects. These doses are higher than recommended for malaria chemoprophylaxis, and clinical trials are needed to establish safety and efficacy.

### The rise and fall of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 [^1166k1Wq]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Scientific consensus has now emerged that there is a lack of clinical benefit for using HCQ/CQ among hospitalized patients. Both the UK RECOVERY and the WHO SOLIDARITY trials (rate ratio: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.89–1.59) have now reported their findings on HCQ among hospitalized patients and failed to detect any benefit. On June 25, 2020, the U.S. The Food and Drug Administration announced it had revoked the emergency use authorization for HCQ and CQ. But, while enthusiasm for HCQ to treat COVID-19 has dwindled, there was a rational argument for continuing investigations of HCQ as prophylaxis or its effect in the early phase of the disease. Hydroxychloroquine has antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in laboratory studies through a number of direct molecular actions and anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, and respected voices argued that if HCQ were to play an important role, it would be in prophylaxis or early treatment of the disease, when it was primarily a viral infection stage of the disease. Several pre-exposure and postexposure prophylaxis trials have now been reported. A meta-analysis evaluating HCQ prophylaxis (both pre- and postexposure) reported a significant pooled risk reduction of 22% (95% CI: 1–39) based on four trials. Although this generated enthusiasm again that HCQ may have a role in this pandemic, updating this with two new randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of prophylaxis with nonsignificant findings changes the detected effect importantly (risk reduction 16%, 95% CI: −2 to 30).

ASSESSING THE PROPHYLACTIC ROLE OF HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE

Randomised controlled trials

The number of studies registered at ClinicalTrials.gov on HCQ as preexposure or postexposure prophylaxis for COVID-19 in at-risk, asymptomatic individuals continues to increase. As of 18 September, 75 trials are registered, with 30 of them recruiting. Most of the studies are recruiting high-risk healthcare workers without contraindications for HCQ treatment. Patients in HCQ experimental treatment arms differ both in timing and in dosing of treatment strategies. Duration indeed ranges from 1 to 6 months, most of the studies considering 2–3 months. Most of the protocols use a higher induction dose of 400–1200 mg/day before different maintenance doses. These can be divided into daily dosing schedules, ranging from 200 to a maximum of 800 mg, or weekly schedules, ranging from 200 mg every 3 weeks to 400 mg two times per week. In most studies, the main primary outcome is the difference in incidence of COVID-19 between HCQ and placebo; other outcomes include differences in the clinical expressivity and contagiousness of the disease, especially in terms of hospitalisation.

Although RCTs are optimal at reducing sources of bias when testing the effectiveness of new drugs (or new indications), the absence of scientifically established doses of HCQ for SARS-CoV-2, together with the complex pharmacokinetics of the drug, could represent major obstacles in the definitive interpretation of the results. According to a preclinical simulation, conventional schedules for malaria prevention may not be sufficient to reach plasma concentrations that would be expected to inhibit or suppress SARS-CoV-2 (EC 50 0.72 μM). Even with the FDA-approved therapeutic regimen of 800 mg loading dose followed by 400 mg/day for 3 days, only 7% of the simulations had troughs above the target 14 days after treatment initiation. Only a 800 mg loading dose, followed by 400 mg given two to three times per week, maintained weekly troughs above EC 50 in > 50% of the subjects. If higher EC 50 targets are required, safety could represent a serious issue. As an additional complication, with the tested regimens, steady-state levels of HCQ are reached after 7–8 weeks, thus implying relative long duration of treatment.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^111oeUF4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine post-exposure prophylaxis in contacts of those diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection — randomized evidence and outcomes are summarized as follows: Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported HCQ versus placebo or no additional treatment with assessment for SARS-CoV-2 at day 14; two studies required a positive test and one allowed symptoms when a test was not completed, and outcomes included hospitalization, mortality, and serious adverse events. Hydroxychloroquine appears to have trivial or no effect on the development of symptomatic infection at day 14 compared to no HCQ (RR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.77, 1.16). HCQ showed trivial or no effect on hospitalization (RR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.47, 2.12; three fewer to seven more hospitalizations in 1,000) and mortality (RR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.16, 1.28; five fewer to two more deaths in 1,000). There was no difference in serious adverse events with HCQ rather than no HCQ for post-exposure prophylaxis (RR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.47, 1.76), and additional side effects included QT prolongation, arrhythmias, and gastrointestinal effects.

### A randomized trial of hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis for COVID-19 [^113BjiSq]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

The study COVID-19 PEP was published by David R Boulware and colleagues in 2020 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: COVID-19 infection. In the COVID-19 PEP study, the trial question was: what is the role of hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis for COVID-19? In the COVID-19 PEP study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the COVID-19 PEP study, the population was: 821 patients (424 female, 397 male). The inclusion criteria were adults who had household or occupational exposure to someone with confirmed COVID-19 at a distance of < 6 feet for > 10 minutes while wearing neither a face mask nor an eye shield (high-risk exposure) or while wearing a face mask but no eye shield (moderate-risk exposure). The key exclusion criteria were age < 18 years, current hospitalization, allergy to hydroxychloroquine, retinal eye disease, known glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, known CKD, structural or ischemic heart disease, personal or family history of prolonged QT syndrome. In the COVID-19 PEP study, the interventions were: n = 414 hydroxychloroquine (800 mg once, followed by 600 mg in 6 to 8 hours, then 600 mg daily for 4 more days for a total course of 5 days) n = 407 placebo (matching folate tablet in an identical regimen). In the COVID-19 PEP study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the incidence of either laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or illness compatible with COVID-19 within 14 days (11.8% vs. 14.3%; ARD -2.4, 95% CI -7 to 2.2). In the COVID-19 PEP study, the secondary outcomes were: borderline significant increase in hospitalization (0.2% vs. 0.2%;) Significant increase in symptoms compatible with COVID-19 (11.6% vs. 13.5%;) No significant difference in all new symptoms (13.8% vs. 14.5%; ARD -0.7, 95% CI -7.05 to 5.65). In the COVID-19 PEP study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in neurologic reaction (dizziness, irritability, vertigo), headache, skin reaction, fatigue, allergic reaction, dry mouth, or taste change. significant differences in side-effects (40.1% vs. 16.8%), nausea or upset stomach (22.9% vs. 7.7%), gastrointestinal symptoms (23.2% vs. 4.3%). In the COVID-19 PEP study, the conclusion was: in adults who had household or occupational exposure to someone with confirmed COVID-19 at a distance of < 6 feet for > 10 minutes while wearing neither a face mask nor an eye shield (high-risk exposure) or while wearing a face mask but no eye shield (moderate-risk exposure), hydroxychloroquine was not superior to placebo with respect to the incidence of either laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or illness compatible with COVID-19 within 14 days.

### Using time-weighted average change from baseline of SARS-CoV-2 viral load to assess impact of hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis and early treatment for COVID-19 [^115VsSi6]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Two randomized controlled trials demonstrated no clinical benefit of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for either postexposure prophylaxis or early treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using data from these studies, we calculated the time-weighted average change from baseline SARS-CoV-2 viral load and demonstrated that HCQ did not affect viral clearance.

### Efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine vs placebo for pre-exposure SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis among health care workers: a randomized clinical trial [^115TBFDY]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Health care workers (HCWs) caring for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are at risk of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently, to our knowledge, there is no effective pharmacologic prophylaxis for individuals at risk.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital-based HCWs with exposure to patients with COVID-19 using a pre-exposure prophylaxis strategy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (the Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19 With Hydroxychloroquine Study) was conducted at 2 tertiary urban hospitals, with enrollment from April 9, 2020, to July 14, 2020; follow-up ended August 4, 2020. The trial randomized 132 full-time, hospital-based HCWs (physicians, nurses, certified nursing assistants, emergency technicians, and respiratory therapists), of whom 125 were initially asymptomatic and had negative results for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab. The trial was terminated early for futility before reaching a planned enrollment of 200 participants.

Interventions

Hydroxychloroquine, 600 mg, daily, or size-matched placebo taken orally for 8 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by a nasopharyngeal swab during the 8 weeks of treatment. Secondary outcomes included adverse effects, treatment discontinuation, presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, frequency of QTc prolongation, and clinical outcomes for SARS-CoV-2-positive participants.

Results

Of the 132 randomized participants (median age, 33 years [range, 20–66 years]; 91 women [69%]), 125 (94.7%) were evaluable for the primary outcome. There was no significant difference in infection rates in participants randomized to receive hydroxychloroquine compared with placebo (4 of 64 [6.3%] vs 4 of 61 [6.6%]; P > .99). Mild adverse events were more common in participants taking hydroxychloroquine compared with placebo (45% vs 26%; P = 0.04); rates of treatment discontinuation were similar in both arms (19% vs 16%; P = 0.81). The median change in QTc (baseline to 4-week evaluation) did not differ between arms (hydroxychloroquine: 4 milliseconds; 95% CI, -9 to 17; vs placebo: 3 milliseconds; 95% CI, -5 to 11; P = 0.98). Of the 8 participants with positive results for SARS-CoV-2 (6.4%), 6 developed viral symptoms; none required hospitalization, and all clinically recovered.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, although limited by early termination, there was no clinical benefit of hydroxychloroquine administered daily for 8 weeks as pre-exposure prophylaxis in hospital-based HCWs exposed to patients with COVID-19.

### Prophylaxis against COVID-19: living systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111MF1K8]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Updates

This is the second version (first update) of the living systematic review, replacing the previous version (available as a data supplement). When citing this paper please consider adding the version number and date of access for clarity.

Objective

To determine and compare the effects of drug prophylaxis on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19).

Design

Living systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA).

Data Sources

World Health Organization covid-19 database, a comprehensive multilingual source of global covid-19 literature to 4 March 2022.

Study Selection

Randomised trials in which people at risk of covid-19 were allocated to prophylaxis or no prophylaxis (standard care or placebo). Pairs of reviewers independently screened potentially eligible articles.

Methods

After duplicate data abstraction, we conducted random-effects bayesian network meta-analysis. We assessed risk of bias of the included studies using a modification of the Cochrane risk of bias 2.0 tool and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Results

The second iteration of this living NMA includes 32 randomised trials which enrolled 25147 participants and addressed 21 different prophylactic drugs; adding 21 trials (66%), 18162 participants (75%) and 16 (76%) prophylactic drugs. Of the 16 prophylactic drugs analysed, none provided convincing evidence of a reduction in the risk of laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. For admission to hospital and mortality outcomes, no prophylactic drug proved different than standard care or placebo. Hydroxychloroquine and vitamin C combined with zinc probably increase the risk of adverse effects leading to drug discontinuation — risk difference for hydroxychloroquine (RD) 6 more per 1000 (95% credible interval (CrI) 2 more to 10 more); for vitamin C combined with zinc, RD 69 more per 1000 (47 more to 90 more), moderate certainty evidence.

Conclusions

Much of the evidence remains very low certainty and we therefore anticipate future studies evaluating drugs for prophylaxis may change the results for SARS-CoV-2 infection, admission to hospital and mortality outcomes. Both hydroxychloroquine and vitamin C combined with zinc probably increase adverse effects.

Systematic Review Registration

This review was not registered. The protocol established a priori is included as a supplement.

This study was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (grant CIHR-IRSC:0579001321).

### Randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin for virologic cure of non-severe COVID-19 [^112sQLjQ]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

It is noteworthy that one of the two double-blinded Covid-19 HC RCTs addressed post-exposure prophylaxis only. The otherwas limited by performance of SARS-CoV-2 testing in only 58% of participants. While both of the blinded trials undoubtedly advanced the state of Covid-19 knowledge, neither assessed the concrete endpoint of virologic cure in a PCR-positive Covid-19 population. Q-PROTECT is the first double-blinded RCT that assesses in virtually all of its participants, an objective virologic endpoint in cases (those with mild or no symptoms) in whom virologic clearance is critical to pandemic control.

It is not the case that virologic cure is more important than clinical outcomes, but Q-PROTECT's laboratory-assessed endpoints fill a gap in the blinded-RCT Covid-19 evidence base. Specifically, a blinded RCT could inform national decisions on utility of HC ± AZ to expedite viral clearance and thus reduce transmission. When Q-PROTECT commenced in mid-April 2020, approximately 50,000 people in Qatar had been tested for Covid-19. There had been over 3000 positive SARS-CoV-2 results and seven deaths, with 252 new cases in the 24 h prior to study commencement. As enrollment closed in August 2020, the Covid-19 epidemic in Qatar was a few months past its peak but the daily PCR-positive n was still over 200. Approximately a half-million Covid-19 tests had been done in the country between March and August, with over 100,000 positive results and a death rate of roughly 1 in 1000. Q-PROTECT set out to determine whether HC ± AZ could expedite viral clearance and thus likely reduce transmission.

### Efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine vs placebo for pre-exposure SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis among health care workers: a randomized clinical trial [^111W64KV]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

This randomized clinical trial did not detect a reduction in SARS-CoV-2 transmission with prophylactic administration of hydroxychloroquine, and all participants who did contract SARS-CoV-2 were either asymptomatic or had mild disease courses with full recoveries. As such, we cannot recommend the routine use of hydroxychloroquine among HCWs to prevent COVID-19.

### Efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine vs placebo for pre-exposure SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis among health care workers: a randomized clinical trial [^113Am75Q]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The pandemic triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected more than 6.8 million people in the US, with more than 200 000 deaths to date. The illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread broadly with significant effects on elderly and minority individuals, those with significant comorbidities, and members of the health care workforce. Public health measures to prevent COVID-19 disease have largely depended on physical distancing, use of facial covers and personal protective equipment (PPE), and hand hygiene. Health care workers (HCWs) assigned to treating patients with COVID-19 have frequent potential exposures, raising the question of whether pharmacologic prophylaxis is warranted.

Medication-based prevention and treatment of COVID-19 have proven challenging. To our knowledge, to date, only 2 medications, dexamethasone and remdesivir, have been shown to improve outcomes in severe COVID-19 disease, and no treatment has proven effective in mild to moderate disease. Furthermore, no pharmacologic prophylaxis for COVID-19 has been established. Given the many HCWs with substantial COVID-19 exposure worldwide, there is great interest in finding an effective medication to prevent viral transmission.

Hydroxychloroquine, a 4-aminoquinoline with antimalarial and antiautophagic properties, has been identified as a possible prophylactic medication for SARS-CoV-2. Hydroxychloroquine has been widely used since its US Food and Drug Administration approval in 1956 for treating systemic lupus erythematosus and is generally well tolerated, with few long-term adverse effects. A recent randomized trial for postexposure COVID-19 prophylaxis with a 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine did not demonstrate clinical benefit. However, the composite primary outcome measure for this study included symptoms consistent with infection without laboratory confirmation; most patients did not have assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), raising concerns of type II error from asymptomatic participants. We sought to test the hypothesis that administering daily hydroxychloroquine would prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospital-based HCWs over 8 weeks of exposure via RT-PCR testing of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and serologic antibody testing from participants at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks of treatment.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Published trials and observational studies to date have shown no evidence of a benefit of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for patients admitted to hospital who already have COVID-19. A separate question remains as to whether routine ongoing use of hydroxychloroquine in people without COVID-19 protects against new infections or severe outcomes. We searched MEDLINE and PubMed on Sept 3, 2020, for pharmaco-epidemiological studies evaluating hydroxychloroquine for prevention of severe COVID-19 outcomes. The keywords "hydroxychloroquine AND (COVID OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2) AND (prophyl* OR prevent*) AND (rate OR hazard OR odds OR risk)" were used and results were filtered to articles published since Sept 3, 2019, in English, with abstracts available. 109 papers were identified for screening; none investigated pre-exposure prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine for prevention of severe COVID-19 outcomes. Clinical trials of prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine are ongoing; however, the largest trial does not expect to meet recruitment targets due to "unjustified extrapolation and exaggerated safety concerns together with intense politicisation and negative publicity". In the absence of reported clinical trials, evidence can be generated from real-world data to support the need for randomised clinical trials.

Added value of this study

In this population-based cohort study, which uses a database that includes around 40% of the population of England, UK, we investigated whether routine use of hydroxychloroquine before the COVID-19 outbreak (ie, pre-exposure prophylaxis) prevented COVID-19 mortality. With use of robust pharmaco-epidemiological methods, we found no evidence to support a substantial benefit of hydroxychloroquine in preventing COVID-19 mortality. At the same time, we have shown no evidence of harm. The absence of clear harms or benefits supports clinical equipoise to justify continuing randomised trials. We have shown in this study that it is feasible to address specific hypotheses about medicines in a rapid and transparent manner to inform interim clinical decision making and support the need for large-scale, randomised trial data.

### A living WHO guideline on drugs to prevent COVID-19 [^1139y1qp]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What is the role of drugs in preventing covid-19? WHY DOES THIS MATTER? There is widespread interest in whether drug interventions can be used for the prevention of covid-19, but there is uncertainty about which drugs, if any, are effective. The first version of this living guideline focuses on the evidence for hydroxychloroquine. Subsequent updates will cover other drugs being investigated for their role in the prevention of covid-19.

Recommendation

The guideline development panel made a strong recommendation against the use of hydroxychloroquine for individuals who do not have covid-19 (high certainty).

How This Guideline Was Created

This living guideline is from the World Health Organization (WHO) and provides up to date covid-19 guidance to inform policy and practice worldwide. Magic Evidence Ecosystem Foundation (MAGIC) provided methodological support. A living systematic review with network analysis informed the recommendations. An international guideline development panel of content experts, clinicians, patients, an ethicist and methodologists produced recommendations following standards for trustworthy guideline development using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Understanding The New Recommendation

The linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (6 trials and 6059 participants) found that hydroxychloroquine had a small or no effect on mortality and admission to hospital (high certainty evidence). There was a small or no effect on laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (moderate certainty evidence) but probably increased adverse events leading to discontinuation (moderate certainty evidence). The panel judged that almost all people would not consider this drug worthwhile. In addition, the panel decided that contextual factors such as resources, feasibility, acceptability, and equity for countries and healthcare systems were unlikely to alter the recommendation. The panel considers that this drug is no longer a research priority and that resources should rather be oriented to evaluate other more promising drugs to prevent covid-19.

Updates

This is a living guideline. New recommendations will be published in this article and signposted by update notices to this guideline.

Readers Note

This is the first version of the living guideline for drugs to prevent covid-19. It complements the WHO living guideline on drugs to treat covid-19. When citing this article, please consider adding the update number and date of access for clarity.

### The rise and fall of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 [^112ArmkU]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract.

The efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 has received great attention, and most notably, the enthusiasm for HCQ has been one of politicization rather than science. Laboratory studies and case series published early in the pandemic supported its efficacy. The scientific community raced to conduct observational and randomized evaluations of the drug in all stages of the disease, including prophylaxis, early treatment, and advanced disease. Yet a divisive media response affected recruitment, funding, and subsequent enthusiasm for continuing scientific investigations. Of the more than 300 HCQ trials registered, fewer than 50% report having recruited any patients, and most trials might fail to achieve any useful portions of their intended sample size. Multiple observational studies and two large randomized trials have demonstrated HCQ does not offer efficacy against COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. Prophylaxis studies and early treatment studies provided heterogeneous results and are plagued by low event rates and poor study outcome monitoring. Emerging high-quality evaluations of prophylaxis and early treatment do not support a role for HCQ in these populations. The story of HCQ for COVID-19 has followed a pattern of initial enthusiasm supported by poor quality evidence, followed by disappointment based on more rigorous evaluations. The experience of HCQ in the COVID-19 era calls for the depoliticization of science away from media glare.

THE DESIGN

Conducting clinical research during epidemics is challenging because epidemic dynamics change, public health interventions adapt rapidly, and the scramble for preventive and curative solutions continually generates promising new interventions while discarding others. This poses major methodological challenges, as the various changes must be systematically taken into account to continue ensuring both the scientific rigor and the usefulness of the study results.

Adaptive platform trials have been put forward as a potential alternative to a priori designs. Both the RECOVERY and SOLIDARITY trials were platform trials. One of the main advantages is that it is possible to discontinue evaluation of suboptimal arms (investigational product[s]) and redirect resources to the most promising ones, with an efficient use of a single "common" control arm, hence contributing not only to effective knowledge generation but also to trial efficiency. However, although such designs may be appropriate and efficient for certain treatment trials for COVID-19, prophylaxis has its own specificities. First, platform trials are often open-label. Open-label studies may generate greater willingness to participate than blinded trials, as participants know the treatment they are assigned, although non-negligible bias may be introduced. In COPCOV, this was more important, as the endpoint examined was the presence of symptoms (triggering PCR confirmation of COVID-19), which is more subjective than other endpoints such as hospitalization and death. This argues for placebo controls, which can take considerable time to produce. Second, in platform trials, close to real-time information on endpoints is needed to ensure that arms are added and discarded promptly. Real-time diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 were not widely available at that time, and there was concern that using scarce diagnostics for the study might put additional strain on already overburdened health systems. Third, trial arms may quickly become noncomparable with time, especially when the exposure risk and infection rate change over the course of the trial, such as during the COVID pandemic. – Hence, the different trial arms need to be randomized concurrently throughout the study. Non-concurrent groups, including the control group, may deeply bias the result of the trial. To conclude, the barriers and risks of platform trials made this methodological approach inappropriate for our study.

### Hydroxychloroquine as pre-exposure prophylaxis for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in healthcare workers: a randomized trial [^115Mm9cC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a rapidly emerging virus causing the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic with no known effective prophylaxis. We investigated whether hydroxychloroquine could prevent SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers at high risk of exposure.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of healthcare workers with ongoing exposure to persons with SARS-CoV-2, including those working in emergency departments, intensive care units, COVID-19 hospital wards, and first responders. Participants across the United States and in the Canadian province of Manitoba were randomized to hydroxychloroquine loading dose then 400 mg once or twice weekly for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was confirmed or probable COVID-19-compatible illness. We measured hydroxychloroquine whole-blood concentrations.

Results

We enrolled 1483 healthcare workers, of whom 79% reported performing aerosol-generating procedures. The incidence of COVID-19 (laboratory-confirmed or symptomatic compatible illness) was 0.27 events/person-year with once-weekly and 0.28 events/person-year with twice-weekly hydroxychloroquine compared with 0.38 events/person-year with placebo. For once-weekly hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis, the hazard ratio was .72 (95% CI, .44–1.16; P = 0.18) and for twice-weekly was .74 (95% CI, .46–1.19; P = 0.22) compared with placebo. Median hydroxychloroquine concentrations in whole blood were 98 ng/mL (IQR, 82–120) with once-weekly and 200 ng/mL (IQR, 159–258) with twice-weekly dosing. Hydroxychloroquine concentrations did not differ between participants who developed COVID-19-compatible illness (154 ng/mL) versus participants without COVID-19 (133 ng/mL; P = 0.08).

Conclusions

Pre-exposure prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine once or twice weekly did not significantly reduce laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or COVID-19-compatible illness among healthcare workers.

### Prophylactic (hydroxy) chloroquine in COVID-19: potential relevance for cardiac arrhythmia risk [^116z98xm]. Heart Rhythm (2020). Medium credibility.

(Hydroxy)chloroquine ((H)CQ) is being investigated as a treatment for COVID-19, but studies have so far demonstrated either no or a small benefit. However, these studies have been mostly performed in patients admitted to the hospital and hence likely already (severely) affected. Another suggested approach uses prophylactic (H)CQ treatment aimed at preventing either severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection or the development of disease. A substantial number of clinical trials are planned or underway aimed at assessing the prophylactic benefit of (H)CQ. However, (H)CQ may lead to QT prolongation and potentially induce life-threatening arrhythmias. This may be of particular relevance to patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease and those taking other QT-prolonging drugs. In addition, it is known that a certain percentage of the population carries genetic variant(s) that reduces their repolarization reserve, predisposing them to (H)CQ-induced QT prolongation, and this may be more relevant to female patients who already have a longer QT interval to start with. This review provides an overview of the current evidence on (H)CQ therapy in patients with COVID-19 and discusses different strategies for prophylactic (H)CQ therapy (ie, preinfection, postexposure, and postinfection). In particular, the potential cardiac effects, including QT prolongation and arrhythmias, will be addressed. Based on these insights, recommendations will be presented as to which preventive measures should be taken when giving (H)CQ prophylactically, including electrocardiographic monitoring.

### Effect of early treatment with hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir and ritonavir on risk of hospitalization among patients with COVID-19: the TOGETHER randomized clinical trial [^115cJuHE]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

This randomized clinical trial found no clinical benefit to support the use of either hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir-ritonavir in an outpatient population. This adds to the growing evidence that these drugs should not be used for the treatment of COVID-19. While evidence emerges to evaluate these drugs as prophylaxis, as treatment for both outpatients and inpatients, hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir do not appear to confer any clinical benefit. These results might affect several countries deciding whether to continue to offer both drug regimens for ambulatory patients presenting with mild COVID-19. The successful completion of this trial also demonstrates that expedient trials of repurposed drugs can be completed in low-income settings even during a global health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine vs placebo for pre-exposure SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis among health care workers: a randomized clinical trial [^116YFDP3]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Does a regimen of hydroxychloroquine, 600 mg, per day, reduce the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a pre-exposure prophylaxis strategy when taken by hospital-based health care workers?

Finding

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial that included 132 participants and was terminated early, there was not a significant difference in reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction–confirmed SARS-CoV-2 incidence between hydroxychloroquine and placebo cohorts.

Meaning

Among hospital-based health care workers, daily hydroxychloroquine did not prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, although the trial was terminated early and may have been underpowered to detect a clinically important difference.

Hydroxychloroquine.

Many trials have been undertaken to investigate the antimalarial and rheumatologic therapeutic CQ and its derivative HCQ for treatment of COVID-19, but results thus far have been largely negative. Here we focused on HCQ, which is less toxic and more active against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro than CQ. The SOLIDARITY trial of the WHO has reported interim results indicating that none of the four treatments tested, including HCQ, reduced 28-day mortality, initiation of ventilation, or duration of hospitalization compared with usual care. The RECOVERY Collaborative found no difference in 28-day mortality in 1,561 hospitalized patients randomized to HCQ or usual care. A trial of early treatment randomizing 491 patients also found no difference in symptoms. For prophylaxis, dozens of other trials are underway. One trial of post-exposure prophylaxis in community members and health workers found it to be ineffective, although there were limitations of this pragmatic trial. Another randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial among health care workers showed no difference between post-exposure prophylaxis of HCQ (600 mg daily for 8 weeks) versus placebo. Another randomized trial of 1,483 health care workers showing no reduction in incidence of COVID-19 using once or twice weekly HCQ pre-exposure prophylaxis. In summary, all phases of illness have been studied, and HCQ has not been found to be effective to date.

### COVID-19 pathogenesis, prognostic factors, and treatment strategy: urgent recommendations [^116wmTEH]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

The pandemic of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is not yet close to being over, more than 8 months after the first cases, but researchers are making great progress in fighting the disease. We have conducted a brief review of the geographic differences in the prevalence of COVID-19, the updated pathological findings, prognostic factors, and treatments for disease prevention and improvement of prognosis. Although hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab have been recommended by some researchers, many clinical trials have failed to confirm any beneficial effect of these and other drugs on COVID-19, in terms of improved clinical status or reduced patient mortality. Currently, glucocorticoid is the only drug that reduces the mortality of COVID-19 in a randomized controlled trial; however, it is still necessary to establish the optimal timing of administration. It is also urgent to set up an international or national cohort to address the risk factors associated with infection, the natural history of COVID-19, including the disease type, surrogate markers for critically ill, long-term sequelae, and reinfection after exposure, identify responders to glucocorticoid, and establish optimal treatment strategies for disease control.

Introduction

Hydroxychloroquine, a commonly used conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), is indicated for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Early in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, it was suggested that hydroxychloroquine might have benefits for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine has since been investigated in several clinical trials, and observational cohorts, with no evidence of therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of patients who are admitted to hospital with symptomatic COVID-19.

Evaluations of the effectiveness of pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine for prevention, as opposed to treatment, of SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe COVID-19 outcomes are scarce. One randomised, controlled trial examining hydroxychloroquine as post-exposure prophylaxis did not show significant benefit in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, although uncertainty in results could not exclude a possible benefit. Other trials of pre-exposure or post-exposure use of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention of severe COVID-19 outcomes are ongoing. In this large, population-based cohort study, we aimed to investigate whether ongoing routine hydroxychloroquine use in the 6 months before March 1, 2020, considered as the start of the outbreak in England, UK (ie, analogous to pre-exposure prophylaxis) was associated with lower risk of COVID-19 mortality.

### A pragmatic randomized controlled trial reports lack of efficacy of hydroxychloroquine on coronavirus disease 2019 viral kinetics [^113fBnAz]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Here, we randomized 53 patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to hydroxychloroquine therapy (at a dose of 400mg twice daily for seven days) in addition to standard care or standard care alone (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier, NCT04316377). All severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive patients 18 years of age or older were eligible for study inclusion if they had moderately severe COVID-19 at admission. Treatment with hydroxychloroquine did not result in a significantly greater rate of decline in SARS-CoV-2 oropharyngeal viral load compared to standard care alone during the first five days. Our results suggest no important antiviral effect of hydroxychloroquine in humans infected with SARS-CoV-2.

### Randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin for virologic cure of non-severe COVID-19 [^115N3jBp]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

As of 1 August 2020, the date of closure of enrollment in Q-PROTECT, existing data on HC ± AZ use in hospitalized Covid-19 cases seems weighted toward the negative. However, as an early August commentary by Cohen states, the question of HC's potential utility in Covid-19 has not been definitively answered. There is a void in the existing evidence base that is filled by the current study.

In its blinded RCT design, Q-PROTECT differs from all but two of the preceding studies (both of which were published by the same group of North American investigators). The preponderance of the HC Covid-19 evidence – even the largest, high-quality trials such as RECOVERY and Solidarity – comes from observational or open-label designs and addresses treatment in hospitalized patients.

### The rise and fall of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 [^115DzZht]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

In July 2020, in the UK, the Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 therapy (RECOVERY) trial reported results that showed potential harm with the use of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients (risk ratio for death at 28 days, 0.92; 95% CI: 0.85–0.99). This report further dissolved much remaining enthusiasm for therapeutic effects of HCQ in the clinical trial community evaluating hospitalized patients. Funding for HCQ trials also became increasingly more difficult to secure. The WHO Solidarity trial, for example, a multinational adaptive platform trial among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, was temporarily placed on hold, as was the COPCOV trial that intended to enroll forty thousand health workers to evaluate HCQ as prophylaxis. Subsequently, the CROWN Coronation Trial, evaluating HCQ as a prophylactic among 30,000 health workers, switched the HCQ arm to a measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine.

Infectious Diseases Society of America COVID-19 guideline — treatments not recommended for use: Several interventions "have been tested in adult populations and not found to have clinical benefit", leading to "recommendations against the routine use of hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, inpatient convalescent plasma, and famotidine". Although children were largely excluded from the informing studies, "the experience in adult patients suggests that these drugs would not be expected to have benefit in treatment of children with similar disease characteristics".

### Importance of inclusion of pregnant and breastfeeding women in COVID-19 therapeutic trials [^1116yRKc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Investigators are employing unprecedented innovation in the design of clinical trials to rapidly and rigorously assess potentially promising therapies for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); this is in stark contrast to the continued near-universal regressive practice of exclusion of pregnant and breastfeeding women from these trials. The few trials that allow their inclusion focus on postexposure prophylaxis or outpatient treatment of milder disease, limiting the options available to pregnant women with severe COVID-19 to compassionate use of remdesivir, or off-label drug use of hydroxychloroquine or other therapies. These restrictions were put in place despite experience with these drugs in pregnant women. In this Viewpoint, we call attention to the need and urgency to engage pregnant women in COVID-19 treatment trials now in order to develop data-driven recommendations regarding the risks and benefits of therapies in this unique but not uncommon population.

### Pragmatic recommendations for therapeutics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in low-and middle-income countries [^113kz5Y5]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

The COALITION II Trial was a randomized comparison of azithromycin in addition to standard care versus standard care alone among 447 hospitalized patients in Brazil with suspected COVID-19. Standard care included hydroxychloroquine in both arms, and patients required at least 4 L/minute of oxygen, high-flow nasal cannula, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, or invasive mechanical ventilation. In the modified intention to treat population of 397 patients with confirmed COVID-19, there was no difference in the primary outcome of clinical status at day 15, as assessed by a blinded independent adjudication committee on a six-point ordinal scale. There was also no increase in the incidence of QT prolongation in azithromycin arm when compared with the control arm.

There are also multiple trials studying the role of hydroxychloroquine in the prophylaxis of COVID-19. – Two randomized controlled trials did not show any benefit to pre- or postexposure prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine. Thus, we do not recommend hydroxychloroquine or azithromycin for this purpose at this time.

Availability, feasibility, affordability, and safety.

We recommend against the use of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin for treatment of COVID-19, regardless of availability or cost for LMICs.

Recommendation for LMICs.

We recommend against using hydroxychloroquine ± azithromycin in treating COVID-19 (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence).

3. For hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs, should lopinavir–ritonavir be given?

Rationale.

Numerous antimicrobial drugs are being evaluated for management of COVID-19 patients, including lopinavir–ritonavir.

Recommendations from other guidelines.

WHO COVID-19 Guidelines: We recommend that antivirals including lopinavir/ritonavir not be administered as treatment or prophylaxis for COVID-19, outside of the context of clinical trials.

NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines: The COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel recommends against using lopinavir/ritonavir (AI) or other HIV protease inhibitors (AIII) for the treatment of COVID-19, except in a clinical trial.

Surviving Sepsis COVID Guidelines: In critically ill adults with COVID-19, we suggest against the routine use of lopinavir/ritonavir (weak suggestion).

### Effect of early treatment with hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir and ritonavir on risk of hospitalization among patients with COVID-19: the TOGETHER randomized clinical trial [^116abt1V]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Limitations of our trial were predominantly related to the challenges associated with conducting a trial during a pandemic wherein the disease was not well understood. We still do not understand the best clinical outcome to evaluate in trials for early treatment and prophylaxis trials. It is possible that neither viral clearance or hospitalization are the most important outcome, and outcomes such as inflammatory response may be more important. We found a low rate of hospitalizations, even though our population had risk factors for developing serious COVID-19 and median (range) age of 53 (18–94) years. It seems likely that we do not yet understand what demographic characteristics are associated with the highest risk of developing severe COVID-19.

Repurposing existing drugs is an appealing strategy to respond to the pandemic. As of the writing of this study, as many as 388 clinical trials have been registered evaluating hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir-ritonavir. Several early treatment and postexposure trials have been completed evaluating hydroxychloroquine and none have demonstrated important treatment effects. Although consensus is emerging that hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir do not confer any benefit for treating COVID-19, evaluating other repurposed drugs is still warranted. The ANTICOVand TREATNOW are 2 trials registered currently evaluating hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir, respectively, in outpatient populations. Our findings from this large trial in an outpatient population to examine the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir-ritonavir suggest that the trial infrastructure from those trials may be more appropriately designed to evaluate other repurposed drugs for which there is little experimental evidence to evaluate their efficacy. Our study group is now evaluating the effect of ivermectin, fluvoxamine, and metformin on COVID-19–associated hospitalizations.

### Hydroxychloroquine post-exposure prophylaxis for coronavirus… [^112xp4rk]. ClinicalTrials (2020). Medium credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine Post-Exposure Prophylaxis for Coronavirus Disease Among Health-Care WorkersClinicalTrials. gov ID. Objectives: To evaluate the effect of HCQ in prevention of clinical disease and reduction of viral shedding among HCWs following exposure to confirmed COVID-19 patients. Study design: Multi-center, randomized controlled, superiority, open label trial Setting: The study will be conducted at Rambam Health Care Campus. Eligibility: Participants eligible for inclusion will include non-pregnant adult HCWs who were exposed to a confirmed case of COVID-19 without full adherence to droplet precautions. Participants will be eligible in a period no longer than 72 hours after exposure. Outcomes: The primary outcome will be the number of participants who develop clinical signs compatible with COVID 19 within 14 days of exposure.

Secondary outcomes will include virologically-confirmed COVID 19, disease severity and viral shedding duration for confirmed COVID 19 cases. In SARS-CoV2, chloroquine/HCQ has in-vitro activity that interferes with virus entry to host cells by the inhibition of pre-entry step of the virus to host cells, interfering with viral particles binding to cell surface receptor as well as reduces virus replication. Such activity in the early stage of infection may play a role in prevention of disease progression, making these drugs hypothetically an optional effective post exposure prophylaxis.

The theoretical effects in such context include reduction of virus transmission, reduction of progression to lower respiratory infection following infection and therefore preventing clinical disease and finally reduction of intensity and duration of virus shedding. Given the safe profile of these drugs and the low collateral damage, makes them a favorable PEP drugs. The investigators plan in the present study to assess the effect of chloroquine/HCQ PEP given for a restricted duration following a recognized event of a significant risk exposure among HCWs in hospitals to prevent symptomatic infection and documented COVID-19. OBJECTIVES The objective of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of HCQ as PEP in reduction of virus transmission among HCWs following unprotected close contact to patients with COVID-19.

The investigatots aim to demonstrate a decrease in clinical disease as well as ameliorating disease severity and shortening virological shedding among HCW participants developing COVID-19.

### Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 [^117Sp9CY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

There are fewer studies and fewer reviews examining CQ and HCQ as prophylaxis for COVID‐19 (Objectives 2 and 3). Shah 2020 is a systematic review of the evidence for HCQ in preventing COVID‐19, which was published in March 2020. Due to the lack of studies at that time, the authors included only two pre‐clinical studies and three commentaries, concluding that although evidence from pre‐clinical studies is promising, there was no evidence to support the efficacy of CQ or HCQ in preventing COVID‐19.

National and international guideline recommendations for the use of CQ and HCQ have changed over the course of the pandemic. The US National Institutes of Health published updated guidance on 27 August 2020 recommending against the use of CQ or HCQ for the treatment of COVID‐19 in hospitalized patients, and against the use of CQ or HCQ in non‐hospitalized patients except in the context of a clinical trial (NIH 2020). In May 2020, WHO recommended that CQ and HCQ not be administered to COVID‐19 patients outside of the context of a clinical trial (WHO 2020c).

CQ and HCQ for preventing COVID‐19

Despite no human data on prophylaxis early in the pandemic, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) recommended HCQ as pre‐exposure prophylaxis for frontline healthcare workers having "high‐risk" contact with patients with suspected or confirmed COVID‐19, and postexposure prophylaxis for household and healthcare worker contacts of patients with confirmed COVID‐19 (ICMR 2020). The background section of this recommendation referred to in vivo evidence for efficacy of HCQ for the treatment of COVID‐19, and inferred prophylactic efficacy from therapeutic efficacy (ICMR 2020). Concerns have been raised by multiple groups regarding this approach (Rathi 2020).

Since then, two comparative studies have reported the effect of use of CQ or HCQ for prophylaxis of COVID‐19, one of which is a randomized trial (Boulware 2020), and the other a case‐control study conducted by the ICMR (Chatterjee 2020). The former is included in this review. The case‐control study involved a telephone survey of healthcare workers tested for SARS‐CoV‐2 when suspected of having symptomatic COVID‐19: the 378 cases (172 of whom took HCQ) had a positive PCR test for SARS‐CoV‐2, whilst 373 controls (193 of whom used HCQ) had a negative test (Chatterjee 2020). Whilst use of HCQ versus no use of HCQ was not found to be significantly associated with confirmed COVID‐19, a dose‐response effect was reported, with lower odds of positive PCR the higher the number of weekly doses reported to have been taken: for four or five maintenance doses of HCQ after an initial loading dose, the adjusted odds ratio using multivariate regression analysis was 0.44 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.88) (Chatterjee 2020). Reported side effects were uncommon. Methods were reported incompletely, such as the sampling approach for cases and controls from the database of 21,402 healthcare workers, of whom 1073 has a positive PCR test (Chatterjee 2020). The target sample size was not met, though this was calculated for HCQ prophylaxis as a binary exposure variable, rather than the duration‐based groups used in the eventual analysis (Chatterjee 2020). Several trials exploring the use of CQ or HCQ for prophylaxis of COVID‐19 are ongoing (Cortegiani 2020).

Discussion

Summary of main results

Treating COVID‐19 disease

Ten trials compared HCQ versus standard care without HCQ, or placebo (see Table 1). HCQ makes little or no difference to death due to any cause, compared with no HCQ (high‐certainty evidence). HCQ may make little or no difference to the likelihood of a negative PCR for SARS‐CoV‐2 on respiratory samples at day 14 from enrolment (low‐certainty evidence). HCQ probably results in little to no difference in progression to mechanical ventilation (moderate‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about the effect of HCQ on time to clinical improvement when compared to standard care without HCQ or placebo (very low‐certainty evidence). HCQ probably results in an increased risk of developing adverse events (moderate‐certainty evidence), but may make little or no difference to the risk of serious adverse events (low‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about the effect of HCQ on prolongation of QT‐interval on ECG when compared with standard care without HCQ, or placebo (very low‐certainty evidence).

We have drawn no conclusions from small single‐trial comparisons of CQ versus lopinavir/ritonavir; HCQ and azithromycin versus standard care; and HCQ versus febuxostat.

Objective 2. For prevention of COVID‐19 disease in people at risk of exposure to SARS‐CoV‐2

No eligible studies were identified for this objective.

Objective 3. For prevention of COVID‐19 disease in people who have been exposed to SARS‐CoV‐2

One individually randomized trial compared HCQ with placebo (see Table 2). We are very uncertain about the effect of HCQ on the development of confirmed COVID‐19 at 14 days from enrolment and the risk of hospitalization due to COVID‐19, compared with placebo (very low‐certainty evidence). HCQ probably increases the risk of adverse events, compared with placebo (moderate‐certainty evidence). HCQ may result in little or no difference in serious adverse events, compared with placebo, though no participants in the trial experienced any events (low‐certainty evidence).

A cluster‐randomized trial compared HCQ with no intervention for postexposure prevention of COVID‐19. The results of this trial could not be combined with those of the individually randomized RCT. There was no difference in the risk of symptomatic confirmed COVID‐19 or production of antibodies to SARS‐CoV‐2 between study arms.

### Randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin for virologic cure of non-severe COVID-19 [^113AhEdh]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Other study flaws constituted threats to both internal and external validity. The main internal validity problems included dropouts and other losses to follow-up. The most substantial external validity threats related to the medication regimen and the study population.

A potentially significant internal validity issue was failure to confirm medication compliance (e.g. by having staff administer medications or by assaying drug levels). Since unreported non-compliance with study therapy would likely be associated with an active-drug regimen (e.g. from gastrointestinal side effects), it is possible that differential medication compliance biased Q-PROTECT toward a null finding.

Even if internal validity questions are resolved, there were a number of study limitations that affect external validity. Among the most important are related to Q-PROTECT's study population and the study's specific medication regimen.

Q-PROTECT's participants were nearly all male, and relatively young. Viral clearance rates are likely similar in females and males, but older patients may clear Covid-19 more slowly. Differential viral clearance in various races or ethnicities has not been well characterized. Q-PROTECT results are applicable only to patients similar to those enrolled in the current study.

The current study results applicability is also restricted in terms of medication regimen. While AZ use for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic Covid-19 cases tends follow consistent dosing (500 mg on day one, 250 mg on days two through five), HC dosing varies widely across the Covid-19 evidence base. The Q-PROTECT regimen was selected in March 2020, to match the approach reported successful in Marseille. However, some studies have utilized higher HC doses in the initial days of therapy, and many studies use different daily maintenance doses or durations of therapy. For example, as compared to the one-week Q-PROTECT regimen of 200 mg HC three times daily, Arshad and colleaguesand Mitja and colleaguesboth utilized a day one 800 mg dose followed by 200 mg twice daily for less than a week. Tang and colleagues, while also focusing on mild or moderate disease, administered a higher initial dose (1200 mg daily for three days) and a higher maintenance dose (800 mg) for a longer time frame (two to three weeks). In their post-exposure prophylaxis study, Boulware and colleaguesalso used a relatively high initial HC dose (1400 mg on the day of exposure).

2 Methods

2.1 Study design and trial oversight

The COPEP (COronavirus Post-Exposure Prophylaxis) Trial is a multicenter, pragmatic open-label, two-arm, parallel group, cluster randomised, investigator-initiated, superiority clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of LPV/r PEP in asymptomatic individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 vs no PEP (symptom monitoring alone). During the course of the trial, the protocol underwent several critical amendments. Initially, the protocol was designed as a three-arm parallel group (1:1:1) trial with a hydroxychloroquine 800 mg single-dose as the third arm. This arm was stopped seven weeks after the start of the trial on June 18, 2020, upon request of the Swiss regulatory agency (Swissmedic [Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products]). At that time, the evidence for the clinical efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 had not been established. Furthermore, in a controversial study published in The Lancet, hydroxychloroquine was associated, either alone or in combination with other molecules, with an increase in adverse effects, particularly cardiac. The benefit/risk ratio was considered to be unfavourable and the prescription of hydroxychloroquine was no longer recommended for the treatment or prophylaxis of COVID-19. Only four participants had been assigned to the hydroxychloroquine arm. The remaining two arms were maintained with 2:1 allocation in favour of LPV/r. Originally conceived as a two-centre trial (Geneva and Basel), the protocol was amended on June 15, 2020, to include a third Swiss site (Lugano) and a Brazilian site (Rio de Janeiro). On February 4, 2021, as a further amendment, the definition of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 was broadened to include not only PCRs, but also rapid antigen tests, and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 was introduced as an exclusion criterion.

The protocol and amendments were approved by Swissmedic and the local ethics committees in Switzerland and Brazil. An independent medical monitor, data safety monitoring board, and the COPEP trial steering committee provided an oversight of safety and efficacy endpoints. The initial/amended trial protocols and the statistical analysis plan are listed in Supplements 1–3.

### Reflections on participation in a trial on hydroxychloroquine as prevention for COVID-19 among health workers in Niger [^115zMvYX]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

In 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a rapidly emerging virus causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, had no known effective prophylaxis and no widely available proven effective antiviral treatment. Hydroxychloroquine/Chloroquine was identified as an early potential therapeutic candidate drawing on evidence from reports of both in vitro and in vivo testing. A multicountry placebo-controlled randomized trial was set to evaluate the use of hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine to prevent infection in healthcare workers and staff working in a health facility involved in COVID-19 management. One of the sites of this trial was in Niger. In Niger, of the 240 persons who were provided information about the study and with whom participation was discussed, only five participants provided their informed consent. In this article, we describe the key difficulties encountered in the conduct of this trial from the perspective of the site study team. Among the difficulties, we recognize that the epidemic context, controversy surrounding hydroxychloroquine, vaccine rollout, participants' perspectives, and trial design had a major impact on participation.

### Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for treatment or prophylaxis of COVID-19: a living systematic review [^1135UgBv]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have antiviral effects in vitro against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Purpose

To summarize evidence about the benefits and harms of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for the treatment or prophylaxis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Data Sources

PubMed (via MEDLINE), EMBASE (via Ovid), Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, bioRxiv, Preprints, ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the Chinese Clinical Trials Registry from 1 December 2019 until 8 May 2020.

Study Selection

Studies in any language reporting efficacy or safety outcomes from hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine use in any setting in adults or children with suspected COVID-19 or at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Data Extraction

Independent, dually performed data extraction and quality assessments.

Data Synthesis

Four randomized controlled trials, 10 cohort studies, and 9 case series assessed treatment effects of the medications, but no studies evaluated prophylaxis. Evidence was conflicting and insufficient regarding the effect of hydroxychloroquine on such outcomes as all-cause mortality, progression to severe disease, clinical symptoms, and upper respiratory virologic clearance with antigen testing. Several studies found that patients receiving hydroxychloroquine developed a QTc interval of 500 ms or greater, but the proportion of patients with this finding varied among the studies. Two studies assessed the efficacy of chloroquine; 1 trial, which compared higher-dose (600 mg twice daily for 10 days) with lower-dose (450 mg twice daily on day 1 and once daily for 4 days) therapy, was stopped owing to concern that the higher dose therapy increased lethality and QTc interval prolongation. An observational study that compared adults with COVID-19 receiving chloroquine phosphate, 500 mg once or twice daily, with patients not receiving chloroquine found minor fever resolution and virologic clearance benefits with chloroquine.

Limitation

There were few controlled studies, and control for confounding was inadequate in observational studies.

Conclusion

Evidence on the benefits and harms of using hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine to treat COVID-19 is very weak and conflicting.

### Shining a light on the evidence for hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 [^111jvjhy]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Until data from randomized controlled trials are available, we suggest caution utilizing hydroxychloroquine off label for patients with COVID-19. Reports of overdoses are now occurring. There are currently no evidence supporting hydroxychloroquine as prophylaxis, but unfortunately these data are being extrapolated to the indication potentially resulting in drug shortages for patients with rheumatic diseases who require this medication. Furthermore, we caution medical and world leaders against premature comments of treatment efficacy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such comments may exacerbate shortages for patients reliant on these medications or cause harm due to medication side effects and overdose.

### Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 [^113x9NHq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in substantial mortality. Some specialists proposed chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for treating or preventing the disease. The efficacy and safety of these drugs have been assessed in randomized controlled trials.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of chloroquine (CQ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for 1) treating people with COVID-19 on death and time to clearance of the virus; 2) preventing infection in people at risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure; 3) preventing infection in people exposed to SARS-CoV-2.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Current Controlled Trials (www.controlled-trials.com), and the COVID-19-specific resources www.covid-nma.com and covid-19.cochrane.org, for studies of any publication status and in any language. We performed all searches up to 15 September 2020. We contacted researchers to identify unpublished and ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in people with COVID-19, people at risk of COVID-19 exposure, and people exposed to COVID-19. Adverse events (any, serious, and QT-interval prolongation on electrocardiogram) were also extracted.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed eligibility of search results, extracted data from the included studies, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We contacted study authors for clarification and additional data for some studies. We used risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We performed meta-analysis using a random-effects model for outcomes where pooling of effect estimates was appropriate.

Main Results

1. Treatment of COVID-19 disease We included 12 trials involving 8569 participants, all of whom were adults. Studies were from China (4); Brazil, Egypt, Iran, Spain, Taiwan, the UK, and North America (each 1 study); and a global study in 30 countries (1 study). Nine were in hospitalized patients, and three from ambulatory care. Disease severity, prevalence of comorbidities, and use of co-interventions varied substantially between trials. We found potential risks of bias across all domains for several trials. Nine trials compared HCQ with standard care (7779 participants), and one compared HCQ with placebo (491 participants); dosing schedules varied. HCQ makes little or no difference to death due to any cause (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.19; 8208 participants; 9 trials; high-certainty evidence). A sensitivity analysis using modified intention-to-treat results from three trials did not influence the pooled effect estimate. HCQ may make little or no difference to the proportion of people having negative PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on respiratory samples at day 14 from enrolment (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.10; 213 participants; 3 trials; low-certainty evidence). HCQ probably results in little to no difference in progression to mechanical ventilation (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.37; 4521 participants; 3 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). HCQ probably results in an almost three-fold increased risk of adverse events (RR 2.90, 95% CI 1.49 to 5.64; 1394 participants; 6 trials; moderate-certainty evidence), but may make little or no difference to the risk of serious adverse events (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.79; 1004 participants; 6 trials; low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about the effect of HCQ on time to clinical improvement or risk of prolongation of QT-interval on electrocardiogram (very low-certainty evidence). One trial (22 participants) randomized patients to CQ versus lopinavir/ritonavir, a drug with unknown efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, and did not report any difference for clinical recovery or adverse events. One trial compared HCQ combined with azithromycin against standard care (444 participants). This trial did not detect a difference in death, requirement for mechanical ventilation, length of hospital admission, or serious adverse events. A higher risk of adverse events was reported in the HCQ-and-azithromycin arm; this included QT-interval prolongation, when measured. One trial compared HCQ with febuxostat, another drug with unknown efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 (60 participants). There was no difference detected in risk of hospitalization or change in computed tomography (CT) scan appearance of the lungs; no deaths were reported. 2. Preventing COVID-19 disease in people at risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 Ongoing trials are yet to report results for this objective. 3. Preventing COVID-19 disease in people who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 One trial (821 participants) compared HCQ with placebo as a prophylactic agent in the USA (around 90% of participants) and Canada. Asymptomatic adults (66% healthcare workers; mean age 40 years; 73% without comorbidity) with a history of exposure to people with confirmed COVID-19 were recruited. We are very uncertain about the effect of HCQ on the primary outcomes, for which few events were reported: 20/821 (2.4%) developed confirmed COVID-19 at 14 days from enrolment, and 2/821 (0.2%) were hospitalized due to COVID-19 (very low-certainty evidence). HCQ probably increases the risk of adverse events compared with placebo (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.83 to 3.11; 700 participants; 1 trial; moderate-certainty evidence). HCQ may result in little or no difference in serious adverse events (no RR: no participants experienced serious adverse events; low-certainty evidence). One cluster-randomized trial (2525 participants) compared HCQ with standard care for the prevention of COVID-19 in people with a history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in Spain. Most participants were working or residing in nursing homes; mean age was 49 years. There was no difference in the risk of symptomatic confirmed COVID-19 or production of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 between the two study arms.

Authors' Conclusions

HCQ for people infected with COVID-19 has little or no effect on the risk of death and probably no effect on progression to mechanical ventilation. Adverse events are tripled compared to placebo, but very few serious adverse events were found. No further trials of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for treatment should be carried out. These results make it less likely that the drug is effective in protecting people from infection, although this is not excluded entirely. It is probably sensible to complete trials examining prevention of infection, and ensure these are carried out to a high standard to provide unambiguous results.

### Hydroxychloroquine and COVID-19: critiquing the impact of disease public profile on policy and clinical decision-making [^1163JRCJ]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

The controversy surrounding the use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an antimalarial drug, for COVID-19 has raised numerous ethical and policy problems. Since the suggestion that HCQ has potential for COVID-19, there have been varying responses from clinicians and healthcare institutions, ranging from adoption of protocols using HCQ for routine care to the conduct of randomised controlled trials to an effective system-wide prohibition on its use for COVID-19. In this article, we argue that the concept of 'disease public profile' has become a prominent, if not the sole, determinant in decision-making across various healthcare responses to the pandemic. In the case of COVID-19, the disease's public profile is based on clinical and non-clinical factors that include contagiousness, clinical presentation and media coverage. In particular, we briefly examine the dangers of a heightened public profile in magnifying the inequality of diseases and undermining three key ethical concepts, namely (1) evidence-based practice, (2) sustainable allocation and (3) meaningful consent.

### Shining a light on the evidence for hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 [^117BhZew]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has stunned the world, financial markets, and healthcare systems. Researchers are rushing to identify effective treatments while maintaining rigorous adherence to the scientific method. Clinicians are doing their best to provide evidence-based care in a setting of very little good evidence. To date, no effective treatments exist for COVID-19 management. Unfortunately, traditional and social media coupled with world leader commentary have led some to believe hydroxychloroquine offers a bona fide cure and even prevention. The purpose of this commentary is to review the medical literature related to hydroxychloroquine building on knowledge over the past 17 years since the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic.

Other considerations — The panel agreed that the overall certainty of evidence against treatment with hydroxychloroquine was moderate due to imprecision around a trend toward increased mortality harms, and when considering the addition of azithromycin, the overall certainty of the evidence was low.

Results

A total of 1410 participants were included. The remote trials enrolled a total of 1160 participants (231 participants in the Early Treatment Study and 929 participants in the Hydroxychloroquine COVID-19 Postexposure Prophylaxis Study) from 41 states. The mean (range) age of remote trial participants was 39 (18–80) years, and 676 individuals (58.3%) reported female sex as assigned at birth. Of 250 participants enrolled in the clinic-based study, the mean (range) age was 50 (19–79) years and 131 individuals (52.4%) reported female sex as assigned at birth. Participants in remote trials collected and shipped 14 380 of 15 890 expected nasal swabs (90.5%) for the primary outcome. Retention was high for remote trials, with participants completing 17 129 of 18 893 expected surveys (90.7%) over the follow-up period.

### No benefit of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19: results of systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials" [^1162Py3a]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Coronavirus pandemic is currently a global public health emergency with no definitive treatment guidelines. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature evaluating the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine and its related formulations in COVID-19 patients.

Methods

A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, MedRxiv data and Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials for published articles that reported the outcomes of COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine or its compounds was done. We identified 1071 published studies and 7 studies were included in the analysis.

Results

The study population consisted of a total of 4984 patients, of which 1721 (34.5%) received hydroxychloroquine or its congeners (HCQ group) while 3091 (62.01%) received standard of care or had included antiviral medication (control group). The pooled estimate of successful treatment in the hydroxychloroquine group and the control group was 77.45% and 77.87% respectively, which indicated similar clinical outcomes in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine compared to the control group. The odds ratio of a favourable outcome with hydroxychloroquine was 1.11 (95 CI 0.72 to 1.69) (p = 0.20). The pooled risk difference of favourable outcome with hydroxychloroquine versus control group was 0.00 (95 CI -0.03 to 0.03) which was statistically not significant (p = 0.10).

Conclusions

The present evidence shows no benefit of hydroxychloroquine in patients affected by mild to moderate COVID-19 disease. However, now several trials on HCQ are ongoing and hopefully more data will be available soon. Hence, the management of COVID-19 is set to change for better in the future.

### Hydroxychloroquine use against SARS-CoV-2 infection in non-human primates [^11238d4G]. Nature (2020). Excellent credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become a global pandemic and no antiviral drug or vaccine is yet available for the treatment of this disease 1–3. Several clinical studies are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of repurposed drugs that have demonstrated antiviral efficacy in vitro. Among these candidates, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been given to thousands of individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-the virus that causes COVID-19-worldwide but there is no definitive evidence that HCQ is effective for treating COVID-19 4–7. Here we evaluated the antiviral activity of HCQ both in vitro and in SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques. HCQ showed antiviral activity in African green monkey kidney cells (Vero E6) but not in a model of reconstituted human airway epithelium. In macaques, we tested different treatment strategies in comparison to a placebo treatment, before and after peak viral load, alone or in combination with azithromycin (AZTH). Neither HCQ nor the combination of HCQ and AZTH showed a significant effect on viral load in any of the analysed tissues. When the drug was used as a pre-exposure prophylaxis treatment, HCQ did not confer protection against infection with SARS-CoV-2. Our findings do not support the use of HCQ, either alone or in combination with AZTH, as an antiviral drug for the treatment of COVID-19 in humans.

### Hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019: rapid updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^116U9gBB]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 continues to grow and spread throughout the world since being declared a pandemic. Despite extensive scientific research globally including repurposing of several existing drugs, there is no effective or proven therapy for this enigmatic disease which is still largely managed empirically This systematic review evaluated the role of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the treatment of COVID-19 infection and was conducted using Cochrane methodology for systematic reviews of interventional studies including risk of bias assessment and grading of the quality of evidence. Only prospective clinical trials randomly assigning COVID-19 patients to HCQ plus standard of care therapy (test arm) versus placebo/standard of care (control arm) were included. Data were pooled using the random-effects model and expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). A total of 10,492 patients from 19 randomised controlled trials were included. The use of HCQ was not associated with higher rates of clinical improvement (RR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.96–1.03, p = 0.79) or reduction in all-cause mortality by Day14 (RR = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.97–1.19, p = 0.19) or Day28 (RR = 1.08, 95% CI: 0.99–1.19, p = 0.09) compared to placebo/standard of care. There was no significant difference in serious adverse events between the two arms (RR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.85–1.19, p = 0.95). There is low-to-moderate certainty evidence that HCQ therapy is generally safe but does not reduce mortality or enhance recovery in patients with COVID-19 infection.

### Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 [^112CM5ZG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

We found no studies addressing Objective 2 ‐ prevention of COVID‐19 disease in people at risk of exposure to SARS‐CoV‐2.

For Objective 3 ‐ prevention of COVID‐19 in people who have been exposed to SARS‐CoV‐2, we included one RCT and graded four outcomes (Boulware 2020). We graded the effects estimate for development of COVID‐19 at 14 days from enrolment as very low certainty, implying that we do not know whether HCQ prevents COVID‐19 in people exposed to SARS‐CoV‐2. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence by one level for serious indirectness, as data for this outcome came from a single trial in North America with few older or comorbid participants; and by two levels for very serious imprecision, as the confidence interval around the effects estimate included appreciable benefit and appreciable harm. We graded the effect estimate for participants hospitalized due to COVID‐19 as very low certainty, again downgrading by one level for serious indirectness and by two levels for very serious imprecision. We graded the effects estimate for participants with any adverse events as moderate certainty, implying that HCQ probably increases the risk of adverse events when compared with placebo; the certainty of the evidence was downgraded by one level for serious indirectness, as described above. We graded the effects estimate for participants with serious adverse events as low certainty, meaning that HCQ may result in no difference to the risk of developing serious adverse events compared with placebo; the certainty of the evidence was downgraded by one level for serious indirectness and one level for serious imprecision.

Potential biases in the review process

We took measures to limit bias in the review process by following the procedures outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2019). The Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group (CIDG) Information Specialist conducted the literature search using a variety of general and COVID‐19 specific resources, and included preprints. In addition, we also checked the COVID‐NMA website atfor further studies at regular intervals. We did not make a funnel plot, as fewer than 10 studies were included per comparison. Two review authors independently examined the search results, assessed studies for eligibility, and extracted data, in order to minimize bias in study selection and data extraction.

Comparison 6: HCQ versus standard care by cluster randomization

One trial (2525 participants) reported this comparison (Mitjà 2020b). Due to the cluster‐RCT design and appropriate analysis by the trial authors, adjusted risk ratios have been taken from the report.

Development of symptomatic confirmed COVID‐19 at 14 days from enrolment was not found to differ significantly between participants randomized to HCQ (64/1116; 5.7%) and those allocated to standard care (74/1198; 6.2%) (adjusted RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.46; 2314 participants; 1 RCT; Mitjà 2020b).

Production of antibodies to SARS‐CoV‐2 at 14 days was reported in 137/958 (14.3%) of the participants in HCQ clusters and 91/1042 (8.7%) in clusters not receiving HCQ (adjusted RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.69; 2000 participants; 1 RCT; Mitjà 2020b).

Development of COVID‐19 in household contacts of the recipient of the prophylaxis was not reported by either trial.

Disease severity of participants who developed COVID‐19 was not reported. Five participants in the HCQ clusters (with a denominator of 1197, which is unexplained in its deviation from the randomized total of 1225) and 8/1300 in the standard care clusters died (Mitjà 2020b). Causes of death were not reported.

Adverse events were reported in 671/1197 (56%) participants in the HCQ clusters versus 77/1300 (6%) participants in the clusters not receiving HCQ; a relative effect estimate was not reported (Mitjà 2020b). Serious adverse events were reported, but it was not clear whether they were reported as number of events or number of participants, and did not match the intensity grading reported by the pharmacovigilance consultants employed by the trial (Mitjà 2020b). QT‐interval prolongation was not measured in this trial.

### Reflections on participation in a trial on hydroxychloroquine as prevention for COVID-19 among health workers in Niger [^114VAF8F]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT.

In 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a rapidly emerging virus causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, had no known effective prophylaxis and no widely available proven effective antiviral treatment. Hydroxychloroquine/Chloroquine was identified as an early potential therapeutic candidate drawing on evidence from reports of both in vitro and in vivo testing. A multicountry placebo-controlled randomized trial was set to evaluate the use of hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine to prevent infection in healthcare workers and staff working in a health facility involved in COVID-19 management. One of the sites of this trial was in Niger. In Niger, of the 240 persons who were provided information about the study and with whom participation was discussed, only five participants provided their informed consent. In this article, we describe the key difficulties encountered in the conduct of this trial from the perspective of the site study team. Among the difficulties, we recognize that the epidemic context, controversy surrounding hydroxychloroquine, vaccine rollout, participants' perspectives, and trial design had a major impact on participation.

### Mortality outcomes with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in COVID-19 from an international collaborative meta-analysis of randomized trials [^113frXg7]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

For HCQ, evidence is dominated by the RECOVERY trial, which indicated no mortality benefit for treated COVID-19 patients, together with longer hospitalization and higher risk of progression to invasive mechanical ventilation and/or death. Similarly, the WHO SOLIDARITY trial indicated no mortality benefit. The RECOVERY and WHO SOLIDARITY trials used HCQ in comparatively higher doses than all other trials except REMAP-CAP. There was no evidence for an effect modification by dose (p for interaction = 0.29), and the combined effect of all the trials with lower dose did not indicate a benefit of HCQ but tended to a null effect (OR 0.97; 0.73–1.30) with wide CIs, compatible with the main effect estimate.

This meta-analysis does not address prophylactic use nor other outcomes besides mortality. All but three trials excluded children and the majority excluded pregnant or breastfeeding women; generalizability remains unclear for those populations. Among the five studies on outpatients, there were three deaths, two occurring in the one trial of 491 relatively young patients with few comorbiditiesand one occurring in a small trial with 27 patients. For outpatients who are elderly or have comorbidities, evidence is sparse. Most of the 28 trials excluded persons with comorbid conditions carrying higher risk of adverse events from HCQ or CQ. No evidence is in the pipeline for these groups, which echoes clinical reasoning being reluctant to expose them to risk.

### Mortality outcomes with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in COVID-19 from an international collaborative meta-analysis of randomized trials [^115vXA8p]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Substantial COVID-19 research investment has been allocated to randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, which currently face recruitment challenges or early discontinuation. We aim to estimate the effects of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine on survival in COVID-19 from all currently available RCT evidence, published and unpublished. We present a rapid meta-analysis of ongoing, completed, or discontinued RCTs on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine treatment for any COVID-19 patients (protocol: https://osf.io/QESV4/). We systematically identified unpublished RCTs (ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Cochrane COVID-registry up to June 11, 2020), and published RCTs (PubMed, medRxiv and bioRxiv up to October 16, 2020). All-cause mortality has been extracted (publications/preprints) or requested from investigators and combined in random-effects meta-analyses, calculating odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), separately for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. Prespecified subgroup analyses include patient setting, diagnostic confirmation, control type, and publication status. Sixty-three trials were potentially eligible. We included 14 unpublished trials (1308 patients) and 14 publications/preprints (9011 patients). Results for hydroxychloroquine are dominated by RECOVERY and WHO SOLIDARITY, two highly pragmatic trials, which employed relatively high doses and included 4716 and 1853 patients, respectively (67% of the total sample size). The combined OR on all-cause mortality for hydroxychloroquine is 1.11 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.20; I² = 0%; 26 trials; 10,012 patients) and for chloroquine 1.77 (95%CI: 0.15, 21.13, I² = 0%; 4 trials; 307 patients). We identified no subgroup effects. We found that treatment with hydroxychloroquine is associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients, and there is no benefit of chloroquine. Findings have unclear generalizability to outpatients, children, pregnant women, and people with comorbidities.

### On meta-analytic models and the effect of hydroxychloroquine use in COVID-19 [^115gct6q]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

C. Axfors et al. Nature Communications 10.1038/s41467-021-22446-z (2021)

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been widely tested as a potential treatment in COVID-19. The largest randomized trial in hospitalized patients (the RECOVERY trial) found a numerically larger rate of all-cause mortality in the HCQ arm compared with standard of care alone (RR, 1.09, 95% CI, 0.96–1.23). These data clearly exclude a clinical benefit and raise the question of a possible increased fatality rate caused by widespread HCQ use in the early phase of the pandemic. Since the RECOVERY trial was not powered to detect such ~10% increase in mortality, it is natural to pool the data with those of similar trials to obtain more precise estimates. The study of Axfors et al.is a high-quality systematic review that relevantly addresses this question and leads to the conclusion of a significant increase of mortality associated with HCQ (OR, 1.11, 95% CI, 1.02–1.20, p = 0.02). This is in contrast with other meta-analyses based on similar sets of trials, which reported wider confidence intervals –. In a more recent meta-analysis, including more trials and with the final Solidarity results, the trend was weaker. This eleven percent increase in mortality is now being used to estimate the number of deaths caused by HCQ in various countries.

### Repurposed drug studies on the primary prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the pandemic: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112cwGNR]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical trials and observational intervention studies on a wide variety of repurposed drugs have been published at an unprecedented rate. However, current evidence is scattered and inconclusive due to heterogeneous study designs and settings. A well-designed systematic review and meta-analysis is warranted to summarise and scrutinise published findings and provide up-to-date evidence regarding the effectiveness of prophylactic agents in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. Such a review may map the landscape of existing and future prophylactic candidates.

This review complements current guidelineson preventive drugs and three earlier comprehensive reviews, which were based on articles published in 2020 and early 2021. Further substantial evidence on mostly studied drugs such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and ivermectin and additional information on other repurposed drugs are warranted for guidelines update. Smit et al and Andrade et al conducted a systematic review of repurposed drugs used as prophylaxis for COVID-19. These findings did not describe the large heterogeneity in the existing data quantitatively using meta-analysis. Bartoszko et al focused their review on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) only, without compiling real-world evidence from observational studies. Importantly, findings need to be differentiated between two different prophylaxis modes PrEP and PEP, because the timing and dosage of prescribing prophylactic agents may influence the preventive effect.

This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of repurposed drugs for the primary prevention of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 diseases in adults. For the drugs that have been studied as both PrEP and PEP, we further carried out a subgroup analysis to investigate the differential preventive effectiveness of these drugs when used as PrEP or PEP.

### Hydroxychloroquine / chloroquine as a treatment choice or prophylaxis for COVID-19 at the primary care level in developing countries: a primum non nocere dilemma [^112y19Uj]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned against the use of Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for Covid-19 outside of a hospital or a clinical trial setting due to the risk of QT interval prolongation, ventricular tachycardia and the increased risk of these complications when combined with some antibiotics such as azithromycin. Several studies have reported no benefit of Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or with a macrolide in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. Despite these warnings, in several developing countries the official guidelines for treatment of Covid-19 patients at the primary care level recommend Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, among other treatments, as the first-choice for mild symptomatic Covid-19 patients, asymptomatic contacts or for prophylaxis. In our opinion there is a primum non nocere dilemma during this Covid-19 pandemic. In order to solve this bioethical problem, we strongly recommend that a randomized controlled trial in a primary care setting be carried out as a matter of urgency in these areas of the world.

### Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 [^111ERJHu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

At the time of development of the protocol for this review, other systematic reviews had already been produced. Due to the intense interest in finding a therapeutic that is safe and effective for COVID‐19, many review papers have been published over the last six months. Reviews published early in the outbreak relied on pre‐clinical data, expert commentary, and small, mostly non‐randomized studies. A systematic review of CQ for the treatment of COVID‐19, which searched PubMed and Embase up to 1 March 2020, identified no published studies other than the aforementioned letter (Gao 2020), though 23 clinical trials of CQ or HCQ were found on registries (Cortegiani 2020). Another systematic review of CQ and HCQ for treating COVID‐19, published as a preprint on 30 March 2020, concluded: "There is theoretical, experimental, preclinical and clinical evidence of the effectiveness of chloroquine in patients affected with COVID‐19" (Kapoor 2020). A further review included one non‐randomized study and one randomized trial, and concluded: "Without further evidence, HCQ is not appropriate for patients with COVID‐19 in primary care" (McCormack 2020). A systematic review of antimalarials (CQ and HCQ) for the treatment of COVID‐19 was produced by the Epistemonikos Working Group, which synthesized the results of two small randomized trials and found low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence regarding efficacy and harms (Epistemonikos 2020).

We propose that, in this context, a systematic review of randomized controlled trials using standard Cochrane methods that provides summary estimates of effects for both treatment and prophylactic use of CQ and HCQ, with an appraisal of the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach, is important for the general public, clinicians, and policymakers. We plan to update this review in an expedited fashion as new data become available from the trials that are currently in progress on prevention.

Ivermectin — evidence search, eligibility, and study counts — identified 28 studies in patients with COVID-19 with ages ranging between 8 and 86 years that reported on the outcomes of mortality, symptom resolution, viral clearance, and adverse events, and informed the evidence review for inpatient and outpatient therapy; eligible studies compared treatment with ivermectin against a placebo or standard of care, while studies comparing ivermectin to a non-placebo, active comparison or that did not provide a comparison arm were not included. Several studies did not meet eligibility for inclusion in this review, including Three trials compared ivermectin to hydroxychloroquine (comparison to treatment with evidence of harm); two trials examined ivermectin as prophylactic treatment; and two trials did not provide study data in a peer-reviewed, published, or pre-print manuscript. The studies that informed the recommendations for hospitalized patients included 15 randomized control trials (RCTs), and Sixteen RCTs informed the recommendation for ambulatory persons. Each of them compared an active treatment arm of ivermectin to an inactive comparison (e.g., standard of care with or without placebo).

### Repurposed drug studies on the primary prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the pandemic: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115vnTkc]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Objective

Current evidence on the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis is inconclusive. We aimed to systematically evaluate published studies on repurposed drugs for the prevention of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 among healthy adults.

Design

Systematic review.

Eligibility

Quantitative experimental and observational intervention studies that evaluated the effectiveness of repurposed drugs for the primary prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 disease.

Data Source

PubMed and Embase (1 January 2020–28 September 2022).

Risk Of Bias

Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 and Risk of Bias in Non-Randomised Studies of Interventions tools were applied to assess the quality of studies.

Data Analysis

Meta-analyses for each eligible drug were performed if ≥ 2 similar study designs were available.

Results

In all, 65 (25 trials, 40 observational) and 29 publications were eligible for review and meta-analyses, respectively. Most studies pertained to hydroxychloroquine (32), ACE inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) (11), statin (8), and ivermectin (8). In trials, hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis reduced laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (risk ratio: 0.82 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.90), I² = 48%), a result largely driven by one clinical trial (weight: 60.5%). Such beneficial effects were not observed in observational studies, nor for prognostic clinical outcomes. Ivermectin did not significantly reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR: 0.35 (95% CI 0.10 to 1.26), I² = 96%) and findings for clinical outcomes were inconsistent. Neither ACEi or ARB were beneficial in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most of the evidence from clinical trials was of moderate quality and of lower quality in observational studies.

Conclusions

Results from our analysis are insufficient to support an evidence-based repurposed drug policy for SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis because of inconsistency. In the view of scarce supportive evidence on repurposing drugs for COVID-19, alternative strategies such as immunisation of vulnerable people are warranted to prevent the future waves of infection.

### Effect of hydroxychloroquine on clinical status at 14 days in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: a randomized clinical trial [^116o5wSE]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Data on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are needed.

Objective

To determine whether hydroxychloroquine is an efficacious treatment for adults hospitalized with COVID-19.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a multicenter, blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial conducted at 34 hospitals in the US. Adults hospitalized with respiratory symptoms from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were enrolled between April 2 and June 19, 2020, with the last outcome assessment on July 17, 2020. The planned sample size was 510 patients, with interim analyses planned after every 102 patients were enrolled. The trial was stopped at the fourth interim analysis for futility with a sample size of 479 patients.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice daily for 2 doses, then 200 mg twice daily for 8 doses) (n = 242) or placebo (n = 237).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was clinical status 14 days after randomization as assessed with a 7-category ordinal scale ranging from 1 (death) to 7 (discharged from the hospital and able to perform normal activities). The primary outcome was analyzed with a multivariable proportional odds model, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) greater than 1.0 indicating more favorable outcomes with hydroxychloroquine than placebo. The trial included 12 secondary outcomes, including 28-day mortality.

Results

Among 479 patients who were randomized (median age, 57 years; 44.3% female; 37.2% Hispanic/Latinx; 23.4% Black; 20.1% in the intensive care unit; 46.8% receiving supplemental oxygen without positive pressure; 11.5% receiving noninvasive ventilation or nasal high-flow oxygen; and 6.7% receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), 433 (90.4%) completed the primary outcome assessment at 14 days and the remainder had clinical status imputed. The median duration of symptoms prior to randomization was 5 days (interquartile range [IQR], 3 to 7 days). Clinical status on the ordinal outcome scale at 14 days did not significantly differ between the hydroxychloroquine and placebo groups (median [IQR] score, 6 [4–7] vs 6 [4–7]; aOR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.73 to 1.42]). None of the 12 secondary outcomes were significantly different between groups. At 28 days after randomization, 25 of 241 patients (10.4%) in the hydroxychloroquine group and 25 of 236 (10.6%) in the placebo group had died (absolute difference, -0.2% [95% CI, -5.7% to 5.3%]; aOR, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.54 to 2.09]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults hospitalized with respiratory illness from COVID-19, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, compared with placebo, did not significantly improve clinical status at day 14. These findings do not support the use of hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 among hospitalized adults.

### Hydroxychloroquine for early treatment of adults with mild coronavirus disease 2019: a randomized, controlled trial [^113xrpu7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

No effective treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exist. We aimed to determine whether early treatment with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) would be efficacious for outpatients with COVID-19.

Methods

Multicenter open-label, randomized, controlled trial conducted in Catalonia, Spain, between 17 March and 26 May 2020. Patients recently diagnosed with < 5-day of symptom onset were assigned to receive HCQ (800 mg on day 1 followed by 400 mg once daily for 6 days) or usual care. Outcomes were reduction of viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs up to 7 days after treatment start, disease progression up to 28 days, and time to complete resolution of symptoms. Adverse events were assessed up to 28 days.

Results

A total of 293 patients were eligible for intention-to-treat analysis: 157 in the control arm and 136 in the intervention arm. The mean age was 41.6 years (SD, 12.6), mean viral load at baseline was 7.90 log10 copies/mL (SD, 1.82), and median time from symptom onset to randomization was 3 days. No differences were found in the mean reduction of viral load at day 3 (-1.41 vs -1.41 log10 copies/mL in the control and intervention arm, respectively) or at day 7 (-3.37 vs -3.44). Treatment did not reduce risk of hospitalization (7.1% control vs 5.9% intervention) nor shorten the time to complete resolution of symptoms (12 days, control vs 10 days, intervention). No relevant adverse events were reported.

Conclusions

In patients with mild COVID-19, no benefit was observed with HCQ beyond the usual care.

Strategic decisions about the trials' conduct in response to emerging evidence will also be challenging. Lack of efficacy of an intervention should lead to the discontinuation or repurposing of all other trials evaluating the same intervention. In parallel, once the efficacy of any treatment is confirmed, all placebo or standard care arms of all other trials assessing the same treatment indication will need to be reevaluated to avoid depriving patients of effective treatments. In view of the numerous ongoing trials, clinical trialists will need to be very vigilant to identify early emerging data. For example, a recent preliminary report from the ACTT-1 (Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial) double-blinded clinical trial suggested that remdesivir could decrease the duration of hospital stay by 4 days for people admitted to the hospital because of COVID-19 infection. In addition, the RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy) pragmatic, open-label, randomized clinical trial group in a press release disclosed preliminary findings regarding dexamethasone and hydroxychloroquine, based on data from 2,000 patients that received each of these interventions and 4,000 patients that received placebo. Based on these data, dexamethasone appears to decrease the mortality by one-fifth in patients with COVID-19 requiring oxygen therapy and by one-third among ventilated patients, whereas hydroxychloroquine did not appear to confer any clinical benefits. These findings should trigger a review of the ongoing trials' interventions and designs. It is crucial that funders, ethics committees, and regulatory bodies should encourage trialists to include modification plans for trials whose conduct is deemed unnecessary or inappropriate.

Overall, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was unavoidable to launch multiple controlled clinical trials, often evaluating the same intervention. For this reason, we now need to develop strategies and methodologies that will allow us to make the best use of the data being collected, while protecting the patients from disadvantageous outcomes.

### Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine prescribing patterns by provider specialty following initial reports of potential benefit for COVID-19 treatment-United States, January-June 2020 [^1121nFKD]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, primarily used to treat autoimmune diseases and to prevent and treat malaria, received national attention in early March 2020, as potential treatment and prophylaxis for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). On March 20, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate in the Strategic National Stockpile to be used by licensed health care providers to treat patients hospitalized with COVID-19 when the providers determine the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the patient. * Following reports of cardiac and other adverse events in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, on April 24, 2020, FDA issued a caution against its use † and on June 15, rescinded its EUA for hydroxychloroquine from the Strategic National Stockpile. § Following the FDA's issuance of caution and EUA rescindment, on May 12 and June 16, the federal COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel issued recommendations against the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine to treat COVID-19; the panel also noted that at that time no medication could be recommended for COVID-19 pre- or postexposure prophylaxis outside the setting of a clinical trial. However, public discussion concerning the effectiveness of these drugs on outcomes of COVID-19, and clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis of COVID-19 continue. In response to recent reports of notable increases in prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, CDC analyzed outpatient retail pharmacy transaction data to identify potential differences in prescriptions dispensed by provider type during January–June 2020 compared with the same period in 2019. Before 2020, primary care providers and specialists who routinely prescribed hydroxychloroquine, such as rheumatologists and dermatologists, accounted for approximately 97% of new prescriptions. New prescriptions by specialists who did not typically prescribe these medications (defined as specialties accounting for ≤ 2% of new prescriptions before 2020) increased from 1,143 prescriptions in February 2020 to 75,569 in March 2020, an 80-fold increase from March 2019. Although dispensing trends are returning to prepandemic levels, continued adherence to current clinical guidelines for the indicated use of these medications will ensure their availability and benefit to patients for whom their use is indicated, because current data on treatment and pre- or postexposure prophylaxis for COVID-19 indicate that the potential benefits of these drugs do not appear to outweigh their risks.

Other potential sources of bias

We identified other potential sources of bias in four trials. Skipper 2020 and Tang 2020 were at high risk of bias as they were terminated early, which could have introduced bias as both trials had a time‐updating variable as the primary outcome. Mitjà 2020a was also at high risk of other bias: a small number of participants were randomized who were in fact not eligible for the trial, but these participants were kept as part of the ITT population.

Mitjà 2020b was a cluster‐randomized trial, and so was assessed for risk of bias against five further domains specific to cluster‐randomized trials. We judged the trial to be at low risk for four out of five domains (see Characteristics of included studies), and at high risk of bias for comparability with individually randomized trials: contamination was possible due to the open‐label design, and the intervention would be expected to work best when given to all contacts of a case rather than some being randomized to the intervention and some randomized to no intervention, which would preclude comparability with an individually randomized trial.

Being a pandemic and having a high global case fatality rate directed us to assess the evidence strength of hydroxychloroquine efficacy in treating coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) arising from clinical trials and to update the practice with the most reliable clinical evidence. A comprehensive search was started in June up to 18 July, 2020 in many databases, including PubMed, Embase, and others. Of 432 studies found, only six studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, which includes: clinical trials, age more than 12 years with nonsevere COVID-19, polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine is the intervention beyond the usual care. Data extraction and bias risk assessment were done by two independent authors. Both fixed-effect and random-effect models were utilized for pooling data using risk difference as a summary measure. The primary outcomes are clinical and radiological COVID-19 progression, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 clearance in the pharyngeal swab, and mortality. The secondary outcomes are the adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine. Among 609 COVID-19 confirmed patients obtained from pooling six studies, 294 patients received hydroxychloroquine and 315 patients served as a control. Hydroxychloroquine significantly prevents early radiological progression relative to control with risk difference and 95% confidence interval of -0.2 (-0.36 to -0.03). On the other hand, hydroxychloroquine did not prevent clinical COVID-19 progression, reduce 5-day mortality, or enhance viral clearance on days 5, 6, and 7. Moreover, many adverse effects were reported with hydroxychloroquine therapy. Failure of hydroxychloroquine to show viral clearance or clinical benefits with additional adverse effects outweigh its protective effect from radiological progression in nonsevere COVID-19 patients. Benefit-risk balance should determine the hydroxychloroquine use in COVID-19.

### Repurposed pharmacological agents for the potential treatment of COVID-19: a literature review [^116A5uMP]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

In vitro analyses of SARS-CoV-2, as well as previous studies of SARS and MERS treatment became guides for the direction of possible COVID-19 treatment. Taken by the example of the in vitro analyses of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, it appears to be indisputable that investigations in SARS-CoV-2-infected human airway epithelial cells should have led the discussion before the proposal of clinical trials and that human airway epithelial cells for SARS-CoV-2 in vitro drug analyses should become standard procedure.

The results of clinical trials surrounded with the topic of drug treatment of COVID-19 with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin precipitated the most controversy. Whereas a handful of clinical trials advocated the use of chloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19, other trials reported no proven benefit of chloroquine in COVID-19 patients. Hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19, as well as the observations of risk of intubation or death in SARS-CoV-2-positive, hospitalised patients did not conclude a benefit of hydroxychloroquine treatment in COVID-19 patients. The combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for the use of SARS-CoV-2 viral load reduction has been advocated by a French clinical trial lead by Gautret and colleagues. However, the results of this study and the effect of the drug combination on patients' viral load have been opposed by critics and negated by studies. Furthermore, no effect of clinical improvement was ascribed to the use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in mild to moderate COVID-19 patients. As a possible postexposure prophylaxis, hydroxychloroquine has not proven to have sufficient effect on a population of mainly health care workers. Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, especially in high dosing and in the combination with azithromycin, have potential in causing cardiac side effects and prolonged QTc, giving rise to a significant risk in causing life-threatening arrhythmia. Considering the given data, neither chloroquine, nor hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin present clear proven clinical benefit for the treatment of COVID-19.

1 Introduction

In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) acknowledged the pandemic status of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its associated disease Covid-19. As of August 2020, there is neither a Covid-19 vaccine nor definitive therapy.

One therapeutic approach that was ultimately dropped from the UK's RECOVERY (in June 2020) and the WHO's Solidarity (in July 2020) is the repurposed antimalarial hydroxychloroquine (HC). Initial enthusiasm for HC, administered with or without the macrolide azithromycin (AZ), was fueled by a March 2020 report from a Marseille open-label (non-RCT) studyand a mid-April follow-up from the same group. Covid-19 HC treatment attained a level of notoriety that was arguably disproportionate to the strength of supporting evidence.

In assessing the evidence in April 2020 – evidence that included a study from another French groupthat failed to replicate Marseille's favorable results – reviewers concluded there was insufficient evidence to support HC as a standard of Covid-19 care. Given the lack of certainty, in April 2020 a multidisciplinary group from the Qatari national healthcare system designed the Qatar Prospective RCT of Expediting Coronavirus Tapering (Q-PROTECT).

Pre-symptomatic transmission warrants focus as a target to protect a population from SARS-CoV-2. Q-PROTECT focuses on non-hospitalized low-acuity, emphasizing a dichotomous endpoint: presence of SARS-CoV-2 on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The primary aim was to determine whether, as compared to placebo, use of HC or HC+AZ was associated with higher rates of viral clearance after six days of therapy. There were two secondary study aims: assessment of day 14 virologic cure, and assessment of semi-quantitative change in viral load from baseline to day six.
