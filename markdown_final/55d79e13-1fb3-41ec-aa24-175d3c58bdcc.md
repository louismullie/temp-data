## Question

How to use CVP for assessing shock?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to use central venous pressure (CVP) to assess shock. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about CVP's fundamental limitations for predicting fluid responsiveness. Then, I should review correct measurement techniques and sources of error. Next, I will reframe CVP's role as a safety marker for venous congestion rather than a preload target. After that, I will integrate CVP into a multi-parameter framework with dynamic tests and perfusion markers. Then, I will operationalize this into a practical bedside algorithm. I will also consider special situations and waveform analysis, account for mechanical ventilation effects, and outline when to de-emphasize CVP in favor of better tools, before summarizing key takeaways with appropriate caveats and corrections along the way.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: absolute CVP is a poor standalone predictor of fluid responsiveness, and relying on it to decide on fluids is unsafe. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence — large meta-analyses and re-analyses show pooled correlations around 0.16–0.18 and ROC areas approximating 0.5, with no CVP threshold from 0–20 mmHg exceeding about 66% predictive value for responders or non-responders, which essentially makes it non-discriminatory in most ICU contexts [^113Huuof] [^113uTjT5] [^116WBHw8]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: very low or very high extremes might still be informative for a subset, but even then, the gray zone is large and clinical integration is mandatory [^113Huuof]. I need to ensure the clinical implication is explicit — do not use CVP alone to give or withhold fluids [^113Huuof] [^116WBHw8].

> Next, I should review measurement technique because small errors propagate into big interpretive mistakes. I need to check transducer zeroing at the phlebostatic axis, ensure the catheter tip is at the SVC–RA junction, time the reading at end-expiration, and preferably read at the base of the c-wave; I should confirm system fidelity with a square-wave flush test to avoid over- or under-damping, and recognize that digital monitor averaging can differ by a few mmHg from instantaneous values, especially with irregular respirations [^111KuF3f] [^116VQkNM]. Hold on, I should verify what to do in mechanically ventilated patients without spontaneous effort — the monitor-averaged CVP is reasonably reliable, but end-expiratory measurement aligned to minimal pleural pressure remains the reference, and respiratory mechanics can bias transmural pressure, which I must factor in during interpretation [^113X4VMQ] [^1157RQnu].

> Let me now reframe CVP's primary value: from a preload target to a venous congestion and safety marker. I need to confirm that early and persistent exposure to high CVP correlates with worse outcomes — yes, in septic shock, a time-weighted average CVP above 12 cmH2O for more than 5 hours in the first day associates with a 2.69-fold increase in 28-day mortality and more AKI, with the lowest mortality around 6–12 cmH2O, noting units are cmH2O in that study (about 0.74 mmHg per cmH2O) [^112TDx8f]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost generalized a "keep CVP < 12–15 mmHg" rule, but I should be precise: the strongest data are observational and show an association with harm above 12 cmH2O early on; this supports using CVP as a stop-signal rather than a go-signal, not as a universal numeric target [^112TDx8f] [^115RuuTG]. I should also tie this to organ perfusion physiology: mean perfusion pressure is MAP minus CVP, so a high CVP can reduce organ driving pressure and impair kidney and liver blood flow, particularly in sepsis and heart failure, reinforcing the concept of "fluid tolerance" versus "fluid responsiveness" [^117PSL7J].

> I will now integrate CVP into a multi-parameter assessment. Let me consider primary bedside signs first: capillary refill, mental status, skin mottling, blood pressure and heart rate, urine output, and lactate trends, acknowledging lactate clearance outperforms static values for prognosis and should be interpreted in shock-type context [^114jCT4Q]. Next, I should review dynamic tests that outperform static pressures: passive leg raise with real-time stroke volume or cardiac output, pulse pressure/stroke volume variation under appropriate conditions, end-expiratory occlusion tests, and ultrasound of the IVC, while remembering IVC–CVP correlations are modest and technique- and ventilation-dependent, so I should use IVC primarily as a dynamic surrogate rather than a CVP proxy [^116WBHw8] [^113KvX2Q] [^116KQfzH]. I need to ensure tissue oxygenation markers are in the loop — ScvO2, Pv–aCO2 gap, and lactate kinetics can help arbitrate adequacy of flow when CVP is high but perfusion is low, guiding toward vasoactive or inotropic strategies rather than more fluids when appropriate [^117QXttE] [^114jCT4Q].

> Let me translate this into a practical bedside algorithm, but I should double-check the safety guardrails as I go. First, during initial evaluation, I confirm hypoperfusion clinically, establish MAP targets around 65 mmHg in septic shock, and only obtain CVP if I need central access for other reasons — never to chase a CVP number by itself [^114FVuGv]. Second, for fluid responsiveness, I should not base a bolus on CVP alone; instead, I perform a PLR with real-time SV/CO monitoring and give fluids only if SV increases ≥ 10–15%, recognizing PLR conditions and measurement fidelity matter here [^116WBHw8]. Third, for safety during fluids, if CVP rises substantially without hemodynamic improvement, I stop; earlier work suggests a CVP rise > 5 mmHg during a bolus without benefit is a red flag, and although CVP changes during PLR are generally unreliable, a rise > 2 mmHg may attenuate the predictive value of PPV, which I should factor into interpretation rather than use as a primary decision rule [^111KuF3f] [^114cnDut]. Hold on, I should verify the congestion threshold — given the observational signal of harm when time-weighted average CVP exceeds 12 cmH2O early, I should pivot toward vasopressors or inotropes and consider deresuscitation when CVP remains high with ongoing hypoperfusion rather than continuing fluids, especially in septic shock or AKI-prone states [^112TDx8f] [^1161Dxiw].

> I will now examine waveform morphology and special situations, as CVP's waveform sometimes tells me more than its number. I need to check for loss of the x-descent with a prominent y-descent suggesting right ventricular dysfunction, prominent v-waves indicating tricuspid regurgitation, and blunted y-descent with equalization favoring tamponade physiology, always correlating with echocardiography and CO when possible because waveform interpretation is context sensitive [^113SUQmS] [^113SUQmS]. But wait, what if the patient has severe RV failure — then a high CVP reflects RV afterload or poor compliance rather than volume, and fluids may worsen septal shift and venous congestion; here, CVP is a congestion marker and should trigger a rethink toward reducing RV afterload and optimizing RV perfusion rather than volume expansion [^113SUQmS].

> Mechanical ventilation and transmitted pressures can confound interpretation, so I should confirm transmural rather than absolute intrathoracic pressure effects. Let me verify: PEEP and high plateau pressures elevate measured CVP without necessarily increasing transmural right atrial pressure; estimating transmural pressure using the difference between end-inspiratory and end-expiratory CVP and airway pressures can refine interpretation in select cases, though this remains a conceptual aid rather than a standardized correction at the bedside [^1157RQnu] [^111KuF3f]. I should double-check whether monitor-averaged CVP is acceptable on the vent — yes, in fully controlled ventilation it performs reasonably compared with end-expiratory manual reads, but end-expiratory values aligned to the c-wave remain ideal when accuracy is critical [^113X4VMQ].

> Recognizing when to de-emphasize CVP is just as important. If reliable dynamic indices are available and preconditions are met, I should prefer them over CVP to predict fluid responsiveness, because static filling pressures underperform and can mislead in both directions [^113Huuof] [^116WBHw8]. In scenarios with high PEEP, chronic pulmonary hypertension, or discordance between CVP and the clinical picture, I should trust the integrated assessment — perfusion, CO, dynamic tests, and congestion signs — over any single number; in trauma, for example, early shock index and pulse pressure often provide more actionable guidance than CVP for hemorrhagic shock triage and transfusion needs [^116VnLzo]. Let me consider noninvasive CVP surrogates as well — ultrasound JVP and peripheral compression sonography can correlate with invasive CVP but often underestimate or carry broad variance; they're adjuncts, not replacements for dynamic perfusion-guided resuscitation strategies [^114TRHeJ] [^112zdg4V] [^114RFpBT].

> I should confirm that positive fluid balance and elevated CVP after early resuscitation in septic shock track with worse outcomes, reinforcing the need to individualize fluids and transition early to vasopressors or deresuscitation when congestion emerges. Although one multicenter analysis is truncated in the provided text, its signal aligns with broader observations linking higher cumulative balance and higher CVP to mortality, which I should handle as associative evidence that supports cautious, goal-directed therapy rather than strict CVP targets [^115RuuTG] [^notfound]. Let me reconsider my earlier statement to prevent overreach: CVP should not be used to trigger fluids, but persistent high CVP with poor perfusion should prompt me to stop fluids and reassess for vasopressor, inotrope, or decongestive strategies depending on the phenotype of shock and ventricular function [^112TDx8f] [^1161Dxiw].

> Key takeaways I need to ensure are explicit: CVP is not a test of fluid responsiveness and should not be used in isolation for fluid decisions; it is most useful as a trend and as a safety/congestion marker, especially early in septic shock where prolonged high CVP associates with harm; dynamic tests with real-time SV/CO monitoring, perfusion targets, and organ-specific considerations should guide resuscitation; and meticulous measurement technique and context — especially mechanical ventilation and right heart pathophysiology — are non-negotiable for meaningful interpretation [^113Huuof] [^112TDx8f] [^116WBHw8] [^111KuF3f] [^117PSL7J]. Hold on, I should double-check one more nuance: extreme CVP values may still inform about limits of preload tolerance in a subset, but given the wide gray zone and multiple confounders, integrated, physiology-guided care remains the safest path forward [^114cnDut] [^112iBV7B].

---

CVP is best used in shock as a **trend and waveform tool** to help distinguish shock type and guide therapy [^113SUQmS], not as a standalone measure of volume or fluid responsiveness [^113Huuof] [^114UQbT5]. In hypovolemic shock, CVP is typically low and rises with fluids [^113SUQmS]; in cardiogenic or obstructive shock, it is elevated and may worsen with fluids, signaling the need for inotropes or relief of obstruction [^111KuF3f] [^113Huuof]. In distributive shock, CVP is often low–normal [^113Huuof] and **trends are more informative than absolutes** [^114UQbT5]. Always interpret CVP with clinical context, lactate [^114jCT4Q], ScvO2 [^117QXttE], and dynamic tests [^113Huuof], and avoid over-resuscitation when CVP is high to reduce the risk of AKI and mortality [^112TDx8f] [^115RuuTG].

---

## Physiological basis of CVP in shock

CVP reflects the interplay among venous return, right heart function, and intrathoracic pressure [^111KuF3f]; it is a **surrogate for right atrial pressure** and right ventricular preload but is also influenced by intravascular volume, venous tone, and right ventricular compliance [^113SUQmS]. In shock, these determinants are often deranged, so CVP must be interpreted in context [^117PSL7J].

---

## CVP patterns in different types of shock

| **Shock type** | **Typical CVP pattern** | **Clinical interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| Hypovolemic shock | Low CVP (< 5 mmHg) | - Indicates low preload [^114UQbT5] <br/> - CVP rises with fluids [^113SUQmS] |
| Cardiogenic shock | Elevated CVP (> 12 mmHg) | - Reflects RV/LV dysfunction [^111KuF3f] <br/> - Fluids may worsen congestion [^113SUQmS] |
| Obstructive shock | Elevated CVP (> 12 mmHg) | - Suggests tamponade, PE, or tension pneumothorax <br/> - Fluids may worsen congestion [^113SUQmS] |
| Distributive shock (e.g. septic shock) | Normal or low-normal CVP (6–12 mmHg) | - Reflects vasodilation and relative hypovolemia [^113Huuof] <br/> - Trends guide therapy [^112TDx8f] |

## Clinical utility and limitations of CVP in shock

CVP is most useful for **trend monitoring** and waveform analysis to infer right heart function and venous congestion [^113SUQmS]; **absolute values alone poorly predict fluid responsiveness** [^113Huuof]. Dynamic measures (e.g. PPV, SVV, PLR) are superior for predicting fluid responsiveness [^116WBHw8] [^114nWQTt].

---

## CVP-guided fluid resuscitation

CVP trends help titrate fluids and avoid overload [^111KuF3f]. In septic shock, **maintaining CVP within 6–12 cmH2O** in the first 24 hours is associated with lower mortality and AKI, whereas prolonged CVP > 12 cmH2O increases risk [^112TDx8f] [^115RuuTG]. However, CVP should not be the sole guide; integrate with clinical context and dynamic tests [^113Huuof].

---

## CVP waveform analysis

Waveform analysis offers **additional insights** into right heart function and venous congestion [^113SUQmS]:

- **A-wave**: Atrial contraction; absent in atrial fibrillation.
- **C-wave**: Tricuspid bulging during isovolumetric contraction.
- **V-wave**: Atrial filling against closed tricuspid; prominent in tricuspid regurgitation.
- **X-descent**: Atrial relaxation; attenuated in RV dysfunction.
- **Y-descent**: Early ventricular filling; exaggerated in RV dysfunction.

---

## Integration with other hemodynamic parameters

CVP should be integrated with other parameters to **guide therapy** [^1161Dxiw]:

- **Mean arterial pressure (MAP)**: Initial target ≥ 65 mmHg in septic shock [^114FVuGv].
- **Cardiac output (CO)**: Assessed by echocardiography or thermodilution [^117RSqrQ].
- **Lactate levels**: Marker of tissue hypoperfusion and prognostic indicator [^114jCT4Q].
- **Central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2)**: Assesses global oxygen delivery [^117QXttE].

---

## Risks and complications of CVP monitoring

CVP monitoring **carries risks**, including infection, thrombosis, and pneumothorax; strict aseptic technique and vigilant monitoring are essential [^111KuF3f].

---

## Clinical scenarios where CVP monitoring is particularly useful

CVP monitoring is especially helpful when shock is complex or mixed and the etiology is unclear, as trends in CVP values and waveforms can **aid differentiation**. It supports the assessment and ongoing monitoring of right ventricular dysfunction and helps detect and manage venous congestion that threatens organ perfusion [^117PSL7J].

---

## Summary of key recommendations

- **Use CVP trends and waveforms**: To assess right heart function and venous congestion [^113SUQmS].
- **Avoid relying on absolute CVP values**: For fluid responsiveness; use dynamic measures [^113Huuof].
- **Integrate CVP with other parameters**: MAP, CO, lactate, and ScvO2 [^114jCT4Q].
- **Maintain CVP within 6–12 cmH2O**: In septic shock to reduce mortality and AKI [^112TDx8f].
- **Be aware of risks**: Infection, thrombosis, pneumothorax; use aseptic technique.

---

CVP is a useful tool for assessing shock when used as part of a **comprehensive hemodynamic assessment** [^112oqctg]. It helps distinguish shock types, guide fluid resuscitation, and monitor response to therapy, but should not be used in isolation.

### Measurement and interpretation of central venous pressure: A narrative review [^113SUQmS]. Anaesthesia (2025). Low credibility.

Central venous pressure has been a key component of haemodynamic monitoring for several decades, but its clinical utility is still debated. While central venous pressure has been used traditionally to assess intravascular volume status and fluid responsiveness, mounting evidence suggests that its absolute value alone is an unreliable predictor of such states. This narrative review explores the historical development and physiological foundations of central venous pressure, its measurement techniques, and the available evidence regarding central venous pressure monitoring in various clinical scenarios.

- **Methods**: We conducted a literature search to identify relevant articles. The abstracts of identified articles were assessed for relevance, and their references were screened for further relevant publications.

- **Results**: We identified 229 articles, with 72 undergoing full-text extraction and data synthesis. Preliminary work in central venous pressure monitoring began in canines before early human studies and the development of Guytonian principles of haemodynamics. Physiologically, central venous pressure reflects the intraluminal pressure of the superior vena cava, with measurement significantly affected by transducer position, catheter position, and intrathoracic pressures. In right ventricular dysfunction, the central venous pressure waveform loses its x-descent as the y-descent becomes exaggerated. Central venous pressure in isolation is considered a poor predictor of volume responsiveness; however, elevated central venous pressure is linked with impaired tissue perfusion.

### Systematic review including re-analyses of 1148 individual data sets of central venous pressure as a predictor of fluid responsiveness [^113Huuof]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Central venous pressure (CVP) has been shown to have poor predictive value for fluid responsiveness in critically ill patients. We aimed to re-evaluate this in a larger sample subgrouped by baseline CVP values.

- **Methods**: In April 2015, we systematically searched and included all clinical studies evaluating the value of CVP in predicting fluid responsiveness. We contacted investigators for patient data sets and subgrouped data as lower (12 mmHg) baseline CVP.

- **Results**: We included 51 studies; in the majority, mean/median CVP values were in the intermediate range (8–12 mmHg) in both fluid responders and non-responders. In an analysis of patient data sets (n = 1148) from 22 studies, the area under the receiver operating curve was above 0.50 in the 12 mmHg CVP groups, in which the lower 95% CI crossed 0.50. We identified some positive and negative predictive values for fluid responsiveness for specific low and high values of CVP, respectively, but none of the predictive values were above 66% for any CVPs from 0 to 20 mmHg. There were less data on higher CVPs, in particular > 15 mmHg, making the estimates on predictive values less precise for higher CVP.

- **Conclusions**: Most studies evaluating fluid responsiveness reported mean/median CVP values in the intermediate range of 8–12 mmHg, both in responders and non-responders. In a re-analysis of 1148 patient data sets, specific lower and higher CVP values had some positive and negative predictive value.

### Early persistent exposure to high CVP is associated with increased mortality and AKI in septic shock: A retrospective study [^112TDx8f]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the association between exposure to different intensities of central venous pressure (CVP) over time in patients with septic shock, 28-day mortality, and acute kidney injury (AKI).

Data were obtained from the AmsterdamUMCdb, which includes information on patients aged 18 years and older with septic shock undergoing CVP monitoring. The primary outcome was mortality by day 28. Piecewise exponential additive mixed models were used to estimate the strength of the association over time.

A total of 9668 patients were included in the study. They exhibited an overall mortality rate of 8.2% at 28 days and an AKI incidence of 41.1%. The daily time-weighted average CVP was strongly associated with increased mortality at 28 days, primarily within 24 hours of ICU admission. The mortality rate of patients was lowest when the CVP was 6–12 cmH₂O. When the time of high CVP (TWA-CVP > 12 cmH₂O) exposure within the first 24 hours exceeded 5 hours, the risk of death increased by 2.69-fold. Additionally, patients exposed to high CVP had a significantly increased risk of developing AKI.

The conclusion indicates that the optimal CVP range for patients with septic shock within 24 hours of ICU admission is 6–12 cmH₂O. Mortality increased when patients were exposed to high CVP for more than 5 hours.

### Prospective evaluation of intravascular volume status in critically ill patients: Does inferior vena cava collapsibility correlate with central venous pressure [^113KvX2Q]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

In search of a standardized noninvasive assessment of intravascular volume status, we prospectively compared the sonographic inferior vena cava collapsibility index (IVC-CI) and central venous pressures (CVPs). Our goals included the determination of CVP behavior across clinically relevant IVC-CI ranges, examination of unitary behavior of IVC-CI with changes in CVP, and estimation of the effect of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on the IVC-CI/CVP relationship.

- **Methods**: A prospective, observational study was performed in surgical/medical intensive care unit patients between October 2009 and July 2013. Patients underwent repeated sonographic evaluations of IVC-CI. Demographics, illness severity, ventilatory support, CVP, and patient positioning were recorded. Correlations were made between CVP groupings (< 7, 7–12, 12–18, 19+) and IVC-CI ranges (< 25, 25–49, 50–74, 75+). Comparison of CVP (2-unit quanta) and IVC-CI (5-unit quanta) was performed, followed by assessment of per-unit ΔIVC-CI/ΔCVP behavior as well as examination of the effect of PEEP on the IVC-CI/CVP relationship.

- **Results**: We analyzed 320 IVC-CI/CVP measurement pairs from 79 patients (mean [SD] age, 55.8 [16.8] years; 64.6% male; mean [SD] Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, 11.7 [6.21]). Continuous data for IVC-CI/CVP correlated poorly (R = 0.177, p < 0.01) and were inversely proportional, with CVP less than 7 noted in approximately 10% of the patients for IVC-CIs less than 25% and CVP less than 7 observed in approximately 85% of patients for IVC-CIs greater than or equal to 75%.

### Consensus on circulatory shock and hemodynamic monitoring. Task force of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^117RSqrQ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Transpulmonary thermodilution devices are considered to be less invasive than the PAC, but they still require insertion of a CVC and femoral arterial catheter. These devices combine transpulmonary thermodilution and pulse contour analysis. Transpulmonary thermodilution provides intermittent measurements of cardiac output following a cold bolus injection into a central vein and detection of changes in the blood temperature in the femoral artery. The technique has been compared favorably with pulmonary thermodilution in critically ill patients, including some in shock. Transpulmonary thermodilution also provides intermittent measurements of global end-diastolic volume, a volumetric marker of cardiac preload; cardiac function index, a marker of systolic function of the heart; and extravascular lung water, a quantitative index of pulmonary edema.

- **Arterial pulse wave analysis**: This measures cardiac output by placing sensors directly into the femoral artery catheter, which record the arterial pressure waveform. Determination of pulse contour cardiac output uses proprietary algorithms based on the relationship between stroke volume and arterial pressure waveform, which is influenced by the resistive and elastic characteristics of the arterial system. Intermittent transpulmonary thermodilution cardiac output measurements are used to calibrate the pulse contour cardiac output, and good agreement with thermodilution cardiac output has been reported in hemodynamically unstable patients.

### Noninvasive central venous pressure measurement by controlled compression sonography at the forearm [^114RFpBT]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

We sought to validate a new noninvasive technique to determine central venous pressure (CVP) using high-resolution compression sonography. Information concerning CVP is crucial in clinical situations, including cardiac failure, volume overload, and sepsis. However, the measurement of CVP typically requires puncture of a vein, which carries risk of complications.

After a proof-of-concept study in healthy subjects, a prospective blinded evaluation was undertaken. This compared CVP measurements using a central venous catheter against measurements using compression sonography in critically ill patients in an intensive care unit.

In healthy subjects with experimentally induced venous hypertension across a wide range of pressure values, a strong correlation (r = 0.95; p < 0.001) was observed between noninvasive and invasive peripheral venous pressure at the forearm. Furthermore, high interobserver agreement with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.988 demonstrated excellent reliability of the system. In 50 intensive care unit patients, noninvasive peripheral venous pressure measurement at the forearm showed good correlation with CVP with the forearm positioned both below heart level (r = 0.84; p < 0.001) and at heart level (r = 0.85; p < 0.001). The mean difference between invasive and noninvasive measurement was negligible (-0.1 ± 3.5 cm H2O and -0.7 ± 3.4 cm H2O, respectively).

Controlled compression sonography proves to be a valuable tool for measuring venous pressure in peripheral veins, allowing reliable indirect assessment of CVP without the need for intravenous catheterization.

### The surviving sepsis campaign: Fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^116JnXM9]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

There are several gaps in our understanding and directions for future research related to fluid resuscitation in sepsis management.

- **Should we individualize the initial amount of fluid resuscitation, and if so, how**: Applying a standard fluid dose to all patients with sepsis is inconsistent with other areas of sepsis management, where efforts are made to personalize care where possible. What alternative strategies can be readily used in clinical practice to individualize the initial amount of fluid resuscitation to maximize benefit and reduce harms?

- **Which variables should be used to titrate fluid resuscitation**: Rigorous trials comparing various dynamic and static variables to evaluate fluid responsiveness are needed. Furthermore, testing various dynamic variables in subgroups of patients with sepsis would be informative. Trials should be designed to incorporate multiple methods of assessing fluid responsiveness.

- **What is the optimal timing for fluid resuscitation**: After rapid identification of sepsis and septic shock, time-series studies of fluid resuscitation are needed, especially evaluating the benefits and harms of additional therapies, such as vasopressors, and their respective interplay.

- **Which variables should be used to trigger fluid resuscitation and deresuscitation**: Related to the timing of fluid resuscitation, should a particular set of physiologic variables be assessed in a serial fashion to determine when to shift from resuscitation to deresuscitation in a structured manner?

- **Is a combined approach using several indices of fluid responsiveness better than using a single measurement in isolation?**

### Advances in monitoring and management of shock [^115nCzsQ]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Early recognition and treatment of pediatric shock, regardless of its cause, decrease mortality and improve outcomes. In addition to conventional parameters, such as heart rate, systolic blood pressure, urine output, and central venous pressure, biomarkers and noninvasive methods of measuring cardiac output are available to monitor and treat shock. This article emphasizes that fluid resuscitation is the cornerstone of shock resuscitation, although the choice and amount of fluid may vary based on the cause of shock. Other emerging treatments for shock, such as temperature control and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or ventricular assist devices, are also discussed.

### Optimizing oxygen delivery in the critically ill: Assessment of volume responsiveness in the septic patient [^116WBHw8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Assessing volume responsiveness, defined as an increase in cardiac index after infusion of fluids, is important when caring for critically ill patients in septic shock, as both under- and over-resuscitation can worsen outcomes. This review article describes the currently available methods of assessing volume responsiveness for critically ill patients in the emergency department, with a focus on patients in septic shock.

- **Objective**: The single-pump model of the circulation utilizing cardiac-filling pressures is reviewed in detail. Additionally, the dual-pump model evaluating cardiopulmonary interactions both invasively and noninvasively will be described.

- **Discussion**: Cardiac filling pressures (central venous pressure and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure) have poor performance characteristics when used to predict volume responsiveness. Cardiopulmonary interaction assessments (inferior vena cava distensibility/collapsibility, systolic pressure variation, pulse pressure variation, stroke volume variation, and aortic flow velocities) have superior test characteristics when measured either invasively or noninvasively.

- **Conclusion**: Cardiac filling pressures may be misleading if used to determine volume responsiveness. Assessment of cardiopulmonary interactions has superior performance characteristics and should be preferentially used for septic shock patients in the emergency department.

### Hemodynamic pressure waveform analysis in predicting fluid responsiveness [^115vXZiD]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the usefulness of central venous pressure (CVP), diastolic right ventricular pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) waveform analysis in predicting fluid responsiveness.

- **Design**: A prospective observational study conducted in a tertiary care university hospital.

- **Patients**: Forty-four patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were considered.

- **Interventions**: The study involved analyzing the a/v wave ratio of the PCWP, CVP, and right ventricular dP/dt to predict an increase in stroke volume of more than 15% following the administration of 500 mL of colloid.

- **Measurements and main results**: Out of the forty-four patients enrolled, seven were excluded, resulting in 24 responders and 13 nonresponders. No differences in mean CVP and PCWP values between responders and nonresponders were found. The only parameter significantly associated with a response to volume infusion was the a/v wave ratio of the PCWP tracing (p = 0.0001). The performance of the a/v wave ratio greater than 1 for the PCWP tracing in predicting fluid responsiveness was evaluated by constructing a receiver operating characteristic curve, with an area under the curve of 0.89 (95% confidence interval, 0.79–0.99; p < 0.05).

The conclusions drawn indicated that the a/v ratio measured on the PCWP tracing is a predictor of fluid responsiveness in patients with preserved left ventricular function undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.

### Assessment of central venous physiology of Fontan circulation using peripheral venous pressure [^1153RUeo]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Elevated central venous pressure is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after the Fontan operation. The difference between mean circulatory filling pressure and central venous pressure, a driving force of venous return, is important in determining dynamic changes in central venous pressure in response to changes in ventricular properties or loading conditions. Thus, noninvasive central venous pressure and mean circulatory filling pressure estimation may contribute to optimal management in patients undergoing the Fontan operation. We tested the hypothesis that central venous pressure and mean circulatory filling pressure in those undergoing the Fontan operation can be simply estimated using peripheral venous pressure and arm equilibrium pressure, respectively.

- **Methods**: This study included 30 patients after the Fontan operation who underwent cardiac catheterization (median 8.6, 3.4–42 years). Peripheral venous pressure was measured at the peripheral vein in the upper extremities. Mean circulatory filling pressure was calculated by the changes of arterial pressure and central venous pressure during the Valsalva maneuver. Arm equilibrium pressure was measured as equilibrated venous pressure by rapidly inflating a blood pressure cuff to 200 mm Hg.

- **Results**: Central venous pressure and peripheral venous pressure were highly correlated (central venous pressure = 1.6 + 0.68 × peripheral venous pressure, R = 0.86, P < .0001). Stepwise multivariable regression analysis showed that only peripheral venous pressure was a significant determinant of central venous pressure.

Central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO₂), venous and arterial blood carbon dioxide partial pressure difference (Pv-aCO₂), the venous-arterial blood carbon dioxide partial pressure difference/arterial-venous oxygen content difference ratio (Pv-aCO₂/Ca-vO₂), and lactate are important parameters employed during shock resuscitation.

ScvO₂ is associated with global tissue oxygenation, which can reflect the global balance between arterial O₂ delivery and O₂ consumption. If the value is low, anaerobic metabolism may arise. It has proven useful for hemodynamic management and was recommended as one of the early resuscitation goals in the 2012 sepsis guidelines. Although ScvO₂ was removed from early resuscitation goals in the 2016 sepsis guidelines, it remains a useful clinical parameter. A ΔScvO₂ threshold value of 5.0% discriminates fluid responders from non-responders with a sensitivity of 0.78 and specificity of 0.95. Moreover, ScvO₂ can also predict the success of a spontaneous breathing trial.

Pv-aCO₂ is another possible marker of tissue perfusion. According to the Fick equation, Pv-aCO₂ is inversely related to cardiac output. A normal Pv-aCO₂ < 5 mmHg can be used as an adjunctive hemodynamic parameter to exclude tissue hypoperfusion in patients undergoing major surgery. Pv-aCO₂ can also help clinicians make decisions regarding the provision of therapy aimed at increasing cardiac output.

The Pv-aCO₂/Ca-vO₂ ratio was shown to be a good indicator of…

### Consensus on circulatory shock and hemodynamic monitoring. Task force of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^1161Dxiw]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

When tissue perfusion is judged inadequate, therapeutic interventions aimed at improving perfusion can be considered. Vasopressors, together with fluid resuscitation, are often needed to restore blood pressure. The question then arises of how to select between the manipulation of preload (fluids), inotropic stimulation, and modulation of afterload to improve flow and perfusion. Clinical examination is often of limited value in this context.

The detection of preload responsiveness can be achieved through the use of several different indices. However, the presence of preload responsiveness does not necessarily imply that fluids can be administered safely or that they should be administered at all. Determination of filling pressures, measured invasively by pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) or estimated non-invasively by echocardiography, and measurements of extravascular lung water with transpulmonary thermodilution provide important information on the risks associated with fluid administration (see "Monitoring Preload and Fluid Responsiveness" for further details).

### Central venous pressure: current uses and prospects for an old parameter [^112iBV7B]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Despite being a pivotal parameter in hemodynamic management, central venous pressure (CVP) fell out of favor when several meta-analyses demonstrated its inability to predict fluid responsiveness (FR). CVP is measured in the superior vena cava via a jugular or subclavian catheter and serves as a surrogate for right atrial pressure (RAP). Zeroing to the midpoint of the right atrium ('phlebostatic axis') is crucial since even small differences may induce high variability in measured values. Measurement is ideally performed at end-expiration at minimal intrathoracic pressure, at the base of the c-wave. The CVP displayed by the monitor provides a reasonable estimation in spontaneously breathing patients (SBP), with irregular respiratory patterns. Beyond the value, the appearance of the waveform can offer diagnostic insights into various pathologies. There may be three distinct uses:

### Intravascular volume therapy in adults: Guidelines from the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany [^114UQbT5]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

For a long time, central venous pressure (CVP) formed part of basic routine monitoring for critically ill patients. Over the past few years, studies with various patient groups have shown repeatedly that the correlation of changes in CVP and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure with changes in cardiac output is at best very poor and at worst entirely absent, and that the measurement of the CVP has only minimal predictive power in determining the status of intravascular volume. The underlying reason for this is that CVP is dependent on a broad spectrum of factors, including intravascular volume, peripheral vascular tone, right ventricular compliance, pulmonary vascular resistance, and intrathoracic pressure (in ventilated patients).

Although low CVP may indeed indicate a volume deficit, elevated CVP is equally unable to exclude the presence of volume depletion. By way of illustration, an elevated CVP is possible in the event of right-sided heart failure, pulmonary embolism, cardiac tamponade, tension pneumothorax, or hypervolemia. In a much-cited study on early goal-oriented sepsis therapy, Rivers et al. were able to demonstrate a significant reduction in mortality by specifying a CVP target value between 8 and 12 mmHg. It should be noted that CVP in this study was utilised only as part of a pool of multiple haemodynamic target criteria. Accordingly, isolated evaluation of CVP in the context of this study is not possible.

In a prospective observational study in patients with septic shock (n = 25), CVP, shock index, and cardiac index were measured.

### Consensus on circulatory shock and hemodynamic monitoring. Task force of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^112FQijG]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the hemodynamic management of patients with circulatory shock and their implications for management were developed in 2006 by a team of 25 experts in the field of shock and a jury of 11 individuals representing five critical care societies. In these guidelines, five specific questions were addressed:

- **Epidemiologic and pathophysiologic features**: What are the epidemiologic and pathophysiologic features of shock in the intensive care unit (ICU)?

- **Monitoring preload and fluid responsiveness**: Should we monitor preload and fluid responsiveness in shock?

- **Monitoring stroke volume or cardiac output**: How and when should we monitor stroke volume or cardiac output in shock?

- **Markers of regional and microcirculation**: What markers of the regional and microcirculation can be monitored, and how can cellular function be assessed in shock?

- **Evidence for using hemodynamic monitoring**: What is the evidence for using hemodynamic monitoring to direct therapy in shock?

Since the publication of the 2006 guidelines, data from several observational and randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have been published that provide new evidence for the optimal management of patients with circulatory shock. In this paper, the term shock refers to circulatory shock.

### Consensus on circulatory shock and hemodynamic monitoring. Task force of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^115PFtM6]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Circulatory shock is a life-threatening syndrome resulting in multiorgan failure and a high mortality rate. The aim of this consensus is to provide support to the bedside clinician regarding the diagnosis, management, and monitoring of shock.

The European Society of Intensive Care Medicine invited 12 experts to form a Task Force to update a previous consensus (Antonelli et al.: Intensive Care Med 33:575–590, 2007). The same five questions addressed in the earlier consensus were used as the outline for the literature search and review, with the aim of the Task Force to produce statements based on the available literature and evidence. These questions were:

1. What are the epidemiologic and pathophysiologic features of shock in the intensive care unit?
2. Should we monitor preload and fluid responsiveness in shock?
3. How and when should we monitor stroke volume or cardiac output in shock?
4. What markers of the regional and microcirculation can be monitored, and how can cellular function be assessed in shock?
5. What is the evidence for using hemodynamic monitoring to direct therapy in shock?

Four types of statements were used: definition, recommendation, best practice, and statement of fact.

Forty-four statements were made. The main new statements include:

- **Individualizing blood pressure targets**:
	- Statements on setting personalized blood pressure targets for patients.

- **Assessment and prediction of fluid responsiveness**:
	- Insights into assessing and predicting how patients will respond to fluid administration.

- **Use of echocardiography and hemodynamic monitoring**:
	- Guidelines on employing echocardiography and other hemodynamic monitoring methods.

This consensus provides 44 statements that can be used at the bedside.

### Elevated central venous pressure is associated with increased mortality in pediatric septic shock patients [^117UExxz]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Central venous pressure (CVP) is an important factor affecting capillary blood flow, and it is associated with poor outcomes in adult septic shock patients. However, whether a similar association exists in pediatric patients remains unclear.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively analyzed data from patients admitted to our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) between February 2009 and July 2015. Patients were divided into two groups — survivors and nonsurvivors — according to 28-day mortality. The associations between (a) mortality and CVP at 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours after initiating treatment for established septic shock were analyzed and (b) initial serum lactic acid levels and 6-hour CVP.

- **Results**: Two hundred twenty-six patients were included in this study, and the mortality rate was 29.6% (67 deaths, nonsurvivor group). Initial serum lactic acid levels, Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) III score, and Vasoactive-Inotropic score (VIS) within 24 hours after PICU admission were significantly higher in the nonsurvivors than in survivors (1.3 [0.9, 2.4] vs. 3.9 [1.6, 8.0] mmol/l, 11.0 [7.0, 15.0] vs. 17.0 [10.0, 21.5], 12.0 [7.0, 25.0] vs. 22.5 [8.0, 55.0], respectively with p-values < 0.001, < 0.001, and 0.009, respectively). In addition, compared to survivors, a greater percentage of nonsurvivors required mechanical ventilation (92.5% vs. 51.6%, p < 0.001) and showed a greater extent of fluid overload at 48 hours after admission (3.9% vs. 1.9%, p = 0.006), along with higher 6-hour CVP (10.0 [7.0, 16.0] vs. 8.0 [5.0, 11.0] mmHg, p < 0.001).

### The intrathoracic blood volume index as an indicator of fluid responsiveness in critically ill patients with acute circulatory failure: a comparison with central venous pressure [^111jXGUG]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2008). Low credibility.

The intrathoracic blood volume index (ITBVI) and central venous pressure (CVP) are routinely used to predict fluid responsiveness in critically ill patients with acute circulatory failure, characterized by systolic blood pressure changes of 15% or more. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated for ITBVI and CVP.

- **Results**: Fluid challenge induced a stroke index increase of 15% or more in 18 (51%) patients (responders). At baseline, no studied hemodynamic variables were different between responders and nonresponders. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were 0.64 [95% CI: 0.46–0.80] for ITBVI and 0.68 [95% CI: 0.50–0.83] for CVP, without any statistical difference (P = 0.73). The best cut-off values for CVP and ITBVI were 9 mm Hg (sensitivity = 61%; specificity = 82%) and 928 mL·m⁻² (sensitivity = 78%; specificity = 53%).

- **Conclusion**: ITBVI is similar to CVP in its ability to predict fluid responsiveness in critically ill patients with acute circulatory failure.

### Central venous pressure monitoring via peripherally or centrally inserted central catheters: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115rBmQp]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2017). Low credibility.

The central venous pressure (CVP) is the most commonly used static marker of preload for guiding fluid therapy in critically ill patients, though its usefulness remains controversial. Centrally inserted central catheters (CICCs) are the gold-standard devices for CVP monitoring, but peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) may represent a valid alternative. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis with the aim to investigate whether the difference between PICC- and CICC-measured CVP is not significant.

- **Methods**: We searched for clinical studies published in PubMed and EMBASE databases from inception until December 21, 2016. We included studies providing data on paired and simultaneous CVP measurement from PICCs and CICCs. We conducted two analyses on the values of CVP: the first one according to the total number of CVP assessments, the second one considering the number of patients recruited.

- **Results**: Four studies matched the inclusion criteria, but only three of them provided data for the meta-analyses. Both analyses showed non-significant differences between PICC-measured and CICC-measured CVP: 1489 paired simultaneous CVP assessments (MD 0.16, 95% CI -0.14, 0.45, p = 0.30) on a total of 57 patients (MD 0.22, 95% CI -1.46, 1.91, p = 0.80). Both analyses showed no heterogeneity (I² = 0%).

- **Conclusions**: Available evidence supports that CVP monitoring with PICCs is accurate and reproduces similar values to those obtained from CICCs. The possibility to monitor CVP should not be used among clinical criteria for preferring a CICC over a PICC line.

### Consensus on circulatory shock and hemodynamic monitoring. Task Force of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^116YkpPa]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

An international team of 12 experts in the field of shock was invited by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine to form a Task Force to evaluate new evidence and to revise the guidelines as judged appropriate. Four types of statements were used for the consensus: statements of facts, recommendations, best practice, and definitions (for example, definition of shock).

Statements of facts are used to summarize an important topic discussed in the consensus when facts, rather than actions, are discussed and agreed upon.

Indications to act or not to act on a specific issue are written in the form of a "recommendation" or "best practice statement". Although the formal GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) system of evidence review with the generation of evidence profiles was not conducted, the Task Force members took into account the principles of the GRADE system in making their recommendations. This system classifies recommendations as strong (Level 1) or weak (Level 2) based on the certainty of Task Force members that following a given recommendation will result in more good than harm.

Panelists were also aware that the strength of the GRADE system recommendation depends on the quality of underlying evidence (certainty in the estimates of effects), balance of benefits and harms, costs, values, and preferences of the interested parties. A specific recommendation was issued when the panel judged that there was either no reasonable alternative or sufficient indirect reasoning not to commit time and resources.

### Comparison of different techniques of central venous pressure measurement in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients [^113X4VMQ]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Several techniques exist for measuring central venous pressure (CVP), but little information is available about the accuracy of each method. This study aimed to compare different methods of CVP measurements in mechanically ventilated patients.

- **Methods**: CVP was measured in mechanically ventilated patients without spontaneous breathing using four different techniques: 1) end-expiratory CVP measurement at the base of the "c" wave (CVP MEASURED), chosen as the reference method; 2) CVP measurement from the monitor averaging CVP over the cardiac and respiratory cycles (CVP MONITOR); 3) CVP measurement following a transient withdrawing of mechanical ventilation (CVP NADIR); 4) CVP measurement corrected for the transmitted respiratory pressure induced by intrinsic PEEP (calculated CVP: CVP CALCULATED). Bias, precision, limits of agreement, and proportions of outliers (difference > 2 mm Hg) were determined.

- **Results**: Among 61 included patients, 103 CVP assessments were performed. CVP MONITOR bias [-0.87(1.06) mm Hg] was significantly different from those of CVP CALCULATED [1.42(1.07), P < 0.001] and CVP NADIR [1.04(1.29), P < 0.001]. The limits of agreement of CVP MONITOR [-2.96 to 1.21 mm Hg] were not significantly different from those of CVP NADIR (-1.49 to 3.57 mm Hg, P = 0.39) and CVP CALCULATED (-0.68 to 3.53 mm Hg, P = 0.31). The proportion of outliers was not significantly different between CVP MONITOR (n = 5, 5%) and CVP NADIR (n = 9, 9%, P = 0.27), but was greater with CVP CALCULATED (n = 16, 15%, P = 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: In mechanically ventilated patients, CVP MONITOR is a reliable method for assessing central venous pressure.

### Quantitative assessment of cardiac load-responsiveness during extracorporeal life support: Case and rationale [^1156QXaw]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

In the case presented here, central venous pressure and DFI showed comparable changes in response to ELS reduction and indicated similar changes in cardiac load-responsiveness. Central venous pressure measurement, however, depends on catheter placement, i.e. the location of pressure measurement (jugular vein, caval veins, atrium). When pressure is measured near the inlet of the venous ELS cannula, a change in central venous pressure read-out will, along with hydrostatic pressure, also reflect the rate of suction by the ELS circuit, rather than cardiac preload. Therefore, changes in central venous pressure may in some cases not reflect true changes in cardiac preload. The DFI is a measure of on-pump venous volume, and changes in DFI during reduced unloading (i.e. reduced ELS flow) could be a more reliable measure than central venous pressure. We previously found that DFI is more sensitive to small changes in venous volume than pump inlet pressure/central venous pressure. Therefore, if a reliable central venous pressure is unavailable, DFI can be an alternative to assess cardiac load-responsiveness during ELS.

We are aware that we show only a single case in which the DFI was used to support the regular hemodynamic monitoring. More clinical investigations are necessary to establish the additional value of the DFI in the presence of regular ICU parameters. Considering the ease-of-use of DFI measurement and the promising findings in this patient, we intend to study regular DFI measurement in patients assisted by ELS, which, considering the incidence of ELS, will likely require further investigation.

### Consensus on circulatory shock and hemodynamic monitoring. Task force of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^112GbGKW]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The PAC can also provide intermittent or continuous measurements of SvO₂ and intermittent measurements of PvCO₂; both variables are helpful in assessing the adequacy of cardiac output for oxygen (O₂) utilization and for the clearance of carbon dioxide (CO₂) produced by cellular metabolism.

The main limitation of the PAC is its invasiveness, which partly explains the decline in its use over the past decade as less invasive hemodynamic techniques have developed. Nevertheless, the PAC can still be beneficial for managing shock states that are refractory to initial treatment, especially those with RV dysfunction or complex circulatory conditions where knowledge of PAP, PAOP, and oxygenation parameters is crucial for identifying the main disorders. Monitoring with a PAC is common in the ICU setting despite the lack of high-quality data supporting its benefits. While the availability of cardiac output and other hemodynamic variables obtained using a PAC can enhance the diagnosis and management of circulatory instability, the device can also cause complications, provide inaccurate measurements, and present difficulties in data interpretation.

Published evidence on the use of PACs in the ICU is conflicting, with some early non-randomized trials suggesting increased mortality and morbidity rates and longer hospital stays. The results of a prospective study with propensity-matched groups showed that patients receiving a PAC had a higher 30-day mortality rate, higher hospital costs, and increased ICU stay duration.

### Central venous pressure: A useful but not so simple measurement [^111KuF3f]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: To review the clinical use of central venous pressure measurements.

- **Data sources**: The Medline database, biographies of selected articles, and the author's personal database.

- **Data synthesis**: Four basic principles must be considered. Pressure measurements with fluid-filled systems are made relative to an arbitrary reference point. The pressure that is important for preload of the heart is the transmural pressure, whereas the pressure relative to the atmosphere still affects other vascular beds outside the thorax. The central venous pressure is dependent upon the interaction of cardiac function and return function. There is a plateau to the cardiac function curve, and once it is reached, further volume loading will not increase cardiac output.

- **Conclusions**: If careful attention is paid to proper measurement techniques, central venous pressure can be very useful clinically. However, the physiologic or pathophysiological significance of the central venous pressure should be considered only with a corresponding measurement of cardiac output or at least a surrogate measure of cardiac output.

### Assessing volume status [^115aYvRV]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Shock is a physiologic state associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. The clinician has several tools available to evaluate volume status. Each modality has its benefits and limitations, but, at the time of writing, no one test can indicate with 100% accuracy which patients will be truly volume responsive. Although the search for the Holy Grail of a perfect intravascular monitor continues, we must remember the importance of early, aggressive, and goal-directed interventions for patients in shock. Finally, there is no substitute for the most important intervention — the frequent presence of the physician at the patient's bedside.

### Central venous pressure: current uses and prospects for an old parameter [^114cnDut]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Potential applications for central venous pressure (CVP) in hemodynamic management are being explored. Given its physiological basis and reasoning by a so-called gray zone approach, extreme CVP values may help define preload limits for approximately one-third of patients receiving mechanical ventilation (MV). Very low CVP values may indicate low cardiac preload, whereas high values suggest that fluid administration could be potentially harmful.

However, this has not been demonstrated conclusively in clinical settings, as absolute CVP values do not effectively discriminate between fluid responders (FR) and non-responders. Additionally, changes in CVP during passive leg raising (PLR) or heart–lung interactions are unreliable for this purpose. Despite these challenges, Lakhal et al. suggested that an increase in CVP of more than 2 mmHg during PLR may enhance the predictive value of pulse pressure variation observed during the same maneuver.

CVP also plays a crucial role as a downstream pressure for organs, as it is key in venous return. High CVP is associated with worse outcomes, raising the question of whether specific CVP thresholds should prompt interventions to reduce it. This approach aims for the lowest feasible CVP while maintaining adequate cardiac output (CO). The feasibility of this approach has been explored in specific settings. In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a restrictive strategy guided by CVP after stabilization was linked to shorter MV duration. Clinically, the decision to continue fluid administration in a patient showing congestion signs, despite preload dependency, warrants early re-evaluation to avoid potential harm.

Finally, CVP may be utilized to assess venous congestion in the setting of right ventricular (RV) failure, a condition often marked by preload unresponsiveness and independently associated with increased mortality.

### Fluid resuscitation in septic shock: A positive fluid balance and elevated central venous pressure are associated with increased mortality [^115RuuTG]. Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The objective was to determine whether central venous pressure and fluid balance after resuscitation for septic shock are associated with mortality.

- **Design**: We conducted a retrospective review of the use of intravenous fluids during the first four days of care.

- **Setting**: Multicenter randomized controlled trial.

- **Patients**: The Vasopressin in Septic Shock Trial (VASST) study enrolled 778 patients who had septic shock and were receiving a minimum of 5 μg of norepinephrine per minute.

- **Interventions**: None.

- **Measurements and main results**: Based on net fluid balance, we determined whether one's fluid balance quartile correlated with 28-day mortality. We also analyzed whether fluid balance was predictive of central venous pressure and further whether a guideline-recommended central venous pressure of 8–12 mm Hg yielded a mortality advantage. At enrollment, which occurred on average 12 hours after presentation, the average fluid balance was +4.2 L. By day four, the cumulative average fluid balance was +11 L. After correcting for age and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, a more positive fluid balance at both 12 hours and day four correlated significantly with increased mortality. Central venous pressure was correlated with fluid balance at 12 hours; however, on days one to four, there was no significant correlation. At 12 hours, patients with central venous pressure 12 mm Hg.

### Measurement and interpretation of central venous pressure: a narrative review [^113uTjT5]. Anaesthesia (2025). Low credibility.

This conflicting evidence culminated in a 1971 editorial concluding: "there is, in fact, ample evidence that changes in blood volume may be reflected in changes of CVP and, that fluid replacement based on CVP measurement may be the best way to treat acute hypovolaemia". Subsequent clinical approaches generally considered CVP an independent variable, leading to a focus on utilizing CVP as an indicator of volume status and fluid responsiveness. Contemporary evidence suggests CVP reflects poorly the adequacy of cardiac preload — consistent with the observations of Ryan and Howland — and is a poor predictor of fluid responsiveness in patients who are critically ill.

A 2013 meta-analysis including 43 studies and 1802 participants (including healthy volunteers, patients in the intensive care unit, and patients undergoing major surgery) obtained a summary correlation coefficient between CVP and the change in stroke volume or cardiac index in response to a fluid challenge of 0.18 (95% CI 0.10–0.25), concluding CVP is unable to predict fluid responsiveness in the assessed cohorts. This builds on a 2008 meta-analysis by the same group, who analyzed CVP and fluid therapy (then including 24 studies involving 803 patients) which also concluded that CVP correlated poorly with measured blood volume and has limited accuracy when guiding fluid therapy decisions, particularly in dynamic settings (pooled correlation coefficient 0.16, 95% CI 0.03–0.28).

Similarly, a 2016 systematic review of 51 studies and re-analysis of over 1000 patient datasets concluded that CVP value in isolation is a poor indicator of fluid status.

### Central venous waveform analysis and cardiac output in a porcine model of endotoxemic hypotension and resuscitation [^113HoB3b]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2023). Low credibility.

Cardiac output (CO) is a valuable proxy for perfusion and governs volume responsiveness during resuscitation from distributive shock. The underappreciated venous system has nuanced physiology that provides valuable hemodynamic information. In this investigation, deconvolution of the central venous waveform by the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) algorithm was performed to assess its ability to constitute a CO surrogate in a porcine model of endotoxemia-induced distributive hypotension and resuscitation.

- **Study design**: Ten pigs were anesthetized, catheterized, and intubated. A lipopolysaccharide infusion protocol was used to precipitate low systemic vascular resistance hypotension. Four crystalloid boluses (10 cc/kg) were then given in succession. After administration, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, thermodilution-derived CO, central venous pressure (CVP), and the central venous waveform were collected, with the latter undergoing fast Fourier transformation analysis. The amplitude of the fundamental frequency of the central venous waveform's cardiac wave (f0-CVP) was obtained. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, CVP, f0-CVP, and CO were plotted over the course of the boluses to determine whether f0-CVP tracked with CO better than the vital signs or than CVP itself.

- **Results**: Distributive hypotension to a 25% mean arterial pressure decrement was achieved, with decreased systemic vascular resistance (mean 918 ± 227 [SD] dyne/s/cm-5 vs 685 ± 180 dyne/s/cm-5; p = 0.038). Full hemodynamic parameters characterizing this model were reported. Slopes of linear regression lines of hemodynamic measures were analyzed, but further details appear to be truncated.

### Central venous pressure: Current uses and prospects for an old parameter [^1157RQnu]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Under physiological circumstances, transmural CVP (tCVP) is a good estimation of the transmural right ventricular (RV) diastolic pressure. During mechanical ventilation (MV), the effect of transmitted intrathoracic pressure on the CVP should be considered. This may be estimated by applying an analogous method to the one proposed by Teboul et al. for estimating transpulmonary artery wedge pressure, where ∆CVP is the difference between peak-inspiratory and end-expiratory CVP, Pplat is the end-inspiratory airway pressure, and PEEP is the positive end-expiratory pressure.

As a surrogate of RV filling pressure, high tCVP indicates either supraphysiological RV overdistension or reduced diastolic compliance. The consequence would be a decrease in venous return (VR) and potential overdistension upstream (venous congestion). In critical care, MV commonly elevates CVP by increasing RV afterload and should not be automatically interpreted as myocardial dysfunction or hypervolemia. In a recent study, among 518 MV patients, those with RV dysfunction (RVD) had significantly higher CVP. CVP showed good accuracy in identifying a combined endpoint of RVD and venous congestion (AUC = 0.839), with an optimal cutoff of 10 mmHg, but was less reliable for general RVD. A large gray zone (9–12 mmHg) limits its predictive value to diagnose RVD but may make it useful to rule out RV failure (i.e. RV dilatation with congestion).

### An in vitro study comparing a peripherally inserted central catheter to a conventional central venous catheter: No difference in static and dynamic pressure transmission [^112WTJEv]. BMC Anesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

Early goal-directed therapy improves survival in patients with septic shock. Central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring is essential to guide adequate resuscitation. The use of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) is increasing, but limited data exists comparing a PICC to a conventional CVP catheter. We studied the accuracy of a novel PICC to transmit static and dynamic pressures in vitro.

- **Methods**: We designed a device to generate controlled pressures via a column of water allowing simultaneous measurements from a PICC and a standard triple lumen catheter. Digital transducers were used to obtain all pressure readings. Measurements of static pressures over a physiologic range were recorded using 5 Fr and 6 Fr dual lumen PICCs. Additionally, random repetitive pressure pulses were applied to the column of water to simulate physiologic intravascular pressure variations. The resultant PICC and control waveforms were recorded simultaneously.

- **Results**: Six hundred thirty measurements were made using the 5 Fr and 6 Fr PICCs. The average bias determined by Bland-Altman plot was 0.043 mmHg for 5 Fr PICC and 0.023 mmHg for 6 Fr PICC with a difference range of 1.0 to -1.0. The correlation coefficient for both catheters was 1.0 (p-value < 0.001). Dynamic pressure waveforms plotted simultaneously between PICC and control revealed equal peaks and troughs.

- **Conclusion**: In vitro, no static or dynamic pressure differences were found between the PICC and a conventional CVP catheter. Clinical studies are required to assess whether the novel PICC has bedside equivalence to conventional.

### The intensivist's perspective of shock, volume management, and hemodynamic monitoring [^1158HAXA]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

One of the primary reasons for intensive care admission is shock. Identifying the underlying cause of shock (hypovolemic, distributive, cardiogenic, and obstructive) may lead to entirely different clinical pathways for management. Among patients with hypovolemic and distributive shock, fluid therapy is one of the leading management strategies. Although an appropriate amount of fluid administration might save a patient's life, inadequate (or excessive) fluid use could lead to more complications, including organ failure and mortality due to either hypovolemia or volume overload.

Currently, intensivists have access to a wide variety of information sources and tools to monitor the underlying hemodynamic status, including medical history, physical examination, and specific hemodynamic monitoring devices. Although appropriate and timely assessment and interpretation of this information can promote adequate fluid resuscitation, misinterpretation of these data can also lead to additional mortality and morbidity. This article provides a narrative review of the most commonly used hemodynamic monitoring approaches to assessing fluid responsiveness and fluid tolerance. In addition, we describe the benefits and disadvantages of these tools.

### Measurement and interpretation of central venous pressure: a narrative review [^112oqctg]. Anaesthesia (2025). Low credibility.

Central venous pressure (CVP) remains a fundamental yet controversial parameter in haemodynamic monitoring. While evidence suggests that the absolute CVP value alone is a poor predictor of fluid responsiveness, integrating CVP with waveform analysis and trend monitoring provides valuable insights into right heart function, venous congestion, and organ perfusion. Emerging evidence suggests there is valuable interplay between CVP and critical physiological variables, such as right ventricular diastolic dysfunction, microcirculatory perfusion, and Doppler-derived venous waveforms, reinforcing the relevance of CVP monitoring in peri-operative and critical care settings.

As surgical and critically ill patient populations become increasingly complex, the role of CVP should be reconsidered — not as an isolated predictor, but as a component of comprehensive haemodynamic assessment. Understanding the nuances of CVP trends, waveform morphology, and its interactions with other haemodynamic markers remains integral to informing accurate clinical decision-making in critical care medicine. Future research directions may include refining the integration of CVP with advanced monitoring modalities while minimizing reliance on outdated paradigms of volume assessment to optimize patient outcomes.

### Ultrasound accurately reflects the jugular venous examination but underestimates central venous pressure [^114TRHeJ]. Chest (2011). Low credibility.

Bedside ultrasound examination could be used to assess jugular venous pressure (JVP), and thus central venous pressure (CVP), more reliably than clinical examination.

- **Methods**: The study was a prospective, blinded evaluation comparing physical examination of external jugular venous pressure (JVPEXT), internal jugular venous pressure (JVPINT), and ultrasound collapse pressure (UCP) with CVP measured using an indwelling catheter. We compared the examination of the external and internal JVP with each other and with the UCP and CVP. JVPEXT, JVPINT, UCP, and CVP were compared graphically using Bland-Altman plots, and correlation coefficients were calculated.

- **Results**: The correlation coefficients comparing CVP to UCP, JVPEXT, and JVPINT were 0.62, 0.57, and 0.50, respectively. When UCP was compared with JVPEXT and JVPINT, correlation coefficients were 0.91 and 0.81, respectively. Lastly, the correlation coefficient comparing JVPEXT and JVPINT was 0.98. The Bland-Altman graphical comparison of methods technique revealed that CVP was often underestimated by UCP and clinical examination of JVPEXT and JVPINT. In contrast, there was no systematic bias between UCP and either JVPEXT or JVPINT, nor between JVPEXT and JVPINT.

- **Conclusions**: Ultrasound examination is capable of measuring accurately the JVP as judged from the internal or external jugular vein. However, like the JVP, ultrasound typically underestimates CVP. A systematic bias between UCP and CVP suggests the presence of a variable degree of venous tone, possibly signaling contraction of jugular venous smooth muscle.

### Measurement and interpretation of central venous pressure: a narrative review [^114P6LZz]. Anaesthesia (2025). Low credibility.

Monitoring trends in central venous pressure (CVP), despite being non-specific for diagnosing right ventricular dysfunction or volume status, can be valuable in conditions such as pulmonary hypertension or left-sided heart failure where acute right ventricular diastolic dysfunction is linked to high morbidity and a poorer overall prognosis. The relationship between CVP and right ventricular dysfunction is complex; elevated pressures may lead to a compensatory increase in afterload, worsening right ventricular filling. Nevertheless, CVP provides essential insights into the haemodynamic burdens on the right heart and can be instrumental in monitoring the progression of right ventricular diastolic dysfunction over time.

Anaesthetists and intensivists are increasingly tasked with caring for patients at risk of right heart failure due to pulmonary hypertension, a condition estimated to affect 1% of the global population, with higher prevalence in individuals over 65 years of age. Most cases are secondary to left heart disease or lung disease (World Health Organization group 2 disease). These patients face a peri-operative mortality rate of 15–50% during emergency surgeries. The 2022 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines advocate for CVP monitoring during general anaesthesia when significant fluid shifts are anticipated. Notably, the insertion and monitoring of central venous catheters (CVC) is a fundamental skill for anaesthetists, whereas peri-operative echocardiography or pulmonary artery catheterisation may not be. In such scenarios, the absolute value, trends, and waveform of CVP become critical.

### Fluid response evaluation in sepsis hypotension and shock: A randomized clinical trial [^11747ysa]. Chest (2020). Low credibility.

Fluid resuscitation is a central component of septic shock treatment. Excessive fluid administration causes hypervolemia and is associated with tissue edema, organ dysfunction, increased ICU length of stay, prolonged ventilator dependence, and higher mortality rates. Guidelines recommend crystalloid fluid administration of at least 30 mL/kg for sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion or septic shock and suggest that "fluid administration beyond initial resuscitation requires careful assessment of the likelihood that the patient remains fluid responsive". Robust evidence that supports this recommendation is lacking. Two-thirds of patients with septic shock demonstrate fluid overload on day 1, and fluid resuscitation often continues beyond the first day of care. However, only one-half of septic patients will be fluid responsive and potentially benefit from fluid administration. A propensity model analysis of 23,513 patients with sepsis demonstrated that day 1 fluid administration > 5 L was associated with a significantly increased risk of death.

- **Take-home points**: Traditional methods of the assessment of fluid responsiveness (FR), such as vital signs, physical examination, and static measurements of circulatory pressure, do not reliably correlate with FR. In contrast, dynamic measurement of stroke volume (SV) after an IV fluid bolus or passive leg raise (PLR) is a safe and feasible method of rapidly assessing the effectiveness of fluid-induced augmentation of SV and cardiac output (CO). This approach has been associated with reduced length of stay and fewer complications.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the management of COVID-19 patients with shock in low-and middle-income countries [^113CAPk7]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

Availability, feasibility, affordability, and safety are crucial factors in the management of patients. Lactate measurements and central venous catheters (CVCs) are widely used in high-income countries (HICs) but are not routinely available in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). For example, in a survey conducted among 263 physicians from Africa, 49.2% stated they either "sometimes" or "never" had access to CVCs. There is no evidence that these more invasive or costly tools are more helpful than the simple bedside exam; therefore, especially in the LMIC context, vital signs, and particularly capillary refill time (CRT), are sufficient for guiding the adequacy of resuscitation.

Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has become more readily available in LMICs because improved technology has rendered portable machines more affordable. Studies in LMICs have revealed that POCUS impacts diagnosis and management of patients in real-time. However, an additional barrier to the application of POCUS is the limitation in physician training and proficiency in bedside ultrasound skills, although training is feasible.

- **Recommendations and suggestions**: We recommend the use of simple bedside parameters, such as CRT, rather than more invasive or costly parameters, such as lactate measurements, central venous pressure (CVP), or central venous saturation, for assessing the adequacy of resuscitation (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We suggest that POCUS be used to assess the need for further fluid resuscitation if available (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

### Measurement and interpretation of central venous pressure: a narrative review [^113yRhi9]. Anaesthesia (2025). Low credibility.

Elevated central venous pressure (CVP) may reflect impaired right ventricular filling secondary to impaired ventricular compliance. However, CVP cannot be used to diagnose the cause of right ventricular dysfunction, which can result from several conditions, including elevated left atrial pressure; pulmonary hypertension; pulmonic stenosis; right ventricular outflow tract obstruction; and primary right ventricular dysfunction.

In a normal heart, right ventricular end diastolic volume is determined by transmural pressure and myocardial compliance. Increased intrapericardial and intrathoracic pressures reduce right ventricular transmural pressure, while impaired right ventricular relaxation requires a higher CVP to facilitate filling. For example, following cardiac surgery, a patient with obesity who has World Health Organization group 3 pulmonary hypertension due to obstructive sleep apnea and is mechanically ventilated at a mean airway pressure of 12 mmHg may have a CVP of 15 mmHg despite being euvolemic. Conversely, a patient breathing spontaneously in acute left heart failure may still have a low CVP.

### Is measurement of central venous pressure required to estimate systemic vascular resistance? A retrospective cohort study [^117KU7eS]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Low credibility.

In addition to providing adequate anesthesia to patients, anesthesiologists must maintain stable blood pressure, especially as clinical outcomes are closely related to the intraoperative management of hemodynamics. Because blood pressure is a product of cardiac output (CO) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR), it is also essential to understand and estimate each of these components. At the time of writing, however, no tool has been available that can directly measure SVR intraoperatively. Instead, SVR can only be indirectly estimated using mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), CO, and central venous pressure (CVP), with SVR calculated as (MAP – CVP) / CO.

The clinical range of CVP (typically 5 to 15 mmHg) is, however, much less than the range of MAP (60 to 120 mmHg), suggesting that CVP may have little impact on the estimation of SVR. Few studies at the time of writing have specifically addressed this question. The accuracy and feasibility of using an arbitrary CVP rather than actual CVP for the estimation of SVR is not known, especially during the intraoperative period. Using vital records obtained from patients who underwent neurological and cardiac surgery, the present study retrospectively calculated SVR using fixed values of CVP (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mmHg) and randomly changing values of CVP (5 to 15 mmHg). These calculated SVRs were then compared with actual SVR, calculated using actual CVP.

### Is measurement of central venous pressure required to estimate systemic vascular resistance? A retrospective cohort study [^114F7bhA]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Low credibility.

The clinical range of central venous pressure (CVP) (typically 5 to 15mmHg) is much less than the range of mean arterial blood pressure (60 to 120mmHg), suggesting that CVP may have little impact on estimation of systemic vascular resistance (SVR). The accuracy and feasibility of using an arbitrary CVP rather than actual CVP for the estimation of SVR during the intraoperative period is not known.

- **Methods**: Using vital records obtained from patients who underwent neurological and cardiac surgery, the present study retrospectively calculated SVR using fixed values of CVP (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20mmHg) and randomly changing values of CVP (5 to 15mmHg) and compared these calculated SVRs with actual SVR, calculated using actual CVP. Differences between actual SVR and SVRs based on fixed and random CVPs were quantified as root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Bland-Altman analysis and four-quadrant plot analysis were performed.

- **Results**: A total of 34 patients were included, consisting of 18 who underwent neurosurgery and 16 who underwent cardiac surgery; 501,380 seconds (139.3 hours) of data was analyzed. The SVR derived from a fixed CVP of 10mmHg (SVRf10) showed the highest accuracy (RMSE: 115 and 104 dynes/sec/cm⁻⁵ and MAPE: 6.3% and 5.7% in neurological and cardiac surgery, respectively). The 95% limits of agreement between SVRf10 and actual SVR were -208.5 (95% confidence interval, -306.3 to -148.1) and 242.2 (95% CI, 181.8 to 340.0) dynes/sec/cm⁻⁵ in neurosurgery, and -268.1 (95% CI, -367.5 to -207.7) and 163.2 (95% CI, 102.9 to 262.6) dynes/sec/cm⁻⁵ in cardiac surgery.

### Central venous pressure: Current uses and prospects for an old parameter [^117PSL7J]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Blood flow in most organs is tightly related to mean perfusion pressure (MPP), calculated as the difference between systemic mean arterial pressure (MAP) and central venous pressure (CVP). The regulation of perfusion pressure is a key determinant of organ function and may be compromised in critical illness. This is particularly true in heart failure, where its association with liver dysfunction and impaired microcirculatory flow is well documented. In sepsis, an increased CVP — rather than MAP alone — is linked to venous congestion and a reduction in MPP, which is associated with a higher risk of acute kidney injury. Although there is evidence supporting the association between high CVP and organ dysfunction, establishing causality is less straightforward.

### Estimation of central venous pressure by ultrasound [^113sL4LF]. Resuscitation (2005). Low credibility.

Increasing blood volume and cardiac output is one of the most commonly needed interventions in the primary care of traumatized and severely ill patients. Although cardiac filling pressures have severe limitations in assessing preload, central venous pressure (CVP) is the invasive measure most frequently used in clinical practice for the assessment of volume status and cardiac preload. We combined ultrasound and tissue pressure measurement for non-invasive jugular and brachial venous pressure estimation.

- **Materials and methods**: CVP was measured both invasively and non-invasively using the new technique in 32 critically ill patients. In six volunteers, increasing PEEP was used for the assessment of changes in non-invasive CVP.

- **Results**: Non-invasive CVP increased linearly with increasing PEEP, independent of the investigator. Median (range) coefficient of variation (CV) for five consecutive measurements performed by three investigators in volunteers was 15% (6–31%), 14% (4–31%), and 21% (8–42%). Absolute differences between the average non-invasive CVP among investigators were 1.7 cm H2O (0.4–6.6 cm H2O), and the inter-examiner CVP was high (182%, 40–415%). In patients, invasive CVP was 10 mmHg (5–18 mmHg), and the corresponding non-invasive venous pressures were 8 mmHg (3–14 mmHg, basilic vein, p < 0.01) and 6 mmHg (3–13 mmHg, jugular vein, p < 0.01). The coefficients of variation were 4% (< 1%-64%, invasive CVP), 22% (5%-51%, non-invasive basilic vein pressure), and 17% (7%-34%, non-invasive jugular vein pressure).

- **Conclusion**: Ultrasound-based, non-invasive measure

### Predicting fluid responsiveness: A review of literature and a guide for the clinician [^114nWQTt]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Volume resuscitation is of utmost importance in the treatment of shock. It is imperative that this resuscitation be guided using a reliable method of ascertaining volume status to avoid the ill-effects of hypovolemia while also avoiding those of over-resuscitation. There are numerous tools and methods available in this era to aid the bedside physician in guiding volume resuscitation, many of which will be described in this review of literature.

The methods to assess preload responsiveness are broadly divided into static and dynamic measurements. Static measurements involve 'snapshot' estimations of preload, while dynamic measurements rely on fluctuations in heart-lung interactions or a simulated volume challenge to predict whether increasing preload by volume loading will be beneficial. Dynamic measurements are favored over static measurements; however, the conditions to be met for most dynamic measurements to be valid leave these methods to be used reliably in a very discrete critically-ill population.

This issue is overcome by utilizing maneuvers developed to assess fluid responsiveness that liberalize the conditions required for most dynamic measurements, such as passive leg raising, end-expiratory occlusion, and mini-fluid boluses. This review of literature highlights the differences between static and dynamic measurements of fluid responsiveness and proposes a guide to choosing the most reliable methods of ascertaining volume responsiveness individualized to each patient.

### Bedside hand vein inspection for noninvasive central venous pressure assessment [^115b5xfp]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Rapid estimates of central venous pressure (CVP) can be helpful to administer early fluid therapy or manage cardiac preload in intensive care units, operating rooms, or emergency rooms to initiate and monitor adequate medical therapy. Invasive CVP measurements have inherent and non-negligible complication rates as well as high expenditures. Several noninvasive methods of CVP measurements, such as ultrasound-guided techniques, are available but require trained skills and special equipment, which might not be available in all situations.

Our purpose was to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of CVP estimates assessed upon the height of hand veins collapse (HVC) using invasively measured CVP as the gold standard. The HVC was determined by slowly lifting the patient's hand while observing the dorsal hand veins collapse. The vertical distance from the dorsal hand to a transducer air zero port was noted and converted to mmHg. The observer was blinded to the simultaneously measured CVP values, which were categorized as low (< 8 mmHg), normal (8–12 mmHg), and high (> 12 mmHg).

Measurements were performed in 82 patients with a median [IQR] age of 67 [60; 74] years. The median CVP was 12 [8; 15] mmHg, and the median absolute difference between the measured HVC and CVP was 4 [2; 7] mmHg. The Spearman correlation coefficient between CVP and HVC was 0.55, 95% CI [0.35; 0.69]. Overall, CVP categorization was correct in 45% of the cases. HVC had a sensitivity of 92% for a low CVP with a negative predictive value of 98%. A high HVC had a sensitivity of 29% but a high specificity of 94%.

### Measurement and interpretation of central venous pressure: a narrative review [^116VQkNM]. Anaesthesia (2025). Low credibility.

Pressure transducers are zeroed to atmospheric pressure via a three‐way tap, and are repeated periodically to account for cable faults or baseline drift. Given the various pieces of equipment used to monitor CVP, and to account for the natural frequency and damping coefficient, a fast‐flush test to elicit a square waveform measures the dynamic response of the system to assess over- or underdamping.

In contemporary practice, CVP waveforms and values are displayed digitally; however, this is also an inherent source of error. First, cardiac mechanical events, and thus changes in the pressure waveform, follow the corresponding electrical events with a delay of 0.2 s. Second, the concept of a CVP 'value' is abstract, derived using various filtering techniques that incorporate peak and trough values. The difference between the instantaneous CVP value and the derived value can be up to 4 mmHg in patients whose lungs are ventilated spontaneously or mechanically. Measurement timed to right ventricular end diastolic pressure, or when the tricuspid valve closes, provides the most accurate indication of cardiac preload.

The most accurate methods for obtaining a CVP numerical value involve reading a waveform directly, or freezing the bedside monitor at the base of the c‐wave at end expiration over three breaths, where pleural pressure is closest to atmospheric in patients whose lungs are both spontaneous and mechanically ventilated, thereby reducing the effects of intrathoracic pressure. However, if there is an elevated end expiratory pressure from obstruction or bronchospasm, then…

### Does a simple bedside sonographic measurement of the inferior vena cava correlate to central venous pressure [^116KQfzH]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Bedside ultrasound has been suggested as a non-invasive modality to estimate central venous pressure (CVP).

- **Objective**: Evaluate a simple bedside ultrasound technique to measure the diameter of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and correlate it to simultaneously measured CVP. Secondary comparisons include anatomic location, probe orientation, and phase of respiration.

- **Methods**: An unblinded prospective observation study was performed in an emergency department and critical care unit. Subjects were a convenience sample of adult patients with a central line at the superior venocaval-atrial junction. Ultrasound measured transverse and longitudinal diameters of the IVC at the subxiphoid, suprailiac, and mid-abdomen, each measured at end-inspiration and end-expiration. Correlation and regression analysis were used to relate CVP and IVC diameters.

- **Results**: There were 72 subjects with a mean age of 67 years (range 21–94 years), 37 (53%) male, enrolled over 9 months. Seven subjects were excluded for tricuspid valvulopathy. Primary diagnoses were respiratory failure in 12 (18%), sepsis in 11 (17%), and pancreatitis in 3 (5%). There were 28 (43%) patients mechanically ventilated. Adequate measurements were obtainable in 57 (89%) using the subxiphoid, in 44 (68%) using the mid-abdomen, and in 28 (43%) using the suprailiac views. The correlation coefficients were statistically significant at 0.49 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.26–0.66), 0.51 (95% CI 0.23–0.71), and 0.50 (95% CI 0.14–0.74) for end-inspiratory longitudinal subxiphoid, mid-abdomen, and suprailiac views, respectively.

### Non-invasive central venous pressure measurement by compression ultrasound — a step into real life [^112zdg4V]. Resuscitation (2009). Low credibility.

Information on central venous pressure (CVP) is helpful in clinical situations like cardiac failure and sepsis. Compression ultrasound (CU) of a forearm vein has been shown to be a reliable method for CVP measurement when assessed by experienced personnel under study conditions. We hypothesized that CU can be reliably used for CVP measurement following a training program and using a portable ultrasound system. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the feasibility and accuracy of CU, comparing the results of vascular experts vs. trainees as well as high-end vs. portable ultrasound systems.

- **Methods**: CU with non-invasive CVP measurement (CVP(ni)) was performed by four investigators in 50 patients of an intensive care unit and compared with invasive CVP measurement (CVP(i)).

- **Results**: Feasibility was between 88% and 92% in the different investigator groups. The CVP(ni) measurement showed a significant linear correlation (r = 0.58–0.68; p < 0.001) with CVP(i) in all groups. The mean difference between CVP(i) and CVP(ni) was 2.4 ± 3.1 mmHg and similar among the investigators. No differences were observed between measurements done by vascular experts and trainees, as well as between high-end and portable ultrasound systems. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CU is able to detect changes in CVP during the respiratory cycle.

- **Conclusions**: After a training program, CU can be used by non-vascular clinicians for reliable CVP measurement with good quality portable systems. Additionally, respiratory changes in CVP are detectable by CU. These data suggest CU to be an efficient method for measuring CVP in real-life settings.

### Hemodynamic monitoring in the critically ill: Spanning the range of kidney function [^112TYgQW]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Critically ill patients often have deranged hemodynamics. Physical examination, central venous pressure, and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure ("wedge") have been shown to be unreliable at assessing volume status, volume responsiveness, and adequacy of cardiac output in critically ill patients. Thus, invasive and noninvasive cardiac output monitoring is a core feature of evaluating and managing a hemodynamically unstable patient.

In this review, we discuss the various techniques and options of cardiac output assessment available to clinicians for hemodynamic monitoring in the intensive care unit. Issues related to patients with kidney disease, such as the timing and location of arterial and central venous catheters, and the approach to hemodynamics in patients treated by long-term dialysis are also discussed.

### Elevated central venous pressure is associated with increased mortality in pediatric septic shock patients [^114hBgCJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Our records indicated that 278 patients with a diagnosis of septic shock had been admitted to the PICU during the study period. Among these, patients without CVP measurements or those without CVP data within 6 hours of diagnosis (N = 19), patients who died within 72 hours after admission to the PICU (N = 14), patients who did not fulfill the above definition of septic shock (N = 11), and patients with incomplete CVP records (N = 8) were excluded. Therefore, data from 226 patients were used in this study.

Catheters were predominantly inserted in the femoral vein (n = 188, 83.2%), followed by the internal jugular (n = 21, 9.3%) and the subclavian (n = 17, 7.5%). Of the 226 patients included, 67 died, resulting in a mortality rate of 29.6%, and these patients formed the nonsurvivor group. The remaining 159 patients formed the survivor group.

### Consensus on circulatory shock and hemodynamic monitoring. Task force of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^114jCT4Q]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The prognostic value of lactate levels exceeds that of blood pressure. While hyperlactatemia is associated with worse outcomes in any type of shock, a correct interpretation also depends on the type of shock, i.e. septic shock versus hemorrhagic shock.

From a metabolic perspective, elevations in blood lactate concentration may be due to increased production, decreased clearance, or a combination of the two. As elevated plasma lactate forms part of the definition of shock, using it as a diagnostic marker of shock is a circular argument. Many studies have confirmed the association between initial serum lactate levels and mortality, independently of clinical signs of organ dysfunction, in patients not only with severe sepsis but also those in cardiogenic shock.

An early decrease in blood lactate levels may indicate the resolution of global tissue hypoxia and has been associated with decreased mortality rates. Two studies proposed 'lactate-based management' of ICU patients. Jones et al. studied 300 patients, of whom more than 80% had septic shock. These patients were treated to normalize central venous pressure (CVP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP). Additional management to normalize lactate clearance compared with management to normalize central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) did not result in different rates of hospital mortality. Jansen et al. showed that in patients with hyperlactatemia (> 3.0 mEq/L) on ICU admission, lactate-guided therapy (aimed at decreasing lactate by ≥ 20% every 2 hours for the initial 8 hours) in comparison with no lactate-guided therapy (where the treatment team had no knowledge of lactate levels) led to different outcomes.
