## Question

Topical antihistamines for eyes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about topical antihistamines for ocular allergy, including when to use them, which agents to choose, dosing and duration, safety, alternatives and escalation, special populations, and a concise practical recommendation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical indication and the pathophysiology that makes topical antihistamines rational. Then, I should verify guideline-backed positioning in care pathways. Next, I will examine comparative efficacy across specific agents and formulations, including onset and duration. After that, I need to check safety and tolerability, including preservatives and rebound concerns. Then, I will consider alternatives and escalation for refractory disease, including steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and immunotherapy. I should also review pediatric and contact lens considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic, patient-centered recommendation with monitoring points and follow-up, anchoring to high-credibility guidance and pivotal trials as I go.

> Let me first confirm the indication and mechanism. Topical antihistamines target the early-phase, histamine-driven pruritus and hyperemia of allergic conjunctivitis, which can be seasonal or perennial, and may coexist with allergic rhinitis in allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, with mast cell degranulation releasing histamine that activates H1 receptors and produces itch and vasodilation, while some agents also stabilize mast cells and modulate late-phase mediators, which helps with sustained control of signs and symptoms [^115XUFL2] [^111wZqCy].

> I need to verify where these drops fit in the care pathway. High-credibility guidance recommends topical antihistamines with mast cell–stabilizing activity as first-line for mild seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis, reserving pure mast cell stabilizers for frequent or persistent disease and adding a short, carefully monitored steroid course for moderate to severe flares or vernal/atopic exacerbations, which aligns with the pathophysiology and practical needs of patients for both rapid onset and maintenance control [^117YCyuQ] [^1154NSKo] [^116ccxXX].

> Next, I should review specific agents and formulations, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without distinguishing generations and dosing convenience. Dual-action agents such as olopatadine, ketotifen, alcaftadine, bepotastine, and azelastine combine H1 antagonism with mast cell stabilization, providing both immediate relief and prophylaxis, whereas cromolyn and nedocromil are pure mast cell stabilizers that require more frequent dosing and a loading period before full benefit, and olopatadine 0.77% and cetirizine 0.24% are notable for once-daily dosing with clinically meaningful onset and duration profiles, which can improve adherence and comfort [^1144eKvZ] [^114HtHYn] [^114yLcWL].

> I will now examine comparative efficacy signals, keeping in mind heterogeneity in models and outcomes. Wait, let me verify consistency across settings: multiple studies and reviews indicate that topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers outperform placebo for itch and redness, and head-to-head data often show small but detectable differences favoring certain agents in specific endpoints; for example, in CAC models, olopatadine reduced itching and redness with onset within minutes and sustained 24-hour benefit at 0.77%, bepotastine showed clinically meaningful itch reduction with 8 to 16 hours of activity, and cetirizine 0.24% demonstrated 15-minute onset and approximately 8-hour duration, while pooled analyses and CAC comparisons frequently place olopatadine and alcaftadine among the most active options, with ketotifen also demonstrating superiority to placebo and in some studies outperforming levocabastine [^111nfUzW] [^1177EYTq] [^112cXZUB] [^116ZhHqy] [^113gyYpi] [^114NSrps].

> Hold on, I should verify safety and tolerability before making firm product-level recommendations. Serious adverse events are uncommon with topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers. Local transient stinging or burning may occur, preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride can irritate the ocular surface in some patients, and chronic vasoconstrictor use can lead to rebound hyperemia, so preservative-free or low-bother formulations and counseling on avoiding vasoconstrictor overuse are prudent. Importantly, unlike steroids, these agents do not carry risks of cataract or intraocular pressure elevation, supporting their role as chronic-use first-line therapy when needed [^115XUFL2] [^115N4ftS] [^1144eKvZ] [^112djbPH].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist despite appropriate topical therapy or disease is severe. I need to ensure I cover escalation appropriately: short courses of low-potency topical corticosteroids, such as loteprednol or fluorometholone, are reasonable for acute exacerbations or vernal/atopic flares with close follow-up, whereas steroid-sparing immunomodulators like cyclosporine or tacrolimus are indicated for steroid-dependent or refractory cases and for prevention of seasonal recurrences, and in select scenarios a sustained-release dexamethasone intracanalicular insert can be considered to reduce drop burden and deliver consistent anti-inflammatory exposure, with attention to IOP monitoring and contraindications such as active infection or corneal epithelial defects [^116ccxXX] [^116XvM4c] [^116vWX6T] [^112KecqA] [^112R1Y3c].

> I should double-check pediatric considerations and practical use. Most topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers are acceptable in children, with second-generation oral antihistamines preferred when systemic therapy is needed due to better safety profiles; ketotifen is available over the counter and widely used in pediatrics, and azelastine is approved in children older than 3 years, so agent selection should balance efficacy, comfort, dosing frequency, and cost while avoiding unnecessary steroids [^114WbNnf] [^1144eKvZ] [^1154NSKo] [^117RJTUH].

> Let me consider contact lens wearers specifically. Patients should remove lenses before instilling medicated drops due to preservative interactions and the lack of compatibility data in most labeling, and preservative-free artificial tears can be used to rinse or as adjuncts; novel antihistamine-releasing contact lens technologies are under investigation and may address both vision correction and allergy control, but they are not yet standard of care, so I need to counsel on lens hygiene and consider dosing schedules that minimize disruption to wear time [^115eNYPN].

> I should confirm that nonpharmacologic measures are not overlooked, as they meaningfully augment pharmacotherapy. Cold compresses, refrigerated preservative-free artificial tears, allergen avoidance strategies such as wraparound sunglasses, frequent laundering, and bedtime bathing, and avoiding eye rubbing reduce symptom burden and medication needs, and should be reinforced at each visit, especially in patients with frequent recurrences or overlapping dry eye [^115N4ftS] [^1154NSKo].

> Next, I should review longer-term disease modification strategies when first-line therapy fails. Allergen immunotherapy is effective for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and may reduce ocular symptoms and medication burden, with FDA-approved SLIT tablets for specific allergens and a requirement for supervised administration in some regimens; for patients with inadequate control on topical therapy, referral to allergy for evaluation and immunotherapy is reasonable [^111Vnyf4] [^114rmRjQ] [^112jkK3C].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overstated the strength of evidence for alcaftadine over olopatadine; I should verify and temper that. While pooled CAC analyses and comparative studies suggest alcaftadine and olopatadine both have robust itch control with somewhat different receptor profiles and onset/duration characteristics, head-to-head superiority claims are inconsistent and setting-dependent, so I should frame these as comparable, high-efficacy options rather than a strict hierarchy, and let patient preference, comfort, and dosing convenience guide selection [^113gyYpi] [^111nfUzW] [^112N3uo2].

> Putting this together, my practical, stepwise approach is as follows: confirm the diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis with emphasis on itching and bilateral watery discharge while excluding infectious or sight-threatening etiologies. Start a dual-action topical antihistamine/mast cell stabilizer such as olopatadine 0.2% or 0.77% once daily, alcaftadine 0.25% once daily, bepotastine 1.5% twice daily, or ketotifen 0.025% twice daily, chosen based on access, cost, comfort, and prior response. Add preservative-free artificial tears frequently and implement allergen avoidance and cold compresses. Reassess in 1 to 2 weeks and, if control is inadequate, consider a short, closely monitored course of a soft steroid such as loteprednol, escalating to a steroid-sparing agent like cyclosporine or tacrolimus for persistent disease. For highly symptomatic seasons or refractory cases, consider an intracanalicular dexamethasone insert or allergen immunotherapy with appropriate precautions and follow-up, documenting IOP when steroids are used and avoiding steroids in active infection or epithelial compromise [^117YCyuQ] [^1154NSKo] [^1144eKvZ] [^116ccxXX] [^112KecqA] [^111Vnyf4].

> In summary, I need to ensure the recommendation remains evidence-aligned and balanced: topical antihistamines with mast cell–stabilizing activity are first-line for mild to moderate allergic conjunctivitis, with once-daily options like olopatadine 0.77% and alcaftadine 0.25% offering rapid onset and 24-hour control, while ketotifen and bepotastine provide strong efficacy with twice-daily dosing. They are safe for chronic use, with local tolerability issues typically minor, and serve as the foundation upon which layered care with lubricants, allergen avoidance, short steroid bursts, immunomodulators, and immunotherapy can be added as needed, always tailoring to severity, phenotype, and patient preferences [^1154NSKo] [^1144eKvZ] [^114HtHYn] [^115XUFL2].

Topical antihistamines for the eyes are **first-line therapy** for allergic conjunctivitis, providing rapid relief of itching, redness, and tearing with minimal systemic absorption and a favorable safety profile [^1154NSKo] [^115XUFL2]. Dual-action agents (olopatadine, ketotifen, alcaftadine, bepotastine, azelastine) are preferred for their **combined antihistamine and mast cell–stabilizing effects**, enabling once- or twice-daily dosing and reducing the need for corticosteroids [^117YCyuQ] [^114HtHYn]. Common adverse effects are mild ocular irritation or taste disturbance; serious events are rare [^115XUFL2]. For severe or refractory cases, short-term topical corticosteroids or immunomodulators may be added, with close monitoring for adverse effects [^1177Mb4o] [^115V8ctM].

---

## Mechanism of action

Topical antihistamines **block H1 receptors** on the ocular surface, rapidly suppressing histamine-mediated itching, redness, and tearing [^112uY3tr]. Dual-action agents also **stabilize mast cells**, reducing degranulation and the release of inflammatory mediators, thereby providing both immediate and preventive effects [^117RJTUH].

---

## Clinical indications

Topical antihistamines are indicated for **seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC)** — characterized by acute symptoms triggered by seasonal allergens such as pollen — and for **perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC)** — driven by year-round allergens like dust mites, pet dander, and molds. They are also used for **vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC)** and **atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC)** — chronic, severe forms of allergic conjunctivitis — often in combination with other therapies [^117YCyuQ] [^1154By8B].

## Commonly used topical antihistamines

| **Drug name** | **Mechanism of action** | **Dosage frequency** | **Clinical notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Olopatadine | - Antihistamine <br/> - Mast cell stabilizer | Once daily (0.77%) or twice daily (0.1%–0.2%) | - Rapid onset <br/> - 24-hour duration [^114HtHYn] [^111nfUzW] |
| Ketotifen | - Antihistamine <br/> - Mast cell stabilizer | Twice daily | Effective in pediatric and adult populations [^1172DvFC] |
| Alcaftadine | - Antihistamine <br/> - Mast cell stabilizer | Once daily | - Rapid onset <br/> - Prolonged duration [^113gyYpi] |
| Bepotastine | - Antihistamine <br/> - Mast cell stabilizer | Twice daily | - Well tolerated <br/> - Effective in acute and chronic disease [^115N4ftS] [^1177EYTq] |
| Azelastine | - Antihistamine <br/> - Mast cell stabilizer | Twice daily | - Effective <br/> - May cause mild ocular irritation [^112N3uo2] [^117RJTUH] |

---

## Efficacy

Topical antihistamines **significantly reduce ocular itching, redness, tearing, and discomfort** associated with allergic conjunctivitis [^115XUFL2]. Dual-action agents, particularly olopatadine 0.77% and alcaftadine 0.25%, provide rapid onset (within minutes) and sustained 24-hour relief, supporting once-daily dosing regimens [^114HtHYn].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Topical antihistamines are **generally safe and well tolerated** [^115XUFL2]. Common adverse effects include mild ocular irritation, burning, stinging, and taste disturbances [^1172DvFC]. Serious adverse events, such as severe allergic reactions or significant ocular damage, are rare. Minimal systemic absorption limits systemic side effects, making these agents suitable for long-term use [^116Fk3xp].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Limited efficacy in severe disease**: Topical antihistamines may be insufficient alone in severe or chronic forms of allergic conjunctivitis, such as VKC or AKC, necessitating combination therapy or alternative treatments [^1175xtke].

- **Preservative sensitivity**: Some patients may experience irritation or allergic reactions to preservatives (e.g. benzalkonium chloride) present in certain formulations. Preservative-free options are available for sensitive patients [^112djbPH].

- **Contact lens use**: Patients wearing contact lenses may need to remove lenses before instillation of drops, depending on the specific formulation and preservative content [^115eNYPN].

---

## Alternative and adjunctive therapies

- **Topical corticosteroids**: Short-term use of low-potency corticosteroids (e.g. loteprednol) may be considered for severe or refractory cases, with careful monitoring for adverse effects such as increased intraocular pressure and cataract formation [^1177Mb4o] [^1144eKvZ].

- **Mast cell stabilizers**: Cromolyn sodium and nedocromil sodium are effective prophylactic agents, particularly useful in chronic or recurrent disease [^117YCyuQ].

- **Immunomodulators**: Topical cyclosporine and tacrolimus are steroid-sparing options for severe, chronic allergic conjunctivitis, especially VKC and AKC [^115V8ctM] [^1154By8B].

- **Allergen immunotherapy**: Considered for patients with persistent symptoms despite maximal topical therapy, particularly those with significant systemic allergic disease [^111Vnyf4] [^114rmRjQ].

---

Topical antihistamines are **effective and safe first-line therapy** for allergic conjunctivitis, providing rapid symptom relief with minimal systemic side effects. Dual-action agents are preferred for their combined antihistamine and mast cell–stabilizing properties, enabling convenient dosing and reducing reliance on corticosteroids. For severe or refractory cases, adjunctive therapies such as topical corticosteroids, mast cell stabilizers, immunomodulators, or allergen immunotherapy may be necessary [^111wZqCy].

### Treatment of allergic conjunctivitis with bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution 1.5% [^116SJtGB]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

As with earlier analyses of conjunctival hyperemia data in CAC trials with BBOS 1.5%, the assessment of pooled data shows that BBOS 1.5% treatment consistently reduced the extent of hyperemia, and that these reductions were statistically significant at the earliest time points. Overall, BBOS 1.5%-induced hyperemia reductions did not reach the level designated for clinical significance. This result has been seen with other ophthalmic antihistamines using the CAC model–and may be due to the timing of the efficacy assessments as well as a differential response to H 1 receptor-specific antihistamines in dilated vascular tissue and ocular nerve endings responsible for itching sensation following a CAC.

The pooled analysis of secondary efficacy variables provides additional power to the assessments, allowing several measures that were not significant in the earlier analyses to reach the level of statistical significance. For example, reductions in lid swelling at 8 hours were significant at all time points in the pooled dataset. Similarly, BBOS 1.5% significantly reduced chemosis and ciliary hyperemia for the onset-of-action CAC tests for the pooled data analyses.

The CAC is a model designed to replicate the accompanying signs and symptoms of AC in a way that is reproducible, quantifiable, and standardized among subject populations that may have differing levels of allergen sensitivity. In contrast, studies that depend upon daily fluctuations in environmental allergens are hampered by high variability and the resulting need for a large number of subjects. A limitation of the CAC model is that it reproduces neither the exact manner in which patients are typically exposed to allergens in the environment nor the degree or constancy of exposure to environmental allergens. Despite this, the CAC model is able to accurately measure the ability of investigational products to prevent or treat both the early and the late phases of ACand has been used to support approval of a number of ophthalmic allergy medications for over 20 years.–The CAC-based trials of BBOS 1.5% provided the basis for the US Food and Drug Administration approval of this ophthalmic solution for treatment of itching associated with AC in September 2009.

### Effect of alcaftadine 0.25% on ocular itch associated with seasonal or perennial allergic conjunctivitis: a pooled analysis of two multicenter randomized clinical trials [^116GBp9u]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

After all evaluations were completed at the end of each visit, the use of over-the-counter antiallergy eye drop Visine-A ® was permitted. Systemic and/or topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin or aspirin-containing products, prescription, over-the-counter or homeopathic antiallergy therapies (including over-the-counter sleeping aids that contain an antihistamine and all antihistamines), all other topical ophthalmic preparations (including tear substitutes), and H 1 antagonist antihistamines/mast cell stabilizers (ie, olopatadine) were not permitted up to 72 hours prior to the start of the study or during the course of the study. Systemic and/or topical corticosteroids were not permitted up to 14 days prior to the start of the study or during the course of the study.

Efficacy and safety endpoints

The primary efficacy measure was ocular itching, 16 hours after instillation of study medication, evaluated by the subject at 3 minutes post-CAC (primary endpoint) and at 5 and 7 minutes post-CAC (secondary endpoints). For safety assessment, the incidence of adverse events was monitored and the severity and relationship to the study drug was determined by the Investigator. Adverse events were coded to system organ class and preferred terms using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, version 13.1.

### Effect of alcaftadine 0.25% on ocular itch associated with seasonal or perennial allergic conjunctivitis: a pooled analysis of two multicenter randomized clinical trials [^112fKYq6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Allergic conjunctivitis is a common ocular condition estimated to affect 15%–40% of the general population in developed nations.–Ocular allergy is characterized by an inflammatory response primarily of the conjunctival mucosa that also may affect the cornea and eyelids. Allergic conjunctivitis encompasses a group of disorders that include seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC), perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), as well as more severe and chronic conditions of vernal keratoconjunctivitis and atopic keratoconjunctivitis. Acute allergic conjunctivitis is primarily caused by IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation and the subsequent release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Release of histamine induces ocular itching (the hallmark symptom of ocular allergy), as well as other ocular signs and symptoms, including redness, eyelid swelling, chemosis, and tearing. These ocular symptoms are commonly accompanied by nasal symptoms or rhinitis, and often collectively referred to as allergic rhinoconjunctivitis.–Ocular itching is directly related to the action of histamine on H 1 receptors in the conjunctiva. Other allergic symptoms have been attributed to the action of H 1 or H 2 receptors on the vasculature.

### The efficacy and safety of dexamethasone intracanalicular insert use in patients with chronic seasonal / perennial allergic conjunctivitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115C487g]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

The management of allergic conjunctivitis necessitates a multifaceted approach involving both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Initial measures focus on the avoidance of environmental irritants to minimize exposure and subsequent allergic reactions. Pharmacological management includes both prophylactic and therapeutic medications, administered via topical ocular drops or systemic routes. Prophylactic drugs, such as sodium cromoglycate and nedocromil, function as mast cell stabilizers, exerting their effect by blocking the release of inflammatory mediators and thereby preventing the onset of symptoms. Symptomatic relief is achieved through the use of decongestants, including astringents (eg, silver nitrate or zinc sulfate), vessel vasoconstrictors (alpha and beta sympathomimetics), or antihistamines (eg, astemizole or cetirizine). These medications work by a reduction in conjunctival congestion, constriction of blood vessels, and inhibition of histamine-mediated allergic responses. Furthermore, anti-inflammatory drugs such as NSAIDs and corticosteroids play a key role in reducing inflammation and suppressing immune-mediated responses. These agents act by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory mediators and modulating the immune response, thereby alleviating symptoms and promoting ocular comfort.

Corticosteroids are effective for allergic reactions by inhibiting the production of inflammatory substances such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, reducing inflammatory cells, and suppressing mast cell proliferation. These pleiotropic actions make corticosteroids effective in both the early and late stages of the allergic response. Consequently, patients who are more prone to experiencing the late-phase inflammatory response, eg, those with moderate to severe symptoms, prolonged or recurrent allergen exposure, or inadequate symptom management with antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers, often receive topical corticosteroid treatment. It is important to note, however, that prolonged use of corticosteroids may cause significant adverse effects, including increased intraocular pressure and the development of glaucoma, cataracts, and an elevated risk of infection. Despite the frequent use of topical therapies for allergic conjunctivitis, there are still several needs unmet by the current treatment options. These inadequacies include inconsistent efficacy, short duration of action, delayed onset of action, and safety concerns associated with side effects, particularly those induced by steroids and preservatives. Consequently, there remains a demand for long-acting therapies that consistently demonstrate efficacy, require lower dosages, and effectively inhibit the late-phase inflammatory response without major adverse effects.

### Critical appraisal of bepotastine in the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis [^112vknu3]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Bepotastine besilate 1.5% solution is an H(1)-antihistamine recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the topical treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Several clinical studies have demonstrated its safety as well as its efficacy versus placebo. This review finds that bepotastine besilate 1.5% solution is a suitable alternative to other agents within the class of H(1)-antihistamines, but there are no clinical trial data to suggest that it holds any specific advantages over other agents.

### The phase 3 INVIGORATE trial of reproxalap in patients with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis [^111BPdah]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Surprisingly, given the significant incidence of allergic conjunctivitis, new mechanisms of action for treatment have not been introduced in decades. Although topical antihistamines are considered standard of care for allergic conjunctivitis, the most common reports submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database for topical antihistamine monotherapy (olopatadine, ketotifen, alcaftadine, epinastine, and bepotastine) are "treatment failure" (45%) and "drug ineffective" (17%), which may partially explain why polypharmacy is common in allergic conjunctivitis. Histamine is rapidly metabolized and likely peaks soon after allergen exposure, thereby limiting the duration of activity of antihistamines. Furthermore, many non-histaminic mediators likely contribute to the clinical presentation of ocular allergy. Because of toxicity concerns, corticosteroids can only be safely used on a short-term basis. Therefore, novel treatments are needed. The data reported herein suggest that use of the novel RASP modulator reproxalap may be an effective treatment for the symptoms and signs of allergic conjunctivitis. By extension, based on the activity reported herein, RASP modulation may represent a potential therapeutic approach for other allergic diseases.

### Ocular comfort and drying effects of three topical antihistamine / mast cell stabilizers in adults with allergic conjunctivitis: a randomized, double-masked crossover study [^114Ggwc1]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare short-term (5-minute) ocular comfort and drying effects of 3 topical antihistamine/mast cell stabilizers-epinastine, azelastine, and ketotifen-in patients with allergic conjunctivitis (AC).

Methods

Adults with a history of AC, as confirmed on skin testing conducted within the previous 2 years, were enrolled in this single-center, randomized, double-masked crossover study. At visit 1, patients were randomized to receive a single drop of epinastine in 1 eye and either azelastine or ketotifen in the other eye. Ocular comfort was assessed by patients on an 11-point scale (0 = very comfortable to 10 = very uncomfortable) immediately (0 minute) and at 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 minutes after instillation. Patients were also asked to describe how their eyes felt at 3 minutes using a standardized list of positive (soothing, smooth, refreshing, cool, and comfortable), neutral (thick, sticky, and filmy), and negative (stinging, irritating, and burning) descriptor words. At visits 2 to 4, patients were examined for ocular drying and tear-film stability using fluorescein staining and ocular protection index (OPI) evaluation, respectively.

Results

A total of 40 patients (27 women, 13 men; mean age, 40 years [range, 18–73 years]) were included in the study. The mean comfort score was significantly lower (indicating more comfort) with epinastine compared with azelastine at 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 minutes (between-treatment differences, 2.90, 1.85, 1.35, and 0.63, respectively; P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P = 0.001, and P = 0.019) and compared with ketotifen immediately after instillation (between-treatment difference, 1.2; P = 0.014). The mean ocular comfort score was significantly lower with ketotifen compared with azelastine at 0.5, 1, and 2 minutes (between-treatment differences, 2.35, 1.35, and 1.10, respectively; P = 0.001, P = 0.023, and P = 0.028). A majority (85%) of patients chose positive comfort descriptors to describe epinastine versus 34% with azelastine. No significant differences in fluorescein staining or OPI were observed.

Conclusions

In this small study in patients with AC, following administration of a single drop, epinastine was rated as more comfortable than azelastine and ketotifen. None of the tested medications were associated with significant acute ocular drying effects.

### DEXTENZA versus topical steroid or antihistamine therapy for treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^112EP8vW]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To compare clinical outcomes and patient preference for the dexamethasone intracanalicular insert (DEX) versus topical loteprednol (LOT) or olopatadine (OLO) for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis in a real-world model of allergen exposure.

Methods

This was a prospective comparative trial. Adults with testing-confirmed bilateral allergic conjunctivitis received DEX in the more symptomatic eye and either LOT 2 times daily or OLO once daily for 30 days in the fellow eye. The primary outcome was patient preference for treatment. Clinical outcomes included ocular itching and hyperemia, lid swelling, and watering/tearing. Safety outcomes included intraocular pressure (IOP).

Results

Thirty patients participated and completed the study. All received DEX in the eye with worse symptoms and 15 received LOT and the other 15 received OLO in the other eye. Patients preferred DEX (10/15; 66.7%) over LOT (4/15; 26.7%), with one patient having no preference (p = 0.0103). Patients had no preference between DEX (8/15; 53.3%) and OLO (6/15; 40%), with one patient having no preference (p = 0.1044). In the DEX/LOT cohort, ocular itching and hyperemia improved more with DEX than LOT (p ≤ 0.009), while in the DEX/OLO cohort, the DEX eyes showed greater improvement in conjunctival hyperemia (p < 0.0001) but not itching (p = 0.074). No between-group differences were seen in eyelid swelling or tearing/watering in either cohort. Mean change in IOP was similar between the DEX and LOT eyes (p = 0.4921), and mean IOP rose more in the DEX eyes than the OLO eyes (by < 1 mmHg; p = 0.0403).

Conclusion

Overall, this real-world study demonstrated that the dexamethasone intracanalicular insert was as effective as a topical antihistamine/mast cell stabilizer and more effective than topical steroids in relieving the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. This insert should be considered as an alternative to topical therapy for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^115RNr7c]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis guideline — action statements for diagnosis and management: The development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians recommend intranasal steroids for patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR whose symptoms affect their quality of life, and a strong recommendation that clinicians recommend oral second-generation/less sedating antihistamines for patients with AR and primary complaints of sneezing and itching. The panel further states that clinicians should make the clinical diagnosis of AR when patients present with a history and physical examination consistent with an allergic cause and 1 or more of the following symptoms: nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy nose, or sneezing, with findings that include, but are not limited to, clear rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, pale discoloration of the nasal mucosa, and red and watery eyes. For testing, clinicians should perform and interpret, or refer to a clinician who can perform and interpret, specific IgE (skin or blood) allergy testing for patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR who do not respond to empiric treatment, or where the diagnosis is uncertain, or when knowledge of the specific causative allergen is needed to target therapy. The panel adds that clinicians should assess associated conditions such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, sleep-disordered breathing, conjunctivitis, rhinosinusitis, and otitis media, and clinicians should offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, immunotherapy (sublingual or subcutaneous) for patients with AR who have inadequate response to symptoms with pharmacologic therapy with or without environmental controls.

### Evaluation of the efficacy of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% ophthalmic solution and azelastine hydrochloride 0.05% ophthalmic solution in the conjunctival allergen challenge model [^112N3uo2]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% ophthalmic solution and azelastine hydrochlofide 0.05% ophthalmic solution are 2 topical antiallergic agents indicated for the treatment of itching of the eye associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Olopatadine has recently received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for an expanded indication for the treatment of signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis, including itching, tearing, eyelid swelling, redness, and chemosis.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of olopatadine hydrochloride versus azelastine hydrochloride and placebo (artificial tears) in the conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) model.

Methods

This was a prospective, randomized, double-masked, contralaterally controlled, multicenter, allergen-challenge study. Itching was chosen as the primary efficacy variable since it is the only FDA-approved indication these 2 agents have in common. Subjects with a history of allergic conjunctivitis who responded to the CAC at screening visits 1 and 2 were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups: olopatadine in 1 eye and azelastine in the other eye; olopatadine in 1 eye and placebo in the other eye; or azelastine in 1 eye and placebo in the other eye. At the assessment visit (visit 3), subjects received masked study medication according to the randomization scheme. After 5 minutes, subjects were bilaterally challenged with the allergen concentration that had elicited a positive conjunctival allergic response at visits 1 and 2. Immediately after challenge, subjects gave itching assessments (scale, 0 = no itching to 4 = severe itching) every 30 seconds for a total period of 20 minutes. Mean itching scores for all eyes were compared by treatment. Mean itching scores at each time point were compared between treatments using 2 sample t tests.

Results

Of the 180 subjects screened, 111 responded to the CAC at visits 1 and 2 and completed the study; 65% (72/111) of patients were female, 87% (97/111) were white, and 49% (54/111) had brown irides. The mean age was approximately 40 years. Seventy-three eyes were treated with olopatadine, 75 with azelastine, and 74 with placebo. A single dose of 1 of the 3 study medications per eye was well tolerated by all subjects. Both treatments were significantly more effective than placebo at reducing itching postchallenge. Olopatadine was significantly more effective than azelastine in reducing itching at 3.5 minutes through 20 minutes postchallenge (average mean unit difference of -0.31; P < 0.05) in the CAC model.

Conclusion

In this population, olopatadine was significantly more effective than azelastine in the management of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis in the CAC model.

### Phase III trials examining the efficacy of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% compared to vehicle for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis in the conjunctival allergen challenge model [^1128S1fS]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% is a strong therapeutic, with an ability to provide quick and extended relief of ocular and nasal symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. There are no safety concerns identified with cetirizine treatment and drop comfort ranged from very comfortable to comfortable. As an ophthalmic solution, cetirizine offers a faster onset of action for ocular and nasal signs and symptoms than the oral formulation and is aided by patient and physician familiarity.

### Role of antihistamines in ocular allergy [^113CVADi]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Although H(1) antihistamines are commonly used to treat allergic disorders and have demonstrated efficacy in allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, data on the effects of these agents specifically on ocular symptoms are limited. Oral H(1) antihistamines inhibit some symptoms of pruritus and erythema in laboratory models and have been shown to be superior to placebo for relief of symptoms in clinical trials. Eye drops typically provide faster relief of ocular symptoms than oral agents, and combination therapy with a topical agent and an oral agent has been found to be superior to the oral agent alone. In general, oral H(1) antihistamines have been considered superior to intranasal corticosteroids for relief of ocular symptoms, but some studies have shown equal efficacy for these agents, or even superior efficacy for intranasal corticosteroids.

### Management of ocular allergy [^111wZqCy]. Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

The treatment and management of ocular allergy (OA) remain a major concern for different specialties, including allergists, ophthalmologists, primary care physicians, rhinologists, pediatricians, dermatologists, clinical immunologists, and pharmacists. We performed a systematic review of all relevant publications in MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web Science including systematic reviews and meta-analysis. Publications were considered relevant if they addressed treatments, or management strategies of OA. A further wider systematic literature search was performed if no evidence or good quality evidence was found. There are effective drugs for the treatment of OA; however, there is a lack an optimal treatment for the perennial and severe forms. Topical antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, or double-action drugs are the first choice of treatment. All of them are effective in reducing signs and symptoms of OA. The safety and optimal dosing regimen of the most effective topical anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, are still a major concern. Topical calcineurin inhibitors may be used in steroid-dependent/resistant cases of severe allergic keratoconjunctivitis. Allergen-specific immunotherapy may be considered in cases of failure of first-line treatments or to modify the natural course of OA disease. Based on the current wealth of publications and on the collective experience, recommendations on management of OA have been proposed.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^115N4ftS]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Seasonal/perennial allergic conjunctivitis — management — Nonpharmacologic measures include that "Recommendations often include wearing sunglasses as a barrier to airborne allergens, cold compresses, refrigerated artificial tears, avoiding eye rubbing, and avoiding allergens", with additional measures such as "Hypoallergenic bedding, eyelid cleansers to remove allergens, frequent clothes washing, and bathing/showering before bedtime may also be helpful". Pharmacologic therapy notes that "Mild allergic conjunctivitis can be treated with an over-the-counter topical antihistamine/vasoconstrictor agent or with more effective second-generation topical histamine H1-receptor antagonists", many drops "can be stored in the refrigerator" for symptomatic relief, and chronic vasoconstrictor use "can be associated with rebound vasodilation once the agent is stopped". For recurrent or persistent disease, "mast-cell stabilizers can be used", and "Many new medications combine antihistamine activity with mast-cell stabilizing properties and can be used for either acute or chronic disease". Related comorbidity relief is described: "The use of topical mast-cell inhibitors can also be helpful in alleviating the symptoms of allergic rhinitis", including nasal spray or aerosols, while as a general precaution, "Indiscriminate use of topical antibiotics or corticosteroids should be avoided because antibiotics can induce toxicity, and corticosteroids can potentially prolong adenoviral infections and worsen HSV infections".

Vernal conjunctivitis (vernal keratoconjunctivitis, VKC) management — General measures include environmental modification, cool compresses, ocular lubricants, and topical and oral antihistamines and topical mast-cell stabilizers, which "can be useful to maintain comfort". For acute exacerbations, "topical corticosteroids are usually necessary to control severe symptoms and signs". Immunomodulatory therapy has supporting data: "Topical cyclosporine 2% has demonstrated a reduction in signs and symptoms compared with placebo after 2 weeks of use in patients with VKC", and "0.05% topical cyclosporine used at least four times daily" has been effective for severe disease and in "preventing seasonal recurrences". "Cyclosporine 0.1% is the first and only topical immunomodulator FDA approved for the specific treatment of VKC in children and adults". Steroid-sparing agents "may reduce or eliminate the use of topical steroids", and for "severe sight-threatening vernal keratoconjunctivitis that is not responsive to topical therapy, supratarsal injection of corticosteroid can be considered".

### Treatment of allergic conjunctivitis with bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution 1.5% [^116zdcr8]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Allergic conjunctivitis (AC) is the most common allergic ocular disorder, affecting up to 60 million Americans annually. The hallmarks of AC include a combination of ocular itching and conjunctival hyperemia (redness), which are often accompanied by chemosis, lid swelling, and tearing, as well as rhinorrhea and other nasal symptoms.–The most common instigators of this allergic condition are either seasonal pollens or perennial allergens, including, but not limited to, dust mites, molds, or animal dander. Allergic responses generally occur in two phases. The early or immediate (acute) phase occurs within minutes of allergen exposure, and results from antigen-evoked mast cell degranulation and subsequent histamine release. This is followed by a late or delayed (chronic) phase, hours or days after exposure, that is manifested by proinflammatory mediators and recruitment of immune cells including eosinophils and neutrophils.

### Management of ocular allergy itch with an antihistamine-releasing contact lens [^115YmmsY]. Cornea (2019). Medium credibility.

Ketotifen exhibits a unique spectrum of activity among the agents used to treat AC. Like many ocular antihistamines, ketotifen possess both antihistamine and mast-cell stabilizing properties; it is a high-affinity antagonist of H 1 receptorswhich acts both as a competitive inhibitor of histamine and as an inhibitor of histamine release. In addition, ketotifen has been shown to attenuate accumulation of mast cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils at the sites of allergen deposition. This action prevents the initiation of more chronic allergic responses and contributes to the efficacy of ketotifen in the treatment of AC.

Topical treatments for ocular disease provide significant pharmacological advantages, particularly in terms of delivery of the therapeutic at the site of action and minimization of systemic exposure. Despite this, topicals are limited by a number of factors: tear film turnover is high (limiting exposure time), and accurate, reproducible instillation of drops is a challenge for many patients. Use of CLs as a vehicle for the delivery of therapeutic agents to the ocular surface may be a solution to these issues for lens users dealing with allergiesor other conditions, including glaucoma, ocular infection, or ocular trauma.

In this report, we describe the use of a CL-based delivery modality for ketotifen therapy of AC. The studies employed the conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC; Ora, Inc, Andover, MA) model to measure the lens/ketotifen combination efficacy. The CAC model provides a controlled alternative to traditional environmental allergy trials and allows for reproducible allergic responses that can be used as a reliable test of antiallergic efficacy. In this method, a reproducible allergic response to a quantified, instilled allergen is established in each subject. In subsequent visits, these challenges are repeated following instillation of test compounds such as antihistamines or steroids. – By varying the time between treatment and challenge, both onset and duration of the therapeutic effects can be quantified. The model has been validated over many trials, and CAC-based studies are an established standard for FDA approval of ophthalmic antiallergicssuch as olopatadine, bepotastine, and alcaftadine.

### The phase 3 INVIGORATE trial of reproxalap in patients with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis [^115Qei3u]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite an increasing prevalence of allergic conjunctivitis that includes more than 20% of the US population, drugs to treat allergic conjunctivitis with novel mechanisms of action have not been introduced in decades. Furthermore, although most patients with allergic conjunctivitis are treated at least initially with topical antihistamines, the need for adjunctive therapy is common. For example, in one study, up to 60% of patients required non-antihistaminic medication, which often includes topical corticosteroids, a class of drugs associated with potentially serious ocular toxicity including elevation of intraocular pressure and development of glaucoma.

Topical conjunctival allergen challenge has typically been used in development of allergic conjunctivitis drugs. However, the clinical relevance of applying concentrated allergen to the ocular surface can be questioned, and the assessment of duration of drug activity after challenge is often limited to less than 10 minutes, possibly due to waning drug effect resulting from rapidly declining histamine levels, which peak within 5 to 10 minutes of allergen exposure. Investigational allergic conjunctivitis drugs may also be tested in field trials, but exposure to pollen is variable, unpredictable, and depends heavily on weather and patient behaviors. Allergen chambers, on the other hand, represent a combination of direct conjunctival challenge and field trials, allowing for a controlled exposure to allergens in a simulated real-world setting. In a small, proof-of-concept clinical trial using an allergen chamber, reproxalap demonstrated preliminary activity in patient-reported symptoms and investigator-assessed ocular redness. Accordingly, the Phase 3 INVIGORATE Trial was performed to assess the activity of reproxalap in a real-world model of seasonal allergen exposure. Based on published clinical relevance thresholds for patient-reported ocular itching and redness, two different within-patient responder analysis methods were used to confirm the clinical relevance of the results.

### Allergic conjunctivitis: a cross-sectional study [^111iVNSt]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Ocular allergy is a common disease in daily practice.

Objectives

A cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate clinical aspects of and therapeutic approaches to ocular allergy in Italy.

Methods

Of the 3685 patients affected by ocular allergy and enrolled by 304 ophthalmologists nationally, 3545 were eligible to be included in the statistical analysis. A questionnaire was administered in office to record demographic data, comorbidities, trigger factors, number of conjunctivitis episodes, and past treatments. Signs and symptoms were graded according to their severity, frequency, and duration.

Results

Mean age of enrolled patients was 38 ± 19 years. Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (55% of patients) was equally distributed among the different age groups, while perennial allergic conjunctivitis (18%) increased with age and vernal keratoconjunctivitis (9%) was more frequent under the age of 18. Itching and redness were reported in 90% and 85%, respectively; lid skin involvement was observed in 22% of cases and keratitis in 11%. Pollen sensitivities were indicated as the most frequent triggers; however, exposure to non-specific environmental conditions, pollutants, and cigarette smoke was frequently reported. Only 35% of patients underwent a diagnostic evaluation of specific allergic sensitization, with positive allergy tests found in 82% of this subset. With regard to treatment, topical decongestants were used in 43% of patients, corticosteroids in 41%, antihistamines in 29%, systemic antihistamines in 27%, and mast cell stabilizers in 15%.

Conclusion

This survey provided useful epidemiological information regarding the clinical characteristics and treatment options of a large cohort of patients affected by different forms of ocular allergy.

Clinical Relevance

An understanding of ocular allergic disease, its incidence, demographics, and treatment paradigms provides important information towards understanding its pharmacoeconomics and burden on the national health system.

### Effect of alcaftadine 0.25% on ocular itch associated with seasonal or perennial allergic conjunctivitis: a pooled analysis of two multicenter randomized clinical trials [^113gyYpi]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Both SAC and PAC can cause significant discomfort, reduce quality of life, and lead to a loss of productivity, particularly during the spring and fall allergy seasons.–Effectively treating the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitisand limiting the onset of future symptoms via minimizing exposure to specific allergenshave been shown to improve quality of life in patients with ocular allergy. The ocular manifestations of both SAC and PAC are secondary to mast cell degranulation and subsequent allergic inflammation in sensitized individuals. Once sensitized, exposure to either a seasonal or perennial allergen may elicit a classic allergic conjunctivitis response within minutes. Therefore, critical to improving a patient's quality of life is a safe and effective treatment that has a rapid onset of action and is effective against both seasonal and perennial allergens.

Topical ophthalmic antihistamines are the primary treatment option for patients with allergic conjunctivitis. With antagonistic activity against H 1, H 2, and H 4 receptors, alcaftadine is a dual-action antiallergic agent that directly inhibits histamine receptor activation and indirectly reduces allergic responses by stabilizing mast cells. The role of H 4 receptors in allergic conjunctivitis has not been fully elucidated; in vitro studies suggest that histamine binding to H 4 receptors may mediate eosinophil chemotaxis. In vivo studies have also suggested that H 4 receptors play a role in mediating inflammatory and pruritic responses.

In the current analysis of pooled data from two, large, similarly designed clinical studies, alcaftadine 0.25% was well tolerated and demonstrated significant reduction in ocular itching induced by both seasonal and perennial allergens at all time points (3, 5, and 7 minutes) measured after conjunctival challenge with allergen using the CAC model. In addition, the reduction in itching by alcaftadine was similar between those subjects challenged with seasonal allergens and those challenged with perennial allergens. Significantly higher proportions of subjects challenged with seasonal or perennial allergens achieved minimal itch (itch score < 1) or zero itch (itch score = 0) after treatment with alcaftadine 0.25% compared with placebo. Alcaftadine was shown to have a rapid onset of action upon challenge with both seasonal and perennial allergens, up to 16 hours post drop instillation. This rapid and sustained effect of alcaftadine may be because of its ability to prevent loss of epithelial tight junction proteins (zonula occludens-1, E-cadherin) and to reduce eosinophil infiltration, as has been shown in animal models of allergic conjunctivitis.

### Treatment of allergic conjunctivitis with bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution 1.5% [^112t1Fzq]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

AC is classified as a type 1, IgE-mediated hypersensitivity immune reaction and occurs in individuals previously exposed to the offending allergen. The signs and symptoms of AC are primarily caused by the action of mast cell-derived histamine, which acts on H 1 and H 2 histamine receptors in the surrounding ocular tissues. For this reason, medications that stabilize mast cells and reduce degranulation and those that directly antagonize the action of histamine at its receptors have become the first-line therapy for AC. Medications of this class, dual-action antihistamines, have both an improved safety profile and increased therapeutic effect compared to older topical agents (eg, pheniramine maleate) used in the treatment of AC.,

Bepotastine besilate is an anti-allergic agent with multiple mechanisms of action that has been extensively investigated in both preclinical and clinical studies. Bepotastine besilate is a dual-action agent, a highly selective histamine H 1 -receptor antagonist, with potent mast cell-stabilizing effects.–The anti-inflammatory actions of bepotastine besilate include inhibition of leukotriene B4and attenuating eosinophil chemotaxis and activation.–Bepotastine has also been shown to inhibit the biosynthesis of proinflammatory IL-5 in vitro. Oral formulations of bepotastine besilate have been well-characterized in Japan in both preclinical,–and clinical reports,–as well as in several clinical safety studies.–Positive results from these studies led to approval by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare in July 2000 of an oral bepotastine besilate formulation (Talion ® tablet; Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, Osaka, Japan)for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and subsequently (in 2002) for urticaria and several types of dermal prurituses.–Based on the history of clinical effectiveness accumulated since the approval in Japan, bepotastine besilate was reformulated for investigation of its topical use in the treatment of AC.

Dupilumab — conjunctivitis risk and management: Conjunctivitis can be an adverse effect of dupilumab, and prior history of conjunctivitis and more severe AD before start of dupilumab may be risk factors for conjunctivitis with dupilumab treatment. Some protocols suggest a baseline eye examination by an ophthalmologist and the use of lubricant eye drops (artificial tears) twice daily when dupilumab is initiated, but practice varies, and mild conjunctivitis may respond to warm compresses, lubricant eye drops, and if there is concomitant allergen exposure, antihistamine eye drops. Patients with symptoms of severe ocular disease, such as blurred vision, decrease in visual acuity, purulent eye discharge, photophobia, or eye pain, should be urgently or emergently evaluated by ophthalmology. Treatment with ophthalmic topical corticosteroids or other immunomodulatory (tacrolimus, cyclosporine, lifitegrast) eye drops may be needed to treat the conjunctivitis and prevent its potential complications, and treatment of any eczema around the eyes with topical cortisone ointment or pimecrolimus cream may help with reducing ocular itching and rubbing.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^112noXpZ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) guideline action statements — Clinicians should make the clinical diagnosis of AR when patients present with a history and physical examination consistent with an allergic cause and 1 or more of the following symptoms: nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy nose, or sneezing. Clinicians should perform and interpret, or refer to a clinician who can perform and interpret, specific IgE (skin or blood) allergy testing for patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR who do not respond to empiric treatment, or when the diagnosis is uncertain, or when knowledge of the specific causative allergen is needed to target therapy. Clinicians should not routinely perform sinonasal imaging in patients presenting with symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of AR. Clinicians may advise avoidance of known allergens or may advise environmental controls (eg, removal of pets, the use of air filtration systems, bed covers, and acaricides [chemical agents that kill dust mites]) in AR patients who have identified allergens that correlate with clinical symptoms. Clinicians should assess patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR for, and document in the medical record, the presence of associated conditions such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, sleep-disordered breathing, conjunctivitis, rhinosinusitis, and otitis media. Clinicians should recommend intranasal steroids for patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR whose symptoms affect their quality of life, and clinicians should recommend oral second-generation/less sedating antihistamines for patients with AR and primary complaints of sneezing and itching. Clinicians may offer intranasal antihistamines for patients with seasonal, perennial, or episodic AR, and clinicians should not offer oral leukotriene receptor antagonists as primary therapy for patients with AR. Clinicians may offer combination pharmacologic therapy in patients with AR who have inadequate response to pharmacologic monotherapy, and clinicians should offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, immunotherapy (sublingual or subcutaneous) for patients with AR who have inadequate response to symptoms with pharmacologic therapy with or without environmental controls. Clinicians may offer, or refer to a surgeon who can offer, inferior turbinate reduction in patients with AR with nasal airway obstruction and enlarged inferior turbinates who have failed medical management; clinicians may offer acupuncture, or refer to a clinician who can offer acupuncture, for patients with AR who are interested in nonpharmacologic therapy; and no recommendation regarding the use of herbal therapy for patients with AR.

### ICON: diagnosis and management of allergic conjunctivitis [^116DcWjy]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Ocular allergy (OA), interchangeably known as allergic conjunctivitis, is a common immunological hypersensitivity disorder affecting up to 40% of the population. Ocular allergy has been increasing in frequency, with symptoms of itching, redness, and swelling that significantly impacts an individual's quality of life (QOL). Ocular allergy is an often underdiagnosed and undertreated health problem, because only 10% of patients with OA symptoms seek medical attention, whereas most patients manage with over-the-counter medications and complementary nonpharmacological remedies. The clinical course, duration, severity, and co-morbidities are varied and depend, in part, on the specific ocular tissues that are affected and on immunologic mechanism(s) involved, both local and systemic. It is frequently associated with allergic rhinitis (commonly recognized as allergic rhino conjunctivitis), and with other allergic comorbidities. The predominance of self-management increases the risk of suboptimal therapy that leads to recurrent exacerbations and the potential for development of more chronic conditions that can lead to corneal complications and interference with the visual axis. Multiple, often co-existing causes are seen, and a broad differential diagnosis for OA, increasing the difficulty of arriving at the correct diagnosis(es). Ocular allergy commonly overlaps with other anterior ocular disease disorders, including infectious disorders and dry eye syndromes. Therefore, successful management includes overcoming the challenges of underdiagnosis and even misdiagnosis by a better understanding of the subtleties of an in-depth patient history, ophthalmologic examination techniques, and diagnostic procedures, which are of paramount importance in making an accurate diagnosis of OA. Appropriate cross-referral between specialists (allergists and eyecare specialists) would maximize patient care and outcomes. This would significantly improve OA management and overcome the unmet needs in global health.

### Epithelial barrier dysfunction in ocular allergy [^1138bJPx]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

3 OCULAR ALLERGY

The term allergic conjunctivitis or OA refers to a collection of hypersensitivity disorders affecting primarily the lid and conjunctiva and includes different phenotypes varying from seasonal (SAC) and perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), to the chronic vernal (VKC) and atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC), and contact blepharoconjunctivitis.

Successful management of OA involves preventive, non‐pharmacologic as well as pharmacologic measures. Over the years various therapeutic options have been developed to achieve symptom control in OA including topical antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, and dual acting agents with use of corticosteroids and immunomodulators in severe cases. However, in the chronic forms, none of these completely control the signs and symptoms or prevent the recurrences. Ocular surface inflammation in VKC and AKC often leads to severe suffering and complications such as corneal ulcers, tissue remodeling, scars, and rarely LSC deficiency, characterized by invasion of conjunctival epithelium into the cornea. Further, treatment related complications such as increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and cataract arise due to side effects of steroids overuse warranting new and safer therapeutics. Since the eyes are exposed directly to an outer environment, defective barrier must be primarily involved in the pathology of OA. Epithelial barrier integrity is known to be compromised in dry eye pathologies suggesting that barrier dysfunction plays a critical role in different ocular surface disorders.

### Histamine and H1-antihistamines: celebrating a century of progress [^111R9Dov]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

In this review we celebrate a century of progress since the initial description of the physiologic and pathologic roles of histamine and 70 years of progress since the introduction of H(1)-antihistamines for clinical use. We discuss histamine and clinically relevant information about the molecular mechanisms of action of H(1)-antihistamines as inverse agonists (not antagonists or blockers) with immunoregulatory effects. Unlike first (old)-generation H(1)-antihistamines introduced from 1942 to the mid-1980s, most of the second (new)-generation H(1)-antihistamines introduced subsequently have been investigated extensively with regard to clinical pharmacology, efficacy, and safety; moreover, they are relatively free from adverse effects and not causally linked with fatalities after overdose. Important advances include improved nasal and ophthalmic H(1)-antihistamines with rapid onset of action (in minutes) for allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis treatment, respectively, and effective and safe use of high (up to 4-fold) doses of oral second-generation H(1)-antihistamines for chronic urticaria treatment. New H(1)-antihistamines introduced for clinical use include oral formulations (bilastine and rupatadine), and ophthalmic formulations (alcaftadine and bepotastine). Clinical studies of H(3)-antihistamines with enhanced decongestant effects have been conducted in patients with allergic rhinitis. Additional novel compounds being studied include H(4)-antihistamines with anti-inflammatory effects in allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and other diseases. Antihistamines have a storied past and a promising future.

### Antihistamines: do they work? Further well-controlled trials involving larger samples are needed [^111RPkEM]. Allergy (2004). Low credibility.

Histamine is one of the most important steps in the phlogistic allergic reaction. Its activity is due to the link to specific receptors on the cellular surface. H1-receptors of second generation are the most currently prescribed drugs in allergic diseases for their high selectivity, little or no central sedative effect, rapid onset of action and long half lives. Antihistamines can modulate part of immunological mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation reducing mediator release and expression of adhesion molecules, regulating the release of cytokines, chemokines and consequently inflammatory cells recruitment. The anti-inflammatory effects of cetirizine, desloratadine and levocetirizine are reviewed. Quality of life is considered too, as a main parameter in a global evaluation of the antihistamine's effects.

### Management of allergic conjunctivitis: an evaluation of the perceived comfort and therapeutic efficacy of olopatadine 0.2% and azelastine 0.05% from two prospective studies [^116arn72]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Results from 2 patient-reported outcome studies of allergic conjunctivitis sufferers who used olopatadine 0.2% and azelastine 0.05% are analyzed.

Methods

The PACE (Pataday Allergic Conjunctivitis Evaluation) multi-center, prospective, open-label study examined patient perceptions of olopatadine 0.2% once daily (qd) and previous twice daily (bid) allergic conjunctivitis medications via questionnaire in allergic conjunctivitis sufferers who had previously used bid medication and then initiated olopatadine. A second conjunctival antigen challenge (CAC) study evaluated comfort of 4 allergic conjunctivitis medications.

Results

Forty-nine patients from the PACE study (N = 125) with prior azelastine use were examined. Significantly more patients rated themselves "very satisfied" with current olopatadine use compared with past azelastine use on drop comfort (p < 0.0001), speed of relief (p = 0.0004), and overall satisfaction (70% vs 16%, p < 0.0001). Significantly more patients reported olopatadine "very effective" against swelling compared with azelastine (47% vs 8%, p = 0.0404). In the CAC study (N = 36), data from olopatadine (n = 8), azelastine (n = 9) and placebo (N = 36) groups were reported. Olopatadine was rated significantly more comfortable than azelastine upon instillation (p = 0.0223), at 30 seconds (p = 0.0479), and at 1 minute after instillation (p = 0.0240).

Conclusion

In the reported studies, olopatadine 0.2% qd was more comfortable than azelastine 0.05% and preferred by patients with allergic conjunctivitis by a ratio of 4:1.

Allergic conjunctivitis is a common cause of ocular itching, conjunctival hyperemia, and watering and can be triggered by both seasonal and perennial allergens. Its prevalence has been estimated at up to 40%. The condition negatively impacts quality of life and work productivity.

The pathophysiology of allergic conjunctivitis involves immune responses mediated by histamine and mast cells. Treatment consists of antihistamines for immediate relief and mast-cell stabilizers for long-term control. Corticosteroids can be used for short periods to manage acute flares but safety issues such as elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and cataract formation limit long-term use. Recently, Dextenza, a 0.4 mg dexamethasone intracanalicular insert (Ocular Therapeutix, Bedford, MA) has been approved for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis; it is also approved for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain following ocular surgery. The dexamethasone intracanalicular insert is a rod-shaped depot of 0.4 mg preservative-free dexamethasone encapsulated within polyethylene glycol-based hydrogel that expands after contact with fluid to occlude the punctum and secure its placement. Fluorescein is conjugated to the hydrogel to enable visualization. The insert delivers a sustained and tapered dose of dexamethasone to the ocular surface for up to 30 days and resorbs completely.

In Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, the dexamethasone insert relieved ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis more effectively than placebo when evaluated using a modified conjunctival allergen challenge model. To date, no real-world studies have evaluated the insert's effectiveness in managing signs and symptoms of clinical allergic conjunctivitis, nor have any studies included comparisons to other treatments for allergic eye disease. We have conducted a randomized trial comparing the dexamethasone insert to loteprednol — a topical corticosteroid — and to olopatadine — a topical antihistamine/mast cell stabilizer — in reducing the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis.

### Ophthalmic drugs for patients with allergic conjunctivitis… [^1172DvFC]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

New ophthalmic formulations of ketotifen fumarate, pemirolast potassium and nedocromil sodium have recently received labeling approval from the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adults and children with itchy eyes resulting from allergic conjunctivitis. Pemirolast and nedocromil are mast-cell stabilizers; ketotifen, in addition to this property, also has H. 1-receptor antagonists have been shown to be effective in the treatment of patients with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. Like ketotifen, olopatadine is a mast-cell stabilizer and a selective H 1-receptor antagonist and has been shown to be useful in the treatment of patients with allergic conjunctivitis. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. Neither ketotifen, pemirolast or nedocromil result in significant absorption or accumulation of drug.

Results of one four-week clinical trial revealed that ketotifen 0. 05 percent was as effective as cromolyn 2 percent in decreasing the signs and symptoms associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Evidence from another clinical trial revealed that pemirolast 0. 1 percent used four times daily was more effective than placebo in preventing signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. Ocular irritation, burning or stinging may occur with the use of these drugs. Conjunctival injection, headache and rhinitis were common side effects associated with the use of ketotifen, although allergic reactions, stinging, discharge, eye pain and photophobia occurred in less than 5 percent of patients. With pemirolast, the most common adverse side effects were headache, rhinitis and mild cold or flu symptoms. Headache was the most common adverse side effect associated with the use of nedocromil, but unpleasant taste and nasal congestion also occurred.

The consultants conclude that ketotifen, pemirolast and nedocromil appear to be effective in the treatment of itching caused by allergic conjunctivitis. Whether these drugs are more effective than the existing drugs in their class has not been determined.

### Pooled analysis of two studies evaluating efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis [^111nfUzW]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Two individual phase 3 conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) studies of similar design have assessed the efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride (HCl) 0.77% for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the integrated efficacy and safety of olopatadine HCl 0.77% from a larger dataset by pooling data from the two individual CAC studies.

Methods

Data were pooled from two phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double-masked, active- and vehicle-controlled CAC studies. The primary comparison was on ocular itching scores between olopatadine HCl 0.77% versus vehicle (at onset and 24 hours) and olopatadine HCl 0.77% versus olopatadine 0.2% (at 24 hours). Additional end points included conjunctival redness, total redness, and proportion of itching responders at onset and 24-hour duration of CAC. For both primary and secondary analysis, mixed model repeated measures analysis was used, except for proportion of ocular itching responders. Sensitivity analyses were carried out using a two-sample t -test.

Results

This analysis included 448 patients. Olopatadine HCl 0.77% was superior to vehicle (P < 0.0001) at onset and 24-hour duration of action (difference in means: −1.14 to −1.52) and to olopatadine 0.2% (P = 0.0009) at 24-hour duration of action in relieving ocular itch. Additionally, olopatadine HCl 0.77% substantially reduced conjunctival redness and total redness over vehicle and olopatadine 0.2% at onset and 24-hour duration of action. At 24 hours CAC, there were a higher proportion of itching responders with olopatadine HCl 0.77% compared to vehicle or olopatadine 0.2% (difference in proportion of responders: 43.17%, P < 0.0001, and 17.25%, P = 0.0012, respectively). No safety concerns were identified.

Conclusion

This analysis confirms the findings from the individual studies. The rapid onset and prolonged duration of action (for 24 hours) of olopatadine HCl 0.77% supports once-daily dosing in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.

### A randomized, multicenter phase 3 clinical trial evaluating intracanalicular dexamethasone insert for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^112KecqA]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Allergic conjunctivitis is an inflammatory-mediated disorder induced by seasonal or perennial allergens and affects up to approximately 40% of the general United States (US) population. However, it is often underdiagnosed and undertreated due to its association with other disorders such as dry eye disease and allergic rhinitis. Two of the most common symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis are itching and redness. For patients with moderate to severe symptoms, there is a detrimental impact on quality of life. Several studies have examined the impact of allergic conjunctivitis on patients' quality of life. In a study of 220 patients with ocular allergy, nearly half rated their disease severity of at least 6 on a scale of 1 to 10; moreover, patient-reported quality of life significantly declined during allergic conjunctivitis episodes (P < 0.001). A study of more than 1000 patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis found that allergic conjunctivitis was associated with a decrease in productivity, illustrated by an impairment while working and an increase in hours of work missed.

Current treatment options for allergic conjunctivitis include topical antihistamines, which have a rapid onset and short duration of action, and topical mast-cell stabilizers, which require a long loading period. Topical corticosteroids are effective in both the early and late phases of the allergic response but are generally limited to a short course (1–2 weeks) for patients with more severe or persistent symptoms due to the potential for misuse or abuse of steroids, which can lead to complications associated with long-term use. All topical corticosteroid eye drops commercially available in the US contain preservatives, which can cause patient discomfort and corneal toxicity. Topical corticosteroids also have a complex dosing regimen, which can result in poor patient compliance and difficulty with self-administration. An additional limitation with the application of topical drops includes frequent touching of the face, which potentially increases the risk for infection.

### Phase III trials examining the efficacy of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% compared to vehicle for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis in the conjunctival allergen challenge model [^114yLcWL]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Most of the approved treatments for ocular allergies are antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers, or both, and act to reduce the signs and symptoms of the early-phase reaction. Cetirizine hydrochloride (Zyrtec ®; Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc; New Brunswick, NJ, USA) is the number one oral antihistamine allergy treatment recommended by allergists. Cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% used in these studies was a sterile, buffered, clear, colorless aqueous solution containing cetirizine 0.24% (equivalent to cetirizine hydrochloride 0.29%) and 0.010% benzalkonium chloride (preservative). Cetirizine hydrochloride selectively inhibits H1 histamine receptors to treat seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, idiopathic urticaria, and itching due to chronic hivesand has a long-standing record of approval in different formulations. Cetirizine hydrochloride is safe and well tolerated and was approved in tablet form (5 and 10 mg) in USA in 1995, as a syrup formulation in 1996, for children aged 2–5 years in 1998, for children aged 6 months and older in 2002, and for nonprescription use as a chewable tablet and syrup in 2007. The long-standing therapeutic success and safety of cetirizine hydrochloride in different formulations and pronounced ocular symptoms of allergic conjunctivitissupported the development of cetirizine hydrochloride as an ophthalmic solution to combat the ocular effects of allergic conjunctivitis.

In 2018, cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% (Zerviate™) was approved by the Food and Drug Agency for the treatment of ocular itch associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Here, we report two Phase III efficacy studies that were the basis of this approval. These two studies show strong and similar anti-itch efficacy of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% compared with vehicle using the CAC model. Study 2 expanded the efficacy assessment in Study 1 to subjects with more severe allergic conjunctivitis symptoms including eyelid swelling. Together these studies show reproducible success of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% for the treatment of ocular and nasal signs and symptoms associated with allergic conjunctivitis in diverse patient populations. Clinical efficacy was demonstrated with a 15-minute onset of action and añ8-hour duration of action.

### Efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis using a conjunctival allergen-challenge model [^115XXExF]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Frequently associated with allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis is the most common form of ocular allergy, resulting in a condition better known as "allergic rhinoconjunctivitis". Itchy eyes and nasal congestion are the main symptoms, often accompanied by irritability and fatigue. Despite the efficacy of the current available products to treat allergic conjunctivitis, patients experiencing incomplete symptom relief are likely to benefit from using a product that provides symptom relief over the course of an entire day with the convenience of once-daily dosing.

Allergic conjunctivitis occurs when allergens such as grass or ragweed pollen, dust mites, and animal dander cause an immune reaction in the eye mediated by IgE. A cascade of events leads to mast-cell degranulation and release of histamine and other proinflammatory mediators at the site of allergen invasion. The inflammatory reaction results in vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, leukocyte chemotaxis, and emigration of inflammatory cells into the surrounding tissue spaces, thus causing ocular inflammation, ocular itching, redness, tearing, swelling of the conjunctiva (chemosis), and eyelid swelling. Ocular symptoms in particular – itchy eyes, puffers, and watering – can have a significant impact on patients' daily activities, leading to poorer quality of life and increased resource utilization, irrespective of the severity of nasal symptoms.

The prevalence of allergic conjunctivitis is difficult to ascertain; however, 30% of the US population report nasal and ocular symptoms for at least 1 week of the year, and approximately 70%–80% of seasonal allergic patients have severe ocular symptoms. An estimated 14% of the US population are thought to suffer from allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and 15%–20% of the Japanese population are thought to suffer from allergic conjunctival diseases.

Available treatment options for the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis include antihistamines, mast-cell stabilizers, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Among antihistaminic drugs, olopatadine is a selective antagonist of histamine H 1 receptors, causing mast-cell stabilization and prevention of histamine-induced inflammatory cytokine production. Olopatadine hydrochloride ophthalmic solutions at concentrations of 0.1% and 0.2% (Patanol ® and Pataday ®, respectively; Alcon Research Ltd, Fort Worth, TX, USA) are effective for the management of allergic conjunctivitis, including reducing ocular itching.–

### Azelastine hydrochloride, a dual-acting anti-inflammatory ophthalmic solution, for treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^117RJTUH]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

Over 50% of patients who seek treatment for allergies present with ocular symptoms. Our current ability to control ocular allergic symptoms is greater than ever before. Newer dual-acting topical eyedrops attack multiple facets of the allergic cascade. Azelastine has antihistaminic effects providing immediate relief, mast cell stabilization providing early-phase intervention, and inhibition of expression and activation of anti-inflammatory mediators which characterize the late phase of the immune reaction. The ophthalmic eyedrop formulation is approved for treatment of allergic conjunctivitis in adults and children aged over 3 years. In clinical trials comparing azelastine with other dual-acting eyedrops, such as levocabastine and olopatadine, azelastine was reported to be slightly less efficacious and to sting briefly upon administration. Even so, many patients experienced the full benefit of symptom relief, and preferred azelastine. As a broad-spectrum drug, azelastine offers many desirable properties for management of ocular allergies. Because it can often produce maximal effect with just twice-daily dosing, azelastine is a particularly good choice for the allergic population in whom minimizing exposure to topical products and preservatives is a key concern.

### Allergic conjunctivitis [^117Q72Zb]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Allergic conjunctivitis is common, especially during the allergy season. Consultation with the allergist to perform skin tests or in vitro tests may be useful and confirmatory in the diagnosis of ocular allergy. If treatment is necessary, antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are safe and reasonably effective. Corticosteroids are an order of magnitude more potent than noncorticosteroids; however, they have attendant side effects that are best monitored by the ophthalmologist. The development of "modified" corticosteroids has been a boon to the treatment of ocular allergy because these drugs may reduce potential side effects without sacrificing potency.

### Efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis using a conjunctival allergen-challenge model [^114ASAZp]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Results

Study population

A total of 202 patients were randomized in the study between December 2011 and March 2012; all were available for the safety analysis. Two patients discontinued after randomization but before the scheduled CAC; therefore, 200 patients were available for the intent-to-treat efficacy analysis.

Reasons for study discontinuation were similar across treatment groups, with 16 patients discontinuing the study early after visit 3A (Figure 1). Patient demographic and baseline characteristics were similar across treatment groups, except that different proportions of participants were allergic to different types of allergens causing allergic conjunctivitis (Table 1).

### Update and clinical utility of alcaftadine ophthalmic solution 0.25% in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^1178eonN]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Allergic disorders of the ocular surface are primarily characterized as IgE- and/or T-lymphocyte-mediated disorders that affect the cornea, conjunctiva, and eyelid. Approximately 40% of individuals in the developed countries have allergic conjunctivitis, and as such, it is the most common form of ocular allergy. Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis is the most prevalent type of allergic conjunctivitis that impacts the quality of life of patients. This article reviews the pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical trials, clinical efficacy, and safety of alcaftadine. Histamine and the pathological mechanism of ocular allergy will be briefly reviewed with the intent of providing a background for the detailed discussion on the clinical utility of alcaftadine in allergic conjunctivitis. The Medline PubMed, Elsevier Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases were used to search for evidence-based literature on histamine and immunopathological mechanism of allergic conjunctivitis, as well as on pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical trials, and clinical efficacy of alcaftadine. The treatment and management goals of allergic conjunctivitis are to prevent or minimize the inflammatory cascade associated with allergic response in the early stages of the pathological mechanism. It is of note that activation of histamine receptors on immune and nonimmune cells are associated with allergen-induced inflammation of the conjunctiva and its associated ocular allergic manifestations, including itching, edema, hyperemia, and tearing. Alcaftadine is an efficacious multiple action antiallergic therapeutic agent with inverse agonist activity on H1, H2, and H4 receptors, as well as anti-inflammatory and mast cell stabilizing effects that could provide therapeutic benefits to patients with allergic conjunctivitis.

### Phase III trials examining the efficacy of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% compared to vehicle for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis in the conjunctival allergen challenge model [^116ZhHqy]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

An advantage of the CAC model is the ability to measure the individual signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. In addition to ocular itching, cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% had extended efficacy toward the improvement of other ocular signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis including conjunctival redness, chemosis, eyelid swelling, ciliary redness, and episcleral redness even in the absence of any enrichment (Study 1). Cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% provided some relief for conjunctival redness, similar to other approved therapeutics, although the pathophysiology of redness is not directly targeted by antihistamines. For all other ocular efficacy endpoints, the cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% group was significantly improved compared with vehicle for at least one time point and frequently for several time points. Most notably, cetirizine 0.24% ophthalmic solution had a robust impact on eyelid and conjunctival swelling (chemosis), which was even more pronounced in an enriched population (Study 2, where swelling was entry criteria). These two studies corroborate the success of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% for all standard signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis.

Furthermore, cetirizine demonstrated efficacy in the reduction of multiple nasal symptoms even when provided as a topical ophthalmic solution. Rhinorrhea, nasal pruritus, ear or palatal pruritus, and nasal congestion were significantly improved compared to vehicle at one or more post-CAC time points. Improvements in scores were most robust for the symptom of rhinorrhea where all post-CAC measurements were significantly improved from vehicle and nasal pruritus where the majority of time points were significantly improved from vehicle. Thus, cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% may further help address the needs of a patient who has rhinoconjunctivitis whose nasal symptoms are not being met by an oral therapeutic.

### Management of ocular allergy itch with an antihistamine-releasing contact lens [^115eNYPN]. Cornea (2019). Medium credibility.

Ocular allergy is a pervasive condition that affects up to 20% of the US population, with a similar prevalence worldwide. – Allergic conjunctivitis (AC), the most common type of ocular allergy, is clinically defined as an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity response to exposure of the ocular surface to one or more allergens, including tree or grass pollens, pet dander, or dust mite dander. The impact of AC on overall health and quality of life is consistently underestimated, – and although not typically sight-threatening, AC and related conditions underlie significant loss in patient productivity and quality of life.,

Patients who wear contact lenses (CLs) are particularly impacted by AC. For daily wear CL users, it creates a higher threshold for effective hygiene to minimize allergen accumulation on lenses. Furthermore, because the primary symptom of AC is itch, patients who naturally (and often, unconsciously) respond to ocular itch with eye-rubbing cause an exacerbation of their allergic symptoms and risk damage to both their ocular surface and their lenses. Often, patients who prefer CL use for refractive correction revert to spectacle use during allergy season to avoid these complications.

Currently available antiallergic medications are generally compatible with CL use but require that lenses be removed before topical drug application. This is in part because of concerns regarding interactions between lenses and drop preservatives and also because clinical studies of allergy drops have typically excluded CL users from study populations. Without data to establish compatibility, regulatory guidelines emphasize that drops should not be used while wearing lenses.

Signs and symptoms of AC include hyperemia, watery discharge, chemosis, and itch. Although all of these conditions are seen in other ocular disorders, ocular itching is often considered pathognomonic for conjunctivitis that is of allergic origin. The itch response is due to conjunctival mast cell release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators, and thus the therapeutic approaches to AC have focused on use of topical antihistamines such as olopatadine, bepotastine, or ketotifen. These second-generation antihistamines are characterized by a rapid, prolonged suppression of allergen-associated itch responses.

### Antihistamine use in children [^114WbNnf]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2015). Low credibility.

This review provides an overview of the use of antihistamines in children. We discuss types of histamine receptors and their mechanism of action, absorption, onset and duration of action of first-generation and second-generation H(1)-antihistamines, as well as elimination of H(1)-antihistamines which has important implications for dosing in children. The rationale for the use of H(1)-antihistamines is explored for the relief of histamine-mediated symptoms in a variety of allergic conditions including: non-anaphylactic allergic reactions, atopic eczema (AE), allergic rhinitis (AR) and conjunctivitis, chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and whether they have a role in the management of intermittent and chronic cough, anaphylaxis, food protein-induced gastrointestinal allergy and asthma prevention. Second-generation H(1)-antihistamines are preferable to first-generation H(1)-antihistamines in the management of non-anaphylactic allergic reactions, AR, AE and CSU due to: their better safety profile, including minimal cognitive and antimuscarinic side effects and a longer duration of action. We offer some guidance as to the choices of H(1)-antihistamines available currently and their use in specific clinical settings. H(1)-antihistamine class, availability, licensing, age and dosing administration, recommended indications in allergic conditions and modalities of delivery for the 12 more commonly used H(1)-antihistamines in children are also tabulated.

### Efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis using a conjunctival allergen-challenge model [^114HtHYn]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Symptom relief for the duration of 24 hours after treatment would benefit patients with allergic conjunctivitis.

Objective

To compare the safety and efficacy of olopatadine 0.77% with vehicle or olopatadine 0.2% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis in a conjunctival allergen-challenge clinical study.

Patients and methods

In this Phase III, multicenter, double-masked, parallel-group, randomized trial, patients with allergic conjunctivitis received olopatadine 0.77%, its vehicle, or olopatadine 0.2%, administered once at visits 3A (day 0), 4A (day 14 ± 2), and 5 (day 21 +3). Allergic conjunctivitis-associated sign and symptom assessments included ocular itching, conjunctival redness, total redness, chemosis, and tearing scores. Adverse events and ocular safety parameters were also assessed.

Results

A total of 202 qualifying patients were randomized. Olopatadine 0.77% was superior (P < 0.001) to vehicle for treatment of ocular itching at 3, 5, and 7 minutes postchallenge at onset of action and 16- and 24-hour duration of action. Conjunctival redness mean scores were significantly lower for olopatadine 0.77% versus vehicle at all three post-conjunctival allergen-challenge time points: onset (−1.52 to −1.48; P < 0.001), 16 hours (−1.50 to −1.38; P < 0.01), and 24 hours (−1.58 to −1.38; P < 0.05). At 24 hours, olopatadine 0.77% was superior to olopatadine 0.2% at all three postchallenge time points for ocular itching (P < 0.05), conjunctival redness (P < 0.05), and total redness (P < 0.05). No clinically relevant differences in safety parameters or adverse events were observed between the treatment groups.

Conclusion

Olopatadine 0.77% is superior to both its vehicle and olopatadine 0.2% for the treatment of allergen-mediated ocular itching and conjunctival redness. Ocular itching symptom relief is maintained over 24 hours, supporting once-daily dosing and demonstrating a comparable safety profile to olopatadine 0.2%.

### Safety of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis in adult and pediatric subjects [^113LNL7h]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Given that allergic reactions are driven by histamine, the therapeutic market has yielded several efficacious systemic antihistamine products. Cetirizine hydrochloride is an antihistamine with a well-characterized systemic safety and efficacy profile due to its use for over 20 years. The anti-allergic efficacy of cetirizine has been documented in various animal and human models. In vitro receptor binding studies have shown no measurable affinity for histamine receptors other than H1 and negligible induction of anticholinergic and anti-serotonergic activity, supporting an on-target product with minimal adaptive immune response. As a result, cetirizine has been approved for use in the United States since 1995 and has since been adapted to various formulations.

Individual patient response to antihistamines can be highly variable, and the efficacy for which systemic antihistamines are valued, including the relief of ocular allergy, is frequently accompanied by ocular adverse events (AEs) such as pupillary changes, blurred vision, and dry eye syndrome. For example, oral cetirizine in patients with normal ocular health has been shown to induce signs and symptoms associated with ocular dryness, including corneal and conjunctival staining, decreased tear film breakup time, and increased ocular discomfort when exposed to a controlled adverse environment (CAE ®). Cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% was developed to minimize systemic effects by using a concentration of cetirizine hydrochloride specifically designed for targeted and comfortable ocular administration.

Here we report the results from one pharmacokinetic (PK) and two safety and tolerability studies conducted as part of the drug development program of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% (Zerviate ®). Cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% used in these studies was a sterile, buffered, clear, colorless aqueous solution containing cetirizine 0.24% (equivalent to cetirizine hydrochloride 0.29%) and 0.010% benzalkonium chloride (preservative). The vehicle used in these studies was identical to cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% except it did not contain the active drug. Cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% demonstrated broad safety and tolerability along with compelling efficacy (Meier et al, 2018, co-submitted) in the relief of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis in pediatric (2–18 years of age) and adult subjects.

### Phase III trials examining the efficacy of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% compared to vehicle for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis in the conjunctival allergen challenge model [^116L3eJn]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Measuring allergic conjunctivitis in a controlled environment has been difficult in the past due to hypervariability dependent on allergen, subject, season, and weather, resulting in different symptomatic responses and a range of severity. The Ora conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) ® model circumvents these concerns inducing a moderate-to-severe allergic reaction in a controlled and reproducible manner. In the CAC model, all subjects undergo a screening procedure where subjects demonstrate reproducible moderate-to-severe allergic responses. This model is an established method approved by regulatory agencies to determine therapeutic efficacy in the relief of allergic signs and symptoms. Numerous studies have demonstrated the clinical efficacy of therapeutics for the indication of allergic conjunctivitis using the CAC model including antihistamines, alcaftadineand olopatadine hydrochloride, and coritcosteroids such as Dextenza. Furthermore, bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution was shown to be efficacious in the treatment of nasal symptoms using the CAC model, demonstrating a broad role for the CAC model in the development of allergic conjunctivitis therapeutics. As a result, the last several products approved for this indication (Pazeo [Alcon Pharmaceuticals; Fort Worth, TX, USA], Lastacaft [Allergan; Dublin, Ireland], Bepreve [Bausch & Lomb; Rochester, NY, USA], and Pataday [Alcon Pharmaceuticals; Fort Worth, TX, USA]) have established efficacy through the CAC model.

### Pooled analysis of two studies evaluating efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis [^112Yewb6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

In addition, olopatadine HCl 0.77% had lower mean scores compared with vehicle and olopatadine 0.2% for all other measured signs and symptoms post-CAC at onset of action and 24-hour duration of action. This data support the overall benefit of olopatadine HCl 0.77% over olopatadine 0.2% in relieving signs and symptoms associated with allergic conjunctivitis, lasting for 24 hours. The similarities in study population and study design justify this pooled analysis, and the consistency of the results across multiple measures supports the overall benefit of olopatadine HCl 0.77% over olopatadine 0.2% in relieving signs and symptoms associated with allergic conjunctivitis lasting for 24 hours.

No serious AEs were reported with olopatadine HCl 0.77% regardless of the treatment duration (onset of action and 24 hours). Overall, the safety profile of olopatadine HCl 0.77% was comparable to the vehicle and the well-established safety profile of olopatadine 0.2%.

### A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group comparison of olopatadine 0.1% ophthalmic solution versus placebo for controlling the signs and symptoms of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis and rhinoconjunctivitis [^114fKRhe]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The most common form of allergic ocular disease is seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, coinciding with the pollen season and generally associated with rhinitis. Symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis include ocular itching, hyperemia, tearing, mucus production, foreign body sensation, chemosis, and lid edema. Similarly, the primary symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis are nasal itching, irritation, sneezing, watery rhinorrhea, and congestion combined with ocular itching, tearing, and swelling.

Objective

This study compared olopatadine 0.1% ophthalmic solution with placebo eyedrops (over-the-counter artificial tear product), instilled in the eye, with regard to the prevention and relief of the ocular and nasal symptoms of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis and rhinoconjunctivitis.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, conducted at 7 US centers, to instill either olopatadine 0.1% ophthalmic solution or placebo eyedrops (artificial tears) in both eyes twice daily for 10 weeks. Patients were evaluated for efficacy (intent-to-treat) and safety. Only patients with proven grass pollen allergy (dermal and conjunctival allergen challenge tests) were selected; all patients were studied during the same period, historically shown to be grass season; and grass pollen counts were obtained.

Results

A total of 131 patients (64 olopatadine; 67 placebo) were assessed for efficacy (intent-to-treat); 132 patients were assessed for safety. The mean (SD) age of participants was 38.53 (11.61) years (range, 18 to 87 years), and 58.0% were women (76/131), with no significant differences between groups for age or sex. In the olopatadine group, 1.6% of patients were black (1/64), compared with 14.9% of the placebo group (10/67) (P = 0.005). Mean scores of ocular itching and hyperemia were lower at all assessment times with olopatadine than placebo. The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05) for itching on days 7, 14, 35, 63, and 70, and for hyperemia on days 14, 28, 42, and 63, after correction for multiplicity. Linear regression slopes predicting ocular itching and hyperemia from the pollen count were significantly lower (P < 0.003 and P < 0.035, respectively) with olopatadine than with placebo. Similar results were obtained for rhinorrhea, sneezing, and nasal itching (P < 0.006, P < 0.012, and P < 0.034, respectively). With placebo, the proportion of patients with frequent ocular itching and hyperemia increased as a function of pollen level; however, with olopatadine, the proportions remained low and virtually constant.

Conclusion

In the population studied, olopatadine 0.1% ophthalmic solution controlled ocular and nasal symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis and rhinocojunctivitis and was well tolerated when administered twice daily for 10 weeks.

### DEXTENZA versus topical steroid or antihistamine therapy for treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^115mBKDb]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Overall, this real-world study demonstrated that the dexamethasone intracanalicular insert was preferred over topical therapy and was as effective as a topical antihistamine/mast cell stabilizer and more effective than topical steroids in relieving the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. This insert should be considered as an alternative to topical therapy for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. Larger head-to-head trials of therapies for allergic conjunctivitis can further clarify the roles of these agents in disease management.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first real-world study of the dexamethasone intracanalicular insert for allergic conjunctivitis. Patients experienced greater improvements in signs and symptoms with the dexamethasone intracanalicular insert than with the topical steroid loteprednol and preferred the insert to topical therapy by more than a 2-to-1 margin. Conversely, outcomes were similar and no clear preference was demonstrated between the insert and the use of the topical antihistamine/mast cell stabilizer olopatadine.

Statistical differences in signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis favoring the dexamethasone insert over topical loteprednol therapy may be explained in several ways. First is the two drugs' relative potency: dexamethasone is considered a highly potent corticosteroid while loteprednol is considered a weak corticosteroid. Second is differences in formulation. Solutions typically clear from the ocular surface within 15 minutes and suspensions within 2 hours. In contrast, the intracanalicular insert provides constant tapered delivery of dexamethasone over its ~30-day dosing period. Consequently, the bioavailability of drug at the ocular surface is likely greater with the dexamethasone insert compared to the loteprednol solution. Regarding the strong preference expressed by patients for the dexamethasone insert over topical loteprednol, part may be explained by the superior efficacy of the insert over topical drops in relieving the signs and symptoms of ocular allergy, while part may be related to the freedom from self-administration of topical drops 2 times daily for 30 days (60 instillations).

In contrast, there was no significant difference in improvement of most signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis, nor a strong preference by patients, between the dexamethasone insert and the topical antihistamine/mast cell stabilizer olopatadine (OLO). Changes in ocular itching, eyelid swelling, and tearing/watering were similar between treatment groups, while there was a significant difference favoring the dexamethasone insert in ocular hyperemia. This may be explained in part by differences in mechanism of action of these two drugs. Antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers directly target the specific form of inflammation underlying allergic conjunctivitis, while corticosteroids have a broader and nonspecific action on histamine-mediated inflammation. In addition, OLO is used once daily with a reduced drop burden. Given the different mechanism of action, a further study to evaluate the use of both medications together may be useful.

### DEXTENZA versus topical steroid or antihistamine therapy for treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^113BiKth]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Qualifying subjects attended a treatment visit within 2 weeks; all assessments described above except ocular allergy testing were repeated. Also, the Eye Allergy Patient Impact Questionnaire (EAPIQ) was administered. This validated instrument assessed the severity of ocular allergy symptoms, treatment, impact of symptoms on daily activities and emotions, and satisfaction with therapy;, the latter section was not administered at the treatment visit. Following these assessments, subjects received the dexamethasone intracanalicular insert (the DEX group) in the self-reported most symptomatic eye and either the corticosteroid loteprednol 0.2% (Alrex, Alcon, the LOT group) 2 times daily or the antihistamine/mast cell stabilizer olopatadine (Pazeo, Alcon, the OLO group) once daily in the fellow eye for 30 days. The treatment assigned to the fellow eye was alternated between LOT and OLO 1:1. After insertion, DEX position was assessed by slit lamp examination. Adherence with topical therapy was assessed by the use of a patient dosing diary. Subjects were re-evaluated at days 3, 8, 15, and 30. BCVA, IOP, Slit lamp examination, patient grading of ocular and nasal symptoms, and TSS were assessed at every visit. Additionally at Day 30, the satisfaction section of the EAPIQ was administered using a 6-point Likert scale (very satisfied to very dissatisfied), as was treatment preference using a 5-point Likert scale (no preference, moderately or much preferred either treatment; "moderately" and "much" preferred were collapsed to "preferred" for analysis). Rescue therapy with topical steroids was available for uncontrolled symptoms.

### Management of severe allergic conjunctivitis with topical cyclosporin a 0.05% eyedrops [^113LuMZz]. Cornea (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the efficacy of topical cyclosporin A 0.05% in the management of severe allergic conjunctivitis.

Methods

Seven patients with severe allergic conjunctivitis who were not responding to topical steroids, antihistamines, and mast cell stabilizers were given topical cyclosporin A 0.05%. All patients had an active disease when they were included in the study. Signs and symptoms were recorded before and after treatment.

Results

Seven patients, 6 boys and 1 girl, 6–14 years old, 6 with vernal keratoconjunctivitis and 1 with atopic keratoconjunctivitis, were enrolled in the study. Treatment with topical cyclosporin A 0.05% decreased the severity of symptoms and clinical signs significantly after 6 months (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank test). In addition, the need for steroids was reduced or even stopped. The patients experienced no side effects during the follow-up periods (mean, 14.0 ± 2.1 months; range, 8–18 months).

Conclusions

Topical cyclosporin A is an effective treatment in the management of severe allergic conjunctivitis with a benefit as a steroid-sparing agent.

### Topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers for treating seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis [^115XUFL2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Seasonal/perennial allergic conjunctivitis is the most common allergic conjunctivitis, usually with acute manifestations when a person is exposed to allergens and with typical signs and symptoms including itching, redness, and tearing. The clinical signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis are mediated by the release of histamine by mast cells. Histamine antagonists (also called antihistamines) inhibit the action of histamine by blocking histamine H1 receptors, antagonising the vasoconstrictor, and to a lesser extent, the vasodilator effects of histamine. Mast cell stabilisers inhibit degranulation and consequently the release of histamine by interrupting the normal chain of intracellular signals. Topical treatments include eye drops with antihistamines, mast cell stabilisers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, combinations of the previous treatments, and corticosteroids. Standard treatment is based on topical antihistamines alone or topical mast cell stabilisers alone or a combination of treatments. There is clinical uncertainty about the relative efficacy and safety of topical treatment.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers, alone or in combination, for use in treating seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2014, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to July 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2014), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 17 July 2014. We also searched the reference lists of review articles and relevant trial reports for details of further relevant publications.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing topical antihistamine and mast cell stabilisers, alone or in combination, with placebo, no treatment or to any other antihistamine or mast cell stabiliser, or both, that examined people with seasonal or perennial allergic conjunctivitis, or both. The primary outcome was any participant-reported evaluation (by questionnaire) of severity of four main ocular symptoms: itching, irritation, watering eye (tearing), and photophobia (dislike of light), both separately and, if possible, by an overall symptom score. We considered any follow-up time between one week and one year.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Disagreements were resolved by discussion among review authors and the involvement of a third review author. We followed standard methodological approaches used by Cochrane.

Main Results

We identified 30 trials with a total of 4344 participants randomised, with 17 different drugs or treatment comparisons. The following antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers were evaluated in at least one RCT: nedocromil sodium or sodium cromoglycate, olopatadine, ketotifen, azelastine, emedastine, levocabastine (or levocabastine), mequitazine, bepotastine besilate, combination of antazoline and tetryzoline, combination of levocabastine and pemirolast potassium. The most common comparison was azelastine versus placebo (nine studies). We observed a large variability in reporting outcomes. The quality of the studies and reporting was variable, but overall the risk of bias was low. Trials evaluated only short-term effects, with a range of treatment of one to eight weeks. Meta-analysis was only possible in one comparison (olopatadine versus ketotifen). There was some evidence to support that topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers reduce symptoms and signs of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis when compared with placebo. There were no reported serious adverse events related to the use of topical antihistamine and mast cell stabilisers treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

It seems that all reported topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers reduce symptoms and signs of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis when compared with placebo in the short term. However, there is no long-term data on their efficacy. Direct comparisons of different antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers need to be interpreted with caution. Overall, topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers appear to be safe and well tolerated. We observed a large variability in outcomes reported. Poor quality of reporting challenged the synthesis of evidence.

### Efficacy and safety of ketotifen eye drops in the treatment of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis [^114NSrps]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Ketotifen blocks histamine H(1) receptors, stabilises mast cells, and prevents eosinophil accumulation. These multiple, pharmacological mechanisms provided the rationale for assessing the efficacy and safety of ketotifen 0.025% eye drops in subjects with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC) in an environmental setting.

Methods

This was a double masked, randomised, multicentre trial conducted in Australia. Subjects were randomly assigned to ketotifen fumarate 0.025% ophthalmic solution, placebo (as vehicle), or levocabastine hydrochloride 0.05% ophthalmic suspension, twice daily in each eye for a 4 week period. Subjects were assessed at follow up (days 5–8) and termination (days 25–31) visits. The primary efficacy variable was the responder rate, based on the subjects' assessment of global efficacy at the follow up visit.

Results

519 subjects were randomised to treatment. At the follow up visit, the responder rate, based on subjects' assessment of global efficacy, was significantly greater in the ketotifen group (49.5%) than in the placebo group (33.0%) for subjects with a positive diagnostic test for pollen allergy (p = 0.02). The investigators' assessment of responder rates also showed that ketotifen was superior to placebo (p = 0.001). Ketotifen produced a significantly better outcome than levocabastine (p < 0.05) for relief of signs and symptoms of SAC, at both the follow up and the termination visit. The type and frequency of adverse events were similar across treatment groups.

Conclusions

In an environmental setting, ketotifen fumarate 0.025% ophthalmic solution was well tolerated and effective in reducing the signs and symptoms of SAC, and in preventing their recurrence. Ketotifen consistently showed the best efficacy in comparison with both placebo and levocabastine. These results indicate that ketotifen eye drops are a valuable treatment option for this condition.

### Update and clinical utility of alcaftadine ophthalmic solution 0.25% in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^114peA54]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Early phase response

An allergic reaction will be initiated when previously sensitized eyes are re-exposed to the allergen. The allergens activate Th2-lymphocytes to secrete Th2-lymphocyte-derived cytokines. This binding of multivalent allergens to IgE molecules on FcεRI induces cross-linking of the IgE–FcεRI complex on the primed mast cells, which in turn activates the primed mast cell to undergo degranulation. Degranulation of the mast cells leads to three immunobiological responses that are characterized by the release of preformed mediators such as biogenic amines (eg, histamine) and neutral proteases (eg, tryptase), synthesis and release of lipid mediators (eg, prostaglandin), and production and release of cytokines (eg, IL-4). This is the activation phase of allergic response of allergic conjunctivitis. It is noteworthy that the early-phase response occurs within 3–5 minutes of allergen exposure, and it usually lasts for less than an hour.

Histamine binding to receptors on the ocular surface is associated with altered permeability of epithelium that disrupts the epithelial barrier function of the conjunctiva. It also stimulates epithelial cells of the conjunctiva to release adhesion molecules, chemokines, and proinflammatory cytokines. The interaction of histamine with histamine receptors expressed on immature DCs recruits and activates DCs to become mature antigen-presenting cells capable of activating naïve T lymphocytes to become activated CD4 T lymphocytes that subsequently differentiate into Th2-lymphocytes. Thus, Th2-lymphocytes along with mast cells are the major immune cells involved in allergic inflammatory response in allergic conjunctivitis. The binding of released histamine from degranulated mast cells to histamine receptors on vascular endothelial cells, neuronal fibers, goblet cells, immune cells, and conjunctival epithelium culminates in the clinical manifestation of allergic conjunctivitis (redness, itching, tearing, chemosis, and eyelid edema). Furthermore, the interaction of histamine with histamine receptors on conjunctival goblet cells and nerve fibers causes increased mucus secretion and itching in allergic conjunctivitis, respectively. Tryptase released following mast cell degranulation induces the proliferation of conjunctival fibroblasts, as well as potentiates the effect of histamine. It is of note that tryptase and histamine are considered biomarkers of allergen-induced IgE-mediated conjunctival allergic response.

### A comparison of the efficacy and tolerability of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% ophthalmic solution and cromolyn sodium 2% ophthalmic solution in seasonal allergic conjunctivitis [^116v2USV]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Treatments for allergic conjunctivitis have various mechanisms of action. Cromolyn sodium stabilizes conjunctival mast cells by preventing calcium influx across the cell membrane, whereas olopatadine hydrochloride is both an antihistamine and a mast cell stabilizer.

Objective

This study compared the efficacy and tolerability of olopatadine and cromolyn in controlling the ocular signs and symptoms of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis.

Methods

This was a multicenter, randomized, double-masked, parallel-group trial. One group instilled olopatadine 0.1% ophthalmic solution and placebo BID, and the other instilled cromolyn 2% ophthalmic solution QID, both for 6 weeks. The formulation of cromolyn used in this study is currently available only in Europe and Australia.

Results

The intent-to-treat efficacy and safety analyses included 185 patients, 91 in the olopatadine group and 94 in the cromolyn group. At 30 minutes after the first instillation, respective decreases of approximately 30% and approximately 20% were reported in self-rated ocular itching and redness with both treatments; by 4 hours, itching had decreased by approximately 38% in both groups. Differences between treatments were not statistically significant. At 4 hours, redness had decreased by approximately 38% and approximately 26% in the respective treatment groups. By day 42, both treatments had produced significant reductions from baseline in ocular signs and symptoms; however, the reductions in itching and redness were significantly greater with olopatadine compared with cromolyn (both variables, P < 0.05). The difference in physicians' impression of overall improvement on days 30 and 42 significantly favored olopatadine over cromolyn (both days, P < 0.05). Most patients (62.2%) had reacted positively to grass pollen at baseline. The regression slopes correlating itching and redness with pollen count were 5 times lower for olopatadine compared with cromolyn (P = 0.002 and P = 0.016, respectively), indicating that olopatadine's efficacy increased as the pollen count increased.

Conclusions

Six weeks' instillation of olopatadine 0.19% ophthalmic solution BID had a significantly greater effect on the ocular signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis compared with 6 weeks' instillation of cromolyn 2% ophthalmic solution QID. Both treatments were well tolerated by patients in all age groups; however, olopatadine appeared to have better local tolerability in children aged < 11 years.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^112Q6fN6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Chlamydia is the cause of 1.8–5.6% of all acute conjunctivitis cases. Chlamydial conjunctivitis primarily has a unilateral presentation with concurrent genital infectionand presents with conjunctival redness, lymphoid follicle formation, or mild purulent discharge. A distinctive sign of this infection in adults is bulbar conjunctival follicles, which are absent in neonates/infants. Chlamydial conjunctivitis is typically spread through sexual contact. Chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States, with 1,708,569 cases reported in 2017. From 2013 to 2017, the number of reported cases of chlamydia in the United States increased by 22%. In neonates, the eyes can be infected after vaginal delivery by infected mothers. Treatment includes oral azithromycin or oral doxycycline in adults, and erythromycin in neonates.

Allergic Conjunctivitis

Most cases of allergic conjunctivitis are attributable to seasonal allergies and present with bilateral symptoms. Mild to severe itching and redness are the key symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis, which can present with a watery or mucoid discharge. Treatment includes supportive measures (cold compress, artificial tears), topical or oral antihistamines, and mast cell inhibitors. A short course of topical corticosteroids can be used in select cases in which corneal involvement and herpetic infection have been ruled out; both conditions could worsen with steroid use.

Differential Diagnosis

To satisfy the American Academy of Ophthalmology Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines that treatment of conjunctivitis is directed at the root cause, physicians should manage patients by taking a systematic approach (Figure 2), considering the epidemiologic spectrum of infectious conjunctivitis, patient history, clinical exam, and — if needed — diagnostic tests.

### Pooled analysis of two studies evaluating efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis [^116NC5or]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

To ensure symptom relief over a longer duration, we assessed olopatadine administered once daily at a higher strength. This new formulation contains olopatadine HCl at a concentration of 0.77% (7.76 mg/mL), which is equivalent to 0.7% olopatadine as a free base. Olopatadine HCl 0.77% was developed with the rationale of expanding the benefits offered by olopatadine 0.2%, particularly superior and long-lasting relief over a period of 24 hours with once-daily dosing, while maintaining its safety and patient comfort.

Two phase 3 studies were conducted using the CAC model to assess the safety and efficacy of olopatadine HCl 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis.–The outcomes of these two studies supported the recent approval (January 30, 2015) of olopatadine HCl ophthalmic solution 0.77% (olopatadine HCl 0.77%) by the FDA for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. The results from these two CAC studies demonstrated superiority of olopatadine HCl 0.77% over vehicle at onset and 24 hours post-dosing and over olopatadine 0.2% at 24 hours post-dosing for the treatment of ocular itching in patients with allergic conjunctivitis.–In the current article, we report the pooled analysis of these two randomized phase 3 studies to evaluate the integrated efficacy and safety findings from a larger dataset.

### Time to onset and duration of action of the antihistamine bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solutions 1.0% and 1.5% in allergic conjunctivitis: a phase III, single-center, prospective, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, conjunctival allergen challenge assessment in adults and children [^1177EYTq]. Clinical Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Bepotastine besilate is a highly selective histamine H(1)-receptor antagonist with antihistaminic, mast cell stabilizing, and anti-inflammatory activity. Based on a history of clinical effectiveness and tolerability of oral bepotastine besilate in the treatment of allergic symptoms, bepotastine besilate is being tested as a potential ophthalmic medication for allergic conjunctivitis.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess the effects of bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution 1.0% and 1.5% for the treatment of ocular itching and conjunctival hyperemia in a conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) model in adults and children.

Methods

This Phase III, single-center, prospective, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, CAC clinical trial enrolled patients ≥ 10 years of age with a history of allergic conjunctivitis, skin-test reaction, and CAC response. Patients received bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution 1.0%, bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution 1.5%, or placebo, 1 drop on each eye on days 14 ± 3 and 28 ± 3. The primary efficacy end points, patient-assessed ocular itching (at 3, 5, and 7 minutes) and investigator-assessed conjunctival hyperemia (at 7, 15, and 20 minutes), were determined after CAC according to standardized 5-point scales (0 = none to 4 = severe). Clinical significance was defined in the protocol as ≥ 1.0-U between-group difference in mean ocular itching scores at the majority of time points at a study visit and also a ≥ 0.5-U difference at all time points. Tolerability of the test agent was assessed by visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, intraocular pressure, dilated funduscopy, and adverse events.

Results

A total of 107 patients (male, 54%; age range, 11–73 years; white race/ethnicity, 93%) received investigational product and comprised the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution 1.0%, 36 patients; bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution 1.5%, 35; and placebo, 36). All 107 patients received investigational product at visit 3A (day 0) and were included in the ITT population. Of the 107 patients who were enrolled, 103 completed the study without a protocol deviation or violation. The 1.0% and 1.5% solutions were associated with clinically and statistically significant reductions in mean ocular itching scores compared with placebo on the 15-minute onset-of-action and 8-hour duration-of-action CAC tests (reductions, 1.3–1.5 U and 1.0–1.7 U respectively; all, P < 0.001). Statistically significant reductions in conjunctival hyperemia were achieved with both bepotastine besilate concentrations. Overall, 13 patients experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event considered related to the study drug (bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution 1.0%, 6 patients; bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution 1.5%, 4; and placebo, 3).

Conclusions

In this CAC model of allergic conjunctivitis in adults and children, bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solutions 1.0% and 1.5% were associated with clinically and statistically significant reductions in ocular itching, but not conjunctival hyperemia, within 15 minutes that were maintained for at least 8 hours after administration. Both solutions were well tolerated. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00424398.

### Conjunctivitis: a systematic review of diagnosis and treatment [^115mqPVn]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Conjunctivitis is a common problem.

Objective

To examine the diagnosis, management, and treatment of conjunctivitis, including various antibiotics and alternatives to antibiotic use in infectious conjunctivitis and use of antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers in allergic conjunctivitis.

Evidence Review

A search of the literature published through March 2013, using PubMed, the ISI Web of Knowledge database, and the Cochrane Library was performed. Eligible articles were selected after review of titles, abstracts, and references.

Findings

Viral conjunctivitis is the most common overall cause of infectious conjunctivitis and usually does not require treatment; the signs and symptoms at presentation are variable. Bacterial conjunctivitis is the second most common cause of infectious conjunctivitis, with most uncomplicated cases resolving in 1 to 2 weeks. Mattering and adherence of the eyelids on waking, lack of itching, and absence of a history of conjunctivitis are the strongest factors associated with bacterial conjunctivitis. Topical antibiotics decrease the duration of bacterial conjunctivitis and allow earlier return to school or work. Conjunctivitis secondary to sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia and gonorrhea requires systemic treatment in addition to topical antibiotic therapy. Allergic conjunctivitis is encountered in up to 40% of the population, but only a small proportion of these individuals seek medical help; itching is the most consistent sign in allergic conjunctivitis, and treatment consists of topical antihistamines and mast cell inhibitors.

Conclusions and Relevance

The majority of cases in bacterial conjunctivitis are self-limiting and no treatment is necessary in uncomplicated cases. However, conjunctivitis caused by gonorrhea or chlamydia and conjunctivitis in contact lens wearers should be treated with antibiotics. Treatment for viral conjunctivitis is supportive. Treatment with antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers alleviates the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis.

### Conjunctivitis: diagnosis and management [^114ZswsT]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Conjunctivitis caused by viruses, bacteria, or allergies is one of the most common eye conditions in primary care. There is no single sign or symptom that accurately differentiates viral from bacterial conjunctivitis. A comprehensive history and physical examination can guide diagnosis. Viral and allergic conjunctivitis are more common in adults and typically present with watery discharge. Supportive care options for viral conjunctivitis include artificial tears, cold compresses, and antihistamine eye drops. Strict personal hygiene, including frequent handwashing, is essential to decrease the risk of transmission. Topical antihistamines with mast cell-stabilizing activity are the treatment of choice for allergic conjunctivitis. Bacterial conjunctivitis is more common in children and typically presents as mucopurulent discharge with the eyelids matted shut. Delayed antibiotic prescribing has been found to have similar symptom control as immediate prescribing. Ophthalmology referral is indicated for conjunctivitis in a neonate or patients with severe pain, decreased vision, recent ocular surgery, vesicular rash on the eyelids or nose, history of rheumatologic disease, or immunocompromised state.

### Evaluation of desloratadine on conjunctival allergen challenge-induced ocular symptoms [^113eu2Qv]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Allergic conjunctivitis (AC) is frequently associated with allergic rhinitis (AR) and affects up to 91% of patients with AR. Desloratadine, an orally administered, non-sedating second-generation antihistamine, has proven efficacy and safety in the control of nasal and non-nasal — including ocular — symptoms of AR. This randomized-controlled trial is the first to evaluate the effects of continuous oral desloratadine treatment on ocular symptoms after conjunctival allergen challenge.

Objective

To evaluate the impact of administering oral desloratadine 5 mg daily for 7 days on ocular symptoms in conjunctival allergen-challenged subjects.

Methods

In this crossover study, adults with a history of seasonal AC and a minimal threshold response to allergen challenge were randomized to receive desloratadine 5 mg daily (n = 20) or placebo (n = 21) for 7 days after which they underwent a second ocular allergen challenge. After a 2-week washout period, subjects crossed over to the other treatment. The primary efficacy parameter was the intra-subject difference from baseline at end-point in the post-challenge mean composite ocular redness score (the sum of redness scores in ciliary, conjunctival, or episcleral vessel beds). Secondary efficacy parameters included the intra-subject and inter-subject differences in individual symptom scores for ciliary, conjunctival, or episcleral redness; pruritus; chemosis; eyelid swelling; and tearing.

Results

The mean composite ocular redness score was reduced at 10, 15, and 20 min post-challenge with desloratadine treatment compared with placebo, though these differences were not statistically significant (P = NS). Desloratadine was significantly more effective than placebo in preventing post-challenge ocular pruritus (P < 0.001). Significant improvements post-challenge were also seen in ciliary and episcleral redness, chemosis, eyelid swelling, and tearing (P < 0.05 vs. placebo for all comparisons). Desloratadine was well tolerated.

Conclusion

Treatment with desloratadine 5 mg daily for 7 days reduced allergic ocular symptoms following allergen challenge.

### Safety of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis in adult and pediatric subjects [^116Fk3xp]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% provides an alternative to other ophthalmic solutions currently available for the indication of ocular itch associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Allergic conjunctivitis commonly results in divergent and patient-dependent symptoms; thus, the ideal therapeutic for one patient may not ease the symptoms of all patients, supporting the need for a broad anti-allergics market. Cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% comes with the added benefit of patient and physician familiarity, above and beyond its demonstrated efficacy and safety. The high comfort upon instillation, low incidence of AEs, minimal systemic exposure, and lack of clinically relevant changes in safety measures suggest that cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% will add to and improve the currently marketed therapeutics for allergic conjunctivitis.

### Changes in tear function and the ocular surface after topical olopatadine treatment for allergic conjunctivitis: an open-label study [^116mBaof]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% eye drops represent a new class of anti-allergic agent with combined antihistaminic and mast cell-stabilizing properties.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to describe alterations in tear function and the ocular surface in patients with allergic conjunctivitis and to analyze the effect of topical olopatadine treatment on corneal sensitivity, tear function, and impression cytology variables.

Methods

This was a single-center, 3-visit, prospective, open-label study conducted in patients with allergic conjunctivitis. Patients received 1 drop of topical olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% BID for 3 weeks. At each visit, patients and healthy control subjects underwent routine ophthalmic examinations and measurements of corneal sensitivity and tear function (Schirmer test of tear quantity, tear film break-up time [BUT], fluorescein staining of the cornea). All control subjects and a subgroup of patients also underwent conjunctival impression cytology for assessment of squamous metaplasia and goblet cell density. The outcomes of interest were changes in corneal sensitivity, tear function, and impression cytology variables after 3 weeks of treatment with olopatadine eye drops, both in patients with allergic conjunctivitis and between patients and controls.

Results

At enrollment, the study included 46 eyes of 23 patients (9 men, 14 women; age range, 20–42 years) with allergic conjunctivitis; results were calculated based on the 21 patients who completed the study. The control group consisted of 70 eyes of 35 healthy subjects (13 men, 22 women; age range, 22–39 years). Before treatment, 64.3% of the eyes of patients with allergic conjunctivitis had a fluorescein staining score of > 1 point, whereas after treatment, 14.3% had a score of > 1 point (P < 0.001). Patients' mean (± SD) corneal sensitivity improved to 55.0 ± 2.5 mm from the pretreatment value of 42.5 ± 2.5 mm (P < 0.001). Mean BUT values before and after treatment were 8.1 ± 3.5 and 14.0 ± 7.0 seconds, respectively (P < 0.001). Before treatment, patients' mean squamous metaplasia grade was 2.5 ± 0.5; at the end of treatment, it had decreased to 1.0 ± 0.5 (P < 0.001). The mean pretreatment goblet cell density of 545 ± 85 cells/mm2 improved to 1,090 ± 100 cells/mm2 after treatment (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

In the patient population studied, the disorder of tear function, squamous metaplasia, and loss of ocular surface goblet cells associated with allergic conjunctivitis improved with topical olopatadine treatment.

### Clinical practice of allergen immunotherapy for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma: an expert panel report [^114rmRjQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) reduces symptoms and medication use associated with allergic rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis and allergic asthma. Although several AIT guidelines exist, there remain unanswered questions about AIT that are relevant to everyday practice. Our objective was to prepare an evidence-based overview addressing the practical aspects of AIT in clinical practice based on published evidence and the experience of international experts in the field. Topics covered include interpretation and translation of clinical trial data into everyday clinical practice (eg, allergen doses and treatment duration), assessment of risk and treatment of local and systemic allergic reactions, recommendations for improvement of AIT guidelines, and identification of appropriate data for seeking regulatory approval, to name a few. Many informational gaps in AIT practice need further evaluation as products and practices evolve.

### Ocular allergy overview [^1142jSiT]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The prevalence of ocular allergy clearly is underappreciated and has been under diagnosed and undertreated. The ocular symptoms associated with the most common ocular allergy conditions, such as seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis, are twice as likely to affect the allergy sufferer rather than nasal symptoms alone. The differential diagnosis of conjunctivitis is quite broad, with the most common forms associated with allergies, infections, and hormones. There are common features and some discerning features that, with a good history and examination, may provide a more focused and appropriate management.

### Effect of alcaftadine 0.25% on ocular itch associated with seasonal or perennial allergic conjunctivitis: a pooled analysis of two multicenter randomized clinical trials [^115c59iJ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Limitations of this study are inherent in any pooled analysis, though the two studies had similar designs. In addition, there was no prespecified percentage of patients to be tested in either study with a specific type of allergen. Approximately two-thirds of patients in the alcaftadine and control groups were challenged with allergens categorized as seasonal allergens and the remaining patients were challenged with perennial allergens. While reduction of itching by alcaftadine was similar in subjects challenged with either seasonal or perennial allergens, the smaller sample size in the perennial allergen population likely accounted for the lack of statistical difference at the 7-minute time point in the percent of patients with zero itch analysis.

Overall, alcaftadine is well tolerated and is effective in reducing ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis in response to both seasonal and perennial allergens.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^1154By8B]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Atopic conjunctivitis management — Conservative strategies to reduce allergen exposure and improve hygiene and lubrication are combined with antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers; next-line therapies for moderate disease include topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus targeted at T-cell activity. Tacrolimus is available as a 0.03% and 0.1% topical ointment for dermatologic use in the United States and has been used off label for ophthalmic disease. In patients 2 years old or older, eyelid involvement can be treated with pimecrolimus cream 1% or topical tacrolimus; tacrolimus drops/ointment 0.03% is used for children 2 to 15 years, and either 0.03% or 0.1% is used for patients 16 years and older. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy of topical tacrolimus 0.1% applied conjunctivally in patients who failed therapy with topical corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and/or antiallergy medications. These agents may make patients more susceptible to herpes simplex keratitis. Systemic therapies are rarely warranted; options include montelukast, aspirin, and oral T‑cell inhibitors such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus, but "the efficacy of these systemic treatments are inconclusive as there are no randomized trials" (Insufficient, Discretionary). Tacrolimus or pimecrolimus are rarely associated with development of skin cancer or lymphoma. For all allergic conjunctivitis, which may require repeat short‑term topical corticosteroids, patients should be informed about potential complications of corticosteroid therapy, and general strategies to minimize corticosteroid use should be employed.

### Vernal keratoconjunctivitis [^1175xtke]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment

There is currently no defined gold-standard treatment algorithm for VKC, but there are many options available, and treatment should be tailored to the individual.

Whatever treatment regimen is prescribed, it should be initiated promptly and the patient should be monitored closely for the development of any corneal complications.

A Cochrane review by Mantelli et al included 27 randomized controlled trials encompassing 2,184 eyes in an effort to evaluate topical therapies for the treatment of VKC. They found that all common antiallergic eye drops are effective in reducing signs and symptoms of disease, and that some patients even respond to placebo. A critical initial component of all allergic disease involves avoidance of inciting factors. Patients should be encouraged to wash hands frequently and avoid touching or rubbing their eyes. Cold compresses and artificial tears may help to alleviate symptoms in mild cases or as adjunctive therapy to pharmacologic treatment. First-line pharmacologic therapy for VKC is topical treatment, and there is considerable therapeutic overlap with other forms of allergic conjunctivitis. Mast cell stabilizers are a mainstay for prophylaxis. In milder cases, antihistamines may be of benefit, but more severe cases may require corticosteroid treatment. Long-term steroid use is associated with many complications, so other immunomodulatory treatments have been studied extensively.

Mast cell stabilizers

Mast cell stabilizers are thought to prevent mast cell degranulation via inhibition of calcium channels, but their mechanism is not completely understood. There is increasing evidence that mast cell stabilizers act more broadly on inflammatory cell chemotaxis. Commonly used mast cell stabilizers include cromolyn sodium and lodoxamide, which are frequently used as first-line therapy. Lodoxamide has been shown to be superior to cromolyn sodium in relieving symptoms and clinical signs of VKC. The medications should be used 4–6 times daily and may take up to 2 weeks to show response in mild cases of VKC.

Antihistamines

Antihistamines are sometimes used in the treatment of VKC: they are most often used in alleviating the symptoms of mild disease, but they have limited utility in severe cases.

More recent medications that combine antihistamine properties with mast cell stabilization include ketotifen and olopatadine. Both have been shown to improve the signs and symptoms of VKC, and there is evidence that ketotifen may be more effective. Some antihistamines may have a drying effect, which could exacerbate symptoms.

### Phase 3 randomized double-masked study of efficacy and safety of once-daily 0.77% olopatadine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution in subjects with allergic conjunctivitis using the conjunctival allergen challenge model [^117WTZDv]. Cornea (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the efficacy and safety of a novel once-daily 0.77% olopatadine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution in subjects with allergic conjunctivitis (AC) using the conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) model.

Methods

In this 5-week, multicenter, double-masked, phase 3, randomized trial, subjects aged ≥ 18 years with a history of AC and a confirmed positive bilateral CAC response were randomized 2:2:2:1 to receive olopatadine 0.77%, olopatadine 0.2%, olopatadine 0.1%, or vehicle, respectively, following a single topical dose in each eye. The primary objective was superiority of olopatadine 0.77% over all comparators on ocular itching according to a 0 to 4 scale (0 = none and 4 = incapacitating itch) at 24-hour duration of action and over vehicle only at the onset of action (3, 5, and 7 minutes after CAC for both).

Results

In total, 345 subjects were randomized. Olopatadine 0.77% was superior to the vehicle at alleviating ocular itching at all post-CAC time points at the onset of action and at 24 hours (difference in means: -0.9 to -1.5; P < 0.0001). Superiority in relieving ocular itching was also demonstrated for olopatadine 0.77% versus olopatadine 0.2% and 0.1% at 24 hours (difference in means: -0.3 to -0.5; P < 0.05). Additionally, olopatadine 0.77% significantly improved conjunctival redness and total redness compared with all comparators at the onset of action (differences in means: -0.3 to -0.6 and -0.8 to -2.0, respectively; both P < 0.05). No safety concerns for olopatadine 0.77% were identified.

Conclusions

Olopatadine 0.77% demonstrated a rapid onset and prolonged duration of action. It was superior to all comparators in alleviating AC-associated ocular itching with a favorable safety profile. Clinical Trial Registration-URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT01743027.

### Update and clinical utility of alcaftadine ophthalmic solution 0.25% in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^115M9FTR]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Allergic disorders of the ocular surface are primarily characterized as IgE-medicated and/or T-lymphocyte-mediated disorders that affect the ocular surface, including the cornea, conjunctiva, and eyelid. Ocular allergies are usually categorized into acute or chronic allergic disorders based on their pathological mechanism and clinical expression of the allergic response on the ocular surface. The acute form includes seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC) and perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC). Chronic forms are vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and atopic keratoconjunctivitis.

Allergic conjunctivitis is the most prevalent form of ocular allergy. It is predominantly an IgE-mediated ocular allergy that occurs when airborne allergens induce allergic expression on the ocular surface.SAC is a seasonal variant of allergic conjunctivitis due to outdoor aeroallergens, whereas PAC is the perennial variant of allergic conjunctivitis due to indoor airborne allergens. Pollen is the major aeroallergen that is associated with SAC with increased incidence of SAC from tree pollen and grass pollen in the spring and summer months, respectively. Dust mites, pet dander, feathers, and mold are aeroallergens associated with PAC. Patients with allergic conjunctivitis may complain of ocular pruritus and redness following exposure to outdoor and indoor aeroallergens. Approximately 40% of individuals in the developed countries have allergic conjunctivitis. In the United States, allergic conjunctivitis is the most common form of ocular allergy that constitutes over 90% of all ocular allergies. Allergic conjunctivitis affects the ocular surface impacting the quality of life of patients. It affects the school performance of symptomatic students and work productivity through lost workman days.

The treatment and management goals of allergic conjunctivitis are to prevent or minimize the inflammatory cascade associated with allergic response in the early stages of the pathological mechanism. The magnitude of the allergic expression is dependent on the allergen load, allergic mediators expressed by immune and nonimmune cells, and other physiological factors. Histamine, leukotrienes, cytokines, chemokines, prostaglandins, and proteases are produced by activated mast cells in allergen-induced conjunctival inflammation in SAC and PAC. This article reviews the chemical compound, including pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical trials, clinical efficacy, and safety, of alcaftadine. The pathological mechanism of ocular allergy, histamine, and histamine receptors will be briefly reviewed with the intent of providing a background for the detailed discussion on the clinical utility of alcaftadine.

### Comparison of the efficacy of combined fluticasone propionate and olopatadine versus combined fluticasone propionate and fexofenadine for the treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis induced by conjunctival allergen challenge [^1131dyta]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

One approach to treating allergic rhinoconjunctivitis is the concomitant use of an intranasal spray such as fluticasone propionate to alleviate nasal symptoms and a topical or systemic agent to relieve ocular symptoms. It has not yet been determined whether a topical or systemic agent is more effective for the latter purpose.

Objective

This study compared the efficacy of combined use of fluticasone and olopatadine with combined use of fluticasone and fexofenadine in the treatment of the signs and symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis.

Methods

This 2-site, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study employed the conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) model, a standardized method of inducing ocular and nasal signs and symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. At visit 1, subjects underwent CAC to determine the dose of allergen required to elicit a positive reaction. The allergen dose was confirmed at visit 2, and, according to a randomization schedule, subjects were dispensed fluticasone, olopatadine, and placebo pill; fluticasone, fexofenadine, and tear substitute; or placebo nasal spray, placebo pill, and tear substitute. CAC took place at visit 3, after patients had used the assigned medications for 2 weeks. Study medication was instilled 2 hours before CAC, after which allergic signs and symptoms were graded on standardized scales. The primary efficacy variables were ocular itching, ocular redness, and overall nasal symptoms.

Results

Eighty subjects completed the study: 30 received fluticasone and olopatadine, 30 fluticasone and fexofenadine, and 20 placebo. Women constituted 63.8% of the study population and men 36.3%; 91.3% were white, 3.8% black, 2.5% Hispanic, 1.3% Asian, and 1.3% other. Concomitant use of fluticasone and olopatadine produced significantly greater improvements in ocular itching at 3 and 7 minutes after CAC compared with fluticasone and fexofenadine (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in redness scores between groups; however, concomitant use of fluticasone and olopatadine produced significantly greater improvements in redness at 2 time points in each of the 3 vessel beds (ciliary, conjunctival, and episcleral) compared with placebo, and fluticasone and fexofenadine produced significantly greater improvement in redness at 1 time point in I vessel bed compared with placebo (both comparisons, P < 0.05). The 2 treatments had similar effects on total nasal symptom efficacy scores.

Conclusions

In this study, concomitant use of the topical agents fluticasone and olopatadine was more effective than concomitant use of fluticasone plus fexofenadine for overall treatment of the signs and symptoms of induced allergic rhinoconjunctivitis.

### Conjunctivitis in dupilumab clinical trials for adolescents with atopic dermatitis or asthma [^114p776G]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Several types of topical treatment for conjunctivitis were used in these studies, including anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-infective therapies, combination therapies, decongestants, anti-allergic agents (e.g. mast cell inhibitors/stabilizers, antihistamines), sodium chloride, and artificial tears. Regardless of the type of treatment that was used, most cases recovered during the study treatment period in the asthma trial as well as in the AD trials. A number of treatment protocols for conjunctivitis in dupilumab-treated patients with AD have been proposed in the literature, including warm compresses, artificial tears, eyedrops or ointments with antihistamines, anti-inflammatories, corticosteroid drops and ointments, anti-infective therapies, calcineurin inhibitors, topical cyclosporine A, and combination treatments; it should be noted that topical corticosteroid eye treatments increase the risk of eye infection, and longer-term use increases the risk of cataracts and glaucoma. In addition, some prescribers have used prophylactic tears on starting dupilumab therapy, to address potential issues of eye dryness. Currently, there is no consensus on an optimal approach to prevent and manage conjunctivitis in dupilumab-treated patients, and further studies are needed to evaluate the various treatments that are currently being used.

### H1-antihistamines: more relevant than ever in the treatment of allergic disorders [^112uY3tr]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Histamine is an important chemical mediator of inflammation, vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, decreased peripheral resistance, airway smooth muscle contraction, and sensory nerve stimulation causing itching. It also plays a significant role in neurotransmission and in cardiac function. In allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and urticaria, there is strong evidence for the role of H(1)-antihistamine treatment. In asthma, additional dose-response studies, including higher doses of antihistamines than those used in allergic rhinitis, are needed to determine the role of antihistamines. In atopic dermatitis, the itch-relieving topical glucocorticoid-sparing effects of H(1)-antihistamines also require further documentation. The potential benefits of each H(1)-antihistamine should be weighed against the potential risks, and second-generation H(1)-antihistamines with excellent, well-documented safety records should be used in preference to older, less safe H(1)-antihistamines. Second-generation H(1)-antihistamines are more relevant than ever in the treatment of allergic disorders.

### Topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers for treating allergic… [^115sBUtv]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Are topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers, used alone or in combination, effective and safe in treating patients with seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis. Evidence-Based Answer Topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers, either alone or in combination, are safe and effective for reducing the symptoms of seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis. There is insufficient evidence to compare the effectiveness of specific topical medications. No serious adverse effects are associated with these medications. Practice Pointers Patients with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis and perennial allergic conjunctivitis often report itching, tearing, swollen eyelids, and redness mediated by the release of histamine from mast cells, resulting in conjunctival inflammation. 1, 2 Itching is the most common symptom, occurring in more than 75% of patients.

The authors of this Cochrane review evaluated the effectiveness of topical mast cell stabilizers and antihistamines for this common condition. This review included 30 randomized controlled trials with 4, 344 participants four to 85 years of age who had seasonal or perennial allergic conjunctivitis. Studies of patients with vernal keratoconjunctivitis, atopic keratoconjunctivitis, or giant papillary conjunctivitis were excluded, as were studies that analyzed oral or nasal antihistamines. Within the 30 trials, 17 different drug or treatment comparisons were conducted in North and South America, Asia, Europe, Africa, and Australia; the duration of the studies ranged from one to eight weeks. The primary outcomes were participant reports of photophobia and ocular itching, irritation, and watering. Secondary outcomes included adverse effects; the duration of acute symptoms; the incidence of acute episodes per year; and signs of hyperemia, chemosis, or tarsal papillae on examination.

The risk of bias was judged to be low. Overall, the results favor topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers, alone or in combination, vs. placebo for short-term relief of the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. Eight studies comparing the mast cell stabilizers nedocromil or cromolyn sodium vs. placebo favored the mast cell stabilizers. Trials comparing the antihistamines azelastine and levocabastine vs. placebo all favored the antihistamines.

### Pooled analysis of two studies evaluating efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis [^115LQAtj]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This pooled analysis reinforces the findings from the two individual CAC studies demonstrating superiority of olopatadine HCl 0.77% over vehicle and olopatadine 0.2% for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. Olopatadine HCl 0.77% provided superior and longer duration of relief from itching that persisted over a period of 24 hours. No safety concerns were identified with once-daily olopatadine HCl 0.77%. The safety profile of olopatadine HCl 0.77% was comparable to that of olopatadine 0.2%. The rapid onset and prolonged duration of action (at least 24 hours) of olopatadine HCl 0.77% further support its once-daily dosing in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.

### Update and clinical utility of alcaftadine ophthalmic solution 0.25% in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^117P2bzk]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Conjunctiva

The conjunctivae are highly vascularized and immunologically active semitransparent mucous membranes that line the globe. The conjunctiva consists of two layers – epithelium and the substantia propria (conjunctival stroma). The conjunctival epithelium is a nonkeratinized mucosal tissue with mucin-secreting goblet cells and intraepithelial leukocytes. The substantia propria is composed of vascular connective tissue with lymphatics, immune cells, and nonimmune cells. The normal conjunctiva has neutrophils and intraepithelial lymphocytes in the epithelium and the substantia propria. However, macrophages and mast cells are present in the substantia propria but absent in the normal conjunctival epithelium. Eosinophils are not normally found in either the epithelium or the substantia propria.–The conjunctiva has an abundance of Langerhans' cells that initiate allergen-induced immune response when these antigen-presenting cells encounter an allergen on the conjunctiva. The immune cells, such as lymphocytes, distributed over the conjunctiva form a mucosal immune system known as the conjunctiva-associated lymphoid tissue.–Conjunctiva- associated lymphoid tissue is a component of the eye-associated lymphoid tissue. It is of note that eye-associated lymphoid tissue consists of organized lymphoid tissue made up of predominantly lymphocytes. In normal conjunctiva, the mast cells are concentrated in the substantia propria. Immunohistochemical staining is the basis for characterizing the human mast cell as either tryptase containing (mucosal mast cell) or tryptase/chymase containing (connective type mast cell). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern-recognition receptors of the innate immune system that recognize exogenous and endogenous molecules.TLRs are expressed on both nonimmune (epithelial, endothelial cells, fibroblasts) and immune cells (macrophages, dendritic cells [DCs], lymphocytes, mast cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils).TLRs are known to play a role in initiating a signaling cascade that culminate in the generation of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. Therefore, TLRs play a vital role in the ocular surface immune response, and the expression of TLRs in the conjunctival epithelium is increased during ocular allergic conditions. Additionally, the conjunctiva expresses transient receptor potential (TRP) channels that play a role in the pathophysiology of many diseases, including immune-mediated diseases.TRPV1 is a TRP channel expressed on definitive sensory nerves, epithelial cells, and mast cells, and activation of TRPV1 is associated with histamine-induced pruritus. The healthy conjunctiva has intercellular tight junction proteins that help maintain the barrier function of the conjunctival epithelium, a barrier that is impermeable to allergens. The occludin and claudin transmembrane protein complexes are major constituents of tight junction proteins that play a role in maintaining the stability and adhesion of epithelial cells on the ocular surface. Thus, changes to the epithelial barrier function are likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of allergic conjunctivis.

### Antihistamines used in addition to topical nasal steroids for intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis in children [^112moKJG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Allergic rhinitis is a very common chronic illness affecting 10% to 40% of children worldwide and its prevalence among children has significantly increased over the last two decades. Prevalence and severity are related to age, with children of school age most commonly affected.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and adverse event profile of antihistamines (oral or topical) used as an adjunct to topical nasal steroids for intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis in children.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; mRCT and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 21 September 2009.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children under the age of 18 with a history of allergic rhinitis, with or without allergic conjunctivitis or asthma, comparing topical nasal steroids with antihistamines to topical nasal steroids only.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias.

Main Results

One study including 24 participants met the inclusion criteria for this review. This study compared the administration of topical nasal steroids with oral antihistamines to topical nasal steroids only in children, but it did not provide sufficient data to address the clinical question of this review.

Authors' Conclusions

In view of the lack of evidence for the benefit or lack of benefit of antihistamine add-on therapy with topical nasal steroids for children with intermittent or persistent allergic rhinitis, it is important that clinicians are mindful of the adverse effects of antihistamines and the additional costs that may be incurred.

### Efficacy and toxicity evaluation of bepotastine besilate 1.5% preservative-free eye drops Vs olopatadine hydrochloride 0.2% bak-preserved eye drops in patients with allergic conjunctivitis [^112cXZUB]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Allergic conjunctivitis (AC) is the most common allergic ocular disorder, affecting approximately 20% of the global population. The prevalence of AC is region-dependent, and appears to be increasing worldwide. This pathology is associated with seasonal pollen sensitivity, although perennial forms are associated with exposure to animal dander, mites, and molds. AC is a type-1, IgE-mediated hypersensitivity immune reaction that occurs in individuals previously exposed to a specific allergen. The immune response involves the release of inflammatory mediators, including histamine, leukotrienes, bradykinin, prostaglandins, proteases, and cytokines, which contribute to the development of signs and symptoms. Histamines from degranulated mast cells are the principal immune mediators related to early allergic responses. This molecule binds to receptors (H1, H2, H3, and H4) on vascular endothelial cells, neuronal fibers, goblet cells, immune cells, and conjunctival epithelium culminating in clinical manifestations of allergic conjunctivitis including redness, periocular swelling, chemosis, itching, and tearing. This is followed by a late phase that is manifested by pro-inflammatory mediators and the recruitment of immune cells including eosinophils and neutrophils.

The keystone of the treatments is histamine antagonists (also called antihistamines), which inhibit the action of histamine by blocking histamine receptors and, consequently, inhibiting clinical manifestations related to this mediator. Mast cell stabilizers inhibit mast cell degranulation and, consequently, the release of histamine by interrupting the normal chain of intracellular signals. The first line of treatment for this condition includes antihistamines that combine both mechanisms of action: dual-action antihistamines, which present an increased safety and efficacy profile compared with older topical agents used in the treatment of AC.

Bepotastine besilate is the latest-generation ophthalmic antihistamine with multiple mechanisms of action in both preclinical and clinical studies. This drug is a highly selective H1 receptor antagonist with potent mast cell-stabilizing action. Bepotastine besilate exerts its anti-inflammatory action through the inhibition of leukotriene B4and the reduction and activation of eosinophil chemotaxis. It also inhibits the biosynthesis of proinflammatory IL-5 in vitro. The clinical efficacy and safety of bepotastine besilate twice a day (BID) have been demonstrated in several clinical studies. Recent studies suggest that the effect of bepotastine besilate 1.5% was maintained for up to 16 hr, so a posology of once a day in the morning can be proposed.

### Current dilemmas and controversies in allergic contact dermatitis to ophthalmic medications [^112djbPH]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Identifying contact allergens in ophthalmic medications can be a challenging and daunting experience. We summarize data on topical ophthalmic medications with the potential to cause periorbital contact dermatitis and allergic conjunctivitis, highlighting current dilemmas and controversies in this area. The following groups of allergens are reviewed: preservatives, antiglaucoma medications (prostaglandin analogues, β-blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, parasympathomimetics, sympathomimetics), antiinflammatory medications (nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, corticosteroids), antibiotics, antivirals, antiallergic medications (antihistamines, cromones), anaesthetics, mydriatics, and cycloplegics.

### Selecting a topical treatment for seasonal allergic… [^1136SAsz]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Approximately one fifth of the population in the United Kingdom suffers from seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. Symptoms of ocular irritation, redness, and tearing typically occur during pollen-producing seasons. As the underlying mechanism of this condition is believed to be a type 1, IgE-mediated hypersensitivity, topical mast cell stabilizers and antihistamines are used to control symptoms. Systemic antihistamines may be prescribed for patients with more widespread symptoms, and steroids are used occasionally in severe cases. Owen and colleagues conducted a systematic review to determine the relative effectiveness of topical mast cell stabilizers and antihistamines in symptomatic therapy for seasonal allergic conjunctivitis.

Electronic databases, including the Cochrane Library, and bibliographies of relevant articles were used to identify clinical trials comparing topical mast cell stabilizers or antihistamines with placebo, and these two classes of agents with one another. Of the 140 original studies identified, 40 met quality criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Placebo-controlled trials of the mast cell stabilizers sodium cromoglycate, nedocromil, and lodoxamide were identified. The 17 studies of sodium cromoglycate tended to involve small numbers of patients, differed in outcome measures, and showed evidence of publication bias. Nevertheless, the authors calculate a significant difference in perceived benefit over placebo with no important side effects. Patients also perceived significant improvement in symptoms in three of the five trials of topical nedocromil. The authors calculate that patients treated with this drug were 1.

8 times more likely to report moderate or complete control of symptoms than patients given the placebo. A significant benefit also was reported for topical lodoxamide compared with placebo, but this was based on one small study. In the pooled analysis of the 12 topical mast cell stabilizer studies, patients were 4. 9 times more likely to report symptom relief compared with placebo. Eight trials compared the effectiveness of topical mast cell stabilizers with topical antihistamine. A formal meta-analysis was not possible because of differences in the reporting of outcomes. The topical antihistamine appeared to reduce symptoms better than mast cell stabilizers in short-term provocation studies and showed limited evidence of a faster onset of action. Otherwise, no significant differences were apparent between the classes of medication.

The authors conclude that topical mast cell stabilizers and antihistamines provide significantly better symptom relief than placebo in allergic conjunctivitis. Based on available evidence, the choice of a specific agent should be determined by factors such as convenience of use, cost, and patient preferences.

### Cornea / external disease summary benchmarks – 2024 [^115scch9]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis — care management outlines symptomatic care for viral disease, targeted therapy for allergic and vernal forms, measures for contact lens–related keratoconjunctivitis, and management when sexually transmitted pathogens are involved. The majority of cases in the adult population are viral and self-limited, and do not require antimicrobial treatment; there is no proven effective treatment for eradication of adenoviral infection, artificial tears, topical antihistamines, topical corticosteroids, oral analgesics or cold compresses may mitigate symptoms, and the use of antibiotics should be avoided because of potential adverse treatment effects. Allergen-specific immunotherapy is beneficial in reducing allergic conjunctivitis, more so in children than in adults. Treat mild allergic conjunctivitis with an over-the-counter antihistamine/vasoconstrictor agent or second-generation topical histamine H1-receptor antagonists; if the condition is frequently recurrent or persistent, mast-cell stabilizers can be used, and new medications combine antihistamine activity with mast-cell stabilizing properties. Treatment for vernal conjunctivitis includes modifying the environment and use of cold compresses and ocular lubricants, and for acute exacerbations, topical corticosteroids are usually needed to control severe symptoms (I+, MQ, SR). For contact lens-related keratoconjunctivitis, discontinue contact lens wear until the cornea returns to normal, and in mild cases a brief course of topical corticosteroids, in addition to longer-term use of topical cyclosporine, can be considered. Use systemic antibiotic treatment for conjunctivitis due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis, treat sexual partners when conjunctivitis is associated with sexually transmitted diseases and refer patients and their sexual partners to an appropriate medical specialist, and refer patients with manifestation of a systemic disease to an appropriate medical specialist.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^112jkK3C]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Implementation guidance

Clinician's Summary:

The evidence that the Expert Panel reviewed did not support the use of SLIT specifically for the treatment of allergic asthma. However, the FDA has approved SLIT tablets (but not aqueous preparations) for the treatment of allergic rhino conjunctivitis. Individuals with this condition who also have asthma might benefit from SLIT and, if so, this benefit is most likely to be in the form of a reduction in the use of quick-relief and/or long-term control medications.

On the basis of the currently available data, the Expert Panel does not recommend SLIT for allergic asthma. SLIT is beneficial for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. In an individual with comorbid allergic asthma, SLIT for allergic rhino conjunctivitis might reduce the symptoms of allergic asthma as well (and this potential provides the rationale for making the recommendation conditional). For individuals whose allergic asthma symptoms benefit from SLIT for allergic rhino conjunctivitis, the Expert Panel offers the following suggestions.

The clinician should administer the first dose of SLIT in the office, and the individual with asthma should wait in the office for at least 30 minutes after receiving the dose. If no problems develop, the individual may continue the SLIT dosing at home. Individuals receiving SLIT should ideally have an injectable epinephrine prescription and receive education on how to administer this medication.
Currently, only tablet SLIT formulations for short ragweed and dust mite mixture and for northern grass have FDA approval for treatment of allergic rhinitis with and without conjunctivitis. SLIT is not FDA approved specifically for asthma treatment.
What clinicians should discuss with their patients: The Expert Panel does not recommend SLIT for the treatment of allergic asthma, but this treatment may benefit individuals with certain comorbid conditions, such as allergic rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis. The FDA has approved the use of SLIT to treat allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis in response to only a few allergens at this time for individuals aged 5 years and older (for sensitization to northern grass) and in individuals aged 18 years and older (for sensitization to a short ragweed and dust mite mixture).

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^1177Mb4o]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis — if symptoms are not adequately controlled, a brief course (1 to 2 weeks) of topical corticosteroids with a low side effect profile can be added to the regimen. Oral antihistamines are commonly used but may induce or worsen dry eye syndrome and impair the tear film's protective barrier. Concomitant use of cooled preservative-free artificial tears may alleviate coexisting tear deficiency and dilute allergens and inflammatory mediators on the ocular surface. In severe cases, topical cyclosporine or tacrolimus can be considered.

### Comparison of ketotifen fumarate ophthalmic solution alone, desloratadine alone, and their combination for inhibition of the signs and symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in the conjunctival allergen challenge model: a double-masked, placebo-and active-controlled trial [^1176GL5E]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Ketotifen fumarate is a topical antiallergic combination mast-cell stabilizer and antihistamine indicated for the temporary prevention of ocular itching due to allergic conjunctivitis. Desloratadine is a systemic antihistamine indicated for the treatment of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of ketotifen 0.025% ophthalmic solution instilled in the eye, desloratadine 5-mg tablets taken orally, and their combination for prevention of the signs and symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, as induced by the conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) model.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-masked, placebo- and active-controlled, single-center clinical trial. At visit l, the dose of allergen necessary to elicit a qualifying allergic reaction was determined for subjects meeting the entry criteria. At visit 2, the allergen dose determined at visit 1 was confirmed, and all subjects who had a qualifying ocular and nasal allergic reaction were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups: ketotifen ophthalmic solution and placebo tablet, desloratadine tablet and placebo eyedrop, or ketotifen and desloratadine. Subjects were instructed to instill 1 drop into each eye twice daily and take 1 tablet with water once daily at the same time as the morning eyedrop for approximately 4 weeks. At visit 3, subjects brought in their medication and were given 1 drop of the eyedrop bilaterally and 1 tablet with water. Bilateral CAC was performed 2 hours after administration of medication. Using standardized scales, subjects rated ocular itching at 3, 5, and 7 minutes after CAC; ocular tearing and eyelid swelling at 10, 15, and 20 minutes after CAC; and nasal signs and symptoms (sneezing, rhinorrhea and postnasal drip, pruritus, and nasal congestion) at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 minutes after CAC. The investigator graded ocular redness and chemosis at 10, 15, and 20 minutes after CAC. At all visits, subjects were offered an anti-allergy eyedrop to relieve any immediate ocular discomfort caused by CAC.

Results

One hundred two subjects were screened-82 (55 women, 27 men; mean age, 42.8 years [range, 21–70 years]) were randomized to treatment, and 80 completed the study. Subjects in the group that received ketotifen (n = 27) and the group that received ketotifen with desloratadine (n = 26) had significantly lower mean itching scores compared with those in the group that received desloratadine alone (n = 27) at all time points (P ≤ 0.05). Total ocular redness, calculated by summing the mean redness scores for each of the 3 vessel beds, was significantly lower in the ketotifen group than in the other treatment groups at most time points (P ≤ 0.05). All treatments attenuated nasal symptoms; no statistically significant differences were noted between treatment groups, with the exception of the 50-minute time point, at which combination treatment was significantly more effective than ketotifen alone (P ≤ 0.05). The proportion of subjects who requested relief drops after CAC was significantly lower in both the ketotifen alone and combination treatment groups compared with the desloratadine alone group (P = 0.004).

Conclusions

Ketotifen ophthalmic solution significantly decreased the signs and symptoms of ocular and nasal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. The addition of ketotifen to the oral desloratadine regimen improved the overall antiallergic efficacy of both medications.
