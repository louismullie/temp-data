## Question

Can oseltamivir be used to treat giardiasis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether oseltamivir can be used to treat giardiasis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about oseltamivir's approved indications, mechanism of action, and dosing. Then, I should verify the etiology and standard treatments for giardiasis. Next, I will check for any evidence linking oseltamivir to giardiasis treatment. After that, I need to analyze mechanistic compatibility or incompatibility. Finally, I will consider safety and off-label issues and conclude with appropriate, guideline-concordant therapy recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the basics on oseltamivir. Oseltamivir phosphate is an oral neuraminidase inhibitor approved for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A and B, with adult treatment dosing of 75 mg twice daily for 5 days and prophylaxis dosing of 75 mg once daily, typically begun within 48 hours of exposure, and with renal dose adjustments specified for decreased creatinine clearance and dialysis scenarios, all of which anchor its role as an anti-influenza agent rather than an antiparasitic therapy [^1177DJoR] [^113J4Whv] [^1173eiNS] [^115dn77P] [^1142HdTc] [^114jWuKe] [^111YsAXg]. Wait, let me verify the mechanism and disposition as well: oseltamivir is a prodrug rapidly converted to the active oseltamivir carboxylate, which inhibits influenza viral neuraminidase and is eliminated unchanged in urine, reinforcing a virology-specific target and pharmacology profile [^112b5BZC].

> Next, I should review giardiasis. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — giardiasis is not a viral disease; it is a protozoan parasitic infection caused by Giardia intestinalis/lamblia that colonizes the small intestine and can cause diarrhea, malabsorption, weight loss, and chronic gastrointestinal sequelae, which immediately suggests an antiprotozoal, not antiviral, treatment paradigm [^111AXPMa] [^1122AKDH]. I need to check first-line regimens: standard therapies include 5-nitroimidazoles such as metronidazole and tinidazole, with tinidazole 2 g as a single dose in adults, and nitazoxanide as an effective alternative, all of which are established antiprotozoals for Giardia [^111U41WR] [^112wFfu2] [^111Y2jD3].

> I will now examine whether oseltamivir has any documented role in giardiasis. Let me verify across the influenza and Giardia literature provided: oseltamivir trials and reviews focus exclusively on influenza outcomes and do not mention Giardia, and conversely, giardiasis guidance and treatment studies do not reference oseltamivir at all, which argues against any clinical precedent or evidence for its use in this protozoan infection [^116AnA7U] [^111AXPMa] [^1177DJoR] [^111AXPMa] [^114iE1HY]. Hold on, I should double-check that no mechanistic rationale is proposed — nothing in these documents suggests antigiardial activity for neuraminidase inhibition.

> Now, mechanistic compatibility matters. Let me think about the target: oseltamivir inhibits influenza neuraminidase, an enzyme on influenza virions that facilitates viral release, a target absent from Giardia's eukaryotic protozoan biology, which instead involves trophozoite attachment, encystation, antigenic variation, and unique metabolic pathways, none of which are plausibly affected by neuraminidase inhibition, making activity against Giardia biologically implausible [^112b5BZC] [^111AVLK1]. Hmm, wait a minute — could I be missing a noncanonical effect of oseltamivir? I should confirm that no off-target antiparasitic effects are described; again, nothing in the pharmacologic or clinical corpus provided indicates such activity [^113nd9Kf].

> Even if someone attempted off-label use, I need to ensure the safety profile wouldn't worsen illness. Oseltamivir commonly causes gastrointestinal adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which could exacerbate giardiasis-related diarrhea and malabsorption; additional warnings include neuropsychiatric events and severe skin reactions, and the suspension contains sorbitol, which can cause dyspepsia and diarrhea, all of which weigh against off-label use in a diarrheal protozoan illness [^115h9Jv5] [^113oiYnR] [^116nUttK]. Hold on, I should verify if any benefit outweighs risk — no efficacy signal for Giardia exists to justify these risks [^111AXPMa].

> I should confirm dosing context next. All dosing frameworks for oseltamivir — whether by renal function, hepatic impairment, or dialysis — are tailored to influenza treatment or prophylaxis, with no guidance for protozoal infections, underscoring that there is no established therapeutic window or regimen for giardiasis and reinforcing that use would be empiric and unsupported [^1173eiNS] [^115dn77P] [^1142HdTc] [^111YsAXg] [^114BNNRY] [^115KxEaa] [^114CNsoh] [^114jWuKe].

> Let me now outline the evidence-based treatment approach for giardiasis. For uncomplicated disease, appropriate antiprotozoals include tinidazole 2 g once, metronidazole multi-day regimens, or nitazoxanide with FDA-labeled dosing for patients 12 years and older, with pediatric suspension-based dosing for younger children per product labeling; these choices are supported by randomized trials and systematic reviews [^112wFfu2] [^111U41WR] [^111Y2jD3] [^111AavFh] [^117K1i66]. Next, I should review management after nitroimidazole failure — refractory giardiasis is increasingly recognized, and quinacrine demonstrates high parasitological cure rates around 90–100% in cohorts of nitroimidazole-refractory cases, with combination regimens such as quinacrine plus metronidazole reported historically, although availability can be limited and data are largely observational [^113GRSJG] [^115hFTbw] [^114iE1HY] [^116ZbFxY] [^116oAuUY] [^113iHsW7] [^117WrcU8].

> But wait, what if treatment still fails — could host factors be contributory. I should confirm immune issues such as IgA deficiency, which is central in mucosal defense against Giardia, can correlate with persistent infection and treatment failures; identifying and addressing host factors may be essential, and after successful therapy, stool PCR typically turns negative within about a week, which can help verify eradication during follow-up [^1122AKDH] [^112pMzFU] [^117WrcU8] [^114VeyTA]. Hold on, I should verify that the care plan also emphasizes correct diagnosis — stool antigen, microscopy, or PCR per local resources, with attention to exposure risks and household transmission, is standard before labeling a case as refractory [^111AXPMa].

> Final assessment and recommendation: Oseltamivir cannot be used to treat giardiasis; there is no clinical evidence, no mechanistic plausibility, and no dosing guidance supporting such use, and its gastrointestinal adverse effects may worsen diarrheal illness in Giardia infection, so it should not be prescribed for this indication [^111AXPMa] [^116AnA7U] [^112b5BZC] [^115h9Jv5]. I should double-check that the standard of care is clear: use antiprotozoal therapy such as tinidazole, metronidazole, or nitazoxanide for initial treatment, and consider quinacrine-based regimens, often after expert consultation, for nitroimidazole-refractory cases, while evaluating for host factors like IgA deficiency and confirming microbiologic cure on follow-up testing [^112wFfu2] [^111Y2jD3] [^111U41WR] [^113GRSJG] [^115hFTbw] [^114iE1HY] [^1122AKDH]. Let me not forget to ensure we rule out and appropriately treat infectious diarrheas rather than masking them with symptomatic agents alone, aligning with general prescribing cautions for diarrheal conditions [^111M5PCt].

Oseltamivir is **not effective for giardiasis** because it targets influenza neuraminidase rather than protozoa. There is **no evidence** supporting its use against Giardia lamblia, and no guidelines recommend it [^111AXPMa] [^1177DJoR]. Standard treatments include metronidazole [^111U41WR], tinidazole [^112wFfu2], or nitazoxanide [^111Y2jD3], with quinacrine reserved for refractory cases [^113GRSJG] [^115hFTbw] [^114iE1HY]. Using oseltamivir for giardiasis is inappropriate and may delay effective treatment.

---

## Mechanism of action of oseltamivir

Oseltamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor that blocks viral neuraminidase, preventing the release of new influenza virions and limiting viral spread. It is specific to influenza A and B and **has no known activity against protozoa**, such as Giardia lamblia.

---

## Pharmacological considerations

Oseltamivir is rapidly converted to oseltamivir carboxylate, which is eliminated unchanged in the urine; less than 20% of the dose is excreted in feces [^112b5BZC]. This pharmacokinetic profile is **tailored to systemic antiviral activity**, not to luminal protozoal infections such as giardiasis [^1179dhkU].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding oseltamivir and giardiasis

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting oseltamivir for giardiasis; no studies or case reports document efficacy against Giardia lamblia, and no guidelines recommend its use for this indication [^111AXPMa] [^1177DJoR].

---

## Recommended treatments for giardiasis

The **standard treatments for giardiasis** include:

- **Metronidazole**: 250 mg orally three times daily for 5–10 days [^111U41WR].
- **Tinidazole**: 2 g orally as a single dose [^112wFfu2].
- **Nitazoxanide**: 500 mg orally twice daily for 3 days [^111Y2jD3] [^111AavFh].

In refractory cases, **quinacrine** is effective and well tolerated [^114iE1HY] [^113GRSJG] [^115hFTbw].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

Using oseltamivir for giardiasis may cause **unnecessary adverse effects**, including:

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea [^115h9Jv5].
- **Neuropsychiatric effects**: Abnormal behavior, agitation, confusion, delirium [^113oiYnR].
- **Severe cutaneous reactions**: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis [^116nUttK].

These risks are unjustified in light of the lack of efficacy against Giardia lamblia.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Oseltamivir is **not effective for giardiasis** and should not be used for this indication. Clinicians should use evidence-based antiprotozoal therapies and avoid oseltamivir to prevent treatment delays and unnecessary adverse effects [^111AXPMa].

### Quinacrine treatment of nitroimidazole-refractory giardiasis [^114iE1HY]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Limited evidence exists on the efficacy and tolerability of quinacrine for nitroimidazole-refractory giardiasis.

- **Methods**: Nitroimidazole-refractory giardiasis cases were defined as microbiologically confirmed treatment failure after two courses, through microscopy and/or PCR, during the period from 2008 to 2020. These cases were retrospectively identified.

- **Results**: Out of 87 patients, 54 (62%) had visited India. Quinacrine was used in 54 (62%) of these cases; 51 received monotherapy while 3 received it combined with metronidazole. Only 3 of the patients had positive stool samples with persisting symptoms after quinacrine treatment, resulting in a 94% parasitological efficacy. These patients were all cured following a second treatment. One patient (1.9%) recorded mild adverse effects.

- **Conclusions**: Quinacrine is an effective treatment for nitroimidazole-refractory giardiasis with good tolerability.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between Giardia lamblia and endemic pediatric diarrhea in developing countries [^117PQ2j9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The outcome variable was "acute diarrhea" in the majority of the studies, but a few included "persistent diarrhea" as well as "acute diarrhea"; some studies presented pooled results of acute and persistent diarrhea. In 14 studies, the length of the diarrheal episode was not specified or was not clearly defined. A few studies focused on persistent diarrhea as the outcome variable, defined as diarrhea that continued unabated for more than two weeks; these studies are presented separately. In one study, no operational definition was presented, and in another study, the authors reported on "chronic diarrhea", defined as diarrhea that lasted more than four weeks.

Table 1 summarizes salient features of 12 pediatric case/control studies of acute diarrhea and 3 studies of persistent diarrhea in which the authors controlled for potential confounders by matching or adjusting in multivariable analysis. From one study, we abstracted data on children only.

- **Acute diarrhea**: Among studies conducted in children in developing countries or other nonindustrialized settings, six studies showed no significant difference between cases and controls in the detection rate of G. lamblia, whereas six other studies showed a significantly lower detection rate of G. lamblia in stools from patients with acute diarrhea than from controls.

- **Persistent diarrhea**: Five case/control studies examined the association between G. lamblia and persistent diarrhea (more than or equal to 14 days duration).

### The use of antiviral agents for the management of severe influenza [^112CV1Xe]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The clinical course of pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza can be severe, particularly in the very young and patients with comorbidities. Pandemic H1N1 2009 is sensitive to the antiviral agents oseltamivir and zanamivir but is resistant to the M2 inhibitors. Although few clinical data are yet available, treatment of pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza in hospital settings with oseltamivir or zanamivir appears to be beneficial.

In hospitalized patients with severe influenza treated with oseltamivir, mortality and length of stay are significantly reduced, and viral load is reduced more quickly than in untreated patients. In patients at high risk treated with oseltamivir or zanamivir, reductions in the risk of complications and mortality after treatment have been demonstrated with oseltamivir and zanamivir, although there are fewer data on the latter. There is no evidence yet that other antiviral agents are effective in severe or pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza.

World Health Organization guidance strongly recommends the use of oseltamivir for severe or progressive infection with pandemic H1N1 2009, with zanamivir as an alternative if the infecting virus is oseltamivir-resistant. Very little resistance to oseltamivir has been found at the time of writing.

### Central importance of immunoglobulin A in host defense against Giardia spp [^1122AKDH]. Infection and Immunity (2002). Low credibility.

The protozoan pathogen Giardia is an important cause of parasitic diarrheal disease worldwide. It colonizes the lumen of the small intestine, suggesting that effective host defenses must act luminally. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies are presumed to be important for controlling Giardia infection, but direct evidence for this function is lacking. B-cell-independent effector mechanisms also exist and may be equally important for antigiardial host defense.

To determine the importance of the immunoglobulin isotypes that are transported into the intestinal lumen, IgA and IgM, for antigiardial host defense, we infected gene-targeted mice lacking IgA-expressing B-cells, IgM-secreting B-cells, or all B-cells as controls with Giardia muris or Giardia lamblia GS/M-83-H7. We found that IgA-deficient mice could not eradicate either G. muris or G. lamblia infection, demonstrating that IgA is required for their clearance. Furthermore, although neither B-cell-deficient nor IgA-deficient mice could clear G. muris infections, IgA-deficient mice controlled infection significantly better than B-cell-deficient mice, suggesting the existence of B-cell-dependent but IgA-independent antigiardial defenses.

In contrast, mice deficient for secreted IgM antibodies cleared G. muris infection normally, indicating that they have no unique functions in antigiardial host defense. These data, together with the finding that B-cell-deficient mice have some, albeit limited, residual capacity to control G. muris infection, show that IgA-dependent host defenses are central for eradicating Giardia spp.

### Oseltamivir-resistant pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in patient with impaired immune system [^117F5JKw]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

To the Editor: We detail the development of oseltamivir-resistant pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in a chronically immunocompromised patient and the pitfalls encountered when treating such patients with neuraminidase inhibitors. On August 6, 2009, a 56-year-old man was seen in the emergency room of a local hospital with a 24-hour history of fever, myalgia, coryzal symptoms, and cough. He was on day 3 of a postexposure course of oseltamivir (75 mg 1×/d); influenza A had been presumptively diagnosed for his wife after she had similar symptoms.

The patient's medical history showed grade IVB nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma, which had been diagnosed in 2001. Lymphoma was initially treated with chemotherapy, but relapse required autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation in July 2005. Further relapses in 2006 and 2007 were treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, respectively, before the patient underwent an allogeneic peripheral stem cell transplantation in July 2008. This treatment was complicated by graft-versus-host disease, and the patient required ongoing immunosuppression.

When hospitalized, the patient was being treated with cyclosporine A (50 mg/d) and prednisolone (20 mg/d). Physical examination showed a temperature of 39°C and wheezing from the left lung. Initial tests showed a neutrophil count of 2.02 × 10⁹/L, a lymphocyte count of 0.87 × 10⁹/L, and a C-reactive protein level of 33 mg/L. He was started on piperacillin–tazobactam and gentamicin, and oseltamivir was increased to the treatment dose of 75 mg 2×/d. A nasopharyngeal aspirate collected on August 7 con

### Detection of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus in patients treated with oseltamivir [^116JuGR4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

- **Figure**: Duration of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 excretion in nasal swabs from patients treated with oseltamivir. The number of days from the start of oseltamivir treatment to the achievement of negative results of reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) is indicated for 16 patients. The 3 patients classified in the last group (> 5 days) are 1 patient with a negative RT-PCR result on day 7 post-treatment and 2 patients who still had positive results on day 5 post-treatment but provided no additional sample for testing.

These preliminary virologic data obtained during the first 6 weeks of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in France confirm the poor sensitivity of the Quidel test toward this new virus, as recently reported. Further studies are needed to evaluate the performances of other rapid tests. Hayden et al. demonstrated that treatment with oseltamivir significantly reduced the duration of viral shedding among patients infected with seasonal influenza virus A (H1N1), in comparison with a placebo group: 1.5–2.5 days vs. 3.5–5.5 days (p = 0.003). In our study, surprisingly, PCR results for sequential nasal swab specimens from 16 patients infected by pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and treated with oseltamivir were negative within 3 days after therapy for only 9 (56%); indeed, for 3 (19%) patients, the viral genome could be detected > 5 days after antiviral treatment began. These data raise questions about potential virus transmission during antiviral treatment and the possible resistance of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 to oseltamivir. This latter point is now under study.

### Mytesi [^111M5PCt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Consider the risks of treatment in patients with infectious diarrhea. It is crucial to evaluate infectious etiologies of diarrhea before initiating treatment to reduce the risk of inappropriate therapy and disease exacerbation.

Before starting Mytesi, infectious causes of diarrhea must be ruled out. If infectious etiologies are not considered, and Mytesi is started based on a presumptive diagnosis of non-infectious diarrhea, there is a risk that patients with infectious diarrhea will not receive the appropriate treatments, worsening their condition. Mytesi is not indicated for the treatment of infectious diarrhea.

### Quinacrine treatment of nitroimidazole-refractory giardiasis [^113ZomTf]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Quinacrine was well tolerated among our patients, with none discontinuing the treatment prematurely. Other recent studies have similarly reported a very low rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects. Historically, quinacrine was replaced by chloroquine for malaria owing to reported adverse effects, the most alarming being psychiatric ones. In a report from 1945, which included 7,604 soldiers treated with quinacrine for malaria (receiving a total of 2100 mg), 35 (0.4%) experienced what was termed "toxic psychosis". The definition of toxic psychosis was not specified; the effect was usually described as one of euphoria and expansiveness, and only occasionally with disorientation. No cases of irreversible psychiatric disturbances were observed.

In a study from 1946, 28 cases of toxic psychosis, most commonly described as confusion, were detected among more than 14,000 soldiers (0.2% risk). Only 2 out of 28 had received a total dose of 2100 mg, while 26 had received higher doses. Rapid recovery was observed after cessation of therapy. When reevaluating these old studies, the possibility that the psychiatric mood disturbances could have resulted from malaria, combined with the fact that the soldiers were at war under severe conditions, must be taken into consideration. Furthermore, the patients received higher cumulative doses for malaria than we use for giardiasis (most frequently 2100 mg compared to 1500 mg in our cohort). In a later paper, it was reported that 1.5% of adults treated with quinacrine for giardiasis experienced "toxic effects".

### Antiamoebic drugs for treating amoebic colitis [^113Y2YN7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

The included trials reported a variety of comparisons involving over 30 individual drugs and combinations. We categorized these trials as follows:

- **Single-agent alternative versus metronidazole (17 trials)**: This includes 10 trials comparing tinidazole with metronidazole; three trials on ornidazole versus metronidazole; and one trial each on secnidazole versus metronidazole, panidazole versus metronidazole, satranidazole versus metronidazole, and praziquantel versus metronidazole.

- **Any antiamoebic drug versus placebo (four trials)**: Two trials examined nitazoxanide against a placebo, while one trial focused on quinfamide versus placebo and another assessed 10 different drugs from six drug classes versus placebo.

- **Combination regimen versus monotherapy (seven trials)**: This category includes three trials on combinations such as dehydroemetine plus oral tetracycline and diloxanide furoate, metronidazole and diiodohydroxyquinolone, and metronidazole and furazolidone, compared to metronidazole alone. Another trial explored nimorazole and aminosidine or nimorazole and etofamide or etofamide and aminosidine against nimorazole, aminosidine, or etofamide monotherapy. Additional trials investigated combinations like tetracycline and clioquinol versus secnidazole, quinfamide and mebendazole versus nitazoxanide, and tinidazole and diloxanide furoate versus tinidazole.

- **Single-dose regimens versus longer regimens (five trials)**: Trials in this category included quinfamide (one dose) versus quinfamide (two or three doses); secnidazole (one dose) versus tetracycline and clioquinol (five days); and secnidazole (one dose) versus tinidazole (two days).

### Debate regarding oseltamivir use for seasonal and pandemic influenza [^113nd9Kf]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

It should not be surprising that treatment for uncomplicated influenza will only produce a modest effect because influenza virus replication precedes symptoms by 1–2 days. This means that the viral load in the patient may have peaked by the time the patient begins antiviral treatment. Given that most antiviral drugs, including oseltamivir, act by reducing viral replication, the effect of treatment will therefore be minimal in otherwise healthy persons when immune responses are already reducing viral titers. It is therefore plausible that community-based randomized controlled trials are not capturing critical information about the mode of action of oseltamivir that is beneficial to severely ill patients.

It is possible that the benefit to severely ill patients may be related to the increased duration of viral shedding and higher viral loads found in this group of patients. Elevated cytokine levels, sometimes referred to as a cytokine storm, have been detected for patients infected with highly pathogenic A(H5N1) virus and for severely ill patients infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and seasonal influenza viruses. A randomized controlled trial study of 117 healthy adults experimentally infected with seasonal influenza virus A(H1N1) reported that oseltamivir treatment significantly reduced interleukin-6, interferon-γ, and tumor necrosis factor-α cytokine responses in patients compared with responses in placebo-treated patients. Although these results do not clarify whether the decreased cytokine response was the result of effective viral treatment or a (postulated) immune modulation effect, they provide valuable insights into the drug's potential benefits.

### Treatment of giardiasis after nonresponse to nitroimidazole [^11374atm]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Giardia lamblia are protozoan parasites distributed globally, mostly transmitted through close contact and the consumption of contaminated water or food. Giardiasis occurs in industrialized nations; occasional waterborne outbreaks have been reported in North America and Europe. However, the prevalence of giardiasis is greater in developing countries, with rates exceeding 50% among children in many locales. Among travelers, especially those traveling to developing countries, G. lamblia infection is also common; according to the GeoSentinel registry, it is the most frequently diagnosed gastrointestinal pathogen.

The utility of offering antigiardia medications to patients in areas of giardiasis hyperendemicity has been called into question unless symptoms are severe. Conversely, treatment administered to patients in areas of low giardiasis endemicity, such as ill returning travelers, usually leads to a cure. Since the introduction of metronidazole in 1959, nitroimidazoles have been the main treatment for giardiasis. However, a recent meta-analysis of clinical trials has shown that nitroimidazole treatment fails for 10%–20% of giardiasis patients; optimal treatment in such cases is not defined, and some agents (e.g. quinacrine) are often unavailable.

### SPL drug information for oseltamivir phosphate [^116nUttK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of oseltamivir phosphate PO (also known as Tamiflu, Tamiflu):

- **Bacterial infections**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as bacterial infections may coexist with or occur as complications during the course of influenza.

- **Gastrointestinal adverse events**: Use caution in patients with hereditary fructose intolerance, as oral suspension of oseltamivir contains sorbitol and can cause dyspepsia and diarrhea.

- **Neuropsychiatric adverse events**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as oseltamivir has been associated with an increased risk of abnormal behavior and delirium.

- **Severe cutaneous adverse reactions**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as oseltamivir has been associated with an increased risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and erythema multiforme.

In this retrospective observational study, quinacrine was used with good results and tolerability. Only three patients experienced a microbiologically verified treatment failure after one treatment course, resulting in 94% parasitological efficacy, and all were cured following a second course.

Historically, metronidazole and tinidazole have achieved approximately 90% (range, 60% to 100%) cure rates for intestinal giardiasis. Although additional treatment courses with nitroimidazoles are sometimes attempted for persistent cases, they demonstrated low efficacy in our cohort (24%), consistent with other studies. In this study, microbiologically verified Giardia in stool samples was used after at least two full treatment courses to ensure evaluation of true refractory disease, rather than compliance issues.

In a study from Barcelona, all 14 patients with nitroimidazole-refractory giardiasis (defined as microbiologically confirmed persistence after one metronidazole course) showed clinical improvement one month after quinacrine treatment, achieving 100% clinical efficacy. However, PCR was still positive in three patients, resulting in 79% parasitological efficacy. In another Spanish study on nitroimidazole-refractory giardiasis, all 14 quinacrine-treated patients who had follow-up were cured, with negative stool samples verifying this outcome. Of these, 12 patients had received at least two nitroimidazole courses, and two patients had received only one course prior to quinacrine. In a study from the United Kingdom, quinacrine was deemed effective because 20 patients with nitroimidazole-refractory giardiasis required no further treatment at their center, with 11 receiving quinacrine monotherapy.

### Debate regarding oseltamivir use for seasonal and pandemic influenza [^116dXfMn]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

After partially successful efforts to retrieve unpublished data from Roche, the Cochrane group conducted a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of oseltamivir in treating uncomplicated community-acquired influenza. Their findings led the group to conclude that oseltamivir had no specific antiviral effect, even though the drug had been specifically designed to achieve exactly that. The Cochrane systematic review, which focused only on an intention-to-treat analysis, confirmed that oseltamivir reduced symptom duration in the intention-to-treat group by less than 24 hours. Earlier, the Cochrane group had noted, "We are unsure of the generalizability of our conclusions from seasonal to pandemic or avian influenza".

As noted previously, a subsequent meta-analysis, funded by an unrestricted grant from Roche, also confirmed an approximately one-day reduction in symptoms among adults and adolescents who had laboratory-confirmed influenza and were treated within 48 hours of symptom onset. This analysis included outcomes of both intention-to-treat and intention-to-treat-infected groups. Benefit was found for the intention-to-treat-infected group, but no benefit was found for patients with influenza-like illness who did not have laboratory-confirmed influenza (the intention-to-treat but not infected group). Given that the benefit of oseltamivir was confined to symptomatic patients with laboratory-confirmed infection, the authors concluded that the effect of oseltamivir was due to its effect on the influenza virus, rather than a nonspecific antiviral effect.

### Oseltamivir treatment for influenza in adults: A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116AnA7U]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

Despite widespread use, questions remain about the efficacy of oseltamivir in the treatment of influenza. We aimed to conduct an individual patient data meta-analysis of all clinical trials comparing oseltamivir with placebo for the treatment of seasonal influenza in adults, focusing on symptom alleviation, complications, and safety.

- **Methods**: We included all published and unpublished Roche-sponsored randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials of 75 mg twice daily oseltamivir in adults. Trials of oseltamivir for the treatment of naturally occurring influenza-like illness in adults reporting at least one of the study outcomes were deemed eligible. We also searched databases such as Medline, PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the ClinicalTrials.gov trials register for additional relevant trials published before January 1, 2014, optimizing our search on November 27, 2014. We analyzed intention-to-treat infected, intention-to-treat, and safety populations. The primary outcome was time to alleviation of all symptoms, analyzed using accelerated failure time methods. We used risk ratios and the Mantel-Haenszel method to evaluate complications, hospital admissions, and safety outcomes.

- **Findings**: We included data from nine trials encompassing a total of 4328 patients. In the intention-to-treat infected population, we observed a 21% shorter time to alleviation of all symptoms in oseltamivir recipients compared to placebo recipients (time ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.74–0.85; p < 0.0001). The median times to symptom alleviation were 97.5 hours for the oseltamivir group and 122.7 hours for the placebo group, with a difference of -25.2 hours (95% CI -36.2 to -16.0).

### The use of quinacrine in nitroimidazole-resistant Giardia duodenalis: An old drug for an emerging problem [^112cKU9d]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

There is little evidence regarding the management of refractory giardiasis after treatment with nitroimidazoles. This study estimates the proportion of persistent giardiasis in three hospitals in Barcelona, describes associated risk factors and genotypes, and evaluates the efficacy rate of quinacrine in those with persistent giardiasis.

- **Methods**: A clinical, prospective, observational study was conducted in patients with giardiasis treated with nitroimidazoles. Those with persistent giardiasis were provided quinacrine. Molecular characterization of Giardia isolates was performed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of a fragment of tpi and bg genes.

- **Results**: Seventy-seven patients were recruited and treated with nitroimidazoles, and in 14 of 71 (20%) patients followed up, Giardia persisted. Refractory giardiasis was associated with malaise (P = 0.007) and anorexia (P = 0.02), with previous giardiasis (P = 0.03), and with previous antibiotic (P = 0.02) or antiparasitic (P = 0.04) use. Quinacrine had an effectiveness rate of 100% in refractory giardiasis (n = 13; 95% confidence interval = 75–100). Molecular characterization showed that 17 (25%) Giardia isolates belonged to assemblage A, and 31 (43%) belonged to assemblage B. In refractory giardiasis, assemblage A and B were found responsible in 4 and 6 cases, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Almost 20% of patients presented persistent giardiasis, belonging to both assemblages A and B, after nitroimidazole treatment. A short course of quinacrine was effective in treating refractory cases. Further controlled studies should evaluate i…

### Oseltamivir for influenza in adults and children: Systematic review of clinical study reports and summary of regulatory comments [^113oYPfX]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

To describe the potential benefits and harms of oseltamivir, a systematic review was conducted of all clinical study reports (or similar documents where no clinical study report exists) from randomized placebo-controlled trials and regulatory comments ("regulatory information").

- **Design**: Systematic review of regulatory information.

- **Data sources**: Clinical study reports, trial registries, electronic databases, regulatory archives, and correspondence with manufacturers.

- **Eligibility criteria for selecting studies**: Randomized placebo-controlled trials on adults and children who had confirmed or suspected exposure to natural influenza.

- **Main outcome measures**: Time to first alleviation of symptoms, influenza outcomes, complications, admissions to hospital, and adverse events in the intention-to-treat population.

- **Results**: From the European Medicines Agency and Roche, clinical study reports for 83 trials were obtained. Twenty-three trials were included in stage 1 (reliability and completeness screen) and 20 in stage 2 (formal analysis). In treatment trials on adults, oseltamivir reduced the time to first alleviation of symptoms by 16.8 hours (95% confidence interval 8.4 to 25.1 hours, P < 0.001). There was no effect in children with asthma, but there was an effect in otherwise healthy children (mean difference 29 hours, 95% confidence interval 12 to 47 hours, P = 0.001). In treatment trials, there was no difference in admissions to hospital in adults (risk difference 0.15%, 95% confidence interval -0.91% to 0.78%, P = 0.84) and sparse data in children and for prophylaxis. In adult treatment trials, oseltamivir reduced the…

### Treatment of giardiasis after nonresponse to nitroimidazole [^117Jsptn]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Given the poor performance of other monotherapies, the 90.5%–100% rate of response to quinacrine is remarkable. Shortly after the introduction of metronidazole, randomized trials showed it to be as efficacious as quinacrine, and metronidazole replaced quinacrine entirely as a giardiasis treatment. After three decades, the situation seems to be changing; nitroimidazole treatment failure is increasing, and quinacrine seems to be the best treatment for giardiasis.

It is unfortunate that quinacrine is no longer available through pharmaceutical companies; in some countries, it can be obtained only through compounding pharmacies or not at all. In Israel, for example, quinacrine is practically unavailable; for one patient in our series, quinacrine was obtained with the kind assistance of colleagues practicing in a developing country. This case illustrates how pharmaceutical industry neglect of tropical parasitic infections carries a health price tag, even in industrialized countries.

Several sources of bias may pertain to retrospective case series, the only extant source of data on nitroimidazole treatment failure for giardiasis. Case series are sometimes the result of point-source (often waterborne) outbreaks and therefore might be biased by the presence of one or a few pathogen strains. Even in reports in which cohorts are more geographically diverse, numbers of patients are generally small, and statistical comparison of treatment outcomes is not possible. Moreover, the choice of antiprotozoal agents is influenced by factors other than effectiveness, such as drug availability and cost.

### Nitroimidazole-refractory giardiasis: A growing problem requiring rational solutions [^116oAuUY]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Giardia intestinalis is a microaerophilic, diarrhea-causing protozoan common in countries with suboptimal sanitation. Standard treatment involves nitroimidazoles, but a growing number of refractory cases have been reported. Treatment failure has become increasingly prevalent in travelers who contract giardiasis in Asia. Clinicians are increasingly relying on second-line and less well-known drugs to treat giardiasis.

- **Aims**: To review nitroimidazole-refractory G. intestinalis infection, examine the efficacy of standard therapeutic agents, consider potential resistance mechanisms that could cause treatment failure, and describe the practical aspects of managing this emerging clinical problem.

- **Sources**: A PubMed search was conducted using combinations of the following terms: refractory, Giardia, giardiasis, resistance, and treatment. Articles on the pharmacotherapy, drug resistance mechanisms, and use of alternative agents in nitroimidazole-refractory giardiasis were reviewed.

- **Content**: We review the standard drugs for giardiasis, including their efficacy in initial treatment, mode of action, and documented in vitro and in vivo drug resistance. We assess the efficacy of alternative drugs in nitroimidazole-refractory disease. Existing data suggest a potential advantage of combination treatment.

- **Implications**: An optimal treatment strategy for refractory giardiasis has yet to be determined, meaning there is no standard treatment regimen for nitroimidazole-refractory giardiasis. Further work on drug resistance mechanisms and the use of drug combinations is necessary for this condition.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between Giardia lamblia and endemic pediatric diarrhea in developing countries [^115r7spb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

One well-established mechanism by which infants and young children in developing countries are protected against symptomatic disease upon exposure to Giardia is by suckling on mothers whose breast milk contains high titers of anti-Giardia secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA). Breastfeeding is strongly associated with protection against clinical Giardia diarrhea, even though it does not generally prevent the acquisition of G. lamblia infection or chronic carriage. Importantly, clinical protection is correlated with levels of specific anti-G. lamblia SIgA in milk.

Analogous evidence derives from experimental challenges of adult US volunteers. Secretory IgA anti-Giardia antibodies were detected in duodenal fluids of subjects who experienced diarrhea following initial challenge with Giardia strain Gsm, and these SIgA antibodies correlated with protection against clinical disease when the subjects were rechallenged but not with prevention of reinfection. There are also reports of anti-Giardia properties of breast milk due to moieties other than specific SIgA. Breast milk–derived passive protection may allow the child to acquire active immunity upon exposure to G. lamblia without paying the price of a clinically overt initial infection.

### Symptomatic giardiasis without diarrhea: Further evidence to support the routine duodenal biopsy [^114z2JqN]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Worldwide, Giardia lamblia is the most common protozoan isolated from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Patients with symptoms caused by giardiasis typically present with diarrhea; the absence of diarrhea may result in a low clinical index of suspicion for the diagnosis.

- **Methods**: A series of six patients with giardiasis presenting without diarrhea is reported. Five presented with atypical GI symptoms. In all six cases, diarrhea was absent. Upper GI pathology was suspected by the investigating clinician, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was therefore arranged.

- **Observations**: Five of the six patients improved with appropriate antibiotic treatment.

- **Conclusion**: This series of cases demonstrates the importance of considering G. lamblia as a cause for GI symptoms even in the absence of diarrhea. Routine procurement of duodenal biopsy specimens is valuable for the recognition of atypical presentations of patients with G. lamblia and avoiding delays in diagnosis.

### Treatment of giardiasis after nonresponse to nitroimidazole [^112pMzFU]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

During January 2008–October 2013, a total of 12 cases of nitroimidazole treatment failure, confirmed parasitologically by either microscopy or antigen testing of fecal samples after nitroimidazole therapy, were observed at the Center for Geographic Medicine and Tropical Diseases at Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, and the Tropical Disease Clinic at the Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel. All patients were symptomatic.

The median patient age was 25.0 years (interquartile range 23.7–35.0, mean ± SD 30.4 ± 11.7 years), and 75% of patients were male. Of the 12 cases, 10 (83.3%) occurred after travel to developing countries; 8 patients had traveled to Asia (India and/or Thailand) and 2 to Latin America. Of 11 patients evaluated for immune deficiency, 4 (36.4%) had low immunoglobulin levels; of these, 1 patient had pan-hypogammaglobulinemia and 3 had IgA deficiency.

The median number of failed courses of nitroimidazole was 2.5 (interquartile range 1–3, mean ± SD 2.7 ± 2.5 courses). All 12 patients received albendazole as a second line of treatment. Of 10 patients for whom complete parasitologic data were available, 4 (40%) experienced cure. Of the 6 patients for whom albendazole failed, 4 received additional treatments.

*Note: The table mentioned was removed as there is no accompanying data available.

### Debate regarding oseltamivir use for seasonal and pandemic influenza [^115928Sd]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Oseltamivir treatment of severe influenza

Although it is necessary to consider oseltamivir's effect on more serious infections, no randomized controlled trials exist that can be included in a meta-analysis. The Cochrane group conducts meta-analyses only on randomized controlled trials, which are generally accepted to be the highest level of evidence. Thus, the Cochrane group could not review severe outcomes of laboratory-confirmed influenza. Evidence is instead derived from observational studies on the use of oseltamivir to treat complications of influenza virus infection, such as in hospitalized patients or in those who died. These studies are subject to uncontrolled bias. For instance, sicker patients may be more (or less) likely to be treated, thus attenuating (or exaggerating) the effect of the intervention. Additionally, a serious outcome may occur soon after treatment initiation in a severely ill patient, so the treatment may not have had a chance to succeed. Similarly, patients who receive early treatment are more likely to benefit than those who receive late treatment.

To minimize bias, researchers conducting observational studies have attempted to adjust for time from disease onset to treatment and time from treatment to outcome. Some observational studies have also adjusted for the propensity to be treated, as well as patient coexisting conditions and disease severity, which may affect treatment decisions and outcomes.

Observational studies that enrolled adults have often used death as an outcome, given its ease of definition. However, many observational studies lack sufficient…

### New approaches to the treatment of giardiasis [^113GBtjs]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Giardiasis is one of the most common causes of diarrheal disease worldwide, yet existing antimicrobial therapies are not always effective, and drug resistance occurs in vivo and in vitro. This review focuses on recent advances in the development of new antigiardial drug candidates.

- **Recent findings**: Modification of existing drug leads is a major strategy to develop new high-potency drugs. Complex derivatives of 5-nitroimidazole, the core structure of the most commonly used antigiardial drug, metronidazole, have shown significantly improved activities against Giardia and the ability to overcome metronidazole resistance. Derivatives of benzimidazole, the structural core of the effective antigiardial albendazole, are also exhibiting promising new activities. Beyond lead modifications, several new classes of antigiardial drug candidates have recently been identified by high-throughput screening of large compound libraries, and first efforts have been reported on the development of drugs tailored to known molecular targets in Giardia.

- **Summary**: The pipeline of new antigiardial drug candidates has significantly expanded over the last few years, but this expansion has so far not been accompanied by a demonstration of efficacy in animal models or by a clear understanding of the action mechanisms, particularly in regard to new nitro antimicrobials. Many challenges are still to be expected before the clinical utility of new antigiardial drugs can be established.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between Giardia lamblia and endemic pediatric diarrhea in developing countries [^114VoteL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). High credibility.

Overview of the longitudinal studies

The salient features of the study designs and the results from 18 longitudinal studies undertaken in developing countries or populations in transition are presented. Some longitudinal cohort studies addressed the epidemiology and broad etiology of diarrheal disease, whereas others confined themselves to addressing the etiologic role of Giardia lamblia in association with diarrhea. Children comprised the study target population except for two studies, one from Brazil and the other from Egypt, that also included adult household members. The follow-up period in most studies was approximately 24 months. In the remaining studies, follow-up was approximately 10–12 months, three years (average 1.5 years), or four years (median 23 months).

- **Cohort studies**: The analytical approach compared the prevalence of Giardia lamblia in stool samples obtained during diarrheal episodes with the prevalence of the parasite in stools obtained from asymptomatic children or in nondiarrheal stools obtained on a systematic predetermined basis (routine surveillance). Two studies compared the incidence of diarrhea in "Giardia lamblia–positive periods" with "Giardia lamblia–negative periods". In two studies, the incidence of diarrhea was compared between children who were positive for Giardia lamblia and children whose stool was negative for Giardia lamblia. Measurements of association were reported in only a fraction of the studies, with age- or multivariable-adjusted results presented in seven studies.

### Common intestinal parasites [^111AXPMa]. American Family Physician (2023). Low credibility.

Parasites are a source of significant illness worldwide. In the United States, giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, cyclosporiasis, and trichinellosis are nationally notifiable conditions. Pinworm, the most common intestinal parasite in children, is not a locally notifiable infection. Intestinal parasites have a wide range of acute and chronic symptoms but should be suspected in those who present with diarrhea lasting more than seven days. Infections most often occur through a fecal-oral route. Symptoms tend to be worse for children, older adults, or immunocompromised individuals.

To diagnose Giardia infection, stool microscopy with direct fluorescent antibody testing is recommended; metronidazole, nitazoxanide, or tinidazole is used for treatment. Microscopy with immunofluorescence is sensitive and specific for diagnosing Cryptosporidium infection. This infection is often self-resolving, but treatment with nitazoxanide is effective for symptoms lasting more than two weeks. Microscopy or polymerase chain reaction assays are recommended to diagnose Cyclospora infections, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim may be used to treat patients with persistent diarrhea. Trichinella infection is diagnosed by serum antibody testing, and severe symptoms are treated with albendazole in patients older than one year. Pinworm infections are diagnosed visually or by a tape test or paddle test; albendazole and pyrantel pamoate are both effective treatments.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between Giardia lamblia and endemic pediatric diarrhea in developing countries [^113qiDny]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

We performed a systematic literature review and meta-analysis examining the association between diarrhea in young children in nonindustrialized settings and Giardia lamblia infection. Eligible studies were case/control and longitudinal studies that defined the outcome as acute or persistent (> 14 days) diarrhea, adjusted for confounders and lasting for at least 1 year. Data on G. lamblia detection (mainly in stools) from diarrhea patients and controls without diarrhea were abstracted.

Random-effects model meta-analysis obtained pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Twelve nonindustrialized-setting acute pediatric diarrhea studies met the meta-analysis inclusion criteria. A random-effects model meta-analysis of combined results (9,774 acute diarrhea cases and 8,766 controls) yielded a pooled OR of 0.60 (95% CI, 0.38–0.94; P = 0.03), indicating that G. lamblia was not associated with acute diarrhea. However, limited data suggest that initial Giardia infections in early infancy may be positively associated with diarrhea. Meta-analysis of five persistent diarrhea studies showed a pooled OR of 3.18 (95% CI, 1.50–6.76; P < 0.001), positively linking Giardia with that syndrome. The well-powered Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) is prospectively addressing the association between G. lamblia infection and diarrhea in children in developing countries.

### Oseltamivir for influenza in adults and children: Systematic review of clinical study reports and summary of regulatory comments [^1154zUsR]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

- **Selection of studies**: We included randomised controlled trials testing the effects of oseltamivir for treatment, prophylaxis, and post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza. Treatment referred to the use of oseltamivir in individuals exhibiting symptoms of influenza-like illness potentially caused by influenza A and B viruses. Prophylaxis was defined as the use of oseltamivir when future exposure to influenza was anticipated. Post-exposure prophylaxis involved administering oseltamivir after probable exposure to influenza but before the onset of symptoms. Studies that were open-label and those not involving naturally occurring influenza were excluded.

- **Types of studies**: Due to discrepancies between published and unpublished reports of the same trials, we chose to include only those trials for which we had unabridged clinical study reports. Two authors (PD and TJ) reapplied inclusion criteria for the full clinical study reports received in 2013, resolving disagreements through discussion.

- **Types of participants**: The randomised controlled trials had to include children and adults who were either healthy before exposure to respiratory agents or had a chronic illness (such as asthma, diabetes, or hypertension), excluding individuals with immune systems compromised by diseases such as malignancy or HIV infection. Exposure needed to be naturally occurring influenza, with or without symptoms.

We analysed the intention-to-treat and safety populations, as our previous review discovered compelling evidence for the intention-to-treat influenza-infected subpopulation.

The natural history of viral shedding from the upper respiratory tract of the new pandemic 2009 influenza A(H1N1) and the effect of oseltamivir treatment were uncertain.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study involving 145 consecutive patients with specimens positive by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for the matrix and new H1 genes was conducted.

- **Results**: The nontreated and oseltamivir-treated patients were comparable in their viral load at presentation, demography, and presenting symptoms. No correlation was observed between viral load with age and number of symptoms. The viral load of nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was significantly lower in treated than in nontreated patients at day 5 after symptom onset. When oseltamivir was initiated within 2 days of symptom onset, the viral load was inversely correlated with concomitant absolute lymphocyte count in nontreated patients (Pearson correlation coefficient [r] = -0.687, P = 0.001) and treated patients (Pearson r = -0.365, P < .001). Resolution of fever was 1.4 days later in nontreated than treated patients (P = 0.012).

- **Conclusions**: The natural viral load profile was described. Oral oseltamivir suppresses viral load efficiently.

Giardia lamblia is one of the most common causes of intestinal disease in humans. To adapt to environments both inside and outside of the host's small intestine, this protozoan parasite undergoes significant developmental changes during its life cycle. In this review, we analyze and discuss the most recent findings regarding the process of Giardia trophozoites differentiation into infective cysts, as well as the mechanism of antigenic variation, which allows the parasite to cause chronic infections and reinfections in susceptible individuals.

Extracted study characteristics included the year, number of participants, method of confirming influenza, follow-up duration, and study sponsor. Relevant participant demographics were extracted, including race and ethnicity, sex, and type of influenza (A or B). Missing study demographics were assumed to be unavailable.

The primary efficacy outcome was the number of first all-cause hospitalizations per treatment group in the intention-to-treat infected (ITTi) population — individuals confirmed to have influenza according to the study definition. Hospitalization was defined as the first admission to a hospital or health care center during the treatment or follow-up period, for any cause and any duration. Emergency department visits with direct discharge home were excluded. When this was not specifically reported in the ITTi population, up to eight email data requests were made to the senior and/or corresponding author. The British Medical Journal database contains unpublished Roche CSRs. Within these, hospitalized patients were identified from the serious adverse event narratives, and their participant identification numbers were cross-referenced with the study's diagnostic results to confirm their case positivity.

The primary safety outcome was the rate of any adverse event, regardless of grade, which included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cardiac, psychiatric, neurologic, and a composite of any gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, diarrhea, gastritis, and others). Nonindustry studies either had thresholds for reporting neurological adverse effects or did not report these at all.

### Quinacrine treatment of nitroimidazole-refractory giardiasis [^115PTKW7]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Giardia intestinalis, also known as Giardia lamblia or Giardia duodenalis, is one of the most common intestinal parasitic protozoa reported in humans worldwide. It can cause both acute and chronic diarrhea with malabsorption, abdominal pain, bloating, fatigue, and weight loss, but asymptomatic carriage is not uncommon. First-line treatment for giardiasis is the 5-nitroimidazoles, most commonly metronidazole and tinidazole. In recent years, giardiasis refractory to nitroimidazoles has become a challenging problem worldwide. Alternative agents that have been tried include nitazoxanide, paromomycin, albendazole, mebendazole, and chloroquine, sometimes in combination with a nitroimidazole, but with varying and often suboptimal cure rates. The old drug quinacrine is increasingly being used as an alternative treatment, although availability is limited in many countries.

Quinacrine was originally developed as an antimalarial drug, but due to adverse effects, it was replaced by chloroquine. Quinacrine was used to treat giardiasis as early as the 1930s and was reported to be 90% to 95% effective. In the 1960s, it was largely replaced by the well-tolerated 5-nitroimidazole derivatives after studies had shown their efficacy against giardiasis. Only a few small studies exist that have evaluated quinacrine as a treatment alternative for nitroimidazole-refractory giardiasis.

The primary aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of quinacrine in a larger patient cohort with well-defined nitroimidazole-refractory giardiasis. A secondary aim was to assess the in.

### Prevalence of nitroimidazole-refractory giardiasis acquired in different world regions, Sweden, 2008–2020 [^112NS2ji]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

The reason for the higher and increasing prevalence of nitroimidazole-refractory disease in India compared with other countries is not known. High drug pressure, due to the frequent use of 5-nitroimidazoles, could perhaps be an explanation. Such pressure is observed with bacterial drug resistance, which is also common in India. The lower prevalence found in neighboring Pakistan (1%), which has similar living conditions, is difficult to explain. To understand these geographic and temporal variations, better knowledge of the mechanisms behind nitroimidazole-refractory giardiasis is needed.

Treatment-refractory disease with the persistence of protozoa in fecal samples may result from parasite drug resistance, but host-related factors, such as immunoglobulin deficiencies and HIV, can also play a role. Drug resistance is difficult to evaluate in clinical settings because antimicrobial drug susceptibility testing for Giardia is lacking, and the underlying molecular resistance mechanisms are not well understood. In our cohort, only a small percentage (2%) of patients with nitroimidazole-refractory diseases had known immunosuppressive conditions. Furthermore, all patients (n = 56) who were treated with quinacrine improved. Although quinacrine has been reported to have good efficacy against nitroimidazole-refractory giardiasis — with clinical cure rates of 98% and parasitologic cure rates of 89% from pooled studies — increased use might pose a risk for further resistance. Without reliable diagnostic assays on antimicrobial drug resistance, the management of treatment-refractory giardiasis will remain challenging.

### Treatment of giardiasis after nonresponse to nitroimidazole [^117WrcU8]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Most antiprotozoal agents seem to perform poorly after nitroimidazole has failed. Clearance of giardia after nitroimidazole treatment failure was achieved for less than 20% of patients who received albendazole and less than 30% of patients who received paromomycin, despite reported cure rates of 80% and 90%, respectively, for these drugs when used as primary regimens. Clinical trials have reported that the giardia clearance rate after primary monotherapy with nitazoxanide also approached 80%. Its role in cure after nitroimidazole treatment failure has not been established, but in the few cases found in our search, the giardiasis cure rate after nitazoxanide treatment was only 40%. Thus, nitroimidazole treatment failure might actually be an indicator for multidrug-resistant G. lamblia strains.

Whether nitroimidazole treatment failure reflects pathogen resistance or defective host defenses is not clear. In our case series and others, immunoglobulin deficiency was common in cases of nitroimidazole treatment failure. It has been shown in select cases that nitroimidazole therapy in immunoglobulin-deficient patients fails to clear nitroimidazole-sensitive giardia, leading to the in vivo emergence of resistant strains. The role of a host factor might also be evidenced by cases in which giardia are refractory to nitroimidazole in one patient but easily eliminated from the patient's family members, as occurred for a patient in our series. This 35-year-old patient was IgA deficient, and his wife and toddler son were asymptomatic carriers of giardia, according to fecal testing.

### Cryptosporidium and giardia infections in children: A review [^112mgD69]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Diarrheal disease remains the second leading cause of mortality in children in developing countries. Cryptosporidium is a leading cause, and its importance stands to increase as the rotavirus vaccine becomes used around the world. Cryptosporidium is particularly problematic in children younger than 2 years old and in the immunocompromised. Giardia lamblia is a common intestinal protozoan that is associated with diarrhea and, perhaps, growth faltering in impoverished settings. This review establishes the prevalence of these infections in global settings and reviews diagnosis and management approaches.

### Quinacrine treatment of nitroimidazole-refractory giardiasis [^115hFTbw]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Among the 85 patients treated for nitroimidazole-refractory giardiasis, 26 received multiple treatment courses, resulting in a total of 124 treatment episodes. The proportion of patients treated with quinacrine was 29% (11/38) during the first half of the study period but increased to 91% (43/47) during the second half. Fifty-three were prescribed a therapy other than quinacrine. The second most common treatment after quinacrine was albendazole in combination with metronidazole, after which 18 of 37 with follow-up samples were positive for G. intestinalis, showing a 51% parasitological efficacy. The treatment failure rate was very high with other treatments.

- **Quinacrine tolerability**: None of the 54 patients receiving quinacrine terminated their treatment prematurely, and possible mild adverse effects were recorded in only 1 (1.9%). This was a patient with a previous history of anxiety disorder who experienced reversible symptoms, including mild headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and feeling distracted, upon receiving a 2100 mg cumulative dose of quinacrine. An additional 6 patients with a documented previous history of psychiatric disorders (e.g. depression, anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder) received quinacrine without reporting any adverse effects.

### Tamiflu [^112b5BZC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Elimination**: Absorbed oseltamivir is primarily (> 90%) eliminated by conversion to the active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate. Plasma concentrations of oseltamivir declined with a half-life of 1 to 3 hours in most subjects after oral administration. Oseltamivir carboxylate is not further metabolized and is eliminated unchanged in urine. Plasma concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate declined with a half-life of 6 to 10 hours in most subjects after oral administration.

- **Metabolism**: Oseltamivir is extensively converted to the active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate, by esterases located predominantly in the liver. Oseltamivir carboxylate is not further metabolized. Neither oseltamivir nor oseltamivir carboxylate is a substrate for, or inhibitor of, cytochrome P450 isoforms.

- **Excretion**: Oseltamivir carboxylate is eliminated entirely (> 99%) by renal excretion. Renal clearance (18.8 L/h) exceeds glomerular filtration rate (7.5 L/h), indicating that tubular secretion (via organic anion transporter) occurs in addition to glomerular filtration. Less than 20% of an oral radiolabeled dose is eliminated in feces.

### Reducing influenza virus transmission: The potential value of antiviral treatment [^113FT45R]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

A trial conducted during the 2008–2009 season, comparing combined oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir treatment with each respective monotherapy in 267 IPs, found no significant difference in the frequencies of secondary illness in household contacts between the arms (12.5% overall). However, when the analysis was limited to 136 IPs treated within 24 hours after symptom onset, a significantly lower proportion of contacts developed illness in the combination arm (4%) than in the oseltamivir (17%) or zanamivir (15%) arms.

A large placebo-controlled trial of oseltamivir treatment in household IPs aged ≥ 1 year in Bangladesh during 2008–2010 found that illness was somewhat less frequent in the contacts of oseltamivir-treated IPs (8%) than in those of placebo recipients (10%). The odds ratio was 0.77 (95% confidence interval, .60–.98; p = 0.03). Although no significant difference in reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction–confirmed influenza was found (4% vs. 5%), possibly due to limited contact sampling, the trial documented significant reductions in the frequency of infectious virus detection in oseltamivir-treated children.

Some evidence on the effect of antiviral treatment on household transmission comes from studies during the 2009 pandemic. A retrospective survey of 1,547 households in Japan found a contact SAR of 11.4% overall. Multivariable analysis showed that inhaled zanamivir treatment within 24 and 24–48 hours after illness onset, primarily administered to teenagers, significantly reduced the risk of household transmission to 0.57 and 0.58, respectively.

### An up-date on giardia and giardiasis [^1154kfkj]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Giardia intestinalis is a non-invasive protozoan parasite infecting the upper small intestine, causing acute, watery diarrhea or giardiasis in 280 million people annually. Asymptomatic infections are equally common, and recent data have suggested that infections can even be protective against other diarrheal diseases. Most symptomatic infections resolve spontaneously; however, infections can lead to chronic disease, and treatment failures are becoming more common worldwide. Giardia infections can also result in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and food allergies after resolution. Until recently, not much was known about the mechanism of giardiasis, the cause of post-giardiasis syndromes, and treatment failures, but here we describe the recent progress in these areas.

### Effects of oseltamivir treatment of index patients with influenza on secondary household illness in an urban setting in Bangladesh: secondary analysis of a randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^1172FbpF]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Antiviral drugs are a proposed medical intervention to reduce household transmission of influenza viruses. In a previously described randomized, placebo-controlled trial in Dhaka, Bangladesh, we showed that oseltamivir treatment of index patients was able to reduce influenza symptom duration and virus shedding. In further analysis as part of the same study, we aimed to assess the efficacy of oseltamivir in reducing secondary household illnesses in the same cohort.

- **Methods**: In this double-blind oseltamivir efficacy trial, we identified index patients aged older than 1 year through surveillance of households in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We randomly allocated eligible patients (1:1) to receive oseltamivir or placebo twice daily for 5 days, and we stratified them by enrollment 48 hours versus 48–120 hours since illness onset. Participants provided nasal wash specimens at enrollment and 2, 4, and 7 days after enrollment and were visited daily by a research assistant to record symptoms, both in index patients and household members. For this part of the study, household members were asked to give respiratory specimens for influenza PCR testing. Our primary outcomes were household secondary illness and PCR-confirmed influenza virus infection, assessed in household members of all randomly allocated index patients. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00707941.

- **Findings**: From May 11, 2008, to Dec 31, 2010, we enrolled 1190 index patients with 4694 household members. 592 patients were allocated to the placebo group (2292 household members), and 598 to the oseltamivir group (2402 household members).

### Nitazoxanide [^111AavFh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Diarrhea caused by G. lamblia in adults and adolescents 12 years of age or older:

In a double-blind, controlled trial (Study 1) conducted in Peru and Egypt, adults and adolescents with diarrhea and with one or more enteric symptoms (e.g. abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, abdominal distention, loss of appetite, flatulence) caused by G. lamblia were treated. A three-day course of treatment with nitazoxanide tablets, administered at 500 mg twice daily, was compared with a placebo tablet over the same period. A third group of patients received open-label nitazoxanide for oral suspension, administered as 500 mg/25 mL of suspension twice daily for 3 days. A second double-blind, controlled trial (Study 2) was conducted in Egypt, focusing on adults and adolescents with diarrhea, with or without enteric symptoms (e.g. abdominal colic, abdominal tenderness, abdominal cramps, abdominal distention, fever, bloody stool) caused by G. lamblia. This study compared nitazoxanide tablets, administered 500 mg twice daily for 3 days, to a placebo tablet. For both of these studies, clinical response was evaluated 4 to 7 days following the end of treatment. A clinical response of 'well' was defined as 'no symptoms, no watery stools and no more than 2 soft stools with no hematochezia within the past 24 hours' or 'no symptoms and no unformed stools within the past 48 hours'. The following clinical response rates were obtained:

### Quinacrine treatment of nitroimidazole-refractory giardiasis [^113GRSJG]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

- **Background**: Limited evidence exists on the efficacy and tolerability of quinacrine for nitroimidazole-refractory giardiasis.

- **Methods**: Nitroimidazole-refractory giardiasis cases, defined as microbiologically (microscopy and/or PCR) confirmed treatment failure after two courses during 2008–2020, were retrospectively identified.

- **Results**: Of 87 patients, 54 (62%) had visited India. Quinacrine was used in 54 (62%); 51 received monotherapy and 3 combined with metronidazole. Only 3 had positive stool samples with persisting symptoms after quinacrine treatment (94% parasitological efficacy), and all were cured following a second treatment. One (1.9%) had mild adverse effects recorded.

- **Conclusions**: Quinacrine is an effective treatment for nitroimidazole-refractory giardiasis with good tolerability.

### Nitazoxanide [^117K1i66]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Patients diagnosed with diarrhea caused by G. lamblia, including those from both adult and adolescent populations, were analyzed for clinical response rates between 4 to 7 days post-therapy. These rates were disaggregated based on the number of successes relative to the total patient count. It is important to note that all patients with G. lamblia as the sole pathogen were included in this analysis. Those who did not complete the studies were considered as treatment failures. The analysis showed that clinical response rates were statistically significantly higher when compared to the placebo group.

The 95% confidence interval for the difference in response rates between the tablet and suspension forms was calculated to be between -14% and 17%. Despite some patients showing a 'well' clinical response, instances of G. lamblia cysts were noted in their stool samples 4 to 7 days post-treatment. The significance of this finding remains unclear, and management should focus on the clinical response to treatment.

When focusing on pediatric patients aged 1 through 11 years, a randomized controlled trial held in Peru with 110 subjects revealed insights into treatment efficacy. This trial compared a three-day course of nitazoxanide with dosages of 100 mg twice daily for children aged 24–47 months and 200 mg twice daily for those aged 4 through 11 years, against a five-day course of metronidazole, administered at 125 mg twice daily for children aged 2 through 5 years, and 250 mg twice daily for those aged 6 through 11 years. Clinical response was assessed 7 to 10 days after treatment commencement. A 'well' response was defined as the absence of symptoms, no watery stools, and no more than…

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between Giardia lamblia and endemic pediatric diarrhea in developing countries [^112mKSra]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Experimental challenge studies with Giardia lamblia, in which healthy volunteers were inoculated enterally with trophozoites of two distinct human isolates of G. lamblia — designated GS/M and Isr — demonstrated the establishment of infection and elicitation of clinical illness only among participants who were challenged with the GS/M isolate, belonging to Giardia assemblage B. This study established the concept that there is variability among Giardia strains with respect to their pathogenicity in humans. Animal experiments support this concept of variable pathogenicity among Giardia strains.

A few recent studies undertaken following the availability of techniques to genotype G. lamblia have suggested a possible association between G. lamblia genotypes A or B and clinical illness. Nevertheless, caution must be exercised in drawing conclusions from these preliminary reports, as the sample size of each study was small (6–138 diarrheal cases infected with G. lamblia and 6–199 nondiarrhea subjects infected with G. lamblia). These studies also varied by design, study population, and outcome under investigation.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between Giardia lamblia and endemic pediatric diarrhea in developing countries [^111pYMdQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Giardia lamblia infection induces serum immunoglobulin M and intestinal SIgA anti-Giardia antibodies, of which local SIgA is considered the most important for controlling and clearing the infection. Interleukin 6 and T-dependent responses have also been described. These anti-Giardia responses may contribute to nonspecific or cross-protection against other enteropathogens.

In summary, evidence does not incriminate G. lamblia as a cause of acute diarrhea in young children in developing countries but does suggest an important role of G. lamblia infection in persistent diarrhea in such populations. Statistically well-powered, controlled studies such as the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) are needed to clarify the circumstances under which G. lamblia infection may be involved in the development of diarrheal disease. In seven developing-country sites, GEMS will help address whether Giardia infections in early infancy are positively linked to moderate-to-severe diarrhea, whether some pediatric hosts (e.g. more stunted) are more prone to develop persistent diarrhea, whether Giardia decreases the risk of acute diarrhea from other specific enteropathogens, and whether specific Giardia genotypes exhibit enhanced pathogenicity over other genotypes.

### Treatment options for the eradication of intestinal protozoa [^1179dhkU]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Pathogenic intestinal protozoa are responsible for clinically important infections in both the developed and the developing world. These organisms cause both acute and chronic diarrhea, and Entamoeba histolytica, which affects the colon, can spread to involve the liver. Many of these pathogens, particularly the intracellular protozoa that predominantly affect the small intestine, produce their most devastating effects in patients with HIV/AIDS and other forms of immune deficiency.

There are also various intestinal protozoa that do not seem to have any adverse effects on humans and can, therefore, be regarded as harmless commensal organisms. Although treatment has been available for several decades for giardiasis, isosporiasis, and amoebiasis, until recently there have been no effective remedies for infection with intestinal coccidia — Cryptosporidium, Microsporidium, and Cyclospora species. Cyclospora respond well to co-trimoxazole, microsporidia respond variably to albendazole, and cryptosporidia can often be eradicated by nitazoxanide. In chronically infected HIV-positive patients, treatment with multidrug regimens usually results in rapid resolution of the diarrhea and, in many instances, eradication of the parasite.

To assess the time it takes for a real-time PCR to become negative after the treatment of a Giardia lamblia infection, we evaluated two consecutive follow-up samples from 75 infected patients. Approximately one week after treatment, all samples tested negative, indicating rapid clearance of parasitic DNA after successful treatment.

### Prevalence of nitroimidazole-refractory giardiasis acquired in different world regions, Sweden, 2008–2020 [^116XpUtZ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Giardia intestinalis (G. lamblia, G. duodenalis) is an intestinal protozoal pathogen found worldwide; the highest incidence occurs in developing countries. For decades, the first-line treatment for giardiasis has been the 5-nitroimidazoles, such as metronidazole and tinidazole. Since the early 2000s, reports of giardiasis refractory (resistant) to 5-nitroimidazoles have increased, posing a clinical challenge. These reports are mostly from travelers returning from the Indian subcontinent. Information on the prevalence of giardiasis refractory to 5-nitroimidazoles in India and global epidemiology is scarce. To examine global prevalence, we assessed the percentage of nitroimidazole-refractory disease among giardiasis cases acquired in different geographic world regions.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between Giardia lamblia and endemic pediatric diarrhea in developing countries [^117GdAXa]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

We limited our analysis to the case-control and cohort studies that utilized rigorous methodology and controlled for potential confounders, lasting ≥ 1 year, and clearly defining the outcome variable (i.e. acute vs. persistent diarrhea). In doing so, we found no significant association between the presence of Giardia in stools and an increased risk of acute diarrhea among children living in developing countries or non-industrialized settings. Indeed, there was evidence of a significant inverse association between the presence of Giardia in stools and acute diarrhea among children in these regions. A pooled analysis of the studies that utilized rigorous methodology showed that G. lamblia was associated with a 40% lower likelihood of acute diarrhea in children from developing countries (P = 0.03).

One may consider differences in the host, the parasite, or host-parasite interactions to explain the distinct responses to Giardia exposure among children and adults from industrialized countries versus developing countries. The former are at risk of developing acute diarrhea when encountering G. lamblia, whereas pediatric subjects in the latter settings experience apparent innocuity or even a protective effect against acute diarrhea when infected with this protozoan. One possible explanation may relate to the age of initial exposure and the frequency of subsequent re-exposure. In developing-country populations, G. lamblia is ubiquitous, and the initial infection is acquired in the first few weeks of life.

### Treatment of patients with refractory giardiasis [^116ZbFxY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Giardia lamblia is one of the most common parasitic infections. Although standard treatments are usually curative, some immunocompromised patients — including those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome — as well as healthy patients, may have giardiasis that is refractory to recommended regimens. Our experience with six patients with giardiasis showed that therapy with a combination of quinacrine and metronidazole resulted in cures for five out of the six patients.
