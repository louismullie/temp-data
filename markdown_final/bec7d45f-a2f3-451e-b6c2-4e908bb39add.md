## Question

labile blood glucose elevated cortisol 15 year old femael

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate a 15-year-old female with labile blood glucose and elevated cortisol. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical problem and immediate safety. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis for hyperglycemia and for hypercortisolism in adolescents. Next, I will review the initial workup and screening tests, followed by confirmatory testing for Cushing's syndrome. After that, I need to consider pediatric-specific issues, including pubertal physiology and medication exposures. Finally, I will outline management principles and follow-up, ensuring each step aligns with guideline-based care and the provided evidence base [^113mP7jc] [^116RNyU7].

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and its implications. Labile blood glucose in an adolescent can reflect stress hyperglycemia, early type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, medication-induced hyperglycemia, or impaired glucose tolerance, while an elevated cortisol raises concern for Cushing's syndrome, exogenous glucocorticoid exposure, or physiologic stress responses; I need to ensure I do not conflate these categories and that I prioritize safety if there is symptomatic hyperglycemia or DKA risk [^116EiTne] [^1137NcU9] [^115zjtFQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should construct a prioritized differential. For hyperglycemia, I must consider type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, stress hyperglycemia, medication-induced diabetes (notably glucocorticoids), and monogenic diabetes, while for hypercortisolism I should distinguish endogenous Cushing's syndrome from exogenous steroid exposure and physiologic or pseudo-Cushing states such as obesity, depression, and anxiety; I should also remember that PCOS and uncontrolled diabetes can mimic some Cushing features in adolescents, so I need to keep those in the differential while I verify with objective testing [^116EiTne] [^115Wscz4] [^114QTeqD].

> I will now examine the initial evaluation. I need to check a detailed history for steroid use (oral, inhaled, topical, injections), symptoms of hypercortisolism (weight gain, striae, bruising, hypertension, mood changes, menstrual irregularity), and classic diabetes symptoms; on exam, I should look for central obesity, dorsocervical fat pad, violaceous striae, proximal muscle weakness, skin thinning, and acanthosis nigricans, while also measuring blood pressure and BMI percentile; baseline labs should include fasting plasma glucose or random glucose, HbA1c, basic metabolic panel, CBC, and a morning cortisol with simultaneous ACTH, recognizing that a single elevated cortisol is not diagnostic and needs context and confirmation [^114DJWzk] [^1137NcU9] [^114gBqCp].

> Wait, let me verify the screening approach for Cushing's syndrome before I anchor on it. The recommended first-line screens are an overnight 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test with an 8 am cortisol threshold of less than 1.8 µg/dL for suppression, and late-night salivary cortisol on two separate nights; if either is abnormal, I should proceed to confirmatory testing, and if both are normal, Cushing's is unlikely in this context, though I must ensure I have excluded exogenous steroids and repeated tests if clinical suspicion remains high [^1137NcU9] [^116RNyU7] [^117Pi55f].

> Next, I should review confirmatory testing if screening is positive. I need to obtain two 24-hour urinary free cortisol collections and consider a low-dose 2-day dexamethasone suppression test; if ACTH is low, I should suspect an adrenal source, whereas a normal or high ACTH suggests pituitary or ectopic disease, prompting pituitary MRI and, if needed, inferior petrosal sinus sampling; throughout, I should double-check for assay variability and repeat abnormal results to avoid misclassification [^1137NcU9] [^116RNyU7].

> But wait, what if the cortisol elevation is physiologic or due to stress? I should confirm that I have excluded exogenous glucocorticoids from all routes, including topical, inhaled, intranasal, intra-articular, and epidural injections, because even localized steroid exposure can suppress the HPA axis and confound interpretation; if exogenous exposure is present, I should taper and reassess after recovery of HPA function rather than overdiagnose Cushing's [^114zauNC] [^114daDzB] [^112evbvj].

> I need to ensure I address pediatric-specific physiology. During puberty, increased sex steroids and IGF-1 alter cortisol metabolism and clearance, which can affect both assay interpretation and hydrocortisone dosing if CAH or adrenal insufficiency is ultimately diagnosed; in suspected CAH, I should check 17-hydroxyprogesterone and consider an ACTH stimulation test, recognizing that late-onset or nonclassic CAH can present with hyperandrogenism and sometimes insulin resistance in adolescent females [^117Q5nR6] [^116nGgFx] [^116j8wzx].

> Let me consider the possibility of cyclic Cushing's disease, especially if glucose variability is prominent. If clinical suspicion persists despite normal initial screens, I should repeat salivary cortisol and UFC at times of symptomatic hyperglycemia, because cyclical disease can be missed with isolated normal tests; a pediatric case report showed early morning hyperglycemia correlating with cortisol spikes, reinforcing the need for timed sampling when symptoms flare [^116VGokL].

> I should confirm the diabetes workup is complete. In addition to fasting glucose, random glucose, and HbA1c, I need to consider autoantibodies (GAD65, IA-2) if type 1 diabetes is suspected, and an oral glucose tolerance test if fasting glucose is normal but suspicion remains high; I must remember that stress hyperglycemia can be the first manifestation of evolving type 1 diabetes, so discordant results warrant close follow-up and repeat testing rather than dismissal [^114gBqCp] [^112KFy8r] [^116PLypv].

> Hold on, I should verify that I am not overlooking medication-induced hyperglycemia. Glucocorticoids, beta-agonists, and some immunosuppressants can cause hyperglycemia, and in adolescents exposed to steroids, insulin may be required temporarily; importantly, steroid-induced hyperglycemia often resolves after the steroid is withdrawn, but persistent abnormalities require ongoing diabetes evaluation and management [^112GEMbd] [^112Ek8oh] [^1122EjwA].

> Next, I should review management principles if Cushing's syndrome is confirmed. Definitive therapy is etiology-specific: transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary Cushing's, adrenalectomy for adrenal sources, and treatment of ectopic ACTH; medical options such as ketoconazole, metyrapone, osilodrostat, or mifepristone can be used when surgery is not feasible or as bridge therapy, with mifepristone specifically indicated to control hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adults; I need to ensure rigorous screening and treatment of comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, osteoporosis, and psychiatric symptoms, and to plan long-term follow-up given persistent metabolic risk even after remission [^1138Pz6h] [^111HCyxg] [^114mrsnE] [^113mP7jc].

> I should double-check that my plan addresses the labile glucose in the interim. Frequent home glucose monitoring, nutritional counseling, and escalation to insulin if persistent hyperglycemia or catabolic features emerge are appropriate; if exogenous steroids are being tapered, I must anticipate HPA axis suppression and provide stress-dose coverage during illness or procedures to avoid adrenal crisis, with recovery tracked by morning cortisol and clinical status [^112evbvj] [^112RBXX5].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and counseling are in place. Even after successful treatment of Cushing's, cardiovascular risk factors may persist, so ongoing monitoring of weight, blood pressure, glucose, lipids, and bone health is essential; in adolescents, I should also address menstrual irregularity, body image, and mental health, and coordinate care with pediatric endocrinology, surgery, and psychology as indicated [^113mP7jc] [^1138Pz6h].

Labile blood glucose with elevated cortisol in a 15-year-old female most often reflects **Cushing syndrome** (endogenous or exogenous) [^1137NcU9] or **stress hyperglycemia** from acute illness, anxiety, or poor sleep [^1129BeBr] [^116qN3Dp]. Other causes include **PCOS with insulin resistance** [^112YxnCf], medication effects (glucocorticoids, atypical antipsychotics) [^112GEMbd], and rare causes such as insulinoma or MEN1 [^112cT1ED]. Evaluate with a 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test [^1137NcU9], midnight salivary cortisol [^116RNyU7], and ACTH to distinguish ACTH-dependent from ACTH-independent causes; add abdominal/pelvic imaging if Cushing syndrome is confirmed. Management targets the underlying cause, with insulin or metformin for glycemic control and endocrinology referral for definitive therapy [^notfound].

## Physiological mechanisms linking cortisol and glucose metabolism

Cortisol increases hepatic gluconeogenesis, reduces peripheral glucose uptake, and promotes lipolysis and proteolysis, thereby raising blood glucose [^notfound]. Chronic hypercortisolism leads to **persistent hyperglycemia**, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome [^113mP7jc].

## Differential diagnosis for labile blood glucose and elevated cortisol in adolescents

| **Category** | **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Diagnostic tests** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Endocrine disorders | Cushing syndrome | - Central obesity <br/> - Striae <br/> - Hypertension <br/> - Menstrual irregularity <br/> - Growth retardation | - 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test [^1137NcU9] <br/> - Midnight salivary cortisol [^117Pi55f] <br/> - ACTH levels <br/> - MRI pituitary/adrenal imaging [^116VGokL] [^114qqSEF] |
| Stress-related hyperglycemia | Acute illness <br/> Anxiety <br/> Poor sleep | - Transient hyperglycemia <br/> - Normal cortisol diurnal rhythm | - Clinical history <br/> - Normal suppression tests [^notfound] |

## Clinical evaluation and diagnostic approach

### Step 1: confirm hyperglycemia and characterize glucose variability

Confirm hyperglycemia with fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) or frequent self-monitoring to assess variability [^114gBqCp]. Also obtain a **clinical history** detailing symptoms, menstrual history, medication use, and family history of endocrine disorders [^114DJWzk].

---

### Step 2: confirm hypercortisolism and determine etiology

- **1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test**: Suppression < 1.8 µg/dL suggests Cushing syndrome [^1137NcU9] [^117Pi55f].
- **Midnight salivary cortisol**: Elevated on two occasions supports Cushing syndrome [^117Pi55f].
- **ACTH levels**: Low suggests adrenal source; normal/high suggests pituitary or ectopic source [^notfound].
- **MRI pituitary or adrenal imaging**: Localize tumor if ACTH-dependent or independent Cushing is confirmed [^notfound].

---

### Step 3: additional evaluations

Assess **insulin resistance** with fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and an OGTT when PCOS or metabolic syndrome is suspected [^notfound]. Screen for **other endocrine disorders** — thyroid dysfunction, prolactin, and androgens — as indicated [^116j8wzx].

---

## Management strategies

### General principles

Management focuses on **treating the underlying cause** of hypercortisolism, implementing dietary, exercise, and weight-management interventions, and using pharmacologic therapy — insulin or metformin — for glycemic control as needed [^112GEMbd].

---

### Specific interventions

- **Cushing syndrome**: Surgical resection of pituitary or adrenal tumor; medical therapy (ketoconazole, metyrapone, osilodrostat, mifepristone) if surgery is not feasible or as adjunctive therapy [^116VGokL] [^111HCyxg].
- **Stress-related hyperglycemia**: Address underlying stressors; short-term insulin therapy may be required during acute illness [^1129BeBr].
- **PCOS**: Lifestyle modification, metformin, and hormonal therapy (oral contraceptives) to manage insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism [^notfound].
- **Medication-induced hyperglycemia**: Adjust or discontinue offending medications if possible; initiate insulin or metformin as needed [^112GEMbd].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Prognosis depends on the **underlying cause** and the effectiveness of treatment. Successful treatment of Cushing syndrome typically improves glycemic control and reduces cardiovascular risk, though long-term monitoring for metabolic complications is essential [^113mP7jc]. Persistent hyperglycemia increases the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome, necessitating ongoing follow-up and management [^notfound].

---

Labile blood glucose with elevated cortisol in a 15-year-old female requires a **structured evaluation** to distinguish Cushing syndrome, stress-related hyperglycemia, PCOS, medication effects, and rare causes. Accurate diagnosis enables targeted therapy to improve glycemic control and reduce long-term metabolic risk.

### Child with suspected excessive cortisol production [^1137NcU9]. PES (2021). High credibility.

Child with suspected Cushing syndrome — laboratory evaluation includes an overnight dexamethasone suppression test in which a single dose of 1 mg of dexamethasone given close to 11 pm should suppress the AM cortisol to < 1.8 ug/dl (50 nmol/L), and a midnight salivary cortisol that is a good screening test to rule out Cushings. Additional laboratory testing lists low and high dose dexamethasone suppression test, a corticotrophin releasing hormone test, and a complete metabolic panel, complete blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), plus vitamin D levels, calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels; blood glucose can be elevated with possible glycosuria, frank diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance can develop in children with hypercortilism, hematological and immune dysfunction with cortisol stimulating erythropoiesis leading to polycythemia, lymphopenia and eosinopenia are common, and as cortisol affects vitamin D absorption in the intestines and increased loss of calcium from the kidneys there is often osteopenia/osteoporosis.

At 3.5 months, he was noted to have failure to thrive (weight z-score −0.91 and height z-score −1.5). Follow-up serum 17OHP and A4 concentrations revealed oversuppression of the HPA axis, and PRA was not elevated (Table 1). His hydrocortisone dose formulation was switched from suspension to tablet at a dose of 0.83 mg administered every 8 hours at 7 Am, 3 Pm, and 11 Pm for a total daily dose of 7.1 mg/m²/day. The manipulation of a 5 mg tablet to achieve the 0.83 mg dose was to split in half a scored 5 mg tablet and then further divide the 2.5 mg half-tablet into 3 more pieces. Multiple manipulations of the hydrocortisone tablet made it highly unlikely that accurate dosing was being achieved. Growth failure continued despite reversal of HPA axis oversuppression (Fig. 1), as evidenced by markedly increased 17OHP concentration (Table 1). Hydrocortisone regimen was changed to a quarter tablet (1.25 mg) 3 times a day for a total daily dose 9.3 mg/m²/day. At 14 months of age, parents reported he had random and frequent episodes of lethargy and irritability associated with blood glucose < 60 mg/dL (< 3.3 mmol/L) determined by glucometer, which his mother treated with 1.25 mg additional doses of hydrocortisone. 17OHP, A4, and PRA remained well controlled, and evaluation for other causes of hypoglycemia was unrevealing.

At 15 months of age, he presented for a second opinion due to continued growth failure and hypoglycemia. At that time, his height was at the 1st percentile (z-score −2.3), and weight was at the 5th percentile (z-score −1.7). Initial evaluation showed elevated 17OHP, prepubertal testosterone, and undetectable A4 concentrations (Table 1).

RESULTS

Baseline characteristics of study participants.

In this case-control study, a total of 162 children were enrolled (54 cases; 108 controls). Table 1 gives an overview of background characteristics of included children. The median age was 2.8 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.7–4.4). There were in total 61/162 (37.6%) female subjects, with 18/54 (33.3%) female subjects among cases versus 43/108 (39.3%) female subjects among controls. Most of the patients (122/162; 76.3%) presented with at least one severely deranged vital sign. More than half (96/162; 59.3%) of the study participants were enrolled at Zomba hospital. Background characteristics were distributed equally between cases and controls except for fasting for more than 8 hours prior to study inclusion, which was more common among cases than controls (Table 1). The median cortisol level was 58.9 µg/dL (1,623 nmol/L; IQR, 42.3–68.1 µg/dL) in cases and 40.9 µg/dL (1,092 nmol/L; IQR: 33.7–51.2 µg/dL) in controls (P = 0.834) (Table 3).

### Poor specificity of low growth hormone and cortisol levels during fasting hypoglycemia for the diagnoses of growth hormone deficiency and adrenal insufficiency [^1124vrJZ]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Fasting tests are used to identify the cause of hypoglycemia in children. The purposes of this study were to (1) determine whether growth hormone and cortisol levels obtained at the time of hypoglycemia in such tests can identify children with growth hormone and/or cortisol deficiency and (2) identify potential clinical factors that influence growth hormone and cortisol responses to hypoglycemia.

Study Design

The design consisted of chart review of all diagnostic fasting tests conducted over a 3-year period (n = 151). A normal growth hormone level was defined as ≥ 7.5 ng/mL, and a normal cortisol level was defined as ≥ 18 mug/dL.

Results

During the fasting tests, 84 children (median age: 1.3 years [2 days to 14.3 years]), became hypoglycemic, with blood glucose ≤ 50 mg/dL. Diagnoses included normal, ketotic hypoglycemia, hyperinsulinism, fatty acid-oxidation defects, glycogen-storage disease, and late dumping hypoglycemia. A total of 70% had growth hormone and cortisol levels less than the "normal" thresholds regardless of diagnosis. Of various factors (age, diagnosis, fast duration, duration blood glucose level of < 60 mg/dL, and blood glucose nadir), only age was positively associated with cortisol, and none were consistently related to growth hormone.

Conclusions

A singe low growth hormone or cortisol value at the time of fasting hypoglycemia has poor specificity for the respective diagnoses of growth hormone deficiency and adrenal insufficiency.

### Diagnosis of cyclic Cushing's disease manifests as early morning hyperglycemia in a patient with previously well-controlled type 1 diabetes [^116VGokL]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Background Cyclic Cushing's disease (CCD) is reported to occur in approximately 15% of patients with Cushing's disease (CD). CCD is a rare phenomenon in children. Case presentation A Portuguese female with well-controlled type 1 diabetes (T1DM) on an insulin pump developed transient uncontrolled blood sugar every morning. Increased basal and bolus insulin dosing was ineffective in lowering blood sugar and she began to miss school because of nausea, vomiting, fatigue, but no ketoacidosis. Therefore, other causes of sporadic hyperglycemia were explored. Multiple 6-h urinary free cortisol (UFC) samples revealed a spike in cortisol coincident with severe hyperglycemia. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 3.5 mm microadenoma and inferior petrosal sinus sampling of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) after corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation confirmed ACTH-dependent CD. Endoscopic endonasal tumor resection led to resolution of early morning hyperglycemia and symptoms. Discussion Our case illustrates an atypical presentation of CCD. There are no previous case reports of a pediatric patient with T1DM and CCD. Unexplained hyperglycemia in a patient with previous well-controlled T1DM should prompt assessment of other causes. CCD can be easily be missed if timed 6-h UFC measurements are not obtained.

### The association of low blood glucose and low serum cortisol levels in severely ill children admitted to tertiary referral hospitals in Malawi: a case-control study [^116QL8yM]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT.

Low blood glucose concentrations < 5 mmol/L in severely ill children presenting to hospitals in low-income countries are associated with mortality. Adrenal insufficiency with low cortisol levels may contribute to low blood glucose concentrations. Understanding the association between low cortisol and low blood glucose may assist in improving guidelines for management of severely ill children. The study aimed to determine the association between low serum cortisol and low blood glucose in severely ill children. A matched case-control study of children aged 1 month to 15 years was conducted at two tertiary hospitals in Malawi. Cases were children with blood glucose < 5 mmol/L. Two age-matched controls with blood glucose of ≥ 5–15 mmol/L were enrolled per case. Low cortisol was defined as serum cortisol of < 25 µg/dL (690 nmol/L) and adrenal insufficiency as serum cortisol of < 10 µg/dL (276 nmol/L). A total of 54 cases and 108 controls were enrolled with, median age of 2.8 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.7–4.4). The median cortisol level was 58.7 µg/dL (IQR: 42.3–61.8) in cases and 40.9 µg/dL (IQR: 33.7–51.2) in controls (P = 0.911). The proportion of low cortisol was 4/54 (7.4%) in cases and 9/108 (8.3%) in controls. Logistic regression shows no association between low cortisol and low blood glucose (adjusted odds ratio: 0.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.04–3.02). Results suggest that there is no association between low cortisol and low blood glucose among severely ill children presenting to hospitals in Malawi. The reason for low blood glucose needs further investigation.

A 15-year-old female presented to a pediatric emergency department with glycosuria, ketonuria, and hyperglycemia and was admitted with a presumed diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. The patient required no insulin therapy and only minor dietary modification to maintain euglycemia. Clinical examination and laboratory findings revealed a primary diagnosis of Graves' hyperthyroidism with associated impaired glucose tolerance. Here, we review the mechanisms of thyrotoxicosis resulting in impaired glucose metabolism.

### Recommendations from the Pediatric Endocrine Society for evaluation and management of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates, infants, and children [^114Dyv4q]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Neuroendocrine defenses and injury risk — The first defense against falling PG is suppression of insulin secretion when PG falls below the normal postabsorptive mean of ~85 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L); a further reduction to 65–70 mg/dL (3.6–3.9 mmol/L) elicits glucagon secretion and activation of the sympathoadrenal system, and at a PG concentration < 65 mg/dL (3.6 mmol/L), plasma cortisol and growth hormone levels increase; because the brain has only a few minutes worth of stored fuel reserves, interruption of glucose delivery can have devastating consequences and severe and prolonged hypoglycemia can cause permanent brain injury.

Patients and Methods

The proband (Figure 1 A, II:2) was born by normal vaginal delivery after an uneventful pregnancy with a birth weight of 3130 g. He had an unremarkable first year of life, attaining developmental milestones appropriately, although his mother commented retrospectively that she had noted increasing pigmentation from about 6 months of age. At 12 months of age, after a gastrointestinal illness, he was found comatose by his father. Upon presentation, venous blood glucose level was 0.6 mmol/L (normal range [NR], 3.0–5.4 mmol/L), cortisol level was 560 nmol/L (NR, 138–635 nmol/L), sodium was low at 125 mmol/L (NR, 134–146 mmol/L), and potassium was normal at 4.7 mmol/L (NR, 3.4–5.0 mmol/L). A presumptive diagnosis of ketotic hypoglycemia secondary to gastroenteritis was made. At 21 months of age, subsequent to a brief history of viral upper respiratory tract symptoms, the proband was once again found unresponsive with hypoglycemia (serum blood glucose, 1.4 mmol/L). Endocrine evaluation indicated adrenal insufficiency with low cortisol, 30 nmol/L; elevated plasma ACTH, 492 pmol/L (NR, 2.2–13.3 pmol/L); slightly low serum aldosterone, 192 pmol/L (NR, 300–500 pmol/L for age 1 wk to 2 y); suppressed renin, 2.2 mU/L (NR, 5–100 mU/L for age 1 wk to 2 y), and appropriately suppressed insulin, < 2 mU/L. The child had hyperpigmentation of the skin and gums (Figure 1 B). Glucocorticoid deficiency was diagnosed, and hydrocortisone therapy commenced.

### Impaired glucose tolerance and elevated blood pressure in low birth weight, nonobese, young South African adults: early programming of cortisol axis [^115SGFAt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2000). Low credibility.

Low birth weight is associated with increased cardiovascular and metabolic disorders in adult life, although the mechanisms of this effect remain uncertain. There is one report of increased morning plasma cortisol levels in an elderly low birth weight cohort, but whether this is primary or secondary to other aspects of the phenotype is unclear. We investigated the association between low birth weight and glucose intolerance, blood pressure, and dyslipidemia in young, nonobese adults from a community undergoing the health transition with a high prevalence of both noncommunicable diseases and low birth weight. Additionally, we investigated whether altered basal and stimulated cortisol levels as a marker of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal responsiveness or cortisol metabolism were associated with low birth weight in these young adults. Twenty-year-old, historically disadvantaged, urbanized South Africans (n = 137) with birth weights either below the 10th percentile [underweight for age (UFA)] or between the 25th and 75th percentiles [appropriate for gestational age (AFA)] had anthropometry, blood pressure, lipid levels, and glucose tolerance measured. In a subset (n = 62), 0900 h plasma cortisol concentrations, cortisol responses to 1 microg ACTH, and urinary glucocorticoid metabolites were measured. The mothers of UFA infants were themselves lighter and had a lower body mass index (P: = 0. 0016). At age 20 yr, although the UFA group was still smaller and lighter, with a lower body mass index, they had higher fasting plasma glucose levels (P: = 0.047), and a greater proportion demonstrated glucose intolerance (11.9% vs. 0%; P: < 0.01). The UFA group also had higher systolic [UFA, 126.0 ± 13.3 (± SD); AFA, 122.0 ± 11.7 mm Hg; P: = 0.007] and diastolic (72.3 ± 8.4 vs. 69. 5 ± 8.7 mm Hg; P: = 0.02) blood pressures, after covarying for current weight and gender. Plasma cortisol levels determined at 0900 h were higher in the UFA group (484.9 ± 166.3 vs. 418.6 ± 160.6 nmol/L) and showed a greater plasma cortisol response to low dose ACTH stimulation (area under the curve for cortisol: UFA, 77,238 ± 19,511; AFA, 66,597 ± 16,064 nmol/L.min; P: = 0.04). In conclusion, the link between low birth weight and adult glucose intolerance and blood pressure elevation occurs in young adults in a high risk, disadvantaged population despite a lack of full catch-up growth. Moreover, cortisol axis activation is an early feature in the process linking low birth weight with adult cardiovascular and metabolic disease and is not dependent upon adult obesity or full catch-up growth, at least in this population undergoing the health transition.

5.1 Alterations in Endocrine Function

Corticosteroids, such as AGAMREE, can cause serious and life-threatening alterations in endocrine function, especially with chronic use. Monitor patients receiving AGAMREE for Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and adrenal insufficiency after AGAMREE withdrawal. In addition, patients with hypopituitarism, primary adrenal insufficiency or congenital adrenal hyperplasia, altered thyroid function, or pheochromocytoma may be at increased risk for adverse endocrine events.

Risk of Adrenal Insufficiency Following Withdrawal

AGAMREE produces reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, with the potential for the development of secondary adrenal insufficiency after withdrawal. Acute adrenal insufficiency can occur if AGAMREE is withdrawn abruptly, and could be fatal. The degree and duration of adrenocortical insufficiency produced is variable among patients and depends on the dose and duration of therapy.

The risk of adrenal insufficiency is reduced by gradually tapering the dose when withdrawing treatment. The insufficiency may persist, however, for months after discontinuation of prolonged therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period of discontinuation, supplementation with a systemic corticosteroid is recommended. For patients already taking corticosteroids during times of stress, the dosage may need to be increased.

A steroid "withdrawal syndrome", seemingly unrelated to adrenocortical insufficiency, may also occur following abrupt discontinuance of corticosteroids. This syndrome includes symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, headache, fever, joint pain, desquamation, myalgia, and/or weight loss. These effects are thought to be due to the sudden change in corticosteroid concentration rather than too low corticosteroid levels.

Cushing's Syndrome

Cushing's syndrome (hypercortisolism) occurs with prolonged exposure to exogenous corticosteroids, including AGAMREE, and symptoms include hypertension, truncal obesity and thinning of the limbs, purple striae, facial rounding, facial plethora, muscle weakness, easy and frequent bruising with thin fragile skin, posterior neck fat deposition, osteopenia, acne, amenorrhea, hirsutism, and psychiatric abnormalities.

Hyperglycemia

Corticosteroids can increase blood glucose, worsen pre-existing diabetes, predispose those on long-term therapy to diabetes mellitus, and may reduce the effect of anti-diabetic drugs.

Monitor blood glucose at regular intervals in patients treated with AGAMREE. For patients with hyperglycemia, anti-diabetic treatment should be initiated or adjusted accordingly.

### Corticotropic axis drive of overnight cortisol secretion is suppressed in adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus [^1115KS7A]. Pediatric Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a pro-inflammatory stress state, which, with its attendant hyperglycemia, likely disrupts hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) control, further dysregulating glucose homeostasis.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that endogenous adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-cortisol dose-responsive drive, estimated analytically, is significantly accentuated in adolescents and young adults with T1DM compared with healthy individuals.

Design, Setting, Patients, and Interventions

This was a pilot study of 11 volunteers with T1DM and 10 controls, ages 16–30 yr, at a medical center. Subjects underwent overnight frequent blood sampling (every 10 min for ACTH and cortisol and every 60 min for blood glucose) from 10 pm to 8 am. T1DM volunteers maintained their home insulin regimen.

Main Outcomes

Deconvolution analysis and dose-response estimates were the key outcomes.

Results

Mean free cortisol, but not ACTH, concentrations were lower in the T1DM group compared with controls (p = 0.012). Non-invasive ACTH-cortisol dose-response estimates revealed that T1DM patients had reduced ACTH efficacy (maximal cortisol secretion, p = 0.009), reduced ACTH potency as quantified by greater EC50 (ACTH concentration driving half-maximal cortisol secretion, p = 0.04), and increased ACTH sensitivity (more positive ACTH-cortisol slope, p = 0.03). Post-hoc gender comparisons indicated that these differences were limited to females. Linear regression in women showed a strong correlation of both ACTH efficacy and EC50 with C-peptide levels (both p < 0.01).

Conclusion

Compared with healthy individuals, T1DM patients manifest decreased overnight adrenal responsiveness to endogenous ACTH leading to lower free cortisol concentrations. These findings suggest impaired stress-related adaptations of the HPA axis in T1DM.

Cushing's Syndrome

Cushing's syndrome (hypercortisolism) occurs with prolonged exposure to exogenous corticosteroids, including deflazacort. Symptoms include hypertension, truncal obesity and thinning of the limbs, purple striae, facial rounding, facial plethora, muscle weakness, easy and frequent bruising with thin fragile skin, posterior neck fat deposition, osteopenia, acne, amenorrhea, hirsutism and psychiatric abnormalities.

Hyperglycemia

Corticosteroids can increase blood glucose, worsen pre-existing diabetes, predispose those on long-term therapy to diabetes mellitus, and may reduce the effect of anti-diabetic drugs.

Monitor blood glucose at regular intervals. For patients with hyperglycemia, anti-diabetic treatment should be initiated or adjusted accordingly.

Considerations for Use in Patients with Altered Thyroid Function

Metabolic clearance of corticosteroids is decreased in hypothyroid patients and increased in hyperthyroid patients. Changes in thyroid status of the patient may necessitate a dose adjustment of the corticosteroid. When concomitant administration of corticosteroids and levothyroxine is required, administration of corticosteroid should precede the initiation of levothyroxine therapy to reduce the risk of adrenal crisis.

Pheochromocytoma Crisis

There have been reports of pheochromocytoma crisis, which can be fatal, after administration of systemic corticosteroids. In patients with suspected or identified pheochromocytoma, consider the risk of pheochromocytoma crisis prior to administering corticosteroids.

Testes evaluated using color Doppler Ultrasonography suggested microcalcifications. The epiphyseal line was unclosed, with a bone age 12.5 years (10 years later than the actual age), bone density T-score − 4.5 and Z-score − 4.5. The results of the cortisol rhythm test (Table 1) showed a significant increase in ACTH and a decrease in cortisol, consistent with adrenocortical hypofunction. The patient underwent a gonadorelin stimulation test (Gonadorelin injection 0.1 mg + saline 10 mL intravenously) and a gonadorelin extension test (Gonadorelin injection 0.1 mg + water injection 1 mL subcutaneously for 4 days, Gonadorelin injection 0.1 mg + saline 10 mL intravenously on the fifth day). The results (Table 2) suggested that the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad axis (HPG axis) was not activated. Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) stimulation test (Table 3) suggested that testicular stromal cells were present, but the level of testosterone was low. After obtaining the consent of the patient and his family, further genetic testing was performed on the patient and his mother. The patient's DAX-1 gene test result indicated that p.C202Sfs*62 was pathogenic, while his mother's indicated that she was a carrier of a heterozygous p.C202Sfs*62.

### Refractory hypoglycemia in a pediatric patient with desmoplastic small round cell tumor [^112cT1ED]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Background Tumor-induced hypoglycemia is a rare and serious complication that is usually a consequence of either excessive insulin secretion (insulinoma) or because of non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia (NICTH). NICTH is a rare phenomenon seen most often in adult patients. It is associated with different tumor types. Here, we report the first case to the best of our knowledge in the literature of a pediatric patient with NICTH associated with desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRT). Case presentation This is a 15-year-old girl who presented with symptomatic hypoglycemia and abdominal mass. She required an intravenous glucose infusion rate as high as 9 mg/kg/min in addition to glucose containing oral supplements in order to maintain her blood glucose above 60 mg/dL. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed multiple hepatic lesions with an intraperitoneal soft tissue mass which subsequently was diagnosed as DSRT. When the blood glucose was 45 mg/dL, the insulin, growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels were suppressed with an appropriate elevation of cortisol. Subsequently, an insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF-2) level was sent and the IGF-2:IGF-1 ratio was found to be elevated > 10 consistent with NICTH. After the first dose of chemotherapy, hypoglycemia improved, and she was weaned off glucose containing fluids. Conclusions NICTH should be considered in all cancer patients regardless of their age with refractory hypoglycemia.

### Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia associated with possible hypopituitarism in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [^112owSUh]. Endocrine Practice (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe endocrine dysfunctions associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

Methods

We present a case report, discuss the laboratory findings, and suggest potential contributing factors in this complex milieu.

Results

A 44-year-old man infected with HIV was admitted with loss of consciousness after a grand mal seizure and was found to have a prolonged course of hypoglycemia in conjunction with increased serum levels of insulin and C peptide. Iatrogenic hypoglycemia was excluded by laboratory evaluations. Hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction was suspected because the serum growth hormone and cortisol concentrations during hypoglycemia were low. Radiologic evaluation of the brain revealed no structural abnormalities involving the hypothalamic-pituitary area. A normal cortisol response to adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation (cosyntropin, 250 mg) was documented on two occasions. The cause of the severe hypoglycemic episode and the possible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction in this patient is unknown.

Conclusion

Despite the complexity of endocrine disorders in HIV-infected patients, the course of the disease in this patient underscores the possibility that some of the endocrinologic changes may be reversible.

### Adrenal incidentaloma: a new cause of the metabolic syndrome? [^112sWQQC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

A number of patients with adrenal incidentaloma are exposed to a slight degree of cortisol excess resulting from functional autonomy of the adrenal mass (usually a cortical adenoma). At present, there are only scant data on the unwanted effects of this endocrine condition referred to as subclinical Cushing's syndrome. The aim of the present study was to look for some features of the metabolic syndrome in patients with incidental adrenal adenoma. Forty-one patients (9 men and 32 women) bearing adrenal incidentaloma with typical computed tomography features of cortical adenoma were studied. For both patients and controls, exclusion criteria were age equal to 70 yr or greater, previous history of fasting hyperglycemia, or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), severe hypertension, current use of medication or concomitant relevant illnesses, and body mass index (BMI) equal to 30 kg/m(2) or greater. Forty-one patients with euthyroid multinodular goiter accurately matched for sex, age, and BMI served for a 1:1 case-control analysis. The study design included an oral glucose tolerance test (75 g) and an endocrine workup aimed at the study of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Age and BMI were fully comparable between patients (54.0 ± 10.7 yr, 23.8 ± 2.4 kg/m(2)) and controls (52.2 ± 11.6 yr, 23.5 ± 2.8 kg/m(2)). Fasting glucose and fasting insulin levels were not different between the two groups (4.96 ± 0.61 mmol/liter vs. 4.88 ± 0.58 mmol/liter; 67 ± 34 pmol/liter vs. 59 ± 32 pmol/liter), but the 2-h postchallenge glucose was significantly higher in patients than in controls (7.43 ± 2.49 mmol/liter vs. 6.10 plus minus 1.44 mmol/liter, P = 0.01). Fifteen patients (36%) reached the World Health Organization criteria for IGT and two other patients (5%) reached those for diabetes, and 14% of the controls qualified for IGT (P = 0.01). No difference in the lipid pattern was seen between the two groups, but either systolic or diastolic blood pressure were higher in patients (135.4 ± 15.5 mm Hg vs. 125.0 ± 15.6 mm Hg, P = 0.003; 82.9 ± 9.1 mm Hg vs. 75.3 ± 6.6 mm Hg, P < 0.0001). We calculated the whole-body insulin sensitivity index derived from the oral glucose tolerance test that was significantly reduced in the patients (4.3 ± 1.7 vs. 5.7 ± 2.5, P = 0.01). In a multiple regression analysis, 2-h glucose was associated with BMI and midnight cortisol values (r(2) = 0.36, P = 0.002). The comparison of the patients with nonfunctioning adenoma (n = 29) with those with subclinical Cushing's syndrome (n = 12) yielded significant differences as to 2-h glucose and triglyceride levels, which were significantly higher in the second group (7.02 ± 1.76 mmol/liter vs. 8.72 ± 3.17 mmol/liter, P = 0.03; 1.06 ± 0.4 mmol/liter vs. 1.73 ± 0.96 mmol/liter, P = 0.002), but the insulin sensitivity index was conversely reduced (5.2 ± 1.4 vs. 2.9 ± 1.2, P < 0.0001). In conclusion, many patients with incidental adrenal adenoma display altered glucose tolerance, that may be explained by reduced insulin sensitivity, and increased blood pressure levels in comparison with carefully age- and BMI-matched controls. The slight hypercortisolism observed in some such patients may significantly contribute to this state of insulin resistance. Midnight serum cortisol appears as a sensitive marker of the metabolic effects of subclinical Cushing's syndrome.

### A 3-year-old girl with Graves' disease with hypoglycemia following transient adrenal hyporesponsiveness [^111kY3U5]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

A 3-year-old girl with Graves' disease developed a generalized convulsion as a result of hypoglycemia (25 mg/dL). At the time of the hypoglycemic seizure, her plasma adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) level (1460 pg/mL) was extremely high, but her serum cortisol level (28.4 microg/dL) was relatively low given the severe stress. The cortisol-releasing hormone (CRH) provocation test done after thyroid function had improved revealed normal ACTH and cortisol responses. Since there was no other cause of hypoglycemia, such as hyperinsulinemia, long-term starvation, suddenly advanced emaciation, or prolonged fasting, it was suspected that the transient adrenal hyporesponsiveness was the main cause of hypoglycemia.

A 62-year-old woman presented with an 11-month history of worsening nasal symptoms of rhinorrhoea, anosmia, nasal congestion and intermittent epistaxis. MRI revealed a large mass in the upper nasal vault. Biopsy of the mass revealed an olfactory neuroblastoma. While waiting resection, she acutely developed severe proximal muscle weakness, lethargy and lower extremity oedema. Blood glucose was elevated, and hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis was noted. Elevated serum cortisol level of 95.7 µg/dL (8.7–22.4 µg/dL) and markedly elevated 24-hour urinary cortisol level of 6962.3 µg/24hours (4.0–50.0 µg/24hours) with concurrent adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level of 171pg/mL (6–58pg/mL) were suggestive of an ACTH-dependent source of hypercortisolism. A subsequent positive high-dose dexamethasone suppression test was consistent with ectopic ACTH production. She underwent near-total resection of the right nasal mass followed by radiotherapy, resulting in complete resolution of signs and symptoms of cortisol excess.

### Deflazacort oral (deflazacort oral suspension) [^112NV8Nf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

A steroid "withdrawal syndrome", seemingly unrelated to adrenocortical insufficiency, may also occur following abrupt discontinuance of corticosteroids. This syndrome includes symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, headache, fever, joint pain, desquamation, myalgia, and/or weight loss. These effects are thought to be due to the sudden change in corticosteroid concentration rather than to low corticosteroid levels.

Cushing's Syndrome

Cushing's syndrome (hypercortisolism) occurs with prolonged exposure to exogenous corticosteroids, including deflazacort oral suspension. Symptoms include hypertension, truncal obesity and thinning of the limbs, purple striae, facial rounding, facial plethora, muscle weakness, easy and frequent bruising with thin fragile skin, posterior neck fat deposition, osteopenia, acne, amenorrhea, hirsutism and psychiatric abnormalities.

Hyperglycemia

Corticosteroids can increase blood glucose, worsen pre-existing diabetes, predispose those on long-term therapy to diabetes mellitus, and may reduce the effect of anti-diabetic drugs.

Monitor blood glucose at regular intervals. For patients with hyperglycemia, anti-diabetic treatment should be initiated or adjusted accordingly.

Considerations for Use in Patients with Altered Thyroid Function

Metabolic clearance of corticosteroids is decreased in hypothyroid patients and increased in hyperthyroid patients. Changes in thyroid status of the patient may necessitate a dose adjustment of the corticosteroid. When concomitant administration of corticosteroids and levothyroxine is required, administration of corticosteroid should precede the initiation of levothyroxine therapy to reduce the risk of adrenal crisis.

Pheochromocytoma Crisis

There have been reports of pheochromocytoma crisis, which can be fatal, after administration of systemic corticosteroids. In patients with suspected or identified pheochromocytoma, consider the risk of pheochromocytoma crisis prior to administering corticosteroids.

### Treatment of Cushing's syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113mP7jc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Cushing's syndrome (CS) — metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk after treatment: Metabolic syndrome is present in at least two-thirds of patients with CS and contributes to cardiovascular morbidity. After successful treatment, weight, fat mass, and blood pressure improve and reversal of hypertension usually occurs within weeks to a year; however, excess weight and hypertension may persist in up to 25% of patients. Glucose and lipid metabolism improve, but the prevalence of diabetes and dyslipidemia remains increased compared to BMI-matched controls several years after remission. Fasting blood glucose may underdiagnose diabetes mellitus compared to an oral glucose tolerance test, and clinicians should carefully monitor adult patients treated with GH replacement for diabetes mellitus. There is increased long-term risk of myocardial infarction, and because hypertension and diabetes are main controllable determinants of cardiovascular events and mortality, rigorous and repeated long-term follow-up evaluation and treatment of these conditions are mandatory.

### Long-term follow-up guidelines for survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancers [^115B14Wo]. PES (2023). High credibility.

Radiation — impaired glucose metabolism/Diabetes mellitus: Screening is Fasting blood glucose OR HbA1c every 2 years. Health links include Nutrition and Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Risk Factors, with counseling on obesity-related health risks. Potential considerations for further testing and intervention are Endocrine consultation, evaluation for other co-morbid conditions including dyslipidemia, hypertension, and overweight/obesity, and referral to a dietitian for blood sugar management. Impaired glucose metabolism may occur as part of metabolic syndrome, whose definitions generally include central (abdominal) obesity and ≥ 2 of elevated blood pressure, atherogenic dyslipidemia (elevated triglycerides, reduced HDL cholesterol), and abnormal glucose metabolism; patients who received TBI may develop features of metabolic syndrome without associated obesity. Risk assessment should consider patient factors (family history of diabetes mellitus, pregnancy), cancer/treatment factors (prolonged corticosteroid therapy, e.g., for cGVHD), and pre-morbid/co-morbid medical conditions (obesity).

### Detection of surreptitious administration of analog insulin to an 8-week-old infant [^1164aVYg]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

An 8-week-old infant presented to the emergency department with lethargy, tachycardia, and a blood glucose concentration of 1.8 mmol/L. After admission, hypoglycemia recurred on 3 additional occasions. Initial urinalysis results were negative for ketones, and the results of additional laboratory tests did not support the diagnosis of cortisol or growth hormone deficiency, oral hypoglycemic ingestion, or an inborn error of metabolism. Difficulty restoring and maintaining glucose concentrations along with a transient response to glucagon during 1 hypoglycemic episode suggested hyperinsulinism. In 1 hypoglycemic episode, elevated insulin and low C-peptide concentrations suggested exogenous insulin administration, but 2 subsequent blood samples obtained during hypoglycemia contained appropriately decreased concentrations of insulin. The insulin immunoassay initially used in this case (Roche ElecSys/cobas [Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN]) was insensitive to insulin analogs. Two additional immunoassays, 1 with intermediate (Immulite [Siemens, Deerfield, IL]) and 1 with broad (radioimmunoassay [Millipore, Inc, Billerica, MA]) reactivity to insulin analogs were used to characterize insulin in each of the critical blood samples. Samples obtained during hypoglycemia displayed a graded reactivity similar to that observed in type 1 diabetic patients prescribed insulin analogs, whereas a sample obtained from the patient and a control subject during euglycemia showed equal reactivity among the 3 assays. These data suggested administration of insulin analog to the child, and further characterization of insulin by using tandem mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of Humalog. The child was subsequently placed in foster care with no further recurrence of hypoglycemia.

### Novelgene mutation associated with SHORT syndrome: a case report of a 15-year-old female [^113Gf6qD]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To present the clinical journey and management of a 15-year-old female with SHORT syndrome, highlighting the diagnostic challenges and the novel genetic mutation identified.

Case Presentation

A 15-year-old Filipino female was initially seen in a dermatology clinic at 9 years old for axillary skin darkening, indicative of acanthosis nigricans. Early evaluations revealed elevated blood glucose levels, resulting in a pediatric diabetes diagnosis without the usual hyperglycemic symptoms. Her medical history was notable for premature birth, intrauterine growth restriction, a cardiac murmur from patent ductus arteriosus and a bicuspid aortic valve, delayed teething, and distinct dysmorphic features. Genetic testing identified a novel PIK3R1 gene mutation. Treatment with metformin significantly improved her glycemic control and lipid profiles. The patient also displayed delayed puberty and polycystic ovary syndrome-like symptoms, but growth hormone deficiency was excluded. Endocrine evaluation for her short stature and lipodystrophy confirmed the presence of the PIK3R1 mutation.

Conclusions

This case highlights the importance of thorough endocrine and genetic evaluations in patients with complex clinical presentations like SHORT syndrome. The identification of a novel PIK3R1 gene mutation expands the understanding of the genetic basis of this syndrome and underscores the need for individualized treatment approaches.

### Novel de novo mutation in sulfonylurea receptor 1 presenting as hyperinsulinism in infancy followed by overt diabetes in early adolescence [^1159yGSo]. Diabetes (2008). Low credibility.

CASE REPORT

A female aged 10.5 years presented with fasting hyperglycemia (12.2 mmol/l), obesity (BMI 30.2 kg/m 2), and aggressive behavior. She was the last born of nonconsanguineous Palestinian parents and has seven older, healthy siblings. Both parents developed type 2 diabetes during their 5th decade of life. Her birth weight was significantly large (4,950 g) despite a normal gestational oral glucose tolerance test. From the 2nd day of life until age 3 years, she had recurrent hypoglycemic convulsions (blood glucose 1.9–2.7 mmol/l) that were initially treated by intravenous glucose infusions and later by administration of sweet drinks at home. Hypoglycemia was not documented after age 3 years, but convulsions were never adequately controlled despite antiepileptic treatment (carbamazepine, hydantoin). Electroencephalogram at age 1 year revealed diffuse epileptic activity, while brain computed tomography scan was normal. Despite normal developmental milestones, her current school performance is poor, and she behaves aggressively and uses insulting words. Her menarche was at age 10 years. Hyperphagia and obesity have been a concern since early childhood.

Except for few pink striae on the abdomen, her physical exam was unremarkable for a fully pubertal adolescent. Laboratory investigations showed a blood glucose level of 12.2 mmol/l, moderate glucosuria, and undetectable anti-GAD (< 1.0 μ/ml) and anti-insulin autoantibodies. Thyroid function tests and prolactin were normal, and a mildly elevated urinary free cortisol (299 nmol/24 h; normal < 250 nmol/24 h) was easily suppressed by 90% to 37.5 nmol/24 h after 1 day of 0.5 mg dexamethasone every 6 h. Neurological evaluation, electroencephalogram, and brain magnetic resonance imaging were normal. Hydantoin replacement by topiramate achieved better epileptic control.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^112YxnCf]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — evaluation of markedly elevated androgens: If androgen levels are markedly above laboratory reference ranges, causes of hyperandrogenaemia other than PCOS, including ovarian and adrenal neoplastic growths, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing's syndrome, ovarian hyperthecosis (after menopause), iatrogenic causes, and syndromes of severe insulin resistance, should be considered. The guideline further notes that some androgen-secreting neoplasms are associated with only mild to moderate increases in androgen levels, and that the clinical history of time of onset and/or rapid progression of symptoms is critical in assessing for an androgen-secreting tumour.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114aoQnR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Dynamic tests for diagnosing suspected hypopituitarism — adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) axis assessment includes insulin tolerance and corticotropin (ACTH 1–24, cosyntropin) stimulation with assay-dependent cortisol cutoffs. In insulin tolerance testing, administer insulin, 0.05–0.15 U/kg iv, with the expected normal response that glucose should drop < 40 mg/dL (2.2 mmol/L) and peak cortisol should be > 500–550 nmol/L (> 18.1–20 µg/dL) depending on assay. For the standard-dose corticotropin test, administer ACTH 1–24 (cosyntropin), 250 µg im or iv with cortisol sampled at 0, 30, and 60 min, and cortisol should be at 30 or 60 min > 500–550 nmol/L (> 18.1–20 µg/dL) depending on assay. For the low-dose corticotropin test, administer ACTH 1–24 (cosyntropin), 1 µg iv with samples at 0 and 30 min, and cortisol should be at 30 min > 500 nmol/L (18.1 µg/dL) depending on assay.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112mCgMV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency — acute adrenal crisis management includes immediate fluids and stress-dose glucocorticoids: rapid infusion of 1000 mL isotonic saline within the first hour or 5% glucose in isotonic saline, followed by continuous iv isotonic saline guided by individual patient needs; hydrocortisone 100 mg iv immediately followed by hydrocortisone 200 mg/d as a continuous infusion for 24 h, reduced to hydrocortisone 100 mg/d the following day. In children, give a rapid bolus of normal saline (0.9%) 20 mL/kg, which can be repeated up to a total of 60 mL/kg within 1 h for shock, and hydrocortisone 50–100 mg/m² bolus followed by hydrocortisone 50–100 mg/m²/d divided q 6 h. For hypoglycemia, use dextrose 0.5–1 g/kg of dextrose or 2–4 mL/kg of D25W (maximum single dose 25 g) infused slowly at rate of 2 to 3 mL/min; alternatively, 5–10 mL/kg of D10W for children < 12 y old, with cardiac monitoring and rapid tapering and switch to oral regimen depending on clinical state.

Results

Anthropometric and metabolic phenotypes of all groups

The final dataset included 406 participants, aged 4 to 18 years (198 male, 208 female). A total of 29 subjects were excluded because they did not satisfy inclusion criteria (15 with difficult blood sampling, 5 with a low birth weight, 4 with hypothyroidism in thyroiditis, and 5 treated with glucocorticoids in the last 6 months). Other exclusions were two subjects diagnosed with late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia, eight with distress during BP monitoring, and five who refused the dexamethasone test. A total of 31 out of 406 subjects had the dexamethasone test and showed correct inhibition of cortisol levels (all < 27.59 µg/dl), so Cushing's syndrome was excluded. We performed 24-h urine sampling for free cortisol measurement, but this was incomplete in 20 out of 31 patients.

ACTH levels were higher in Tanner 4 to 5 stage participants (P < 0.001) and in 14.0 to 15.9-year-olds (P < 0.01) in males than in females, and this was also the case in the analysis corrected for BMISDS (or BMI) and HOMA-IR. Cortisol levels were higher in Tanner 4 to 5 stage participants than in Tanner 1 stage participants for the whole group (P < 0.02), and in females (P < 0.02); this was also the case in the corrected analysis for BMISDS and HOMA-IR (Figure 1).

Cortisol levels were higher in the Tanner 4 to 5 stages than the Tanner 1 stage in the whole group (P < 0.02*) and in females (P < 0.02*). ACTH levels were higher in Tanner 4 to 5 stages (P < 0.001*) and in 14.0 to 15.9 years (P < 0.01*) in males than in females. Significance was maintained when the model included body mass index (BMI) (or BMI standard deviation score (BMISDS)) and homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) as covariates. *Indicates significance of analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) analysis.

### Unmasked insulinoma occasioned by severe hypoglycemic coma immediately postpartum: a case report [^113XnJzT]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

The patient was a 40-year-old woman. She has no family history of endocrine disease, including hyperparathyroidism, pituitary adenoma and pancreatic gastrointestinal endocrine tumors. She was married at age 31, started fertility treatment at age 35 and became pregnant at age 39 by in vitro fertilization. During the 3 rd month of pregnancy, she had difficulty consuming meals due to hyperemesis gravidarum; she was treated in the emergency room of her nearby hospital after she was found unconscious at home. Upon arrival at the hospital, her plasma glucose level was 36 mg/dL. Because her symptoms disappeared soon after an intravenous glucose infusion, she was discharged from the emergency room without further investigation of the cause of the hypoglycemic episode. Afterward, she had no hypoglycemic coma, abnormalities of plasma glucose or significant body weight gain in regular checkups during the pregnancy. No abnormalities were noted in the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test performed at week 33 of pregnancy (Plasma glucose levels: 0 min, 60 mg/dL, 60 min, 100 mg/dL and 120 min, 138 mg/dL). Because the baby was in breech position near the due date, she underwent caesarean section at week 38 of pregnancy and gave birth to a healthy child with body weight of 2,595 g. She had no complications associated with the caesarean section; she began eating meals 2 days after the operation. However, she was found unconscious in her home early in the morning 3 days after the operation. Her point-of-care blood glucose level was 16 mg/dL; her symptoms disappeared soon after an intravenous glucose infusion. She was then referred to an endocrinologist in the same hospital, who undertook further investigation of the hypoglycemic episode. isCGM revealed frequent nocturnal hypoglycemic episodes. She was negative for insulin autoantibodies and her cortisol level in the early morning was 38.2 μg/dL (normal range, 4.5–21.1 μg/dL), which excluded the possibilities of insulin autoimmune syndrome and adrenal insufficiency as the cause. She was then hospitalized and subjected to a 72-h fasting test. The test was stopped 7 h after beginning because of her low plasma glucose level (30 mg/dL). Despite the low plasma glucose, her insulin (7.30 μU/mL: normal range, < 18.7 μU/mL) and C-peptide (1.97 ng/mL: normal range, 0.61–2.09 ng/mL) levels were inappropriately high, and the blood glucose level was increased to 109 mg /dL at 20 min after an intravenous glucagon infusion, all of which findings are consistent with insulinoma. However, CE-CT and EUS failed to detect responsible lesions in the pancreas. Consequently, she started receiving diazoxide 50 mg t.i.d. orally, which reduced the frequency of the hypoglycemic episodes, but she had difficulty with the drug due to the development of lower leg edema. She was therefore referred to our institution for further evaluation and treatment. Upon admission, her BMI was 25.4 kg/m 2 (height 153.2 cm; body weight 59.5 kg). She had no family history of diabetes or other endocrine disorders. Her serum insulin level (6.34 μU/mL) was relatively high compared to her plasma glucose level (67 mg/dL) (Table 1). No tumor was found in the pancreas by CE-CT, gadolinium enhanced magnetic-resonance imaging (Gd-MRI) or somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (Fig. 1). Thereafter, (SACST) in conjunction with computer tomography angiography, which visualizes the arteries feeding the pancreas, was performed to localize the responsible lesion after 3-day discontinuation of diazoxide. A significant increase in insulin level was observed, especially in the gastroduodenal and proximal splenic arteries, indicating localization of an insulin-secreting tumor in the pancreatic body and tail (Fig. 2). EUS was then performed on the pancreatic body and tail, revealing a 7-mm low-echoic mass in the pancreatic body (Fig. 3 A). Histological analysis of a specimen aspirated from the mass found it to be an insulin-secreting neuroendocrine tumor (NET, G1, according to WHO 2019) (Fig. 3 B). An open spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy was then performed under intraoperative ultrasound guidance. The operating time was 4 h and 15 min, and the blood loss was 155 ml. Intraoperative insulin measurements showed a rapid decline in serum insulin levels after the resection, indicating successful removal of the tumor (Fig. 4). The insulin-secreting tumor was 10-mm in diameter and consisted microscopically of atypical cells positive for chromogranin A, synaptophysin and insulin but negative for glucagon and somatostatin. Both the mitotic and Ki-67 indices were low, and the tumor was classified as NET, G1, according to the WHO 2019 criteria (Fig. 5). There were periods of fasting and administration of antibiotics due to abdominal pain and effusion in the pancreatic stump, and she was discharged on the 22 nd post operative day. After the operation, the patient showed no further symptoms of hypoglycemia.

### High-end normal adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol levels are associated with specific cardiovascular risk factors in pediatric obesity: a cross-sectional study [^114dx9pG]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The lack of association between BMI and cortisol was unexpected, particularly because an association was present for ACTH. However, a number of studies have failed to show an association. Similar to the lack of an association between BMI and plasma cortisol in the obese population, a lack of association between BMI or body fat levels and urinary free cortisol and free cortisone (in 24-h urine) has also been demonstrated in non-obese children. One explanation could be the homogenous population in terms of weight in our and other studies. However, it could be that ACTH is a better biomarker in childhood in relation to obesity and associated cardiovascular risk factors. Accordingly, major glucocorticoid metabolites in 24-h urine samples (reflecting ACTH-driven adrenocortical activity or cortisol secretion) were significantly associated with body fat in non-obese children. The latter findings, together with our cross-sectional study, suggest that adrenocortical activity (driven by ACTH) is related to body composition during growth whether children are lean/normal weight or obese. However, in this context it is important that higher body fat levels do not always imply higher total blood cortisol although ACTH is increased. ACTH can be increased and total circulating cortisol concomitantly reduced. However, also in children reduced cortisol blood levels are not uncommon in case of elevated body fat levels. Moreover, our paper and that of Reinehr and Andler indicate that children's total cortisol plasma levels are not necessarily reduced if body fat is higher. However, really elevated cortisol concentrations in obese children appear to emerge only if a marked insulin resistance is also present. Interestingly, we also observed changes in ACTH and cortisol levels at the last years and at the end of puberty. Healthy adults have higher blood cortisol levels than children. Adults also have clearly higher 24-h excretion rates of free cortisol and free cortisone after correction for body surface area than children. However 24-h excretion of free cortisol and free cortisone in healthy children up to an age of about 14 years is constant after body surface area correction. We showed in our obese cohort that cortisol rose in Tanner 4 to 5 stage participants, particularly in females. Conversely, ACTH was higher in males with respect to females in the same pubertal stage and at the age of 14.0 to 15.9 years in presence of still unmodified cortisol levels. These data, with respect to what age ACTH and cortisol start to increase, have to be considered in future works on cortisol in obese adolescents.

### Stress hyperglycemia as first sign of asymptomatic type 1 diabetes: an instructive case [^116PLypv]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Stress hyperglycemia (SH) is considered a transient manifestation and routine diagnostic evaluation was thought to be unnecessary due to the lack of definite correlation with diabetes mellitus (DM). Although SH was usually benign and long-term treatment was superfluous, it might be the first sign of insulinopenic status such as type 1 DM (T1DM).

Case Presentation

We reported a boy with acute asthma attack presented incidentally with high blood glucose levels exceeding 300mg/dL and obvious glycemic variability. A prolonged hyperglycemic duration of more than 48h was also noticed. To elucidate his unique situation, glucagon test and insulin autoantibody survey were done which showed insulinopenia with positive anti-insulin antibody and glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody despite the absence of overt DM symptoms and signs.

Conclusions

This case highlights that SH might be a prodromal presentation in T1DM children, especially when accompanied simultaneously with extreme hyperglycemia, apparent glucose variability, as well as prolonged hyperglycemic duration.

### Prenatal Cushing's syndrome secondary to nodular adrenocortical hyperplasia with unsuppressed plasma ACTH levels [^114qqSEF]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

We report a newborn girl (36th week of gestation, birth weight 1,054 g) with Cushing's syndrome secondary to nodular adrenocortical hyperplasia with normal plasma ACTH levels. From birth she was hypertensive, hyperglycaemic and slightly hirsuit. Hypercortisolaemia (> 1,380 nmol/l) was accompanied by normal plasma ACTH levels (8.64–23.9 pg/ml). A 48-h dexamethasone suppression test decreased plasma cortisol by 35%, indicating some degree of ACTH dependency. However, there was no ACTH rise on CRF test. MRI showed enlarged adrenal glands with a possible cyst on the right; the pituitary gland was normal. At the age of 6 weeks she underwent bilateral adrenalectomy. Histology showed enlarged adrenals with multiple non-pigmented nodules (up to 5 mm) in both glands. However, over the next few weeks she developed liver failure and sepsis. She died at the age of 3 months. Post mortem examination confirmed the diagnosis. Nodular adrenocortical hyperplasia may present at birth with severe Cushing's syndrome and unsuppressed ACTH levels, indicating some degree of ACTH dependency in this condition.

Laboratory examination revealed normal levels of electrolytes: potassium 3.9 mmol/L (normal, 3.5–5.3 mmol/L), and sodium 141 mmol/L (normal, 137–147 mmol/L). Serum cortisol (F) rhythms (00:00 h–08:00 h–16:00 h) were 3.24, 13.72, and 13.12 μg/dl (normal morning, 6.2–19.4 μg/dl; afternoon 2.3–11.9 μg/dl). ACTH rhythms were 313.5, 384.3, and 222.3 pg/ml (normal, 7.2–63.3 pg/ml), and 24 h urinary free cortisol levels were 316.16 μg/24 h (normal, 30–350 μg/24 h).17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) levels were 182.8 ng/ml which was much higher than normal (0.05–1.02 ng/ml). Androstenedione (AD) levels were > 10 ng/ml (normal, 0.30–3.30 ng/ml), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) was 4.12 ng/ml (normal, 0.80–10.50 ng/ml), and T was 4.03 ng/ml (normal, 0.06–0.82 ng/ml) (Table 1). A glucose tolerance test showed that blood sugar levels were normal, but an insulin release test revealed that the peak of insulin secretion exceeded the basic value by 10 times (Table 2). Adrenal computed tomography showed an increased bilateral adrenal volume with nodular processes (Fig. 2).

### A characteristic reactive hypoglycemia induced by rapid change of eating behavior in anorexia nervosa: a case report [^112fhNXU]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The relationship among reactive hypoglycemia, corresponding insulin metabolism, and eating behavior in anorexia nervosa (AN) has not been well documented.

Method

A 22-year-old woman with AN was admitted to Kagoshima University Hospital. An oral glucose tolerance test was performed with additional sampling at 15 minutes on the seventh hospital day when her daily caloric intake rapidly increased, reaching 2,000kcal perday.

Results

An elevated level of insulin secretion (1,190pmol/L) was observed during the very early phase (15 minutes) after glucose load, whereas corresponding blood glucose elevations were not as high (1.2mmol/L). The patient experienced asymptomatic hypoglycemia (2.1mmol/L).

Conclusions

Our findings suggested that a rapid increase of energy intake might cause reactive hypoglycemia with characteristic insulin metabolism, that is, an elevated level of insulin secretion during the very early phase.

Secondary hypertension — rare etiologies (Table 10) outlines diagnostic clues, screening, and confirmatory tests as follows: Aortic coarctation (undiagnosed or repaired) has prevalence 0.1% and occurs in a young adult with hypertension (age < 30 y) with BP higher in upper extremities than in lower extremities; screening uses echocardiogram and confirmation uses thoracic and abdominal CT angiogram or magnetic resonance arteriography. Cushing syndrome (< 0.1%) shows central obesity with wide (1 cm) violaceous striae; screening is an overnight 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test and confirmation includes 24-h urinary free cortisol excretion (preferably multiple) or midnight salivary cortisol. Primary hyperparathyroidism is rare with hypercalcemia; screening is serum calcium and confirmation is serum parathyroid hormone. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is rare with hypertension and hypokalemia and signs of virilization or incomplete masculinization; screening shows hypertension and hypokalemia with low or normal aldosterone and renin, and confirmatory testing notes 11-beta-OH: elevated DOC, 11-deoxycortisol, and androgens; 17-alpha-OH: decreased androgens and estrogen but elevated DOC and corticosterone. Mineralocorticoid excess syndromes other than primary aldosteronism are rare with early-onset or resistant hypertension and hypokalemia or hyperkalemia; screening shows low aldosterone and renin and confirmation uses urinary cortisol metabolites and genetic testing. Acromegaly is rare with acral features; screening lists serum growth hormone 1 ng/mL during oral glucose load and confirmation lists elevated age- and sex-matched IGF-1 level and MRI scan of the pituitary.

### ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome with bilateral cortisol-secreting adrenal adenomas: a case report and review of literatures [^115s4ucc]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 55-year-old Chinese female was admitted to our hospital complaining of exertional dyspnea for more than 10 years. She had been developing truncal obesity and facial rounding over the past 2 years, without evidence of acne, hirsutism or wide purple striae. The patient had a family history of hypertension and was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years prior to admission, and she had been using irbesartan, metoprolol and nifedipine XR since then. She was also diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and prescribed with statins for 5 years. The patient reported no history of alcohol or drug abuse, in particular, no history of steroid use.

Physical examination on admission showed elevated blood pressure (164/104 mmHg) and normal heart rate (74 beats per minute). The patient's height, body weight and waist circumference were 156 cm, 51 kg and 88 cm, respectively, with a body mass index (BMI) of 20.96 kg/m². She had a plethoric moon-shaped face, centripetal obesity, buffalo hump, accompanied by ecchymosis and slight edema at both lower limbs. Neurological examination was unremarkable except for slight muscle weakness of the lower-extremities.

Routine laboratory examinations showed normal complete blood cell count and hepatorenal parameters, whereas the level of serum triglyceride was slightly elevated. The fasting plasma glucose level was 7.33 mmol/L, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 6.6% (Table 1). Endocrinological examinations showed that circadian rhythm of cortisol disappeared, and the level of ACTH was less than 1.00 ng/L (Table 2). Twenty-four-hour urine free cortisol (24 h UFC) elevated to 634.8μg/24 h (reference range: 20.26–127.55μg/24 h). The next morning (8 a.m.) serum cortisol level after an overnight 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test (DMST) was 787.5 nmol/L, indicated lack of normal suppression (Table 2). The diagnosis of ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome was therefore established.

### Homozygous nonsense and frameshift mutations of the ACTH receptor in children with familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD) are not associated with long-term mineralocorticoid deficiency [^111q5DGb]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Patient I:1 – c. 459_460insC resulting in p. I154fsX248

Patient I:1 presented with neonatal hepatitis and hypoglycaemia at day 3 of life. He was the second child of a consanguineous Kuwaiti family. His 8 years old brother was unaffected. He was treated for presumed sepsis and investigated for his neonatal hepatitis. He was found to have a high TSH and low FT 4 and diagnosed with hypothyroidism. Treatment was initiated with levothyroxine. There was a family history of thyroid disorders, with Hashimoto thyroiditis (father) and a paternal cousin with panhypopituitarism. He was reassessed at the age of 7 months and diagnosed with glucocorticoid deficiency and initiated on hydrocortisone treatment. Biochemical assessment revealed an undetectable serum cortisol level of < 30 nmol/l during a hypoglycaemic episode (blood glucose was 1.9 mmol/l). Plasma ACTH levels were elevated to 639 ng/l. Serum sodium was 132 mmol/l with a normal potassium level of 4.5 mmol/l. A short synacthen test showed no response to 1–24 ACTH, baseline cortisol was 21 nmol/l and peak of 10 nmol/l. Hyperpigmentation was noted and in hindsight parents had commented on his dark skin soon after birth. Adrenal and thyroid antibodies were negative. A diagnosis of FGD was considered at 5.9 years of age when he was reassessed at a separate centre. While on hydrocortisone replacement, plasma renin levels were deemed 'very high' during an admission for a glucagon stimulation test. This was considered to be due to an element of hypovolaemia during the test. Aldosterone levels were normal at 100 pmol/l (N.R. 100–450 pmol/l). Subsequent repeat renin levels performed while clinically well on treatment showed a PRA on the upper range of normal (4.5 pmol/ml/h; N.R. 2.8–4.5 pmol/ml/h). Further assessment at 10.8 years, while on hydrocortisone treatment the patient showed a persistently elevated plasma ACTH level of 7790 ng/l (N.R. < 50 ng/l), typical of FGD. Aldosterone level was low < 70 pmol/l, paired with a slightly high PRA of 6.7 pmol/ml/h, suggestive of a degree of mineralocorticoid deficiency. He remains well on hydrocortisone treatment 10.2 mg/m²/day. Mutational analysis of the MC2R revealed a homozygous insertion of a cytosine (C) at nucleotide positions 459–460. At a protein level this would result in a substitution of the isoleucine residue at amino acid position 154 by a histidine and subsequent frameshift leading to a nonsense sequence and premature termination of the receptor at position 248 (p. I154fsX248). Both parents were assessed and found to be heterozygous for the C nucleotide insertion.

Morning serum cortisol thresholds for recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis: If confirmation of recovery is desired, we recommend morning serum cortisol as the first test and consider values as a continuum. As a guide, we suggest recovery if cortisol is > 300 nmol/L or 10 µg/dL and glucocorticoids can be stopped safely; we suggest continuing the physiologic dose and repeating morning cortisol when results are between 150 nmol/L or 5 µg/dL and 300 nmol/L or 10 µg/dL; and we suggest continuing the physiologic dose and repeating morning cortisol after a few months when results are < 150 nmol/L or 5 µg/dL.

### Primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease: literature review and case report of a 6-year-old boy [^114rBPg2]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Cushing's syndrome is rare in childhood and is usually caused by a pituitary adenoma. Primary hyperfunction of adrenal glands is less frequent, particularly primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD). It occurs usually in children and adolescents, with female preponderance, while Cushing's disease has increased frequency in prepubertal males. A case of a 6-year-old boy is presented with isolated non-familiar PPNAD. The clinical pattern involved Cushingoid appearance, hypertension, virilization and depressive mood. Laboratory analyses showed loss of circadian rhythm of cortisol, undetectable adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, impaired fasting glucose, polycythemia and elevated white blood count (WBC). Radiology investigation revealed a slightly enlarged medial branch of the left adrenal gland and a normal right one, so a unilateral adrenalectomy was performed. Pathohistology described multiple dark brownish pigmented nodules of various sizes confined to the cortex. Contralateral adrenalectomy was done 3 months later. Follow-up of 3 years was uneventful, except for one adrenal crisis during an intercurrent respiratory illness.

Cabergoline — response, durability, dosing, and safety: Cabergoline is a dopamine agonist with high affinity for the dopamine receptor subtype 2 expressed by most corticotroph adenomas. In small studies, 30–40% of patients responded and maintained normal urinary free cortisol (UFC) after 2–3 years of cabergoline; however, the cortisol-lowering effect did not last in 29% of initial responders and serum prolactin did not predict long-term UFC response. Doses used were up to 7 mg orally per week, with a median of 3.5 mg/wk in one study and a mean of 2.1 mg/wk in the other, and systolic/diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, and insulin improved; tumor volume decreased or remained stable, and side effects were typical of dopamine agonists without reported adrenal insufficiency.

### Catabolism of fats and branched-chain amino acids in children with type 1 diabetes: association with glycaemic control and total daily insulin dose [^112EFEh7]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

As noted previously, there were no significant differences in metabolites between the young males and females in our cohort with T1D. This finding contrasts sharply with our previous studies of IR in adolescents with obesity: fasting levels of BCAA and products of BCAA catabolism were significantly higher in obese teenage boys than obese girls of similar age and BMI z‐score. It is likely that metabolic changes operative during sexual maturation explain the differences between the studies. Genetically engineered mouse models demonstrate that oestrogen increases insulin sensitivity and limits upper body fat deposition, while progesterone opposes these effects. Additionally, during puberty, total body fat content and subcutaneous fat deposition increase in girls, while body fat percentage declines and lean body mass increases in boys. Increases in body fat and reductions in lean mass are known to be associated with IR in adolescents and adults. However, other studies found no relationship between sex steroid levels and measures of carbohydrate metabolismor insulin sensitivityduring puberty. Although no differences between males and females were detected in our study, the BCAA levels in our patients were elevated compared to both lean and obese controls of older children in a prior studyand relatively comparable to levels found in older obese teenagers.

Elevated cortisol and inflammatory cytokines have previously been demonstrated in individuals with T1D in ketoacidosis and can induce proteolysis and muscle catabolism and reduce muscle protein synthesis. In the current study of stable and otherwise healthy children with T1D, the levels of cortisol and inflammatory cytokines were normal. Moreover, there were no significant differences in cortisol levels between males and females. Given that T1D has been associated with decreased skeletal muscle mass and impaired muscle function, further investigation into the relationship between skeletal muscle mass and IR is needed, as reduction in muscle is proposed to limit insulin‐dependent glucose uptake, leading to glucose intolerance.

Our study has some limitations. The sample size was small but provided adequate statistical power for our primary analysis. We used surrogate measures of insulin sensitivity; additional methods, including insulin and glucose clamps and iv and oral glucose tolerance tests, might have provided useful information regarding insulin secretion and tissue‐specific IR.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^112RBXX5]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — important considerations and stress precautions: The figure states that the proposed cortisol cut-offs are only a guide and may vary according to the cortisol assay used and local protocols, that they only apply to patients who are not under major stress, and that they do not apply to subjects with abnormal CBG and albumin. Footnotes add that exogenous glucocorticoid should not be reduced below the lower end of the physiologic replacement dose range; that some patients with cortisol values close to the proposed 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) cut-off may have suboptimal cortisol response when exposed to major stress, so clinicians should rely on clinical judgment, offer stress glucocorticoid coverage, and that dynamic testing may also be considered; and that some patients may develop glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms and may benefit from gradual tapering rather than abrupt discontinuation.

### A subnormal peak cortisol response to stimulation testing does not predict a subnormal cortisol production rate [^114zAdgF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

The decision to commence lifelong glucocorticoid replacement therapy is often based on a cortisol stimulation test. We investigated the relationship between the peak cortisol response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and daily cortisol production rate (CPR) to ascertain whether provocative tests are accurate in indicating the need to initiate lifelong glucocorticoid replacement.

Patients and Methods

Ten patients (five male; mean age, 44 ± 13 yr) with pituitary disease and with demonstrably suboptimal peak cortisol response (350–500 nmol/liter) to insulin-induced hypoglycemia, underwent CPR measurement by isotope dilution using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and 24-h urinary free cortisol (UFC).

Results

The median baseline and peak cortisol attained with hypoglycemia were 284 (164–323) and 473.5 (366–494) nmol/liter, respectively. A strong positive correlation was seen between peak stimulated cortisol and CPR (adjusted for body surface area) (r = 0.75; P = 0.02), and in all patients CPR [4.6 (2.9–15.1) mg/d x m(2)] was within the reference range (2.1–12 mg/d x m(2)) or elevated (one patient). A wide range was found for 24-h UFC [116.5 (20.5–265.9) nmol/liter] in this group of patients, and this parameter lacked significant correlation with either serum cortisol concentration or CPR.

Conclusion

This is the first study to demonstrate a significant correlation between CPR and peak cortisol values during hypoglycemic challenge. An inadequate cortisol response to hypoglycemia suggests the need for glucocorticoid cover at times of stress, but these data indicate that a suboptimal peak cortisol does not equate to a low CPR and should not be an automatic indication for lifelong glucocorticoid replacement therapy. UFC bears no relation to serum cortisol or CPR and is therefore unhelpful in assessment of such patients.

### Betamethasone valerate foam (betamethasone valerate) [^114zauNC]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

General

Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has caused reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on treatment.

Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings.

Therefore, patients applying a topical steroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid.

Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency may occur requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. For information on systemic supplementation, see prescribing information for those products.

Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. (See PRECAUTIONS-Pediatric Use .)

If irritation develops, betamethasone valerate foam, 0.12% should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation, as with most topical products not containing corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing.

In the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of betamethasone valerate foam, 0.12% should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled.

Information for Patients

Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions:

This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes.
This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed.
The treated scalp area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered or wrapped so as to be occlusive unless directed by the physician.
Patients should report to their physician any signs of local adverse reactions.
As with other corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, contact the physician.

Laboratory Tests

The following tests may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression:

ACTH stimulation test

A.M. plasma cortisol test

Urinary free cortisol test

### Symptomatic Cushing syndrome and hyperandrogenemia revealing steroid cell ovarian neoplasm with late intra-abdominal metastasis [^1176Fxdm]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

During physical examination her blood pressure was 195/130 mmHg. She was 147 cm tall and weighed 54 kg (body mass index 25.0). She had hirsutism and her skin was thin with scattered ecchymosis. She had a round and plethoric face, central adiposity, buffalo hump and supraclavicular fat pads. A mass of 7 × 5 cm could be palpated in the left mid-abdomen. There were no purple striae and hyperpigmentation.

Her baseline labs showed normal WBC count (6.66 × 10 9 /L) with neutrophilia (74.7%), hypokalemia (3.11 mmol/L), impaired glucose tolerance (fasting glucose 6.7 mmol/L, 2-hrs postprandial glucose 10.6 mmol/L) and alkalosis (pH 7.54, base excess 9.0 mmol/L). Urine potassium level was within the normal range (50 mmol/24 hr, reference range 25–100) but was relatively high given her hypokalemia. An endocrinological evaluation revealed elevated morning plasma cortisol (31 μg/dl, ref. range 5–25), and overnight dexamethasone (1 mg) failed to suppress plasma level of cortisol. Urinary free cortisol was extremely high (1024.8 μg/24 hr, ref. range 30–110) and plasma ACTH was relatively low (16 pg/ml, ref. range 0–46). In addition, her testosterone level rose to 98 ng/dL (ref. range 14–76) with normal LH, FSH, prolactin and estradiol. Pelvic CT scan showed no recurrent or residual mass in the left adnexa location and the right ovary and the uterus were of normal appearance (Figure 1). However, abdominal CT scan demonstrated two masses beside abdominal aorta, multiple intra-hepatic hypodense nodules, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes enlargement (Figure 2), all enhanced with contrast media (Figure 3). These were compatible with metastatic disease. At the same time, mild adrenal atrophy without ascites was detected in her CT scan. Her previous ovarian tumor sections were re-examined and the pathology result was corrected to steroid cell tumor, NOS (cpinephroma) associated with active cell growth and necrosis (Figure 4). The patient was strongly interested in tumor-reductive surgery. During a pre-surgical work-up, the patient had positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) which revealed abnormally hypermetabolism in the retroperitoneal masses and nodes suggesting metastatic lesions (Figure 5). Therefore, she underwent excisions of abdominal paraaortic neoplasms and multiple intra-hepatic nodules as well as retroperitoneal enlarged lymph nodes. The cut surface of the neoplasms showed a solid mass including hemorrhagic and necrotic contents with calcific deposits. The resected specimens showed very similar appearances of histopathology to the previous ovarian tumor. Neoplastic cells were calretinin, CD99, α-inhibin positive, cytokeratin (CK), vimentin weak positive and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) negative by immunohistochemical staining. These findings were consistent with the diagnosis of malignant steroid cell tumor (NOS) with late intra-abdominal metastasis.

### Cortisol levels during acute illnesses in children and adolescents: a systematic review [^112cp23E]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

According to a recent study by Worth et al, the rate of death due to an adrenal crisis among children with adrenal insufficiency has remained high. The correct GC stress dose for different acute illnesses has the potential to prevent death. Glucocorticoid stress doses for children and adolescents have been based on opinion owing to a dearth of evidence. To contribute toward closing this gap in evidence, we conducted this systematic review of published blood cortisol levels at the time of acute illness in children and adolescents without GC deficiency, using newer assays available in the past 2 decades. The basal cortisol levels between 8 and 9in controls are consistent with those reported by Eyal et al(mean [SD], 11.53 [5.74] μg/dL). Comparing these with cortisol levels observed in children and adolescents during a range of acute illnesses that required hospitalization suggests that GC stress doses may need to be tailored according to the nature and severity of the illness in children and adolescents with GC deficiency and warrant further research.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^112karUa]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — future research priorities include improving the evidence base and harmonizing cortisol testing. The document states that evidence for most recommendations is low or very low and calls for epidemiology research to define the true risk of adrenal clinical crisis and long-term consequences. It indicates that biomedical and psychosocial research to understand glucocorticoid withdrawal is warranted to better differentiate it from glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, and that more research is needed to identify glucocorticoids with less hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis suppression and to explore therapeutic strategies such as concurrent HPA axis stimulation to prevent suppression. For diagnostics, it notes a need for harmonization of cortisol assays and asks for cut-off values to be established using mass spectrometry and for clinical care to adapt this measurement for routine cortisol measurements.

### Diagnosis and treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults: a review [^1135HAvP]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on diabetes mellitus type 2:

- **Definition**: T2DM is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and a relative deficiency in insulin secretion, leading to chronic hyperglycemia.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of T2DM involves a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors that disrupt normal glucose regulation. A key feature is insulin resistance, in which body tissues become less responsive to insulin. To compensate, pancreatic β-cells initially increase insulin production, but this response gradually declines, leading to β-cell dysfunction and insufficient insulin secretion. As a result, hepatic glucose production increases, and glucose uptake by peripheral tissues decreases, causing impaired glucose regulation and eventually chronic hyperglycemia.
- **Epidemiology**: In 2021, an estimated 38.4 million Americans (11.6% of the population) were living with diabetes. Of these, 29.7 million had been diagnosed, while 8.7 million remained undiagnosed. Approximately 2 million Americans had T1DM, including about 304,000 children and adolescents. Among adults aged 65 years and older, diabetes prevalence was particularly high at 29.2% (16.5 million people). Each year, an additional 1.2 million Americans receive a new diabetes diagnosis. Moreover, 97.6 million adults had prediabetes, placing them at elevated risk for developing diabetes. In youth under 20, about 352,000 individuals (0.35%) were living with diagnosed diabetes; between 2017 and 2018, the annual incidence was 18,200 for type 1 and 5,300 for T2DM. Marked racial and ethnic disparities persist, with the highest rates among American Indian/Alaska Native (13.6%), non-Hispanic Black (12.1%), and Hispanic (11.7%) adults, compared with Asian American (9.1%) and non-Hispanic White (6.9%) adults.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for T2DM include overweight or obesity, especially abdominal fat, which leads to insulin resistance. Physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, advancing age, and a family history of diabetes further increase risk. The condition is more common among African American, Hispanic, Native American, and Asian American populations. Other contributing factors include hypertension, dyslipidemia, PCOS, gestational diabetes, and prediabetes. Chronic stress, poor sleep, and certain medications such as glucocorticoids may also raise the risk.
- **Disease course**: The clinical manifestations of T2DM develop gradually, often beginning with a long asymptomatic period during which the disease is present but undiagnosed. Many individuals remain asymptomatic for years, with the condition discovered incidentally during routine testing. As the disease progresses, classic symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and blurred vision may appear. Recurrent infections, slow wound healing, and numbness or tingling in the extremities can also occur as a result of hyperglycemia and peripheral neuropathy. The clinical course is typically chronic and progressive, with β-cell function declining over time. Without proper management, long-term complications develop, including CVD, nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy, which can significantly affect QoL and life expectancy.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis and survival in T2DM depend on the degree of metabolic control and the presence of complications. Individuals who achieve good control of blood glucose, BP, and lipid levels can maintain near-normal life expectancy, while those with poorly controlled diabetes or advanced cardiovascular and renal complications face significantly higher mortality. CVD remains the leading cause of death among people with diabetes. In 2021, diabetes was the eighth leading cause of death in the US, listed as the underlying cause on 103,294 death certificates and mentioned as a contributing cause on a total of 399,401. Overall, life expectancy may be reduced by 5 to 10 years in individuals with longstanding or uncontrolled disease, but adherence to lifestyle modifications, pharmacologic therapy, and regular follow-up can substantially improve both survival and QoL.

### Discrepant glucose results between capillary and venous blood in an 83-year-old white man [^114gVCdc]. Laboratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Herein, we present a case of pseudohypoglycemia induced by hypothermia in an 83-year-old white man in whom glucose levels between venous and capillary blood were discrepant. Although pseudohypoglycemia has been reported in the literature, it is under-recognized among health care professionals and laboratorians. Health care professionals may encounter pseudohypoglycemia using glucose meters; the potentially inaccuracy of glucose meter results for critically ill patients has been intensely debated recently. Thus, this article should be educational for the point-of-care community.

### Cortisol levels during acute illnesses in children and adolescents: a systematic review [^116qN3Dp]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this systematic review of studies on children and adolescents with an intact hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, circulating cortisol levels during acute illness were found to be higher than in controls and varied among a range of acute illnesses. Robust studies are required to examine whether comparable levels need to be achieved with exogenous GC treatment when children and adolescents with GC deficiency experience different acute illnesses.

### Glucose levels are not the same for everyone: a real-world big data study evaluating fasting serum glucose levels by sex and age among children [^1122Ptgm]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Understanding the normal range of laboratory values as pertained to different age groups and males or females is paramount in health care delivery. We aimed to assess the distribution of morning fasting serum glucose levels by age and sex in the general population of children using a large-scale population-based cohort.

Methods

A retrospective study with real-world de-identified data from a large, state mandated health fund in Israel among children aged 2–18 years old between 2006 and 2019. Age, sex, and BMI differences in mean glucose levels were evaluated.

Results

Study included 130,170 venous blood samples from 117,411 children, 53.3% were female. After adjusting for age boys had higher fasting serum glucose levels than girls, with a mean of 89.21 ± 8.66 mg/dL vs. 87.59 ± 8.35 (p < 0.001) [4.95 ± 0.48 mmol/L vs. 4.86 ± 0.46]. Compared to the 15 to 18 year-olds (88.49 ± 7.63 mg/dL) [4.92 ± 0.42 mmol/L], 2 to 5 year-olds had lower glucose levels (84.19 ± 10.65, [4.68 ± 0.59] (p < 0.001)), 11 to 14 year-olds had higher glucose (90.40 ± 7.42 [5.02 ± 0.41], (p < 0.001)) and 6 to 10 year-olds showed no difference (88.45 ± 8.25) [4.91 ± 0.46]. 33.0% (n = 42,991) had a BMI percentile record the same year as their glucose test result. There was a weak yet significant positive association between blood glucose levels and BMI.

Conclusions

Our large cohort indicates that boys have slightly higher fasting serum glucose levels than girls, as do adolescents compared to younger children. This finding is important for the delivery of adequate health care, screening for illness and avoiding unnecessary investigations and tests.

### Cortisol and growth hormone responses to spontaneous hypoglycaemia in infants and children [^114JnnuG]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2004). Low credibility.

Aims

To evaluate responses of cortisol and growth hormone (GH) to spontaneous hypoglycaemia in infants and children.

Methods

Retrospective review of laboratory and clinical data in paediatric patients investigated for suspected hypoglycaemia over a five year period. Thirty patients (16 aged < 3 months) had hypoglycaemia confirmed by laboratory analysis (glucose < 2.5 mmol/l) and were compared with 26 patients (11 aged < 3 months) with glucose ≥ 2.5 mmol/l.

Results

The commonest causes of hypoglycaemia were transient hyperinsulinism in infants < 3 months and intercurrent infection in those > 6 months of age. In both hypo- and non-hypoglycaemic patients, cortisol was positively (r(s) +0.66 and +0.68) and GH inversely (r(s) -0.65 and -0.75) correlated with age. Hypo- and non-hypoglycaemic infants < 3 months had median cortisol concentrations of 205 and 116 nmol/l respectively compared with 1370 and 736 nmol/l in hypo- and non-hypoglycaemic children > 6 months. Conversely, median GH was 46.5 and 51.2 mU/l in hypo- and non-hypoglycaemic infants compared with 14.3 and 12.1 mU/l in older hypo- and non-hypoglycaemic patients. Older non-hypoglycaemic patients with glucose levels below the glycaemic thresholds established for cortisol and GH secretion in adults had higher cortisol and GH concentrations than patients whose glucose levels exceeded these thresholds.

Conclusions

Cortisol and GH responses to spontaneous hypoglycaemia in children are highly age dependent. Young infants mount a poor cortisol response compared with older infants and children. Children older than 6 months may have glycaemic thresholds for cortisol and GH similar to those established for adults.

### Type 1 diabetes mellitus diagnosis in young adult preceded by years of elevated postprandial and fasting glucose but normal HbA1c: a clinical example of discordance [^116AM82n]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Herein, a case study of an individual with fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and postprandial blood glucose (PBG) measures from the 3 years preceding their type 1 diabetes mellitus diagnosis is used to highlight discordance among these common diagnostic tests. Data from the patient's own records, participation in clinical research, and healthcare provider were collated. Measures of FBG (90–160 mg/dL) and PBG (195–247 mg/dL) were elevated for 3 years with a normal HbA1c (5.0–5.4%) and without any symptoms. Overt symptoms, including polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss, manifested 3 years later prompting the patient to contact their physician. Testing revealed an elevated HbA1c (9.8%) and presence of glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies (GAD) (9 IU/mL). Daily body composition measures and weighed food logs from the 3 months preceding and 4 months after diagnosis illustrate the effects of glucose spilling and inadequate insulin levels. Both FBG and PBG indicated diabetes 3 years prior to HbA1c. While FBG, PBG, and HbA1c are considered equally appropriate for screening and diagnosing diabetes, this case study highlights the need to revisit important distinctions between these tests that explain their frequent discordance.

### Acr-asnr-assr-sir-snis practice parameter for the performance of image-guided epidural steroid injection [^114daDzB]. SIR (2025). High credibility.

Epidural steroid injections (ESIs) — endocrinological and systemic effects include that they can increase blood glucose levels in diabetic patients for 2 to 3 days after an ESI and can suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis for up to 3 weeks. After a single epidural injection of 15 mg of dexamethasone acetate, decreased serum cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and urinary cortisol were observed and the levels returned to normal at day 21; this effect may be dose dependent. With triamcinolone, a single 40 mg injection markedly decreased plasma cortisol for only 24 hours, whereas 80 mg resulted in a decrease for up to 14 days posttreatment, and HPA axis function returned to normal within 35 days in both groups. A recent article demonstrated fewer systemic effects (suppression of the pituitary axis for up to 3 weeks) with dexamethasone compared with particulate steroids. Less common side effects have included elevated temperature, euphoria, depression, mood swings, transient changes in sleep pattern, local fat atrophy, depigmentation of the skin, and pain flare; several authors have reported cases of symptomatic epidural lipomatosis following epidural injections of corticosteroids. After betamethasone injection, observed reactions include insomnia (39%), facial erythema (20%), nausea (20%), and rash and pruritus (8%), and ESIs does not induce weight gain.

Cushing's syndrome — screening yields in selected populations: In patients with incidental adrenal nodules, biochemical hypercortisolism is present in a large fraction (up to 10%), with reported prevalences of Cushing's syndrome of 2%, 18%, and 5–20% depending on referral bias and diagnostic tests and criteria; among those with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, 2–3.3% had surgically confirmed Cushing's syndrome or mild hypercortisolism and one of 99 with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus had surgically proven Cushing's disease; in 86 consecutive obese subjects referred to an endocrine clinic with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and/or polycystic ovary syndrome, the incidence was 5.8%; screening studies in hypertension report 0.5–1% prevalence; and in older patients with osteoporosis and vertebral fracture undergoing comprehensive testing, unsuspected Cushing's syndrome was found in as many as 10.8%.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for Cushing's syndrome" for Cushing's syndrome.

The diagnostic criteria for Cushing's syndrome is a clinical tool designed to aid in the identification and diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome, a condition characterized by excessive cortisol production. This tool is particularly useful in distinguishing Cushing's syndrome from other conditions with similar symptoms and from physiological causes of hypercortisolism, as well as exogenous corticosteroid exposure.

The primary components of this diagnostic criteria include the exclusion of physiological causes of hypercortisolism and exogenous corticosteroid exposure, and the presence of certain biochemical abnormalities. These abnormalities include 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels above the upper limit of normal on two or more separate measurements, late-night salivary cortisol levels greater than 145 ng/dL on two or more separate measurements, and serum cortisol levels greater than 1.8 mcg/dL after 1 mg overnight dexamethasone.

The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is considered likely if the patient meets the exclusion criteria and has either elevated urinary and salivary cortisol levels, elevated urinary cortisol and serum cortisol levels after dexamethasone, or elevated salivary cortisol and serum cortisol levels after dexamethasone. If these criteria are not met, a diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is considered unlikely. This diagnostic tool thus provides a structured approach to the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome, facilitating early detection and treatment of this condition.

To assess the likelihood of Cushing's syndrome, a structured approach based on specific diagnostic criteria is employed. This involves evaluating several key factors to understand the presence of hypercortisolism, the hallmark of Cushing's syndrome.

The initial step is to exclude any physiological causes of excess cortisol or exogenous corticosteroid exposure. This is a critical first criterion and serves as a prerequisite for further testing.

Following this, the user considers additional biochemical tests:

- **24-hour urinary free cortisol**: This test measures the amount of cortisol in the urine over a day. For Cushing's syndrome to be considered likely, results should show cortisol levels above the normal upper limit on at least two separate measurements.

- **Late-night salivary cortisol**: Normally, cortisol levels are low at night. For this criterion, a reading of greater than 145 ng/dL (or > 4 nmol/L) on two or more occasions suggests a disruption in the typical diurnal pattern of cortisol production.

- **Serum cortisol after dexamethasone administration**: Dexamethasone is a synthetic steroid used to suppress cortisol production. If, after receiving a 1 mg dose overnight, the serum cortisol level remains greater than 1.8 mcg/dL (or > 50 nmol/L), it indicates a potential problem with cortisol regulation.

The conclusion about the likelihood of Cushing's syndrome is made by integrating these factors:

- The syndrome is likely if there is proven exclusion of other causes (the first criterion) and at least two of the following are satisfied: elevated 24-hour urinary free cortisol, elevated late-night salivary cortisol, or failure to suppress serum cortisol after dexamethasone.

- If this combination of exclusion and elevation criteria is not met, Cushing's syndrome is considered unlikely.

This diagnostic pathway allows for a comprehensive yet straightforward determination, focusing on biochemical validations and excluding other possible explanations before arriving at a clinical interpretation.

### A guidance on diagnosis and management of hyperglycemia at COVID care facilities in India [^115EwJ3B]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Diabetes and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) share a bidirectional relationship. Hyperglycemia occurring in the setting of either previously diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes is known to be associated with poor outcomes. Here, we aim to provide a simple and practical guidance on the diagnosis and management of hyperglycemia in admitted patients with COVID-19.

Methods

The guidance is formulated based on experience of authors and relevant literature on the subject searched using Pubmed.

Results

Every patient admitted to a COVID care facility should be investigated for hyperglycemia using a combination of tests including capillary blood glucose, fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c. Oral glucose lowering drugs can be considered in patients with mild COVID illness who have mild hyperglycemia [pre-meal blood glucose of < 180 mg/dl (10 mmol/L) and post-meal blood glucose of < 250 mg/dl (13.9 mmol/L)] and no contraindication to the use of these agents. All patients with moderate-severe disease and/or hyperglycemia of greater severity should be initiated on insulin therapy. Hyperglycemia should be aggressively screened for and managed in patients receiving systemic glucocorticoids.

Conclusion

This document provides a broad overview on the diagnosis and management of hyperglycemia at COVID care facilities and should be useful to a wide range of healthcare personnel involved in care of patients with COVID-19.

### Clinical manifestations and challenges in adolescent and adult females with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency [^117Q5nR6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Cortisol Metabolism During Puberty

During puberty the increased sex hormone levels and growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 affect cortisol metabolism and turnover. The activity of the 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD11B1) enzyme, which reactivates cortisone to cortisol, is reduced due to inhibition by the increased IGF-1 and growth hormone levels. Hydrocortisone doses therefore need to be increased, and sometimes more frequent dosing of hydrocortisone is required during puberty. The total clearance is significantly higher during puberty than before or after; in addition, the volume of distribution increases during puberty. The increased clearance of cortisol during puberty may in some cases require a switch to a 4-dose or an even more frequent regimen. However, doses above 17 mg/m² per day should be used with caution to avoid compromising growth. The free cortisol half-life is significantly shorter in girls than in boys, which may result in even larger effects of puberty in girls with CAH. It is important that the treating physician be aware of the metabolic changes during puberty to be able to make adequate changes in the dose and how it is divided throughout the day.

In early adolescence, the morning increase of 17OHP may become more evident. This can be overcome by taking the first dose earlier in the morning. Sleeping late and oversleeping the morning dose during weekends may create difficulties in obtaining an optimal stable situation. Elevated androgen levels may prompt the physician to increase the dose, which may lead to a situation with overtreatment some days of the week and undertreatment on weekdays, or during school days if there is a problem with taking the mid-day doses. The advice should be to always take the morning dose at the same time and go back to sleep instead of taking the dose later some days.

### Clinical characteristics, timing of peak responses and safety aspects of two dosing regimens of the glucagon stimulation test in evaluating growth hormone and cortisol secretion in adults [^1126tpcj]. Pituitary (2013). Low credibility.

Weight-based (WB: 0.03 mg/kg) and fixed dose (FD: 1–1.5 mg) regimens of the glucagon stimulation test (GST) have been used to evaluate GH and cortisol secretion in children and adults, respectively. However, experience of the WB regimen in assessing GH and cortisol secretion in adults are limited. We describe a multicenter experience using WB and FD regimens in evaluating GH and cortisol secretion in adults suspected of GH deficiency and central adrenal insufficiency. Retrospective case series of GSTs (n = 515) performed at five tertiary centers. Peak and nadir glucose, and peak GH and peak cortisol responses occurred later with WB (mean dose: 2.77 mg) compared to FD (mean dose: 1.20 mg) regimens. Main side-effects were nausea and vomiting, particularly in younger females. Nausea was comparable but vomiting was more frequent in the WB regimen (WB: 10.0% vs FD: 2.4%; P < 0.05). Peak and nadir glucose, ΔGH, and peak and Δcortisol were higher in the WB regimen. In both regimens, age correlated negatively with peak cortisol levels, and body mass index (BMI), fasting, peak and nadir glucose correlated negatively with peak GH levels. WB and FD regimens can induce adult GH and cortisol secretion, but peak responses occur later in the WB regimen. Both regimens are relatively safe, and vomiting was more prevalent in the WB regimen. As age, BMI, and glucose tolerance negatively correlated with peak GH and cortisol levels, the WB regimen may be more effective than the FD regimen in older overweight glucose intolerant patients.

### Clinically silent somatotropinomas may be biochemically active [^111nG5Sd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acromegaly is suspected based on the typical clinical presentation and is subsequently confirmed biochemically by elevated GH and IGF-I concentrations. We report three female patients with pituitary tumors who presented without any signs or symptoms of acromegaly but with elevated IGF-I levels. Plasma GH was measured every 10 min for 24 h, and an oral glucose tolerance test was performed. All patients had abnormally elevated mean and trough plasma GH levels as well as post-glucose nadir GH concentrations. All patients had magnetic resonance imaging scans revealing pituitary tumors and underwent transsphenoidal surgery. Histologically, they had GH-producing pituitary tumors. Plasma IGF-I levels returned to normal in two patients after surgery. Some pituitary adenomas are true GH-secreting tumors despite not being accompanied by obvious clinical stigmata of acromegaly. Natural history of this disease is unknown because of the small number of reported patients and inconsistent results of biochemical testing. Based on the results of this and previous reports, we propose that all patients with known pituitary tumors, especially younger women with normal or mildly elevated prolactin level, be evaluated for GH excess.

### Severe euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis of multifactorial etiology in a type 2 diabetic patient treated with empagliflozin: case report and literature review [^117DG8cc]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are a relatively novel class of oral medications for the treatment of Type 2 DM with a generally acceptable safety profile. However, these agents have been associated with rare events of a serious and potentially life-threatening complication named euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (euDKA). euDKA is not identical with the typical diabetic ketoacidosis, as it often presents with serious metabolic acidosis but only mild to moderate glucose and anion gap elevation.

Case Presentation

We report a case of a 51-year old female with Type 2 DM treated with an SGLT-2 inhibitor, developing severe metabolic acidosis with only mild blood glucose elevation after a routine surgery. A careful evaluation of involved factors led to the diagnosis of euDKA, followed by cautious application of simple therapeutic measures that resulted in complete restoration of acidosis and glycemic control in less than 48-h.

Conclusions

Euglycemic ketoacidosis is a rare but rather serious complication of SGLT-2 inhibitors use, often with a multifactorial etiology. Its atypical presentation requires a high level of awareness by physicians as early recognition of this complication can quickly and safely restore acid-base balance.

### Obesity and hyperphagia with increased defective ACTH: a novel POMC variant [^114QR4Tq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical History

The female index patient (patient A, current age 27 years, body mass index 41.59) was seen at age 7 years at the department of pediatric endocrinology because of the suspicion of adrenal insufficiency. Since age 1.5 years she had been overweight with overt hyperphagia, which soon turned to early-onset obesity. Since age 5 years she had been hospitalized multiple times for recurrent hypoglycemias, respiratory tract infections, and vomiting. At the time of the first evaluation at the outpatient clinic, she had recently been discharged from the pediatric intensive care unit where she was treated for respiratory insufficiency and septic shock, and the diagnosis of severe hypocortisolism was made (serum cortisol < 28 nmol/L). There was a markedly raised plasma level of ACTH (87.2 pmol/L, upper limit of normal range 11 pmol/L), and hydrocortisone substitution therapy had been initiated. Further analysis showed no mineralocorticoid deficiency, no autoantibodies against the adrenal gland or antithyroid peroxidase antibodies, and adrenoleukodystrophy was excluded. A computed tomography scan revealed an anatomically normal left adrenal gland and no visible right adrenal gland. Stimulation with synthetic ACTH did not lead to a sufficient increase of cortisol levels. She had dark hair and normal skin pigmentation considering her South Asian background. At age 14 she developed overt primary hypothyroidism (free thyroxine 9.6 pmol/L, reference range, 12–26 pmol/L; thyrotropin 10.5 mU/L, reference range, 0.4–4.3 mU/L), which was supplemented, and later, at age 18, a growth hormone (GH) deficiency (insulin-like growth factor-1 levels 15.8 nmol/L, lower limit of normal 25 nmol/L; and insufficient increase of GH after stimulation with clonidine and arginine) without visible abnormalities in the pituitary on magnetic resonance scans, which was also supplemented. Her sister (patient B) presented at age 3 years with a similar clinical picture: primary hypocortisolism (serum cortisol < 28 nmol/L) with high plasma ACTH levels (1036 pmol/L), early-onset obesity (at age 3 her weight and height were > 2 SDs above the average, at age 16 her body mass index was 30.3) and hyperphagia, but also an autism spectrum disorder and mild cognitive impairment. Their parents were consanguineous (first cousins). Their brother died at age 19 of lymphomatoid granulomatosis. Neither their brother nor their parents had obesity or adrenal insufficiency.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American college of endocrinology guidelines for management of growth hormone deficiency in adults and patients transitioning from pediatric to adult care [^113xf1Cr]. Endocrine Practice (2019). High credibility.

Insulin tolerance test (ITT) — adult growth hormone deficiency (GHD) diagnostic stimulation: The ITT has historically been accepted as the "gold standard" with a GH cut point of 3 to 5 μg/L when adequate hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 40 mg/dL) is achieved; stimulated peak GH ranges separated GH-deficient (0.2 to 3.1 μg/L) from GH-sufficient (5.3 to 42.5 ng/mL) patients. The test is contraindicated in the elderly and in patients with a history of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease and seizures, and in insulin-resistant states may necessitate higher insulin doses (0.15 to 0.2 IU/kg) with risk of delayed hypoglycemia. The ITT requires close medical supervision, is unpleasant due to severe hypoglycemia with potential adverse effects (e.g., seizures and altered consciousness), and although it demonstrates good sensitivity, its lack of reproducibility on repeat testing is a limitation; differences in peak GH responses have been shown with varying test times and across the menstrual cycle in women.

### Is there value in routine screening for Cushing's syndrome in patients with diabetes? [^115iYhR8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Subclinical Cushing's syndrome has been described among diabetic populations in recent years, but no consensus has emerged about the value of screening.

Methods

We enrolled 201 consecutive patients attending our diabetes clinic and 79 controls. Patients with at least two of the following three criteria were offered screening using a 2300 h salivary cortisol test: glycosylated hemoglobin of at least 7%, body mass index of at least 25 kg/m(2), and a history of hypertension or blood pressure of at least 140/90 mm Hg. Results are expressed as mean ± sem.

Results

Mean nighttime salivary cortisol levels were similar in the two groups (8.5 ± 1.0 nmol/liter for diabetic patients vs. 5.8 ± 1.0 nmol/liter for controls). Forty-seven patients (23%) had a value of at least 10 nmol/liter, which was set as a conservative threshold above which further investigation would be performed. Thirty-five (75%) agreed to further testing with a 1-mg overnight dexamethasone test. Of the remaining 12 patients, 10 were followed up clinically for at least 1 yr, and no evidence was found of the syndrome evolving. In 28 patients, serum cortisol suppressed to 60 nmol/liter or less. Of the seven patients who failed this test, four agreed to a 2 mg/d 48-h dexamethasone test, with serum cortisol suppressing to 60 nmol/liter or less in all four. Three declined this test but had normal 24-h urinary free cortisol levels. No patient had clinical features of hypercortisolism.

Conclusions

The 1–3% detection rates of three recently published series have not been realized at our center where we studied a group using criteria making patients more likely to have hypercortisolism. Our results do not support the validity of screening patients without clinical features of Cushing's syndrome in the diabetes clinic.
