## Question

Empagflozin HF ans diabetic dose

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate empagliflozin dose for patients with heart failure and type 2 diabetes, and whether this dose differs from the standard dosing used for diabetes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled indications and doses for empagliflozin across diabetes, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. Then, I should verify the dosing used in pivotal heart failure trials and whether both the 10 mg and 25 mg doses were tested. Next, I will review guideline recommendations to ensure alignment with best practice. After that, I need to check whether the presence of diabetes modifies the heart failure dose. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically actionable recommendation with safety considerations and references to support it.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory labeling, because that anchors the dose. The FDA label specifies empagliflozin 10 mg once daily for the treatment of heart failure in adults to reduce cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization, and the same 10 mg once daily dose applies to chronic kidney disease; for type 2 diabetes, the labeled maintenance dose is 10 mg once daily with a maximum of 25 mg once daily, typically taken in the morning [^1152xm53] [^113N1FKn] [^116kjsty].

> Wait, let me verify the trial dosing that informed the heart failure indication, because I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing from diabetes dosing. In EMPEROR-Reduced, patients with HFrEF received empagliflozin 10 mg once daily, and in EMPEROR-Preserved, patients with HFpEF also received empagliflozin 10 mg once daily; both trials demonstrated significant reductions in heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular death, supporting the 10 mg dose as the evidence-based regimen for heart failure irrespective of ejection fraction [^11371Zhr] [^113eU5Rj].

> Hold on, I should review whether the 25 mg dose has any role in heart failure, since the diabetes label allows up to 25 mg. In EMPA-REG OUTCOME, both 10 mg and 25 mg reduced heart failure outcomes, but the cardiovascular benefit did not show a clear dose-response, and subsequent dedicated heart failure trials standardized on 10 mg. Importantly, the heart failure label and contemporary guidelines do not recommend 25 mg for HF management, so the 25 mg dose remains a glycemic-control maximum for diabetes, not a heart failure dose [^112focx7] [^1152xm53] [^114rQVwu].

> Next, I should review guideline direction to ensure my recommendation aligns with consensus. The 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA heart failure guideline recommends SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin, as foundational therapy for HFrEF and supports their use in HFpEF, with dosing consistent with the trial regimens. The 2023 ESC guidance similarly recommends empagliflozin or dapagliflozin across HF phenotypes in appropriate patients, again reflecting the 10 mg dosing used in trials and labeling [^114rQVwu] [^113Scz1b] [^114Gnmga].

> I need to check whether diabetes status changes the heart failure dose. The pivotal heart failure trials included large proportions of patients with and without diabetes, and the benefits of empagliflozin 10 mg were consistent regardless of diabetes status; there is no recommendation to use a different dose in patients with diabetes who also have heart failure, so the dose remains 10 mg once daily in T2DM with HF [^11371Zhr] [^113eU5Rj] [^113yCFbJ].

> Let me consider safety and special situations, because dose adjustments might be needed. Empagliflozin is generally well tolerated, but I should monitor for volume depletion, especially in patients on higher loop diuretic doses, and watch for genital mycotic infections; reassuringly, post hoc analyses suggest consistent efficacy and safety across diuretic strata, though volume depletion risk can be higher with background diuretics, and empagliflozin may even reduce the need for diuretic escalation, which can guide careful coadministration and monitoring rather than dose reduction of empagliflozin itself [^117WM1Hu] [^114MhzwG] [^115o2419].

> But wait, what if the patient is being treated for both glycemic control and heart failure — should I aim for 25 mg for better glucose lowering? Hold on, I should verify that the heart failure indication is satisfied at 10 mg and that 25 mg does not confer additional HF benefit; given the lack of incremental HF outcome benefit at 25 mg and the potential for more adverse effects, the correct approach is 10 mg once daily for HF, with additional glycemic control achieved via other antihyperglycemic agents as needed rather than increasing empagliflozin above the HF-effective dose [^1152xm53] [^112focx7].

> Synthesis and final check: for a patient with heart failure and type 2 diabetes, the recommended empagliflozin dose is 10 mg orally once daily, typically in the morning, consistent with FDA labeling for heart failure and supported by EMPEROR-Reduced and EMPEROR-Preserved. This dose is the same whether or not diabetes is present, and there is no indication to use 25 mg for heart failure management [^1152xm53] [^11371Zhr] [^113eU5Rj].

---

Empagliflozin 10 mg once daily is the standard dose for heart failure patients with diabetes, **reducing cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization** regardless of diabetes status [^11371Zhr] [^113eU5Rj]. For glycemic control in type 2 diabetes, the usual dose is 10 mg once daily, with a maximum of 25 mg once daily; however, the 25 mg dose is **not recommended for heart failure management** because cardiovascular benefit does not increase with higher dosing [^116kjsty] [^112focx7]. No dose adjustment is needed for renal impairment unless **eGFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m²**, and patients should be monitored for volume depletion and genital infections.

---

## Recommended dosing of empagliflozin

### Heart failure indications

In heart failure, the **recommended dose** is 10 mg once daily [^1152xm53] for adults with HFrEF or HFpEF, regardless of diabetes status [^11371Zhr] [^113eU5Rj]. Dose adjustment is not required for renal impairment unless eGFR is < 30 mL/min/1.73 m².

---

### Type 2 diabetes mellitus indications

For glycemic control, the **usual dose** is 10 mg once daily [^116kjsty]; the **maximum dose** is 25 mg once daily, but this higher dose is not recommended for heart failure management because it does not provide additional cardiovascular benefit [^112focx7].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing recommendations

### EMPEROR-reduced trial (HFrEF)

In EMPEROR-Reduced, **design** was a randomized, double-blind trial of empagliflozin 10 mg once daily versus placebo in patients with chronic HFrEF, with or without diabetes [^11371Zhr]. The **primary outcome** — cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure — was significantly reduced (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65–0.86; P < 0.001) [^11371Zhr]. The **renal outcomes** showed a slower annual decline in eGFR and fewer serious renal outcomes with empagliflozin [^11371Zhr].

---

### EMPEROR-Preserved trial (HFpEF)

In EMPEROR-Preserved, **design** was a randomized, double-blind trial of empagliflozin 10 mg once daily versus placebo in patients with HFpEF, with or without diabetes [^113eU5Rj]. The **primary outcome** — cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure — was significantly reduced (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69–0.90; P < 0.001) [^113eU5Rj].

---

### EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (T2DM with CVD)

In EMPA-REG OUTCOME, **design** was a randomized, double-blind trial of empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg versus placebo in patients with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease [^11241E3c]. The **heart failure outcomes** showed a significant reduction in hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.55–0.79; P < 0.001), with consistent effects across both doses [^112focx7].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

- **Volume depletion**: Monitor for hypotension, dizziness, and dehydration, especially in elderly patients or those on diuretics [^115o2419].
- **Genital infections**: Increased risk of mycotic infections; counsel patients on hygiene and recognize symptoms early [^113eU5Rj].
- **Renal function**: Monitor eGFR and electrolytes, particularly in patients with CKD or those on nephrotoxic drugs [^111NtvKk].
- **Hypoglycemia**: Rare when used alone; monitor when combined with insulin or sulfonylureas [^1144StnK].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

- **ESC 2021 guidelines**: Recommend SGLT2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin) for HFrEF to reduce HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular death [^113Scz1b].
- **ESC 2023 guidelines**: Recommend empagliflozin or dapagliflozin for HFmrEF/HFpEF to reduce HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death [^114Gnmga].
- **AHA/ACC/HFSA 2022 guidelines**: Recommend SGLT2 inhibitors as foundational therapy for HFrEF, regardless of diabetes status [^notfound].

## Summary of dosing recommendations

| **Indication** | **Recommended dose** | **Maximum dose** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Heart failure (HFrEF or HFpEF) | 10 mg once daily | 10 mg once daily | - Cardiovascular benefit regardless of diabetes status <br/> - No dose adjustment unless eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² |
| Type 2 diabetes mellitus (glycemic control) | 10 mg once daily | 25 mg once daily | Higher dose not recommended for HF management |

---

Empagliflozin 10 mg once daily is the **standard dose** for heart failure patients with diabetes, providing cardiovascular and renal benefits regardless of diabetes status [^11371Zhr] [^113eU5Rj]. The 25 mg dose is reserved for glycemic control in T2DM and is not recommended for HF management.

As previously reported, hospitalization for heart failure occurred in a significantly lower percentage of patients treated with empagliflozin [126/4687 patients (2.7%)] than with placebo [95/2333 patients (4.1%)] [HR: 0.65 (95% CI: 0.50–0.85); P = 0.002]. The effect of empagliflozin on this outcome was consistent across doses, sensitivity analyses, and subgroups defined by baseline characteristics (Figure 2; see Supplementary material online, Table S1 Supplementary Data). In the 126 patients with at least one heart failure hospitalization event in the empagliflozin group, 43 patients had 111 recurrent events (either heart failure readmission or cardiovascular death), while in the 95 patients with at least one heart failure hospitalization event in the placebo group, 43 patients had 115 recurrent events (see Supplementary material online, Table S2). Information on readmission for heart failure is shown in Supplementary material online, Table S3. Among patients who were hospitalized for heart failure during the study, a smaller proportion of patients treated with empagliflozin than with placebo died of cardiovascular causes [17 (13.5%) vs. 23 (24.2%)] (see Supplementary material online, Table S2).

Study Patients

Participants included patients ≥ 18 years or older who had chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association functional Class II, III, or IV) with a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%. To enroll patients at increased risk of events, the number of patients with an ejection fraction > 30% was limited by requiring that they had been hospitalized for heart failure within 12 months or had exceptionally high levels of NT-proBNP (N-terminal prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide; ie, > 1000 pg/mL or > 2500 pg/mL in those with an ejection fraction of 31% to 35% or 36% to 40%, respectively); these thresholds were doubled in patients with atrial fibrillation. Patients were receiving all appropriate treatments for heart failure as available and tolerated. Exclusion criteria included symptomatic hypotension, systolic blood pressure of < 100 mm Hg or ≥ 180 mm Hg, or an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2. After a 4- to 28-day screening period, patients who fulfilled eligibility criteria were randomized double-blind (in a 1:1 manner) to receive placebo or empagliflozin 10 mg daily in addition to their usual therapy for heart failure.

For this prespecified subgroup analysis, patients were categorized as having diabetes if they had a history of the diagnosis or if 1 pretreatment HbA1c was at least 6.5% (≥ 48 mmol/mol). Among those without diabetes, patients were classified as having prediabetes if they had an HbA1c of 5.7% to 6.4%, and they were considered to have normoglycemia if they had all pretreatment HbA1c of < 5.7%. Randomization was stratified on the basis of glycemic status at screening (diabetes, prediabetes, or normoglycemia), geographic region (North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia, other), and eGFR (eGFR by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration at screening < or ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2). After randomization, patients were periodically evaluated for efficacy, vital signs, laboratory tests, and adverse events. These assessments included the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), systolic blood pressure, hemoglobin, body weight, HbA1c, NT-proBNP, and renal function.

### Empagliflozin prevents worsening of cardiac function in an experimental model of pressure overload-induced heart failure [^1176Uodi]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2017). Low credibility.

Recent findings from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME (Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients) trial demonstrated that the sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin markedly reduced cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Despite the profound and precocious efficacy, the physiological and biomolecular mechanisms responsible for this ∼40% reduction in cardiovascular mortality and heart failure are not known. Interestingly, intrinsic changes to the cardiac tissue itself have largely been ruled out because SGLT2 receptors are not known to be present in the heart. Based in part on this fact, the prevailing theories explaining how empagliflozin may exert its beneficial effects in heart failure involve either improved hemodynamics through osmotic diuresis and natriuresisor by promoting enhanced ketone oxidation by the heart through increased ketone concentrations in the blood. However, these theories have not been fully investigated. In addition, because empagliflozin is used to treat diabetes, it is not known whether the drug is capable of eliciting equally beneficial effects on heart failure outcomes in nondiabetic patients.

Background

The sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin reduced cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalizations in type 2 diabetes (T2D) in addition to a reduction of SBP. As heart failure patients often present with low SBP, which can challenge treatment initiation, we explored if empagliflozin's effect on SBP was independent of baseline SBP and heart failure status, and if the effect on cardiovascular and heart failure outcomes was influenced by updated mean SBP or by an early change in SBP after drug initiation.

Methods and Results

A total of 7020 patients were treated with empagliflozin 10mg, 25mg or placebo and followed for a median of 3.1 years. All of them had BP measurement at baseline. We evaluated changes in SBP in the context of heart failure status at baseline and according to baseline SBP categories (< 120, 120 — < 130, 130 — < 140, 140 — < 160, ≥ 160mmHg). The updated mean SBP during the trial was calculated as a time-dependent variable. We then assessed the association of baseline and updated mean SBP with three-point major adverse cardiovascular events (3P-MACE), hospitalization for heart failure, cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death, all-cause death, and incident/worsening nephropathy, and whether treatment effect of empagliflozin vs. placebo on these outcomes differed if adjusted for updated mean SBP. Finally, we evaluated the impact of early decline in SBP (≥ 5mmHg at week 4) on the treatment effect of empagliflozin vs. placebo on these outcomes. Analyses were performed via Cox regression adjusting for baseline risk factors including a term for treatment subgroup interaction, and by landmark analyses starting at week 4. The difference in SBP reduction at week 12 between empagliflozin and placebo was 3–5mmHg and similar regardless of baseline SBP category or HF status at baseline. Baseline SBP and updated mean SBP categories showed no association with cardiovascular outcomes, but was associated with new/worsening nephropathy. The treatment effects of empagliflozin on all explored outcomes were independent of updated mean SBP as well of the early drop in SBP on treatment.

Conclusion

In addition to decreasing SBP, empagliflozin reduced cardiovascular, heart failure and renal outcomes independently of updated mean SBP during the trial, and of the early SBP drop. These results suggest a BP-independent effect of empagliflozin on cardiovascular and heart failure outcomes. CLINICALTRIALS.

### Heart failure outcomes with empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk: results of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial [^11241E3c]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design

The design of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME ® trial (NCT01131676) has been described. Briefly, the study population comprised patients with type 2 diabetes (with glycated haemoglobin 7.0–9.0% for drug-naïve patients and 7.0–10.0% for those on stable glucose-lowering therapy), established cardiovascular disease, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Patients with investigator-reported heart failure at baseline were allowed to participate without any restriction regarding ejection fraction or New York Heart Association (NYHA) class. Participants were randomized to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo once daily as addition to standard of care. Throughout the trial (or after week 12 for glucose-lowering medication), investigators were encouraged to treat cardiovascular risk factors to achieve optimal standard of care according to local guidelines. The trial continued until at least 691 patients experienced an adjudicated event included in the primary outcome: first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke (3-point major adverse cardiovascular events). Patients who prematurely discontinued study medication continued to be followed for ascertainment of cardiovascular outcomes and vital status.

The trial was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines and was approved by local authorities. An independent ethics committee or institutional review board approved the clinical protocol at every participating centre. All the patients provided written informed consent before study entry.

Safety was assessed based on adverse events that occurred during treatment or ≤ 7 days after the last intake of study medication, coded using the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 18.0. Oedema, an adverse event of special interest, was assessed through a search of adverse events defined using six MedDRA preferred terms (fluid overload, fluid retention, generalized oedema, oedema, oedema peripheral, peripheral swelling).

### A trial to evaluate the effect of the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (DAPA-HF) [^113bsaKm]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Several aspects of the design of DAPA‐HF merit discussion.

Study drug and dose

Dapagliflozin is a once daily, selective, competitive, reversible inhibitor of SGLT2 with similar in vitro potency to canagliflozin and empagliflozin. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 It causes a dose‐dependent increase in urinary glucose excretion with a near maximum effect at 10 mg daily and has no clinically important drug interactions. In common with other SGLT2 inhibitors, dapagliflozin causes small reductions in blood pressure and weight, a small initial increase in creatinine (although long‐term treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors appears to be reno‐protective in type 2 diabetes – see below), as well as an increase in the risk of genital mycotic infection.

Why an SGLT2 inhibitor in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction?

As described in the introduction, canagliflozin, empagliflozin and dapagliflozin reduced the risk of heart failure hospitalization among patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease/cardiovascular risk factors, with an apparently similar treatment effect in the small subgroup (∼10–15%) of patients in each trial with baseline heart failure of undetermined phenotype, as illustrated in a meta‐analysis of EMPA‐REG OUTCOME, CANVAS and DECLARE–TIMI 58. 7, 8, 9, 23 Examination of the event curves in these trials shows a reduction in heart failure hospitalization within weeks to months of randomization. The rapidity of onset of the benefit in the three trials is not consistent with traditional views about the mechanisms and time course of cardiovascular protection accruing with conventional glucose‐lowering therapies. 9, 10, 11, 12, 24, 25, 26, 27 Consequently, numerous additional beneficial mechanisms have been proposed, ranging from diuretic–haemodynamic actions, through effects on cardiac metabolism, adipokines, myocardial fibrosis, uric acid, myocyte ion channels and kidney function. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 A recent mediation analysis suggested that the rise in haematocrit concentration following SGLT2 inhibitor treatment is related to benefit, supporting a diuretic action, and mathematical modelling suggests SGLT2 inhibitors may remove fluid preferentially from the interstitial space and cause less intravascular volume contraction. 27, 28 Other data suggest SGLT2 inhibition can lead to ketogenesis and an increase in β‐hydroxybutyrate, which provides an alternative and more efficient substrate for myocardial energy generation.

### Empagliflozin in heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction [^11524oXm]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study EMPEROR-Preserved was published by Stefan D Anker and colleagues in 2021 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the EMPEROR-Preserved study, the trial question was: what is the role of empagliflozin in patients with HFpEF? In the EMPEROR-Preserved study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the EMPEROR-Preserved study, the population was: 5988 patients (2676 female, 3312 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with NYHA class II-IV HF and an ejection fraction > 40%. The key exclusion criteria were myocardial infarction; major cardiovascular surgery, or stroke in past 90 days; heart transplant; acute decompensated HF; indication for liver disease; impaired renal function. In the EMPEROR-Preserved study, the interventions were: n = 2997 empagliflozin (10 mg once daily plus usual therapy) n = 2991 placebo (matching placebo plus usual care). In the EMPEROR-Preserved study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in cardiovascular death or hospitalization for HF (13.8% vs. 17.1%; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.9). In the EMPEROR-Preserved study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in hospitalization for HF (8.6% vs. 11.8%; HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.6 to 0.83) No significant difference in cardiovascular death (7.3% vs. 8.2%; HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.09) Significant increase in the incidence of improvement in GFR (-1.25 mL/min/1.73 m²/year vs. -2.62 mL/min/1.73 m²/year; HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.66). In the EMPEROR-Preserved study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events and adverse events leading to discontinuation of trial drug. In the EMPEROR-Preserved study, the conclusion was: in patients with NYHA class II-IV HF and an ejection fraction > 40%, empagliflozin was superior to placebo with respect to cardiovascular death or hospitalization for HF.

### Impact of empagliflozin in patients with diabetes and heart failure [^114jvES4]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a common disease with increased risk for mortality and morbidity among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Optimal glycemic control in this patient population is challenging as many available therapies can potentially exacerbate symptoms of HF. Empagliflozin is one in a novel class of agents, the sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, that lowers blood glucose by increasing urinary glucose excretion and improves glycemic control and lowers body weight and blood pressure. In the recent EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, empagliflozin was shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2DM and established cardiovascular risk where it reduced HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular death, with a consistent benefit among patients both with and without baseline HF. Here, we review the empagliflozin data on HF outcomes and discuss potential mechanisms for its benefits in HF with a focus on the potentially significant impact that empagliflozin may have on the care of patients with T2DM and HF in the future.

### Heart failure outcomes with empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk: results of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial [^111D1MXS]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure is highly prevalent in patients with diabetes, occurring in more than one in five patients with diabetes aged over 65 years. Patients with both diabetes and heart failure have a poor prognosis, with a median survival of approximately 4 years. Glucose-lowering treatment options for patients with type 2 diabetes and heart failure are limited. In a meta-analysis, no benefit on heart failure hospitalization or death was demonstrated with more intensive vs. less intensive glucose control. Furthermore, specific glucose-lowering medications have not been shown to improve heart failure outcomes and some may actually have deleterious effects.

Empagliflozin is a potent and selective inhibitor of the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. By inhibiting SGLT2, empagliflozin reduces renal glucose reabsorption and increases urinary glucose excretion. In addition to reducing hyperglycaemia, empagliflozin is associated with osmotic diuresis, reductions in weight and blood pressure without increases in heart rate, and has favourable effects on markers of arterial stiffness and vascular resistance, albuminuria, and serum uric acid.

In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME ® trial, treatment with empagliflozin added to standard of care reduced the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke (3-point major adverse cardiovascular events), cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, and overall mortality compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk. Here we report further analyses of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME ® trial with respect to heart failure outcomes in the overall patient population and in subgroups, including patients with investigator-reported heart failure at baseline, and the effect of empagliflozin on hospitalization due to any cause.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors in heart failure: current management, unmet needs, and therapeutic prospects [^116B3gRC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

A recent meta‐analysis of the three CVOT analyses showed that SGLT‐2 inhibitors, as a class, reduced the risk of hHF by 31%, and again that this risk reduction was consistent in patients with and without recognized atherosclerotic disease (≈30% reduction in risk of hHF in both subgroups) and in patients with and without a history of HF. 56 Real‐world studies, such as CVD‐REAL (Comparative Effectiveness of Cardiovascular Outcomes in New Users of SGLT‐2 Inhibitors) and the ongoing EMPRISE (Non‐interventional Study on the Effectiveness and Safety of Empagliflozin Compared With DPP‐4 Inhibitors in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes in the United States) trial, have also demonstrated the positive effects of SGLT‐2 inhibitors on hHF prevention in patients with T2D irrespective of atherosclerotic disease status, providing consistent results in a practice‐based setting. 57, 58, 59

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1168sZX6]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Heart failure and diabetes — sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) — The American Diabetes Association guidelines recommend the use of SGLT2i as first‑line agent for hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes with HF or at high risk of HF, and SGLT2i are the first class of glucose‑lowering agents to receive FDA approval for treatment of HFrEF. In type 2 diabetes, SGLT2i including canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and sotagliflozin are associated with reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events including hospitalization for HF and cardiovascular death. Two RCTs totaling 8474 patients with NYHA class II, III, or IV HF and EF ≤ 40% (DAPA‑HF and EMPEROR‑Reduced) showed significant reductions in the relative risk of all‑cause death (13%).

The EMPEROR-Reduced trial was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of placebo vs empagliflozin 10 mg among 3,730 HFrEF patients. Herein, the population was stratified into 4 groups: no diuretic and diuretic dose equivalent to furosemide < 40, 40, and > 40 mg daily at baseline.

Results

A total of 3,656 patients from the EMPEROR-Reduced trial were available for analysis. Of those patients, 482 (13.2%) were receiving no diuretic therapy, and 731 (20.0%), 1,411 (38.6%), and 1,032 (28.2%) were receiving < 40 mg, 40 mg, and > 40 mg, respectively. The efficacy of empagliflozin on the primary outcome (time to first event of hospitalization for HF or cardiovascular [CV] death) was consistent regardless of background diuretic therapy (> 40 mg: HR: 0.88 [95% CI: 0.71–1.10]; 40 mg: HR: 0.65 [95% CI: 0.51–0.82]; < 40 mg: HR: 0.65 [95% CI: 0.46–0.92]); no diuretic agents: HR: 0.78 [95% CI: 0.47–1.29]; P trend test = 0.192). Baseline diuretic doses did not influence the effect of empagliflozin on body weight, systolic blood pressure, NT-proBNP, or hematocrit at 52 weeks. The safety profile of empagliflozin vs placebo was unaffected by baseline diuretic dose; however, independently of treatment allocation, total rates of adverse events were higher among patients with higher baseline doses of diuretic agents.

Conclusions

Empagliflozin exhibits a consistent effect on time to CV death or HF hospitalization and an unaltered safety profile regardless of baseline diuretic therapy. (EMPagliflozin outcomE tRial in Patients With chrOnic heaRt Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction [EMPEROR-Reduced]; NCT03057977).

14.4 Heart Failure Trials in Adults

EMPEROR-Reduced (NCT03057977) was a double-blind trial conducted in adults with chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class II-IV) with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% to evaluate the efficacy of JARDIANCE as adjunct to standard of care heart failure therapy.

Of 3,730 patients, 1,863 were randomized to JARDIANCE 10 mg and 1,867 to placebo and were followed for a median of 16 months. The mean age of the trial population was 67 years (range: 25 to 94 years) and 76% were men, 24% were women, and 27% were 75 years of age or older. Approximately 71% of the trial population were White, 18% Asian, and 7% Black or African American. At baseline, 50% of the patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus.

At randomization, 75% of patients were NYHA class II, 24% were class III, and 0.5% were class IV. The mean LVEF was 28%. At baseline, the mean eGFR was 62 mL/min/1.73 m2and the median urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) was 22 mg/g. Approximately half of the patients (52%) had eGFR equal to or above 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, 24% had eGFR 45 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, 19% had eGFR 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 5% had eGFR 20 to less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2.

### The potential role and rationale for treatment of heart failure with sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors [^1152sjjk]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2017). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are both growing public health concerns contributing to major medical and economic burdens to society. T2DM increases the risk of HF, frequently occurs concomitantly with HF, and worsens the prognosis of HF. Several anti-hyperglycaemic medications have been associated with a concern for worse HF outcomes. More recently, the results of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial showed that the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin was associated with a pronounced and precocious 38% reduction in cardiovascular mortality in subjects with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease [Correction added on 8 September 2017, after first online publication: "32%" in the previous sentence was corrected to "38%"]. These benefits were more related to a reduction in incident HF events rather than to ischaemic vascular endpoints. Several mechanisms have been put forward to explain these benefits, which also raise the possibility of using these drugs as therapies not only in the prevention of HF, but also for the treatment of patients with established HF regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes. Several large trials are currently exploring this postulate.

Study Assessments

Patients who fulfilled prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomized, double-blind (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive placebo or empagliflozin 10 mg daily, in addition to their usual therapy for heart failure. After randomization, all appropriate treatments for heart failure or other medical conditions could be initiated or altered at the clinical discretion of the investigator in response to changes in each patient's clinical status. Patients were assessed at study visits for major outcomes, symptoms and functional capacity related to heart failure, changes in medications used for heart failure, vital signs, biomarkers reflecting changes in the course of heart failure or the action of SGLT2 inhibitors, and adverse events; these assessments took place every 2 to 6 months, depending on the metric and the duration of follow-up. All randomized patients were followed for the occurrence of prespecified outcomes for the entire duration of the trial, regardless of whether the study participants were taking their study medications or were compliant with study procedures.

### Effect of empagliflozin on the clinical stability of patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction: the EMPEROR-reduced trial [^116JSDgy]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

In addition to the adjudication and characterization of hospitalizations for heart failure, at each scheduled study visit, patients were prospectively asked about interval events and changes in the use of diuretics that reflected the occurrence of worsening heart failure since the last visit. Events that were considered to reflect clinical deterioration included: (1) worsening heart failure that required the use of an intravenous drug for heart failure in an emergency department; (2) worsening heart failure that required the use of an intravenous drug for heart failure in an outpatient urgent care setting; (3) intensification of daily doses of diuretics for worsening symptoms; and (4) worsening NYHA functional class. Events treated in an emergency department, urgent care setting, or during a hospital stay shorter than that required for an adjudicated event were grouped together. Physicians were not provided any specific guidance as to the degree or duration of diuretic intensification that would qualify as representing a clinically meaningful change. Ascertainment of these events and measures were prospectively collected in the case report form, and their inclusion in analyses of individual and composite end points was prespecified before the blind of the trial was broken.

Statistical Analysis

For time-to-first-event analyses, differences between the placebo and empagliflozin groups were assessed for statistical significance using a Cox proportional hazards model, with prespecified covariates of age, sex, geographical region, diabetes status at baseline, left ventricular ejection fraction, and estimated glomerular filtration rate at baseline. For these analyses, the assumption of proportional hazards was investigated, and no violations were observed. For the analysis of total (first and repeated) events, between-group differences were assessed using a joint frailty model, with cardiovascular death (for end points including heart failure events) or all-cause mortality (for end points including all-cause hospitalization) as competing risks, and using covariates that were used for time-to-first-event analyses. For the analysis of changes in vital signs and laboratory measurements, treatment effects were assessed based on changes from baseline using a mixed model for repeated measures that included age and baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate as linear covariates and baseline score by visit, visit by treatment, sex, region, baseline left ventricular ejection fraction, individual last projected visit based on dates of randomization and trial closure, and baseline diabetes status as fixed effects. The analysis of changes in NT-proBNP was performed on log-transformed data. All P values reported are 2-sided, and P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Empagliflozin (SGLT2i) in HF with LVEF ≥ 40% — EMPEROR‑Preserved showed a significant benefit of empagliflozin in symptomatic HF with LVEF ≥ 40% and elevated natriuretic peptides. The primary composite was reduced by 21%, driven mostly by a 29% reduction in time to first hospitalization, with nonsignificant lower cardiovascular death (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.76–1.09) and no benefit on all‑cause mortality. Additional effects included a significant reduction in total HF hospitalizations, a decrease in the slope of eGFR decline, and a modest improvement in QOL at 52 weeks; benefit was similar irrespective of diabetes, there was no significant interaction by LVEF subgroups (< 50%, 50%– < 60%, and ≥ 60%), and there was a signal for lower benefit at higher LVEFs ≥ 62.5%.

### Diabetes mellitus and heart failure [^111DFr5b]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Epidemiologic and clinical data from the last 2 decades have shown that the prevalence of heart failure in diabetes is very high, and the prognosis for patients with heart failure is worse in those with diabetes than in those without diabetes. Experimental data suggest that various mechanisms contribute to the impairment in systolic and diastolic function in patients with diabetes, and there is an increased recognition that these patients develop heart failure independent of the presence of coronary artery disease or its associated risk factors. In addition, current clinical data demonstrated that treatment with the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin reduced hospitalization for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and high cardiovascular risk. This review article summarizes recent data on the prevalence, prognosis, pathophysiology, and therapeutic strategies to treat patients with diabetes and heart failure.

3.2 events

In the meta‐analysis comprising patients at low/medium CV risk (placebo‐controlled Phase III studies) or high CV risk (EMPA‐REG OUTCOME), empagliflozin reduced the risk of the primary endpoint of 4‐point MACE compared with placebo [HR: 0.86 (95% CI 0.76, 0.98)] and the secondary endpoint of 3‐point MACE [HR: 0.84 (95% CI 0.73, 0.96)] (Figure 1). These results were driven by a reduction in risk of CV death [HR: 0.61 (95% CI 0.49, 0.76)] (Figure 1); based on the 95% Cis, there were no differences between empagliflozin and placebo in the risk of MI, non‐fatal MI, stroke, non‐fatal stroke or hospitalization for unstable angina. The time to occurrence of CV death with empagliflozin and placebo is shown in Figure 2. Empagliflozin reduced the risk of all‐cause mortality compared with placebo [HR: 0.68 (95% CI 0.57, 0.81)] (Figure 1). The time to occurrence of all‐cause mortality with empagliflozin and placebo is shown in Figure 3. Empagliflozin reduced the risk of hospitalization for heart failure [HR: 0.63 (95% CI 0.48, 0.81)] and the composite endpoint of hospitalization for heart failure or CV death compared with placebo [HR: 0.64 (95% CI 0. 54, 0.76)] (Figure 1). For all endpoints, results for the individual empagliflozin dose groups were consistent with those in the pooled empagliflozin group (Figure 1). Results for 4‐point MACE and 3‐point MACE in patients at low/medium or high CV risk were consistent across the trials included in the meta‐analysis (Figures 4 and 5).

### Comparative effectiveness of empagliflozin vs liraglutide or sitagliptin in older adults with diverse patient characteristics [^1171Hhaj]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the comparative risk of cardiovascular outcomes associated with empagliflozin vs liraglutide or sitagliptin, overall and across strata of age, sex, baseline atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease?

Findings

In this comparative effectiveness study of 45 788 patients with type 2 diabetes initiating empagliflozin vs liraglutide and 45 624 patients initiating empagliflozin vs sitagliptin, empagliflozin was associated with a lower risk of hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) vs liraglutide and with both modified major adverse cardiovascular events and HHF vs sitagliptin, with larger absolute benefits in patients with cardiorenal diseases.

Meaning

These findings suggest that older adults with type 2 diabetes might benefit more from empagliflozin vs liraglutide or sitagliptin with respect to the risk of HHF; with respect to the risk of major cardiovascular events, empagliflozin might be preferable to liraglutide only in patients with cardiovascular disease history and to sitagliptin across all patient subgroups.

### Empagliflozin for heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction with and without diabetes [^116GK85j]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Background:

Empagliflozin improves outcomes in patients with heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction, but whether the effects are consistent in patients with and without diabetes remains to be elucidated.

Methods:

Patients with class II through IV heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction > 40% were randomized to receive empagliflozin 10 mg or placebo in addition to usual therapy. We undertook a prespecified analysis comparing the effects of empagliflozin versus placebo in patients with and without diabetes.

Results:

Of the 5988 patients enrolled, 2938 (49%) had diabetes. The risk of the primary outcome (first hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death), total hospitalizations for heart failure, and estimated glomerular filtration rate decline was higher in patients with diabetes. Empagliflozin reduced the rate of the primary outcome irrespective of diabetes status (hazard ratio, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.67, 0.94] for patients with diabetes versus hazard ratio, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.64, 0.95] in patients without diabetes; P interaction = 0.92). The effect of empagliflozin to reduce total hospitalizations for heart failure was also consistent in patients with and without diabetes. The effect of empagliflozin to attenuate estimated glomerular filtration rate decline during double-blind treatment was also present in patients with and without diabetes, although more pronounced in patients with diabetes (1.77 in diabetes versus 0.98 mL/min/1.73m 2 in patients without diabetes; P interaction = 0.01). Across these 3 end points, the effect of empagliflozin did not differ in patients with prediabetes or normoglycemia (33% and 18% of the patient population, respectively). When investigated as a continuous variable, baseline hemoglobin A1c did not modify the effects on the primary outcome (P interaction = 0.26). There was no increased risk of hypoglycemic events in either subgroup as compared with placebo.

Conclusions:

In patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction enrolled in the EMPEROR-Preserved (Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction), empagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of heart failure outcomes irrespective of diabetes status at baseline.

### Sodium ‑ glucose co-transporter ‑ 2 inhibitors in the treatment of diabetes with heart failure [^112MWFPx]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Recently, the 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure was released. The 2022 heart failure guideline provides recommendations based on contemporary evidence for the treatment of these patients. The recommendations present an evidence-based approach to managing patients with heart failure, with the intent to improve the quality of care and align with patients' interests. The publication of some landmark clinical trials may rewrite the guideline, but the guideline is not referenced. The 2022 guideline stated in patients with heart failure and type 2 diabetes, the use of sodium‑glucose co-transporter‑2 inhibitors is recommended for the management of hyperglycemia and to reduce heart failure-related morbidity and mortality (Class 1, Level A) based on EMPEROR-Reduced, DAPA-HF, and DECLARE-TIMI 58. It is worth noting that empagliflozin/dapagliflozin reduced cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with heart failure and diabetes, but the ejection fraction was ≤ 40% in EMPEROR-Reduced and DAPA-HF, < 45% in DECLARE-TIMI 58, respectively. In other words, empagliflozin/dapagliflozin only reduces cardiovascular outcomes in diabetes with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and partial mildly reduced ejection fraction. Notably, PRESERVED-HF and CHIEF-HF indicated that dapagliflozin/canagliflozin improved surrogate endpoints (such as Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire total symptom score) in patients with diabetes and heart failure (ejection fraction was ≥ 45% in PRESERVED-HF and was not limited in CHIEF-HF). Moreover, EMPEROR-Preserved was released that empagliflozin reduced the combined risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (more than 40%), regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes. Ongoing DELIVER will provide new evidence for dapagliflozin in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (more than 40%) with or without diabetes.

Collectively, our current evidence mainly focuses on empagliflozin/dapagliflozin in the treatment of diabetes with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and empagliflozin in the treatment of diabetes with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. The role of other types of sodium‑glucose co-transporter‑2 inhibitors in diabetes with heart failure, especially in diabetes with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, still needs high-quality evidence.

### Timing and adherence matter for sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in heart failure [^113hZ6ro]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Flowchart of the included cohort for the analyses.

ICD indicates International Classification of Diseases; and SGLT‐2i, sodium–glucose cotransporter‐2 inhibitor.

If the SGLT‐2i initial prescription date was before the index date of the HF diagnosis, this was categorized as SGLT‐2i before the index diagnosis of HF (ie, prescribed when the patients with diabetes were either in stage B or stage A HF) and if it was after the index HF diagnosis date, this group was categorized as SGLT‐2i after the index HF diagnosis (ie, stage C HF).

To test timing hypothesis, SGLT‐2i exposure duration in days before the index diagnosis of HF among patients with diabetes was calculated according to physician electronic prescription claims (according to the first and the last prescription day of any dose of either dapagliflozin or empagliflozin). Hence, for those whose initial SGLT‐2i prescription date was before the index HF diagnosis, duration of SGLT‐2i exposure was calculated by subtracting anticipated date of the last dose of SGLT‐2i according to the last prescription (or index date of HF diagnosis if it exceeds that time window) from the initial prescription date of the SGLT‐2i. Median duration was calculated then to yield those above and below median duration.

### Cardiovascular benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in diabetic and nondiabetic patients [^113m3udX]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Empagliflozin

The EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial in patients with T2DM and CVD demonstrated that empagliflozin, as compared with placebo, decreased the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), an effect that was principally ascribed to a significant reduction in risk of death from cardiovascular causes. Both the risk of hospitalization for HF and death from any cause were also markedly reduced by treatment with empagliflozin. Interestingly, a similar decrease in risk of MACE was observed in the two different dose groups in the trial, probably signifying a small dose–response relationship between the dose of empagliflozin and cardiovascular benefits. However, a marked correlation between changes in HbA1c and drug dose was observed, implying the involvement of mechanisms other than glycemic control in the cardiovascular benefits. This was later confirmed in several analyses of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial.

The EMPEROR-Reduced trial (Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure and a Reduced Ejection Fraction) in patients with HFrEF, together with New York Heart Association class II–IV symptoms, showed that empagliflozin, as compared with placebo, reduced the composite risk of hospitalization for worsening HF or death from cardiovascular causes, mainly driven by the reduced risk of the former, and increased KCCQ score at 52 weeks. The effects were of similar size whether diabetes was present or not, again revealing a cardiovascular benefit beyond the antidiabetic effect. As compared with other similar studies, the EMPEROR-Reduced trial extended the known cardiovascular protection of SGLT2i to patients with more advanced but stable HF.

Canagliflozin

In the CANVAS (Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study) program, the risk of MACE in patients with T2DM and CVD or multiple cardiovascular risk factors was reduced by treatment with canagliflozin, albeit without a significant decrease in death from cardiovascular causes or death from any cause. The CREDENCE (Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation) trial, which involved patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and T2DM, showed that treatment with canagliflozin improved the composite primary endpoint of end-stage kidney disease, doubling of serum creatinine level, or death from cardiorenal causes. Both trials indicated that canagliflozin markedly decreased the risk of hospitalization for HF. An analysis of the CREDENCE trial also found that the cardiorenal benefits were independent of glycemic control.

### Randomized trial of empagliflozin in nondiabetic patients with heart Failure and reduced ejection fraction [^116NbKhw]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Large clinical trials established the benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in patients with diabetes and with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The early and significant improvement in clinical outcomes is likely explained by effects beyond a reduction in hyperglycemia.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of empagliflozin on left ventricular (LV) function and volumes, functional capacity, and quality of life (QoL) in nondiabetic HFrEF patients.

Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, nondiabetic HFrEF patients (n = 84) were randomized to empagliflozin 10 mg daily or placebo for 6 months. The primary endpoint was change in LV end-diastolic and -systolic volume assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance. Secondary endpoints included changes in LV mass, LV ejection fraction, peak oxygen consumption in the cardiopulmonary exercise test, 6-min walk test, and quality of life.

Results

Empagliflozin was associated with a significant reduction of LV end-diastolic volume (-25.1 ± 26.0 mL vs. -1.5 ± 25.4 mL for empagliflozin vs. placebo, respectively; p < 0.001) and LV end-systolic volume (-26.6 ± 20.5 mL vs. -0.5 ± 21.9 mL for empagliflozin vs. placebo; p < 0.001). Empagliflozin was associated with reductions in LV mass (-17.8 ± 31.9 g vs. 4.1 ± 13.4 g, for empagliflozin vs. placebo, respectively; p < 0.001) and LV sphericity, and improvements in LV ejection fraction (6.0 ± 4.2 vs. -0.1 ± 3.9; p < 0.001). Patients who received empagliflozin had significant improvements in peak O 2 consumption (1.1 ± 2.6 ml/min/kg vs. -0.5 ± 1.9 ml/min/kg for empagliflozin vs. placebo, respectively; p = 0.017), oxygen uptake efficiency slope (111 ± 267 vs. -145 ± 318; p < 0.001), as well as in 6-min walk test (81 ± 64 m vs. -35 ± 68 m; p < 0.001) and quality of life (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-12: 21 ± 18 vs. 2 ± 15; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Empagliflozin administration to nondiabetic HFrEF patients significantly improves LV volumes, LV mass, LV systolic function, functional capacity, and quality of life when compared with placebo. Our observations strongly support a role for sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in the treatment of HFrEF patients independently of their glycemic status.

### Rationale and design of a randomized trial to test the safety and non-inferiority of canagliflozin in patients with diabetes with chronic heart failure: the CANDLE trial [^1133Cfez]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Previous clinical trials in T2DM patients demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors are well tolerated by patients and exert favorable effects on BP and systemic metabolisms such as body fat loss, in addition to improving glycemic control. Experimental studies using animal models have shown that SGLT2 inhibitors also reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in hepatic, renal, and cardiac tissues, and therefore presumably would have a protective effect on the CV system. These class effects would be expected to be highly advantageous for diabetic patients with increased CV risk, while the diuretic effects of SGLT2 inhibitors may also be potentially effective in CHF patients who require frequent administration of diuretic agents. However, there is no evidence clinical evidence on the clinical safety of SGLT2 inhibitors for heart failure, and it is possible excess intravascular fluid depletion may be exacerbated following administration of SGLT2 in patients with heart failure taking diuretics. Given this current status, it is necessary to assess the safety and efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors for diabetic patients with CHF.

The results of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial showed that administration of empagliflozin significantly reduced CV adverse outcomes in T2DM patients with higher CV risk. Compared to the placebo group, any cause of death including worsening of heart failure, was significantly lower in the empagliflozin group. In addition, a 35% relative risk reduction in hospitalization for heart failure was observed in the empagliflozin group. Although a significant reduction in hospitalization for heart failure was clearly documented, participants with heart failure comprised only about 10% of the trial population at baseline. Moreover, about 40% of the participants were taking diuretics at baseline, and therefore how to use SGLT2 inhibitors in conjunction with diuretics was of great concern in the clinical management of these patients. Taken together, the therapeutic effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in specific patients with heart failure have yet to be established (Fig. 1). It is therefore necessary to assess the clinical safety and efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors focusing on T2DM patients with CHF.

### Heart failure outcomes with empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk: results of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial [^117QXKnz]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME ® trial, the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin, given in addition to standard of care, reduced the risk of the composite endpoint of hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death, as well as its individual components, in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. Consistent reductions were observed across subgroups of patients defined by a variety of clinical characteristics, including the presence of heart failure at baseline and the use of medications commonly used in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes and/or heart failure, and between the two dose groups. In addition, empagliflozin reduced all-cause hospitalization, with both hospitalization for heart failure and hospitalization for other causes contributing to this reduction. The lower rate of introduction of loop diuretics in the empagliflozin group is consistent with a reduced incidence of hospitalization for heart failure. Importantly, prior to these findings, no glucose-lowering drug had been shown to improve heart failure outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. Indeed, the thiazolidinediones and the DPP-4 inhibitor saxagliptin have been associated with increased risk of heart failure hospitalization in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk.

### Design of a prospective patient-level pooled analysis of two parallel trials of empagliflozin in patients with established heart failure [^113zHpxq]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

The exclusion criteria in both trials were nearly identical. Specifically, patients were to be excluded if: (i) they had a cardiovascular disorder or are receiving treatments that increase the unpredictability of or may change their clinical course, independently of heart failure; (ii) they had an untreated or undertreated cardiovascular condition that may influence the course of heart failure or tolerability of the study medications; (iii) they had a significant co‐morbid condition that may influence the clinical course, independently of heart failure; or (iv) they had any condition that may jeopardize safety, limit participation in the trial, or undermine the interpretation of trial data.

In both trials, following a screening period lasting 4–28 days and after the dose of oral diuretics had been stable for at least one week, patients were randomized double‐blind (in a 1:1 manner) to receive placebo or empagliflozin 10 mg daily, in addition to their usual therapy for heart failure. 6, 10 In both trials, randomization was performed by using a permuted block design with a computer pseudo‐random number generator and was stratified by (i) geographical region (North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia, other); (ii) diabetes status at screening; and (iii) estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation at screening < 60 or ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Ejection fraction < 50% or ≥ 50% was an additional stratification variable in the EMPEROR‐Preserved trial. The number of patients randomized into EMPEROR‐Reduced and EMPEROR‐Preserved were 3730 and 5988, respectively. It was expected that half of the patients in each trial would not have diabetes at the time of their enrolment. Following randomization, all appropriate treatments for heart failure or other medical conditions may be initiated, adjusted or altered at the clinical discretion of each patient's physician or healthcare provider according to each patient's needs.

### Blinded withdrawal of long-term randomized treatment with empagliflozin or placebo in patients with heart failure [^111e7YFu]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Patient Population

The design and primary results of both trials have been previously published. Participants were men or women, ≥ 18 years of age with New York Heart Association functional class II to IV heart failure for ≥ 3 months. Patients were required to have an elevated N-terminal pro-hormone B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels (ie, > 300 pg/mL if the ejection fraction was > 40%; ≥ 2500 pg/mL if the ejection fraction was 36%–40%; ≥ 1000 pg/mL if the ejection fraction was 31%–35%; and ≥ 600 pg/mL if the ejection fraction was ≤ 30% or if patients had been hospitalized for heart failure within 12 months). If patients had atrial fibrillation, these thresholds were doubled in EMPEROR-Reduced and tripled in EMPEROR-Preserved. In both trials, patients were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or empagliflozin (10 mg once daily), in addition to recommended therapy. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to placebo or empagliflozin 10 mg daily, which were added to all recommended therapy for heart failure, for the duration of double-blind follow-up (median 16 months in EMPEROR-Reduced and 26 months in EMPEROR-Preserved). Randomization was stratified by geographical region, diabetes status, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, < 60 or ≥ 60 mL·min –1 ·1.73 m –2) in EMPEROR-Reduced and by the same variables and also by left ventricular ejection fraction (< 50% or ≥ 50%) in EMPEROR-Preserved. The protocol was approved by the local ethical committee at each of the participating sites, and all patients gave written informed consent.

### Effects of empagliflozin on risk for cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization across the spectrum of heart failure risk in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial [^116btBfo]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

Empagliflozin reduced the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death and heart failure (HF) hospitalizations in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and established CV disease (CVD) in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial. We investigated whether the benefit of empagliflozin was observed across the spectrum of HF risk.

Methods and Results

Seven thousand and twenty patients with T2D (HbA1c 7–10% and eGFR > 30mL/min/1.73 m2) were treated with empagliflozin 10 or 25mg, or placebo once daily and followed for median 3.1years. In patients without HF at baseline (89.9%), we derived the 5-year risk for incident HF using the 9-variable Health ABC HF Risk score [classified as low-to-average (< 10%), high (10–20%), and very high (≥ 20%)]. Overall, 67.2% of the population had low-to-average, 24.2% high, and 5.1% very high 5-year HF risk. Across these groups, the effect on CV death and HF hospitalization with empagliflozin was consistent [hazard ratio 0.71 (95% confidence interval: 0.52, 0.96), 0.52 (0.36, 0.75), and 0.55 (0.30, 1.00), respectively]. Effects on CV death in the ostensibly highest HF risk group (HF at baseline and/or incident HF during the trial) in whom 37.9% of the overall CV deaths occurred, was also beneficial [0.67 (0.47, 0.97)], yet, similar benefits were seen in the lower risk patients.

Conclusion

In patients with T2D and established CVD, a sizeable proportion without HF at baseline are at high or very high risk for HF outcomes, indicating the need for active case finding in this patient population. Empagliflozin consistently improved HF outcomes both in patients at low or high HF risk.

Adverse event rates consistent with urinary tract infection, volume depletion and acute renal failure were similar between the empagliflozin and placebo groups across the risk categories. There seemed to be a slight difference between treatment arms for confirmed hypoglycaemia events in the low‐intermediate and very‐high risk categories, but the incidence rate ratios for hypoglycaemia requiring assistance were similar between treatment arms. The rates of genital infection were greater with empagliflozin than placebo in all categories (Figure 5).

### Empagliflozin in heart failure: diuretic and cardiorenal effects [^116aSuV2]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors improve heart failure-related outcomes. The mechanisms underlying these benefits are not well understood, but diuretic properties may contribute. Traditional diuretics such as furosemide induce substantial neurohormonal activation, contributing to the limited improvement in intravascular volume often seen with these agents. However, the proximal tubular site of action of the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors may help circumvent these limitations.

Methods

Twenty patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic, stable heart failure completed a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study of empagliflozin 10 mg daily versus placebo. Patients underwent an intensive 6-hour biospecimen collection and cardiorenal phenotyping at baseline and again after 14 days of study drug. After a 2-week washout, patients crossed over to the alternate therapy with the above protocol repeated.

Results

Oral empagliflozin was rapidly absorbed as evidenced by a 27-fold increase in urinary glucose excretion by 3 hours (P < 0.0001). Fractional excretion of sodium increased significantly with empagliflozin monotherapy versus placebo (fractional excretion of sodium, 1.2 ± 0.7% versus 0.7 ± 0.4%; P = 0.001), and there was a synergistic effect in combination with bumetanide (fractional excretion of sodium, 5.8 ± 2.5% versus 3.9 ± 1.9%; P = 0.001). At 14 days, the natriuretic effect of empagliflozin persisted, resulting in a reduction in blood volume (-208 mL [interquartile range, -536 to 153 mL] versus -14 mL [interquartile range, -282 to 335 mL]; P = 0.035) and plasma volume (-138 mL, interquartile range, -379 to 154 ± 453 mL; P = 0.04). This natriuresis was not, however, associated with evidence of neurohormonal activation because the change in norepinephrine was superior (P = 0.02) and all other neurohormones were similar (P < 0.34) during the empagliflozin versus placebo period. Furthermore, there was no evidence of potassium wasting (P = 0.20) or renal dysfunction (P > 0.11 for all biomarkers), whereas both serum magnesium (P < 0.001) and uric acid levels (P = 0.008) improved.

Conclusions

Empagliflozin causes significant natriuresis, particularly when combined with loop diuretics, resulting in an improvement in blood volume. However, off-target electrolyte wasting, renal dysfunction, and neurohormonal activation were not observed. This favorable diuretic profile may offer significant advantage in the management of volume status in patients with heart failure and may represent a mechanism contributing to the superior long-term heart failure outcomes observed with these agents.

### Empagliflozin in the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in addition to background therapies and therapeutic combinations (EMPEROR-reduced): a post-hoc analysis of a randomised, double-blind trial [^113xQsZd]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Background

It is important to evaluate whether a new treatment for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) provides additive benefit to background foundational treatments. As such, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin in patients with HFrEF in addition to baseline treatment with specific doses and combinations of disease-modifying therapies.

Methods

We performed a post-hoc analysis of the EMPEROR-Reduced randomised, double-blind, parallel-group trial, which took place in 520 centres (hospitals and medical clinics) in 20 countries in Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. Patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification II-IV with an ejection fraction of 40% or less were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive the addition of either oral empagliflozin 10 mg per day or placebo to background therapy. The primary composite outcome was cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalisation; the secondary outcome was total heart failure hospital admissions. An extended composite outcome consisted of inpatient and outpatient HFrEF events was also evaluated. Outcomes were analysed according to background use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) or angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs), as well as β blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) at less than 50% or 50% or more of target doses and in various combinations. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03057977.

Findings

In this post-hoc analysis of 3730 patients (mean age 66·8 years [SD 11·0], 893 [23·9%] women; 1863 [49·9%] in the empagliflozin group, 1867 [50·1%] in the placebo group) assessed between March 6, 2017, and May 28, 2020, empagliflozin reduced the risk of the primary outcome (361 in 1863 participants in the empagliflozin group and 462 of 1867 in the placebo group; HR 0·75 [95% CI 0·65–0·86]) regardless of background therapy or its target doses for ACE inhibitors or ARBs at doses of less than 50% of the target dose (HR 0·85 [0·69–1·06]) and for doses of 50% or more of the target dose (HR 0·67 [0·52–0·88]; p interaction = 0·18). A similar result was seen for β blockers at doses of less than 50% of the target dose (HR 0·66 [0·54–0·80]) and for doses of 50% or more of the target dose (HR 0·81 [0·66–1·00]; p interaction = 0·15). Empagliflozin also reduced the risk of the primary outcome irrespective of background use of triple therapy with an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or ARNI plus β blocker plus MRA (given combination HR 0·73 [0·61–0·88]; not given combination HR 0·76 [0·62–0·94]; p interaction = 0·77). Similar patterns of benefit were observed for the secondary and extended composite outcomes. Empagliflozin was well tolerated and rates of hypotension, symptomatic hypotension, and hyperkalaemia were similar across all subgroups.

Interpretation

Empagliflozin reduced serious heart failure outcomes across doses and combinations of disease-modifying therapies for HFrEF. Clinically, these data suggest that empagliflozin might be considered as a foundational therapy in patients with HFrEF regardless of their existing background therapy.

### Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibition in patients hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure: rationale for and design of the EMPULSE trial [^112VxNuQ]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

Treatment with sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors improves outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction. There is limited experience with the in-hospital initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with acute HF (AHF) with or without diabetes. EMPULSE is designed to assess the clinical benefit and safety of the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin compared with placebo in patients hospitalized with AHF.

Methods

EMPULSE is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled multinational trial comparing the in-hospital initiation of empagliflozin (10mg once daily) with placebo. Approximately 500 patients admitted for AHF with dyspnoea, signs of fluid overload, and elevated natriuretic peptides will be randomized 1:1 stratified to HF status (de-novo and decompensated chronic HF) to either empagliflozin or placebo at approximately 165 sites across North America, Europe and Asia. Patients will be enrolled regardless of ejection fraction and diabetes status and will be randomized during hospitalization and after stabilization (between 24h and 5days after admission), with treatment continued up to 90days after initiation. The primary outcome is clinical benefit at 90days, consisting of a composite of all-cause death, HF events, and ≥ 5 point change from baseline in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire total symptom score (KCCQ-TSS), assessed using a 'win-ratio' approach. Secondary outcomes include assessments of safety, change in KCCQ-TSS from baseline to 90days and change in natriuretic peptides from baseline to 30days.

Conclusion

The EMPULSE trial will evaluate the clinical benefit and safety of empagliflozin in patients hospitalized for AHF.

Heart failure outcomes and cardiovascular death in overall patient population

The composite outcome of heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular death occurred in a significantly lower percentage of patients treated with empagliflozin [265/4687 patients (5.7%)] than placebo [198/2333 patients (8.5%)] [hazard ratio, HR: 0.66 (95% confidence interval, 95% CI: 0.55–0.79; P < 0.001)] (Figure 1 A and Table 1). The effect of empagliflozin on heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular death was consistent between doses (see Supplementary material online, Table S1 Supplementary Data) and across subgroups defined by a variety of baseline characteristics including age, race, eGFR, and use of glucose-lowering (including insulin) and cardiovascular medications [including renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers, β-blockers, diuretics (including loop diuretics), and statins] (Figure 2); subgroup analyses of 3-point major adverse cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death by use of loop diuretics at baseline are shown in Supplementary material online, Figure S2. The results of sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary analyses (see Supplementary material online, Figure S3), and there were no differences in censoring between empagliflozin and placebo. The median (interquartile range) of time to censoring for heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular death was 1167 (802–1297) days in the placebo group and 1167 (805–1307) days in the empagliflozin group. Empagliflozin also reduced the risk of the composite outcome of hospitalization for heart failure or death from heart failure (Table 1).

### Are SGLT-2 inhibitors the future of heart failure treatment? The EMPEROR-preserved and EMPEROR-reduced trials [^116QKk6H]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Heart failure is frequently associated with diabetes, and therapies which reduce mortality in people with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) are often limited to drugs which modulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system or heart rate control and occasionally to device therapy. Treatment is even more challenging in people with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), with currently no approved therapy demonstrating a mortality-improving effect, limiting treatment to diuretics for the alleviation of the symptoms of fluid overload and risk factor management. Previous cardiovascular outcome trials for sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors have demonstrated significant favourable outcomes for cardiovascular disease, heart failure hospitalisation and all-cause mortality. The aim of the nearly completed EMPEROR-preserved and EMPEROR-reduced trials is to determine the impact of empagliflozin on cardiovascular and heart failure outcomes in people with HFpEF or HFrEF with or without diabetes. The trials will add substantially to our understanding of SGLT-2 inhibitors in the treatment of HFrEF and may have major implications for the treatment of people with HFpEF. The study will also be powered to address the impact of empagliflozin on changes in renal function in people with and without diabetes and incident diabetes in the participants without diabetes at baseline. In this article we discuss the rationale for using SGLT-2 inhibitors in people with heart failure and explore the potential findings and importance of the ongoing EMPEROR-preserved and EMPEROR-reduced trials.

Benefits on heart failure events in trials of sodium–glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes, with or without heart failure

When the findings in trials in diabetes are combined, treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors is accompanied by ≈30% reduction in the risk of heart failure hospitalization and a ≈40–50% reduction in the risk of serious adverse renal events, including the development of end-stage kidney disease. The magnitude of these benefits is consistent across the various trials, and the effects are statistically robust and clinically important. However, in contrast to these striking effects on non-fatal events, these drugs have inconsistent effects on mortality. Depending on the trial, estimates of a treatment effect on survival have varied from virtually no reduction to as high as ≈40% decrease in risk. Accordingly, when the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiovascular death in individual trials were combined in a meta-analysis, the magnitude of the mortality benefit was modest (a 15% reduction in risk) and characterized by significant heterogeneity.

The consistency of the effect on non-fatal heart failure events and the inconsistency of the effect on cardiovascular death is well-illustrated in two trials with dapagliflozin and empagliflozin in type 2 diabetes (DECLARE-TIMI58 and EMPA-REG OUTCOMES, respectively), Table 1. Both trials demonstrated a similar and robust reduction in the risk of heart failure hospitalizations as well as a decrease in the risk of clinically important progression of renal disease. However, when all randomized patients are considered, SGLT2 inhibition reduced the risk of cardiovascular death by 38% in the trial with empagliflozin but by only 2% in the trial with dapagliflozin. When the analysis is confined to comparable groups of patients (i.e. those with a prior myocardial infarction), the risk reductions for cardiovascular death were 41% in the trial with empagliflozin and 8% in the trial with dapagliflozin. These two estimates represent opposite extremes of the pooled estimate of a 15% reduction in the risk of death reported in a meta-analysis.

### Heart failure outcomes with empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk: results of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial [^111VGimw]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

We previously reported that in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME(®) trial, empagliflozin added to standard of care reduced the risk of 3-point major adverse cardiovascular events, cardiovascular and all-cause death, and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk. We have now further investigated heart failure outcomes in all patients and in subgroups, including patients with or without baseline heart failure.

Methods and Results

Patients were randomized to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo. Seven thousand and twenty patients were treated; 706 (10.1%) had heart failure at baseline. Heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular death occurred in a significantly lower percentage of patients treated with empagliflozin [265/4687 patients (5.7%)] than with placebo [198/2333 patients (8.5%)] [hazard ratio, HR: 0.66 (95% confidence interval: 0.55–0.79); P < 0.001], corresponding to a number needed to treat to prevent one heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular death of 35 over 3 years. Consistent effects of empagliflozin were observed across subgroups defined by baseline characteristics, including patients with vs. without heart failure, and across categories of medications to treat diabetes and/or heart failure. Empagliflozin improved other heart failure outcomes, including hospitalization for or death from heart failure [2.8 vs. 4.5%; HR: 0.61 (0.47–0.79); P < 0.001] and was associated with a reduction in all-cause hospitalization [36.8 vs. 39.6%; HR: 0.89 (0.82–0.96); P = 0.003]. Serious adverse events and adverse events leading to discontinuation were reported by a higher proportion of patients with vs. without heart failure at baseline in both treatment groups, but were no more common with empagliflozin than with placebo.

Conclusion

In patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk, empagliflozin reduced heart failure hospitalization and cardiovascular death, with a consistent benefit in patients with and without baseline heart failure.

### Empagliflozin in heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction [^113eU5Rj]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, but their effects in patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction are uncertain.

Methods

In this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 5988 patients with class II-IV heart failure and an ejection fraction of more than 40% to receive empagliflozin (10 mg once daily) or placebo, in addition to usual therapy. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure.

Results

Over a median of 26.2 months, a primary outcome event occurred in 415 of 2997 patients (13.8%) in the empagliflozin group and in 511 of 2991 patients (17.1%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69 to 0.90; P < 0.001). This effect was mainly related to a lower risk of hospitalization for heart failure in the empagliflozin group. The effects of empagliflozin appeared consistent in patients with or without diabetes. The total number of hospitalizations for heart failure was lower in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group (407 with empagliflozin and 541 with placebo; hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.88; P < 0.001). Uncomplicated genital and urinary tract infections and hypotension were reported more frequently with empagliflozin.

Conclusions

Empagliflozin reduced the combined risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure in patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction, regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes.

### Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors as an early, first-line therapy in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction [^111NtvKk]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

In the present review we summarized data supporting an early initiation of dapagliflozin, empagliflozin or, limited to diabetic patients, sotagliflozin, in patients with HFrEF. These drugs embody most of the ideal characteristics for a HFrEF medication, including single dose, once daily administration, no need for titration, early beneficial effects on clinical events and patient‐reported quality of life, and favourable safety and tolerability profile. The tendency to focus on possible side effects may lead to under‐prescription of evidence‐based medical therapy. However, in the case of SGLT2 inhibitors, serious adverse events are not different from placebo, so that strong and early efficacy is associated with safety and tolerability. Importantly, this includes minimal to no effect on SBP, reduced risk of hyperkalaemia, and favourable effects on renal outcomes, all of which complicate and limit management with neurohormonal antagonists and modulators. Guideline recommendations support the use of SGLT2 inhibitors (e.g. dapagliflozin, empagliflozin and sotagliflozin if concomitant T2DM) in addition to other GDMTs. In the rare case of really naive patients, until recently, there was only evidence for the start of ACEi and beta‐blockers together. With the presentation of EMPULSE trial results, we have also evidence for the safe and effective initiation of the SGLT2 inhibitor, empagliflozin, in patients with both de‐novo acute HF or decompensated chronic HF, once stabilization is achieved (Graphical Abstract). Thus, data summarized in this review support the early 'upfront' use of dapagliflozin or empagliflozin, rather than sequencing behind the other drugs acting on neurohormonal mechanisms (Table 3). The option for a simultaneous or rapid sequence strategy for quadruple medical therapy in patients with HFrEF should be personalized depending on patient characteristics and it is reasonable to propose different sequences with, however, SGLT2 inhibitors as possible first‐line therapy in most cases. Based on tolerability, target dose may or may not be able to be achieved or in certain circumstances decreases in dosing may be required, to ensure each medication is well tolerated. Due to lack of experience, when quadruple therapy is simultaneously or rapidly introduced, physicians should be more cautious and a close monitoring of electrolytes, kidney function and blood pressure may be appropriate.

### Design of a prospective patient-level pooled analysis of two parallel trials of empagliflozin in patients with established heart failure [^116UECmz]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

In addition to the pre‐specification of the composite of serious adverse renal outcomes as the primary endpoint, the pooled analysis has three secondary endpoints: (i) all‐cause mortality; (ii) cardiovascular death; and (iii) time to new‐onset diabetes in patients with pre‐diabetes.

All pre‐specified endpoints will be evaluated as time‐to‐first‐event analyses, using Cox proportional hazards model with the following covariates: treatment, study, gender, geographical region and baseline glycaemic status as categorical variables, and ejection fraction, eGFR and age as continuous variables. Subgroup analyses will be based on age, sex, race, body mass index, ischaemic vs. non‐ischaemic aetiology of heart failure, presence or absence of chronic kidney disease, left ventricular ejection fraction, diabetes at baseline, systolic blood pressure, heart failure hospitalization within 12 months, New York Heart Association functional class, history of atrial fibrillation or flutter, and baseline use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

### Effect of empagliflozin on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with heart failure by baseline diabetes status: results from the EMPEROR-reduced trial [^111CrExd]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

There were no meaningful imbalances in tolerability or safety events between the empagliflozin and placebo groups among patients with heart failure with and without diabetes. Adverse effects that are typical of other heart failure medications (such as hyperkalemia and hypotension) were observed similarly in the placebo and empagliflozin groups. No reports of diabetic ketoacidosis or severe hypoglycemic episode occurred with empagliflozin in patients with prediabetes or normoglycemia. This shows the favorable benefit–risk profile of empagliflozin and provides reassurance to clinicians in initiating SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with heart failure who do not have diabetes.

Our findings should be considered in light of both strengths and limitations of the current trial. Each of our major end points was prespecified and the analysis of the effect of empagliflozin in patients with and without diabetes was designated as our most important subgroup analysis. The patients without diabetes comprised a substantial proportion of our population (50%) and we were also able to study the effect of empagliflozin in a considerable number of patients with prediabetes. Because insulin resistance is exceptionally common in heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, we expected that the proportion of patients with normoglycemia would be comparatively small, leading to estimates of a treatment effect in patients with normoglycemia that were necessarily less precise. However, when comparing the magnitude of the treatment effect across the 3 glycemia subgroups, there was a remarkable consistency of the benefit of empagliflozin with no evidence for heterogeneity.

In this secondary analysis of EMPEROR-Reduced, empagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalizations, decreased total hospitalizations for heart failure, slowed decline in renal function, prevented serious renal events, and improved measures of health status to a similar degree in patients with and without diabetes. Our findings reinforce those recently reported in a similar trial with dapagliflozin in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, but we extend those findings to include benefits on the evolution of renal disease as well as defined benefits in patients with prediabetes and no glycemic disorder. The combined results of the 2 trials reinforce a new role for SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction independent of diabetes or the baseline level of glycohemoglobin.

### Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride (Synjardy) [^114vbHmd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Empagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of first occurrence of primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.99). The treatment effect was due to a significant reduction in the risk of CV death in subjects randomized to empagliflozin (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.77), with no change in the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke (see Table 13 and Figures 4 and 5). Results for the 10 mg and 25 mg empagliflozin dosages were consistent with results for the combined dosage groups.

Figure 4	Estimated Cumulative Incidence of First MACE

Figure 5	Estimated Cumulative Incidence of CV Death

The efficacy of empagliflozin on CV death was generally consistent across major demographic and disease subgroups.

Vital status was obtained for 99.2% of subjects in the trial. A total of 463 deaths were recorded during the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial. Most of these deaths were categorized as CV deaths. The non-CV deaths were only a small proportion of deaths and were balanced between the treatment groups (2.1% in patients treated with empagliflozin, and 2.4% of patients treated with placebo).

SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin — EMPEROR-Preserved outcomes and HFmrEF-relevant subgroup: EMPEROR-Preserved showed a significant benefit of the SGLT2i, empagliflozin, in patients with symptomatic HF, with LVEF > 40% and elevated natriuretic peptides. The 21% reduction in the primary composite endpoint of time to HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death was driven mostly by a significant 29% reduction in time to HF hospitalization (nonsignificant lower cardiovascular death [HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.76–1.0]), with no benefit on all-cause mortality. Empagliflozin also resulted in a significant reduction in total HF hospitalizations, decrease in the slope of the eGFR decline, and a modest improvement in QOL at 52 weeks, and the benefit was similar irrespective of the presence or absence of diabetes at baseline. In a subgroup of 1983 patients with LVEF 41% to 49% in EMPEROR-Preserved, empagliflozin reduced the risk of the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for HF, and the benefit in the primary endpoint did not have a significant interaction by LVEF subgroups (41%–49%, 50%– < 60%, and ≥ 60%).

### Renal and cardiovascular effects of SGLT2 inhibition in combination with loop diuretics in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic heart failure: the RECEDE-CHF trial [^113Q4dy8]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

SGLT2 (sodium-glucose cotransporter-2) inhibitors improve heart failure-associated outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. In patients with heart failure, SGLT2 inhibitors will likely be coprescribed with a loop diuretic, but this combined effect is not well-defined. Our aim was to assess the diuretic and natriuretic effect of empagliflozin in combination with loop diuretics.

Methods

The RECEDE-CHF trial (SGLT2 Inhibition in Combination With Diuretics in Heart Failure) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of patients with type 2 diabetes and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction taking regular loop diuretic who were randomized to empagliflozin 25 mg once daily or placebo for 6 weeks with a 2-week washout period. The primary outcome was change in 24-hour urinary volume from baseline to week 6.

Results

Twenty-three participants (mean age, 69.8 years; 73.9% male; mean furosemide dose, 49.6 ± 31.3 mg/d; mean HbA1c, 7.9 ± 3.8%) were recruited. Compared with placebo, empagliflozin caused a significant increase in 24-hour urinary volume at both day 3 (mean difference, 535 mL [95% CI, 133–936]; P = 0.005) and week 6 (mean difference, 545 mL [95% CI, 136–954]; P = 0.005) after adjustment for treatment order, baseline 24-hour urine volume, and percentage change in loop diuretic dose. At 6 weeks, empagliflozin did not cause a significant change in 24-hour urinary sodium (mean difference, -7.85 mmol/L [95% CI, -2.43 to 6.73]; P = 0.57). Empagliflozin caused a nonsignificant increase in fractional excretion of sodium at day 3, which was absent at week 6 (mean difference day 3, 0.30% [95% CI, -0.03 to 0.63]; P = 0.09; week 6, 0.11% [95% CI, -0.22 to 0.44]; P > 0.99), and a significant increase in electrolyte-free water clearance at week 6 (mean difference, 312 mL [95% CI, 26–598]; P = 0.026) compared with placebo. Empagliflozin also caused significant reductions in body weight and serum urate at week 6.

Conclusions

Empagliflozin caused a significant increase in 24-hour urine volume without an increase in urinary sodium when used in combination with loop diuretic. Registration: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique Identifier: NCT03226457.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115o2419]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus with heart failure — SGLT-2 inhibitors to prevent hospitalization: For adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure, we recommend a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor to prevent hospital admissions for heart failure. The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation, categorized it as Reviewed, New-added, stated that the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was high, and found that the benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors in reducing hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) for patients with T2DM and HF outweighed the potential harm. Guideline-directed medical therapy includes SGLT-2 inhibitors as part of an initial "four pillar" approach for patients with heart failure along with angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors, beta blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and adding an SGLT-2 inhibitor to a regimen in a patient already achieving glycemic goals might require de-escalation of other medications to limit the risk of hypoglycemia. Evidence cited notes empagliflozin has been shown effective in patients with reduced and preserved ejection fraction and that dapagliflozin similarly reduced the rate of heart failure outcomes, while some systematic reviews suggest that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) might also reduce HHF but the overall impact on HHF is likely minimal without albiglutide, which is no longer marketed in the U.S. Implementation should consider patient factors and tolerability described here, including urinary frequency (especially with coexisting bladder or prostate conditions), a history of recurrent or severe genitourinary infections, and in older patients on other antihypertensives or diuretics or those with systolic heart failure the possibility of symptomatic hypotension or volume depletion that might require de-escalation or discontinuation of therapy.

### The SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin in patients hospitalized for acute heart failure: a multinational randomized trial [^114J5iVF]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Initiation of the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin in patients hospitalized for acute heart failure resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit in the 90 days after randomization. Both a reduction in all-cause death and HFEs as well as an improvement in quality of life contributed to the increased number of wins in the empagliflozin group. We believe that the primary endpoint is meaningful because it allows the hierarchical assessment of benefit across three fundamental goals of care: improvement of survival, reduction of HFEs, and improvement of symptoms.

The effect was consistent across a broad spectrum of patients with reduced and preserved LVEF, acute de novo or decompensated chronic heart failure, and those with or without diabetes. Empagliflozin was well tolerated without safety concerns. The results of EMPULSE add to the accumulating evidence on the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors in heart failure –.

EMPULSE is distinct from previous trials with SGLT2 inhibitors for several reasons. In particular, patients in EMPULSE were randomized early in the course of hospitalization for acute heart failure, at a median of 3 days after hospital admission. In the Effect of Sotagliflozin on Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Post Worsening Heart Failure (SOLOIST-WHF) trial, more than half of the patients were enrolled after hospital discharge and that trial included only patients with diabetes. In addition, EMPULSE evaluated patients over the first 90 days after hospital admission, often considered the vulnerable phase of heart failure. Also, EMPULSE included patients without a previous history of heart failure (that is, acute de novo), who were not yet treated for heart failure. The data support that adding empagliflozin to standard therapy was well tolerated and produced similar clinical benefit as in those with chronic decompensated heart failure. Thus, empagliflozin should be considered as an efficacious treatment in patients hospitalized for both de novo and decompensated acute heart failure.

### Heart failure outcomes with empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk: results of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial [^115d4nuJ]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Consistent with the adjudicated results, the proportions of patients with investigator-reported heart failure and with investigator-reported serious heart failure were significantly lower with empagliflozin than with placebo (Table 1). Loop diuretics were introduced in a significantly lower proportion of patients in the empagliflozin group than the placebo group [HR: 0.62 (95% CI: 0.53–0.73); P < 0.001] (see Supplementary material online, Figures S4 and S5). Empagliflozin also reduced the risk of the composite outcomes of hospitalization for heart failure or introduction of loop diuretics [HR: 0.63 (95% CI: 0.54–0.73); P < 0.001] and heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular death or introduction of loop diuretics [HR: 0.64 (95% CI: 0.56–0.73); P < 0.001] (see Supplementary material online, Figures S4 and S5). Furthermore, all-cause hospitalization occurred in a significantly lower percentage of patients treated with empagliflozin than with placebo (Figure 1 B, Table 1; Supplementary material online, Figure S6).

As previously reported, empagliflozin was associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular death compared with placebo, consistent across doses, sensitivity analyses, and patient subgroups defined by a variety of baseline characteristics.

### Design of a prospective patient-level pooled analysis of two parallel trials of empagliflozin in patients with established heart failure [^112dzuRA]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Importantly, our pooled analysis does not duplicate the primary goals of the individual component trials, but instead, it is designed to evaluate the effect of empagliflozin on endpoints that could not be adequately evaluated in the individual trials due to a lack of statistical power. The primary endpoint of the pooled analysis is the effect of empagliflozin on a composite of serious adverse renal outcomes. SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to reduce the progression to end‐stage kidney disease, both in trials of patients with type 2 diabetes and in patients with established chronic kidney disease. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 These trials were able to provide reasonably precise estimates of a treatment effect on renal endpoints, since they each recorded 150–400 events. In these trials, SGLT2 inhibitors consistently reduced the risk of serious adverse renal events to a remarkably similar degree, i.e. a 40–50% reduction in risk. By comparison, estimates of the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on renal outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure have been less precise, since the DAPA‐HF and EMPEROR‐Reduced trials each recorded fewer than 100 serious adverse renal events. The 50% reduction in risk in EMPEROR‐Reduced was nominally significant, whereas the 29% decrease in risk in DAPA‐HF was not. 3, 4 In contrast, the meta‐analysis of EMPEROR‐Reduced and EMPEROR‐Preserved is expected to yield > 200 events, allowing a degree of precision in patients with chronic heart failure that approximates that seen in trials of patients with type 2 diabetes. Combining data across the two trials seems biologically reasonable, since the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on renal outcomes is likely to represent a direct effect of this class of drugs on the structure and function of the kidneys, 16, 17 which is not expected to vary with ejection fraction.

Change in Body Weight, Blood Pressure, and Laboratory Outcomes

The effects of empagliflozin compared with placebo on the change in body weight, blood pressure, and laboratory outcomes are presented in. HbA1c levels decreased with empagliflozin compared with placebo in patients with baseline diabetes but not in those without (P interaction at week 52 < 0.01). Body weight also decreased with empagliflozin both in patients with and without diabetes, but the magnitude of this effect was generally greater in patients with diabetes (P interaction at week 52 = 0.02). Hemoglobin increased with empagliflozin compared with placebo arm in patients with and without diabetes but systolic blood pressure was not notably affected in either of the 2 subgroups. There was a similar decrease in NT-proBNP levels with empagliflozin compared with placebo in patients with and without diabetes in the first weeks (P interaction at week 12 = 0.30) thereafter, this decrease tended to be greater in patients with diabetes (P interaction at week 52 = 0.03). Compared with placebo, uric acid concentration decreased in the empagliflozin arm, less profoundly in patients with diabetes than in those without diabetes up to week 100 (all P interaction < 0.01;).

Adverse Events

The occurrence of overall adverse events and those leading to treatment discontinuation were similar in patients treated with empagliflozin and placebo but serious adverse events tended to be lower in patients on empagliflozin. These results were consistent in patients with and without diabetes (Table 2). Apart from genital infections, urinary tract infections, and volume depletion (including hypotension), which occurred more often with empagliflozin than placebo, the rates of adverse events were comparable in the treatment arms in patients with and without diabetes. Similarly‚ confirmed hypoglycemic episodes and hypoglycemic episodes requiring assistance occurred more frequently in patients with diabetes than in those without diabetes, with no difference between treatment arms. Diabetic ketoacidosis occurred only in patients with diabetes but the rates were similar in the 2 treatment arms, with 4 (0.3%) cases in the empagliflozin group and 5 (0.3%) in the placebo group.

### Cardiovascular and renal outcomes with empagliflozin in heart failure [^11371Zhr]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in patients regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes. More evidence is needed regarding the effects of these drugs in patients across the broad spectrum of heart failure, including those with a markedly reduced ejection fraction.

Methods

In this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 3730 patients with class II, III, or IV heart failure and an ejection fraction of 40% or less to receive empagliflozin (10 mg once daily) or placebo, in addition to recommended therapy. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for worsening heart failure.

Results

During a median of 16 months, a primary outcome event occurred in 361 of 1863 patients (19.4%) in the empagliflozin group and in 462 of 1867 patients (24.7%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio for cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure, 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65 to 0.86; P < 0.001). The effect of empagliflozin on the primary outcome was consistent in patients regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes. The total number of hospitalizations for heart failure was lower in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.85; P < 0.001). The annual rate of decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate was slower in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group (-0.55 vs. -2.28 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2 of body-surface area per year, P < 0.001), and empagliflozin-treated patients had a lower risk of serious renal outcomes. Uncomplicated genital tract infection was reported more frequently with empagliflozin.

Conclusions

Among patients receiving recommended therapy for heart failure, those in the empagliflozin group had a lower risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure than those in the placebo group, regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes.

### Cardiovascular and renal outcomes with empagliflozin in heart failure [^115hhuPr]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

The study EMPEROR-Reduced was published by Milton Packer and colleagues in 2020 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the EMPEROR-Reduced study, the trial question was: what is the role of empagliflozin in patients with HF? In the EMPEROR-Reduced study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the EMPEROR-Reduced study, the population was: 3730 patients (893 female, 2837 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with chronic HF and an ejection fraction ≤ 40% who were receiving recommended therapy. The key exclusion criteria were myocardial infarction, major cardiovascular surgery or stroke in the past 90 days; heart transplant recipient; acute decompensated HF; symptomatic hypotension; indication of liver disease; impaired renal function. In the EMPEROR-Reduced study, the interventions were: n = 1863 empagliflozin (at a dose of 10 mg once daily) n = 1867 placebo (matching placebo). In the EMPEROR-Reduced study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in cardiovascular death or hospitalization for worsening HF (19.4% vs. 24.7%; HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.86). In the EMPEROR-Reduced study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in total hospitalizations for HF (388 events vs. 553 events; HR 0.7, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.85) Significant decrease in the incidence of eGFR decline (0.55 mL/min/1.73 m²/year vs. 2.28 mL/min/1.73 m²/year; AD -1.73 mL/min/1.73 m²/year, 95% CI -1.1 to -2.37) No significant difference in death from any cause (13.4% vs. 14.2%; HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.1). In the EMPEROR-Reduced study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse effects. significant difference in serious renal outcome (1.6% vs. 3.1%). In the EMPEROR-Reduced study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with chronic HF and an ejection fraction ≤ 40% who were receiving recommended therapy, empagliflozin was superior to placebo with respect to cardiovascular death or hospitalization for worsening HF.

### Empagliflozin after acute myocardial infarction [^116soLas]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Empagliflozin improves cardiovascular outcomes in patients with heart failure, patients with type 2 diabetes who are at high cardiovascular risk, and patients with chronic kidney disease. The safety and efficacy of empagliflozin in patients who have had acute myocardial infarction are unknown.

Methods

In this event-driven, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, patients who had been hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction and were at risk for heart failure to receive empagliflozin at a dose of 10 mg daily or placebo in addition to standard care within 14 days after admission. The primary end point was a composite of hospitalization for heart failure or death from any cause as assessed in a time-to-first-event analysis.

Results

A total of 3260 patients were assigned to receive empagliflozin and 3262 to receive placebo. During a median follow-up of 17.9 months, a first hospitalization for heart failure or death from any cause occurred in 267 patients (8.2%) in the empagliflozin group and in 298 patients (9.1%) in the placebo group, with incidence rates of 5.9 and 6.6 events, respectively, per 100 patient-years (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76 to 1.06; P = 0.21). With respect to the individual components of the primary end point, a first hospitalization for heart failure occurred in 118 patients (3.6%) in the empagliflozin group and in 153 patients (4.7%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.98), and death from any cause occurred in 169 (5.2%) and 178 (5.5%), respectively (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.19). Adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of empagliflozin and were similar in the two trial groups.

Conclusions

Among patients at increased risk for heart failure after acute myocardial infarction, treatment with empagliflozin did not lead to a significantly lower risk of a first hospitalization for heart failure or death from any cause than placebo.

### Effect of empagliflozin on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with heart failure by baseline diabetes status: results from the EMPEROR-reduced trial [^1148DFaE]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Editorial, see p

Unlike other antihyperglycemic agents, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have consistently been shown to reduce the risk of heart failure hospitalizations and serious renal outcomes among patients with diabetes. – These substantial cardio-renal benefits cannot be explained by the antihyperglycemic action of SGLT2 inhibitors. Therefore, it has been suggested that SGLT2 inhibitors exert broad cardioprotective and nephroprotective effects, which would be apparent in patients with or without diabetes.

In the DAPA-HF trial (Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure), dapagliflozin was shown to reduce the risk of worsening heart failure events and cardiovascular death independent of diabetes status. However, the DAPA-HF trial did not comprehensively report the influence of diabetes on the renal effects of dapagliflozin or the influence of prediabetes; furthermore, the trial enrolled primarily patients who had mild to moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction and increases in natriuretic peptides. EMPEROR-Reduced (Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction) evaluated the effect of empagliflozin in patients with heart failure, including those with more severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction and more severely impaired kidney function, and the trial identified the effect of the drug on renal outcomes as a major outcome variable. Empagliflozin reduced the risk of major adverse heart failure and renal outcomes when added to inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system and β-blockers and regardless of background therapy with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitors.

In this prespecified analysis of EMPEROR-Reduced, we analyzed the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin on heart failure and renal events by baseline diabetes status and across the range of baseline values of glycohemoglobin (HbA1c).

### Design of a prospective patient-level pooled analysis of two parallel trials of empagliflozin in patients with established heart failure [^117VEtc2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Sodium–glucose co‐transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been shown to reduce the risk of heart failure hospitalizations and serious adverse renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. 1, 2 Additionally, trials with dapagliflozin and empagliflozin (DAPA‐HF and EMPEROR‐Reduced) have shown that these drugs reduce the combined risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalizations for heart failure and slow the decline in glomerular filtration rate in patients with established heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction. 3, 4, 5 The effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on the clinical course of patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction are currently being evaluated in large‐scale trials (EMPEROR‐Preserved and DELIVER), 6, 7 and retrospective subgroup analyses suggest that many of the heart failure events that were prevented in large‐scale trials in patients with type 2 diabetes may have been associated with ejection fractions that were greater than 40%. 8 If such a benefit is confirmed by ongoing trials, then the favourable effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on the heart and kidneys may not be meaningfully dependent on ejection fraction, 8 thus allowing the findings of trials in heart failure with a reduced and preserved ejection fraction to be usefully combined.

The four major outcomes trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with established heart failure were specifically designed to evaluate the effect of these drugs on the combined risk of cardiovascular death or worsening heart failure events (e.g. hospitalizations for heart failure). 3, 4, 6, 7 However, these trials were not statistically powered to evaluate other important endpoints, such as the effects on serious adverse renal events or on survival. As a result of this lack of statistical power, the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on serious renal events and on mortality in the DAPA‐HF and EMPEROR‐Reduced trials achieved nominal levels of statistical significance in one trial but not another, 3, 4 and the confidence intervals of the estimates overlapped substantially. 9 When statistical power was increased by combining the results of DAPA‐HF and EMPEROR‐Reduced in a meta‐analysis, benefits on serious renal events and on survival were observed without meaningful heterogeneity. 9 However, this meta‐analysis combined the results across trials with different members of the drug class.

Outcomes in patients with vs. without heart failure at baseline

At baseline, 244 (10.5%) patients in the placebo group and 462 (9.9%) patients in the empagliflozin group had investigator-reported heart failure. Compared with patients without heart failure at baseline, patients with heart failure at baseline were slightly older, had a higher weight and body mass index, and a greater proportion had eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, a history of myocardial infarction or atrial fibrillation, and were receiving insulin, β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (see Supplementary material online, Table S4). Within the subgroups by presence/absence of heart failure at baseline, baseline characteristics were balanced between the empagliflozin and placebo groups. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, weight, and haematocrit over the course of the study in patients with and without heart failure at baseline are shown in Supplementary material online, Figure S7.

Incidence rates for heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, cardiovascular death, and all-cause mortality were two- to six-fold higher in patients with heart failure at baseline compared with patients without heart failure at baseline (see Supplementary material online, Table S5). However, the reductions in the risk of these outcomes with empagliflozin were consistent in patients with and without heart failure at baseline (Figure 3). Categories of cardiovascular death in patients with and without heart failure at baseline are shown in Supplementary material online, Table S6.

Results

In EMPEROR-Reduced, empagliflozin 10 mg, compared with placebo, reduced the risk of the primary composite endpoint of CV death or hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) mostly through a reduction in HHF (HR 0.75 [95% CI 0.65, 0.86]). Empagliflozin reduced the risk of first and recurrent HHF, a key secondary endpoint. Because of the metformin HCl component, SYNJARDY and SYNJARDY XR are not indicated for use in patients with heart failure without type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Indications and Usage (1)].

The effect of empagliflozin in reducing the risk of the primary composite endpoint was consistent in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (HR 0.73 [95% CI 0.60, 0.87]), and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and metformin HCl as background therapy (HR 0.65 [95% CI 0.49, 0.86]).

EMPEROR-Preserved Trial (Chronic Heart Failure with Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction > 40%)

EMPEROR-Preserved (NCT03057951) was a double-blind trial conducted in patients with chronic heart failure NYHA Class II-IV with LVEF > 40% to evaluate the efficacy of empagliflozin as adjunct to standard of care therapy. Of 5,988 patients, 2,997 patients were randomized to empagliflozin 10 mg once daily and 2,991 patients to placebo once daily and were followed for a median of 26 months.

### Effect of empagliflozin on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with heart failure by baseline diabetes status: results from the EMPEROR-reduced trial [^116hdXjW]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors improve outcomes in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, but additional information is needed about whether glycemic status influences the magnitude of their benefits on heart failure and renal events.

Methods

Patients with Class II-IV heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40% were randomized to receive empagliflozin (10 mg daily) or placebo in addition to recommended therapy. We prespecified a comparison of the effect of empagliflozin in patients with and without diabetes.

Results

Of the 3730 patients enrolled, 1856 (50%) had diabetes, 1268 (34%) had prediabetes (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] 5.7–6.4%), and 606 (16%) had normoglycemia (HbA1c < 5.7%). The risks of the primary outcome (cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure), total hospitalizations for heart failure, and adverse renal outcomes were higher in patients with diabetes, but were similar between patients with prediabetes and normoglycemia. Empagliflozin reduced the risk of the primary outcome in patients with and without diabetes (hazard ratio, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.60–0.87] and 0.78 [95% CI, 0.64–0.97], respectively, P -interaction = 0.57). Patients with and without diabetes also did not differ with respect to the effect of empagliflozin on total hospitalizations for heart failure, on the decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate over time, and on the risk of serious adverse renal outcomes. Among these end points, the effects of the drug did not differ in patients with prediabetes or normoglycemia. When analyzed as a continuous variable, baseline HbA1c did not significantly modify the benefits of empagliflozin on the primary outcome (P -interaction = 0.40). Empagliflozin did not lower HbA1c in patients with prediabetes or normoglycemia and was not associated with increased risk of hypoglycemia.

Conclusions

In EMPEROR-Reduced (Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction), empagliflozin significantly improved cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, independent of baseline diabetes status and across the continuum of HbA1c.

### Empagliflozin and the risk of heart failure hospitalization in routine clinical care [^113WFcjL]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 diabetes Mellitus Patients) showed that empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, reduces the risk of hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) by 35%, on top of standard of care in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and established cardiovascular disease. The EMPRISE (Empagliflozin Comparative Effectiveness and Safety) study aims to assess empagliflozin's effectiveness, safety, and healthcare utilization in routine care from August 2014 through September 2019. In this first interim analysis, we investigated the risk of HHF among T2D patients initiating empagliflozin versus sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor.

Methods

Within 2 commercial and 1 federal (Medicare) claims data sources in the United States, we identified a 1:1 propensity score-matched cohort of T2D patients ≥ 18 years old initiating empagliflozin or sitagliptin from August 2014 through September 2016. The HHF outcome was defined as a HF discharge diagnosis in the primary position (HHF-specific); a broader definition was based on a HF discharge diagnosis in any position (HHF-broad). Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated controlling for over 140 baseline characteristics in each data source and pooled by fixed-effects meta-analysis.

Results

After propensity-score matching, we identified 16,443 patient pairs who initiated empagliflozin or sitagliptin. Average age was approximately 59 years, almost 54% of the participants were males, and approximately 25% had records of existing cardiovascular disease. Compared with sitagliptin, the initiation of empagliflozin decreased the risk of HHF-specific by 50% (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28–0.91), and the risk of HHF-broad by 49% (HR, 0.51;95% CI, 0.39–0.68), over a mean follow-up of 5.3 months. The results were consistent in patients with and without baseline cardiovascular disease, and for empagliflozin at both the 10- and 25-mg daily doses; analyses comparing empagliflozin versus the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor class, and comparing sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor versus dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor classes also produced consistent findings.

Conclusions

The first interim analysis from EMPRISE showed that compared with sitagliptin, the initiation of empagliflozin was associated with a decreased risk of HHF among patients with T2D as treated in routine care, with and without a history of cardiovascular disease.

Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

The Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses flowchart is presented in Figure 1. Literature search of the 4 databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, SCOPUS) retrieved 6522 results, and hand search uncovered 1 additional relevant study; 2414 duplicates were removed. Title and abstract screening excluded a further 4055 articles as they did not include patients without diabetes mellitus, did not evaluate cardiovascular outcomes or metabolic parameters, or were of an inappropriate study type. Full text screening excluded 46 articles. Eight articles were included for the meta‐analysis. 10, 12, 13, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28

Participant Baseline Characteristics

Across the 8 studies, the SGLT2 inhibitor drug name, dosage, frequency, control group, length of intervention, and length of follow‐up were summarized and are included in Table S2. Dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, and empagliflozin were the SGLT2 inhibitors used in 5, 2, and 1 studies respectively. Dapagliflozin and empagliflozin were administered at a dosage of 10 mg throughout the randomized controlled trials. All regimes were given once daily and compared with a control group receiving placebo. The length of follow‐up ranged from 12 weeks to 18 months.

Pooled Cardiovascular Outcomes

The pooled cardiovascular outcomes are presented in Figure 2. The 3 studies analyzed focused on patients with HF. Comparing patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors with patients without, the random effects model demonstrated that the risk ratio for the composite of cardiovascular deaths and HF hospitalization was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.69–0.89; P < 0.001) (Figure 2A). There was a statistically insignificant change in NT‐proBNP.

### The SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin in patients hospitalized for acute heart failure: a multinational randomized trial [^116ycBgi]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin reduces the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization in patients with chronic heart failure, but whether empagliflozin also improves clinical outcomes when initiated in patients who are hospitalized for acute heart failure is unknown. In this double-blind trial (EMPULSE; NCT04157751), 530 patients with a primary diagnosis of acute de novo or decompensated chronic heart failure regardless of left ventricular ejection fraction were randomly assigned to receive empagliflozin 10mg once daily or placebo. Patients were randomized in-hospital when clinically stable (median time from hospital admission to randomization, 3days) and were treated for up to 90days. The primary outcome of the trial was clinical benefit, defined as a hierarchical composite of death from any cause, number of heart failure events and time to first heart failure event, or a 5point or greater difference in change from baseline in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Total Symptom Score at 90days, as assessed using a win ratio. More patients treated with empagliflozin had clinical benefit compared with placebo (stratified win ratio, 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.09–1.68; P = 0.0054), meeting the primary endpoint. Clinical benefit was observed for both acute de novo and decompensated chronic heart failure and was observed regardless of ejection fraction or the presence or absence of diabetes. Empagliflozin was well tolerated; serious adverse events were reported in 32.3% and 43.6% of the empagliflozin- and placebo-treated patients, respectively. These findings indicate that initiation of empagliflozin in patients hospitalized for acute heart failure is well tolerated and results in significant clinical benefit in the 90days after starting treatment.

An association between DPP-4 inhibitor treatment and heart failure has been observed in cardiovascular outcomes trials for two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. These trials evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Consider the risks and benefits of GLYXAMBI prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of GLYXAMBI.

### The SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin in patients hospitalized for acute heart failure: a multinational randomized trial [^116VYSh9]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study EMPULSE was published by Adriaan A Voors and colleagues in 2022 in the journal Nat Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the EMPULSE study, the trial question was: what is the role of empagliflozin in patients hospitalized for acute HF? In the EMPULSE study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the EMPULSE study, the population was: 530 patients (179 female, 351 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with a primary diagnosis of acute de novo or decompensated chronic HF regardless of LVEF. The key exclusion criteria were cardiogenic shock; PE; current hospitalization for acute HF primarily triggered by PE, cerebrovascular accident, or acute myocardial infarction. In the EMPULSE study, the interventions were: n = 265 empagliflozin (at a dose of 10 mg/day) n = 265 placebo (matching placebo). In the EMPULSE study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in clinical success, defines as a composite of all-cause mortality, number of HF events and time to first HF event, or a ≥ 5-point improvement from baseline in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Total Symptom Score at day 90 (53.89% vs. 39.71%; AD 14%, 95% CI 4.14 to 23.86). In the EMPULSE study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in cardiovascular death or hospitalization for HF (12.8% vs. 18.5%; HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.08) No significant difference in improvement of ≥ 10 points in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-total symptom score at day 90 (83.1% vs. 76.3%; OR 1.522, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.5) Significant increase in improvement in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-total symptom score at day 90 (36.19 points vs. 31.73 points; AD 4.45 points, 95% CI 0.32 to 8.59). In the EMPULSE study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the EMPULSE study, the conclusion was: in patients with a primary diagnosis of acute de novo or decompensated chronic HF regardless of LVEF, empagliflozin was superior to placebo with respect to clinical success, defines as a composite of all-cause mortality, number of HF events and time to first HF event, or a ≥ 5-point improvement from baseline in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Total Symptom Score at day 90.

### Safety and efficacy of empagliflozin and diuretic use in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction: a post hoc analysis of the EMPEROR-preserved trial [^114MhzwG]. JAMA Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Importance

The diuretic effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors may result in interaction with background diuretic therapy in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

Objective

To assess the safety and efficacy of empagliflozin in combination with background diuretic therapy and the association of empagliflozin with the need for conventional diuretics.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a post hoc analysis of the Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (EMPEROR-Preserved). EMPEROR-Preserved was a phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial conducted from March 2017 to April 2021. Patients with class II to IV heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 40% were included. Of 5988 patients enrolled, 5815 (97.1%) had baseline data on diuretic use and were included in this analysis, which was conducted from November 2021 to August 2022.

Interventions

Participants in EMPEROR-Preserved were randomized to empagliflozin or placebo. In this analysis, participants were divided into 4 subgroups: no diuretics and furosemide-equivalent diuretic dose of less than 40 mg, 40 mg, and greater than 40 mg at baseline.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcomes of interest were first hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) or cardiovascular death (CV death) and its components. Association of empagliflozin vs placebo with outcomes by baseline diuretic status (no diuretic vs any dose) and dose (no diuretic, < 40 mg, 40 mg, and > 40mg) was assessed. Association of empagliflozin use with changes in diuretic therapy was also studied.

Results

Among 5815 patients (mean [SD] age, 71.9 [9.4] years; 2594 [44.6%] female) with known baseline diuretic use, 1179 (20.3%) were not taking diuretics, 1725 (29.7%) were taking less than 40 mg, 1772 (30.5%) were taking 40 mg, and 1139 (19.6%) were taking greater than 40 mg. In the placebo arm, patients with higher diuretic doses had worse outcomes. Empagliflozin decreased the risk of HHF or CV death, regardless of background diuretic status (hazard ratio [HR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70–0.93] for the diuretic group vs HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.48–1.06 for the nondiuretic group; P for interaction = .58). Similarly, diuretic status was not associated with changes in improvements in first HHF, total HHF, rate of decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate, and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire 23 clinical summary score with empagliflozin. Findings were consistent when patients were categorized by diuretic dose. Empagliflozin was associated with a decreased likelihood of diuretic dose escalation (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.65–0.84) and an increased likelihood of de-escalation (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02–1.30). Empagliflozin was associated with an increased risk of volume depletion in patients taking diuretics (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.13–1.59).

Conclusion

In this study, treatment with empagliflozin was similar regardless of diuretic use or dose. Empagliflozin use was associated with decreased conventional diuretic dosing.

### Practical guide to prescribing sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors for cardiologists [^1151z6DZ]. JACC: Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a class of glucose-lowering therapies that have been shown to reduce risks of heart failure (HF) events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) at high-risk for or with cardiovascular disease. The United States Food and Drug Administration has expanded the regulatory label for empagliflozin and canagliflozin for use to lower cardiovascular risk in patients with T2DM and cardiovascular disease. SGLT2 inhibitors are being actively studied in the treatment of patients with HF, including in those without diabetes mellitus. Despite the accumulating data supporting this class of therapies in HF prevention, cardiologists infrequently prescribe SGLT2 inhibitors, potentially due to lack of familiarity with their use. We provide an up-to-date practical guide highlighting important elements for treatment initiation, dosing, anticipated adverse effects, and barriers to uptake.

### A trial to evaluate the effect of the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (DAPA-HF) [^111MQS4r]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Power calculations and statistical analysis

Key questions in designing DAPA‐HF were what rate might be anticipated for the novel primary composite endpoint and what treatment effect size is clinically relevant and realistic? The event rate was estimated based on recent trials, particularly PARADIGM‐HF. 32 A treatment effect size of 20% was chosen as clearly clinically relevant and reasonably conservative in light of the ∼30% relative risk reduction in heart failure hospitalization observed in EMPA‐REG OUTCOME, CANVAS and DECLARE–TIMI 58. 7, 8, 9 DAPA‐HF is powered for this treatment effect on the primary composite outcome and not the individual components of the composite, particularly cardiovascular death. Furthermore, for nearly all other plausible scenarios, using the treatment effect sizes observed in DECLARE–TIMI 58 and in the SGLT2 inhibitor trial meta‐analysis, DAPA‐HF has ≥ 80% power to detect a benefit of dapagliflozin. 7, 8, 9

Safety considerations

In view of the safety information collected in prior trials, including DECLARE–TIMI 58, adverse event reporting has been simplified (with agreement of the regulatory authorities) — only serious adverse events, adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation/interruption/dose reduction and adverse event of special interest are collected. Adverse events of interest (in light of the profile of dapagliflozin above and concerns with SGLT2 inhibitors and other diabetes drugs more generally) include volume depletion, renal dysfunction, major hypoglycaemic episodes, fractures, and diabetic ketoacidosis. There is also a regulatory requirement to document amputations as a result of observations in the canagliflozin development programme but not in EMPA‐REG OUTCOME or DECLARE–TIMI 58. 43

Current status

The first enrolment (Visit 1) took place 8 February 2017 and the first randomization (Visit 2) occurred 15 February 2017. Subsequent recruitment in DAPA‐HF was rapid, and randomization was completed 17 August 2018.

### Empagliflozin in patients with heart Failure, reduced ejection fraction, and volume overload: EMPEROR-reduced trial [^112ZFEtK]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Investigators have hypothesized that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors exert diuretic effects that contribute to their ability to reduce serious heart failure events, and this action is particularly important in patients with fluid retention.

Objectives

This study sought to evaluate the effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin on symptoms, health status, and major heart failure outcomes in patients with and without recent volume overload.

Methods

This double-blind randomized trial compared the effects of empagliflozin and placebo in 3,730 patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, with or without diabetes. Approximately 40% of the patients had volume overload in the 4 weeks before study enrollment.

Results

Patients with recent volume overload were more likely to have been hospitalized for heart failure and to have received an intravenous diuretic agent in an outpatient setting in the previous 12 months, and to experience a heart failure event following randomization, even though they were more likely to be treated with high doses of a loop diuretic agent as an outpatient (all p < 0.001). When compared with placebo, empagliflozin reduced the composite risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure, decreased total hospitalizations for heart failure, and improved health status and functional class. Yet despite the predisposition of patients with recent volume overload to fluid retention, the magnitude of these benefits (even after 1 month of treatment) was not more marked in patients with recent volume overload (interaction p values > 0.05). Changes in body weight, hematocrit, and natriuretic peptides (each potentially indicative of a diuretic action of SGLT2 inhibitors) did not track each other closely in their time course or in individual patients.

Conclusions

Taken together, study findings do not support a dominant role of diuresis in mediating the physiological changes or clinical benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors on the course of heart failure in patients with a reduced ejection fraction.

### Empagliflozin for heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction with and without diabetes [^1144StnK]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Empagliflozin improves outcomes in patients with heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction, but whether the effects are consistent in patients with and without diabetes remains to be elucidated.

Methods

Patients with class II through IV heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction > 40% were randomized to receive empagliflozin 10 mg or placebo in addition to usual therapy. We undertook a prespecified analysis comparing the effects of empagliflozin versus placebo in patients with and without diabetes.

Results

Of the 5988 patients enrolled, 2938 (49%) had diabetes. The risk of the primary outcome (first hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death), total hospitalizations for heart failure, and estimated glomerular filtration rate decline was higher in patients with diabetes. Empagliflozin reduced the rate of the primary outcome irrespective of diabetes status (hazard ratio, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.67, 0.94] for patients with diabetes versus hazard ratio, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.64, 0.95] in patients without diabetes; P interaction = 0.92). The effect of empagliflozin to reduce total hospitalizations for heart failure was also consistent in patients with and without diabetes. The effect of empagliflozin to attenuate estimated glomerular filtration rate decline during double-blind treatment was also present in patients with and without diabetes, although more pronounced in patients with diabetes (1.77 in diabetes versus 0.98 mL/min/1.73m 2 in patients without diabetes; P interaction = 0.01). Across these 3 end points, the effect of empagliflozin did not differ in patients with prediabetes or normoglycemia (33% and 18% of the patient population, respectively). When investigated as a continuous variable, baseline hemoglobin A1c did not modify the effects on the primary outcome (P interaction = 0.26). There was no increased risk of hypoglycemic events in either subgroup as compared with placebo.

Conclusions

In patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction enrolled in the EMPEROR-Preserved (Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction), empagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of heart failure outcomes irrespective of diabetes status at baseline.

### Effect of glucose-lowering therapies on heart failure [^112M94Zf]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Heart failure is one of the most common comorbidities of diabetes mellitus. Glucose-lowering therapies that can prevent heart failure or improve outcomes in patients with established heart failure are of critical importance among those with type 2 diabetes. Several types of glucose-lowering drugs have been assessed in this setting. Metformin has been shown to modestly improve the outcomes of patients with heart failure, whereas the effect of insulin in those with established heart failure is less clear. The effect of sulfonylureas on improving heart failure is controversial; observational reports have suggested that they are harmful in these patients, but these data have not been confirmed in randomized, controlled trials. Thiazolidinediones are contraindicated in patients with established heart failure and have also been known to cause heart failure. Furthermore, certain dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors seem to increase heart failure hospitalization. The effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists might differ in patients with or without established heart failure, particularly those with decompensated heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction. However, perhaps the most important finding has been that sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2; also known as SLC5A2) inhibitors reduce heart failure hospitalizations and, in the case of empagliflozin, markedly reduce the rate of cardiovascular death. Given the known neutral (or even harmful) effects of other glucose-lowering drugs on heart failure outcomes, SGLT2 inhibitors might well be considered the drug class of choice in patients with diabetes and heart failure, or in those at high risk of developing heart failure.

### Evaluation of the effect of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibition with empagliflozin on morbidity and mortality of patients with chronic heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction: rationale for and design of the EMPEROR-reduced trial [^114pGAq4]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Drugs that inhibit the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) have been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalizations for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes. In populations that largely did not have heart failure at the time of enrolment, empagliflozin, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin decreased the risk of serious new-onset heart failure events by ≈30%. In addition, in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, empagliflozin reduced the risk of both pump failure and sudden deaths, the two most common modes of death among patients with heart failure. In none of the three trials could the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors on heart failure be explained by the actions of these drugs as diuretics or anti-hyperglycaemic agents. These observations raise the possibility that SGLT2 inhibitors could reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with established heart failure, including those without diabetes. The EMPEROR-Reduced trial is enrolling ≈3600 patients with heart failure and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (≤ 40%), half of whom are expected not to have diabetes. Patients are being randomized to placebo or empagliflozin 10 mg daily, which is added to all appropriate treatment with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system and neprilysin, beta-blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. The primary endpoint is the time-to-first event analysis of the combined risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure, but the trial will also evaluate the effects of empagliflozin on renal function, cardiovascular death, all-cause mortality, and recurrent hospitalization events. By adjusting eligibility based on natriuretic peptide levels to the baseline ejection fraction, the trial will preferentially enrol high-risk patients. A large proportion of the participants is expected to have an ejection fraction < 30%, and the estimated annual event rate is expected to be at least 15%. The EMPEROR-Reduced trial is well-positioned to determine if the addition of empagliflozin can add meaningfully to current approaches that have established benefits in the treatment of chronic heart failure with left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

Table 1
Heart failure events in recent trials with glucose-lowering drugs

The publication of TECOS, another mega trial including 14 671 patients was therefore long awaited. Patients included had type 2 diabetes mellitus, were 50 years of age or more, and had an established cardiovascular disease and a baseline HbA1C of 6.5–8%. They were randomized to either the DPP4 inhibitor sitagliptin or to control treatment.

After 3 years of follow-up, no difference was observed in the occurrence of the composite endpoint of cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina (HR = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.88–1.09; p < 0.001 for non-inferiority). Importantly, the incidence of heart failure was similar in the two arms with a hazard ratio of 1.00 (95% CI, 0.83–1.20; p = 0.98). The explanation for the differential effect of sitagliptin and of saxagliptin on heart failure events remain uncertain: differences in populations enrolled in the two trials are unlikely to play a role since the clinical profile of the patients were rather similar. Differences in affinity of the two inhibitors to the various substrates of DPP4 are a potential explanation. Finally, the play of chance cannot be excluded in this very large trial.

Whatever the underlying explanation, the results of this large outcome trial in type 2 diabetes mellitus rule out a class effect of DPP4 inhibitors on heart failure events and are therefore reassuring regarding the safety of sitagliptin in patients with pre-existing heart failure or at high risk of heart failure.

Another trial, EMPA-REG OUTCOME, tested two doses of an inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2, empagliflozin vs. placebo in 7020 patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk. After a median observation time of 3.1 years, the primary outcome made of death from cardiovascular causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke was significantly reduced by 14% in the pooled empagliflozin group. Interestingly, hospitalizations for heart failure and the composite of hospitalization for heart failure or death from cardiovascular causes, two secondary endpoints, were also significantly reduced by 35% (p = 0.002) and 34% (p < 0.01), respectively, suggesting that this new anti-diabetic agent added to standard therapy is not only safe but also beneficial for the prevention of heart failure hospitalizations in type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Safety and efficacy of empagliflozin and diuretic use in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction: a post hoc analysis of the EMPEROR-preserved trial [^117WM1Hu]. JAMA Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the safety and efficacy of empagliflozin in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) with background diuretic use?

Findings

In this post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial, empagliflozin was associated with comparable improvements in time to cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization, first and total heart failure hospitalizations, rate of decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate, and health status, regardless of background diuretic use or dose. Empagliflozin was also associated with a reduced likelihood of diuretic initiation or dose escalation and an increased likelihood of diuretic de-escalation and discontinuation after randomization.

Meaning

The findings suggest that treatment with empagliflozin in patients with HFpEF should be independent of diuretic therapy and may result in reduced need for diuretics.

### Blinded withdrawal of long-term randomized treatment with empagliflozin or placebo in patients with heart failure [^114vBwWc]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

It is not known whether the benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in heart failure persist after years of therapy.

Methods

In the EMPEROR-Reduced (Empagliflozin Outcome Trials in Chronic Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction) and EMPEROR-Preserved (Empagliflozin Outcome Trials in Chronic Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction) trials, patients with heart failure were randomly assigned (double-blind) to placebo or empagliflozin 10 mg/day for a median of 16 and 26 months, respectively. At the end of the trials, 6799 patients (placebo 3381, empagliflozin 3418) were prospectively withdrawn from treatment in a blinded manner, and, of these, 3981 patients (placebo 2020, empagliflozin 1961) underwent prespecified in-person assessments after ≈30 days off treatment.

Results

From 90 days from the start of closeout to the end of double-blind treatment, the annualized risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure was lower in empagliflozin-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients (10.7 [95% CI, 9.0–12.6] versus 13.5 [95% CI, 11.5–15.6] events per 100 patient-years, respectively; hazard ratio 0.76 [95% CI, 0.60–0.96]). When the study drugs were withdrawn for ≈30 days, the annualized risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure increased in patients withdrawn from empagliflozin but not in those withdrawn from placebo (17.0 [95% CI, 12.6–22.1] versus 14.1 [95% CI, 10.1–18.8] events per 100 patient-years for empagliflozin and placebo, respectively). The hazard ratio for the change in risk in the patients withdrawn from empagliflozin was 1.75 (95% CI, 1.20–2.54), P = 0.0034, whereas the change in the risk in patients withdrawn from placebo was not significant (hazard ratio 1.12 [95% CI, 0.76–1.66]); time period-by-treatment interaction, P = 0.068. After withdrawal, the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score declined by 1.6 ± 0.4 in patients withdrawn from empagliflozin versus placebo (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, withdrawal of empagliflozin was accompanied by increases in fasting glucose, body weight, systolic blood pressure, estimated glomerular filtration rate, N-terminal pro-hormone B-type natriuretic peptide, uric acid, and serum bicarbonate and decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit (all P < 0.01). These physiological and laboratory changes were the inverse of the effects of the drug seen at the start of the trials during the initiation of treatment (≈1–3 years earlier) in the same cohort of patients.

Conclusions

These observations demonstrate a persistent effect of empagliflozin in patients with heart failure even after years of treatment, which dissipated rapidly after withdrawal of the drug.

Conclusions and Relevance In this post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial, compared with placebo, empagliflozin was associated with reduced HF hospitalizations or cardiovascular death irrespective of albuminuria levels at baseline, reduced progression to macroalbuminuria, and reversion of macroalbuminuria. Trial Registration. that enrolled adult patients with chronic HF with New York Heart Association class II to IV symptoms for at least 3 months and elevated natriuretic peptide levels across a wide range of LVEF.
27. The protocol of each trial complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethical committees of the participating sites.

All patients gave written informed consent to participate in the study. Patients were randomized in a double-blind manner to receive placebo or empagliflozin, 10 mg daily, in addition to their usual therapy. Following entry into the trial, treatments for HF or other medical conditions could be managed at the clinical discretion of the investigator. This study confirms that albuminuria above the normal range was frequent and associated with poor prognosis in patients with HF, and showed that empagliflozin was associated with a reduction in new-onset macroalbuminuria and an increase in sustained remission from macroalbuminuria to normoalbuminuria or microalbuminuria in patients with HF, regardless of ejection fraction or diabetes status. Furthermore, empagliflozin was associated with improved cardiovascular and kidney outcomes irrespective of baseline UACR.

In this post hoc analysis of EMPEROR-Pooled, empagliflozin was more frequently associated with a reduction in HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular death irrespective of albuminuria levels at baseline, a reduction in progression to macroalbuminuria, and reversion of macroalbuminuria compared with placebo. Empagliflozin was not associated with a reduction in UACR in the overall population; however, UACR was reduced in patients with diabetes, who had higher UACR levels than patients without diabetes.

### Comparative effectiveness of individual sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors [^113EgfQR]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Evidence on cardiovascular benefits and safety of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors is mainly from placebo-controlled trials. Therefore, the comparative effectiveness and safety of individual SGLT-2 inhibitors remain unknown.

Objective

To compare the use of canagliflozin or dapagliflozin with empagliflozin for a composite outcome (myocardial infarction [MI] or stroke), heart failure hospitalization, MI, stroke, all-cause death, and safety outcomes, including diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), lower-limb amputation, bone fracture, severe urinary tract infection (UTI), and genital infection and whether effects differed by dosage or cardiovascular disease (CVD) history.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This comparative effectiveness study using target trial emulation included adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) using 3 US claims databases using data from August 2014 through June 2020. The study was conducted from August 2023 to July 2024, with a follow-up period of up to 8 years, and the analysis was completed in July 2024.

Exposures

First dispensing of canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, or empagliflozin without any use of SGLT-2 inhibitors during the prior 365 days.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Database-specific models were weighted using propensity score matching-weights to adjust for 129 confounders. Hazard ratios and 95% CIs for outcomes were estimated using weighted Cox proportional hazards models. HRs were pooled across databases using a fixed-effect meta-analysis.

Results

Across the databases, 232 890 patients receiving canagliflozin, 129 881 patients receiving dapagliflozin, and 295 043 patients receiving empagliflozin were identified. Compared with empagliflozin initiators, those receiving canagliflozin or dapagliflozin were less likely to have diabetes-related conditions or a history of CVD at baseline. For MI/stroke risk, both canagliflozin (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.91–1.05) and dapagliflozin (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.89–1.03) were comparable to empagliflozin. For heart failure hospitalization, dapagliflozin initiators had a higher risk (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.02–1.39), particularly at the low dose of 5 mg (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.12–1.50). These findings were consistent across subgroups of CVD history. For safety events, compared with empagliflozin, canagliflozin initiators had a lower risk of genital infections (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.91–0.97) but a higher risk of severe UTIs (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.03–1.24), and dapagliflozin initiators had lower risks of genital infections (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.89–0.95) and DKA (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.68–0.90).

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found that individual SGLT-2 inhibitors demonstrated comparable cardiovascular effectiveness at clinically effective doses, though low-dose dapagliflozin showed a reduced benefit for heart failure hospitalization compared with empagliflozin.

### Empagliflozin improves kidney outcomes in patients with or without heart failure [^112MVzQg]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Background In EMPA-REG OUTCOME (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients) empagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease. Post hoc, we evaluated empagliflozin on kidney outcomes in patients with or without heart failure (HF). Methods and Results Individuals were randomized to empagliflozin 10 mg, 25 mg, or placebo. Prespecified analyses by baseline HF status included risk of incident or worsening nephropathy and estimated glomerular filtration rate slope analyses. Cox proportional hazards models assessed consistency of treatment effect across subgroups. Safety evaluations included kidney-related adverse events. At baseline, 244 (10.5%) and 462 (9.9%) patients had HF in the placebo and empagliflozin groups, respectively. Overall, the incidence of kidney outcome events was numerically higher in patients with than without HF. In the HF group, empagliflozin reduced risk of incident or worsening nephropathy or cardiovascular death by 43% (hazard ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.42–0.77]) and progression to macroalbuminuria by 50% (hazard ratio, 0.50 [0.33–0.75]). After an initial transient decrease, estimated glomerular filtration rate stabilized over time with empagliflozin but gradually declined with placebo. Kidney effects in patients with HF were consistent with those in the overall study population (all P values for interaction > 0.05). Across groups, the incidence rate of kidney-related adverse events/100 patient-years was higher in patients with than without HF; however, overall rates were comparable between groups. Conclusions These findings from EMPA-REG OUTCOME support the hypothesis that empagliflozin could reduce the risk of clinically relevant kidney events and may slow progression of chronic kidney disease in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus regardless of HF status.

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114AEsMZ]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors — heart failure outcomes in diabetes — reduce the incidence of heart failure and improve heart failure–related outcomes in people with diabetes with preserved or reduced ejection fraction; in EMPA-REG OUTCOME, empagliflozin led to a significant 35% reduction in hospitalization for heart failure versus placebo, and in CANVAS and DECLARE-TIMI 58 the reductions were 33% and 27%, respectively. In DAPA-HF, adults with New York Heart Association class II–IV heart failure and an ejection fraction of 40% or less had lower risks with dapagliflozin for the primary composite (HR 0.74 [95% CI 0.65–0.85]), first worsening heart failure (HR 0.70 [95% CI 0.59–0.83]), and cardiovascular death (HR 0.82 [95% CI 0.69–0.98]), with the primary outcome effect consistent regardless of the presence or absence of type 2 diabetes. EMPEROR-Reduced showed reduction of the primary outcome in adults with NYHA class II–IV chronic HFrEF (LVEF < 40%), and a similar benefit for heart failure outcomes was seen in DELIVER for dapagliflozin in people with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction. A large meta-analysis including EMPEROR-Reduced, EMPEROR-Preserved, DAPA-HF, DELIVER, and SOLOIST-WHF included 21,947 individuals and demonstrated reduced risk for cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure, cardiovascular death, first hospitalization for heart failure, and all-cause mortality.

### The current role of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes mellitus management [^112Jf58U]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Until now, empagliflozin has been approved by the FDA for T2DM, to reduce cardiovascular death in adults with T2DM, treat adults with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and adults with HF and preserved ejection fraction. Canagliflozin is approved for T2DM and DKD, and reduces the risk of heart attack, cardiovascular death and stroke in adults with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease, and reduces the risk of hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) in T2DM and DKD patients. Dapagliflozin is indicated for T2DM, reduce the risk of HHF, for the treatment of HF in patients with HFrEF, and for CKD patients with or without the risk of T2DM progression. Ertugliflozin is approved for T2DM.

The main purpose of this review is to examine the clinical role, clinical advantages, safety and tolerability of SGLT2 inhibitors.

### Heart failure outcomes with empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk: results of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial [^111oZxma]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Heart failure is a common comorbidity and a common cause of hospitalization in patients with type 2 diabetes, presenting a high medical need for effective therapies. Treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes and heart failure presents challenges for physicians due to a lack of evidence-based guidelines on the optimal management of such patients. Guidelines published by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) in 2012and by the ESC in collaboration with the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) in 2013recognized the lack of adequate evidence on the safety and efficacy of drugs used to treat diabetes in patients with heart failure, as well as the need for further research into whether glucose-lowering therapies can reduce the progression of heart failure.

Preventing hospital admission and improving survival are key goals of the treatment of patients with heart failure. Importantly, empagliflozin reduced hospitalization for heart failure, cardiovascular death, and all-cause mortality to the same extent in patients with heart failure at baseline, who had high use of medications used to treat heart failure, as in patients without heart failure at baseline. Thus, the overall effect of empagliflozin on these important outcomes was not predominantly driven by patients with heart failure at baseline. Of note, patients who survived a hospitalization for heart failure were at high risk of subsequent mortality. Similar observations were made in the SAVOR-TIMI 53 study, in which 26% of patients hospitalized for heart failure died.

Our study has several limitations. The diagnosis of heart failure at baseline was based solely on the report of investigators according to the narrow SMQ, with no measures of cardiac function or biomarkers, such as brain natriuretic peptide, recorded. However, given the baseline characteristics of these patients, including the high use of drugs to treat heart failure and the high incidence of hospitalizations for heart failure and cardiovascular death, it is reasonable to assume that this was indeed largely a population of patients with pre-existing heart failure. The type of heart failure outcomes relative to ejection fraction could not be assessed based on the data available; thus, we cannot conclude on the applicability of these results with regard to reduced or preserved ejection fraction heart failure. In addition, the subgroup of patients with heart failure at baseline was relatively small and several of our analyses were conducted post hoc. The diagnosis of hospitalization for heart failure included the initiation or up-titration of oral or intravenous diuretic medication rather than the more stringent requirement of initiation of intravenous diuretic medication such as used in another study. However, patients hospitalized with heart failure had a high risk of mortality, consistent with the diagnosis.

Results

Patients

A total of 7020 patients at 590 sites in 42 countries received at least one dose of study drug. The baseline characteristics of the study population, including medications used at baseline, have been described. Mean (SD) age was 63.1 (8.6) years, mean (SD) body mass index was 30.6 (5.3) kg/m 2, 72% were male, 25.9% had eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, 46.6% had a history of myocardial infarction, 10.1% had heart failure, and 5.5% had atrial fibrillation. At baseline, ∼81% of patients were on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers, 65% on β-blockers, 43% on diuretics, and 6% on mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

Patient disposition in this trial has been described. Overall, 97% of patients completed the study, with 25% of patients prematurely discontinuing study drug. In both treatment groups, the most common reason for premature discontinuation of study medication was adverse events. The median duration of treatment was 2.6 years and the median observation time was 3.1 years. Final vital status was available for 99% of patients.
