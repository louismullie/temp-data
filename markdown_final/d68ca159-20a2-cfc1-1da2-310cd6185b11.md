## Question

62 yo F with history of long-standing rheumatoid arthritis (on low-dose prednisone 5 mg daily), hypertension, and chronic stable angina presents with persistent insomnia. Labs: Na 138, K 4.1, Cr 1.0. Her psychiatrist recommends starting trazodone 50 mg nightly for sleep. She currently takes methotrexate, folic acid, prednisone, amlodipine, metoprolol, and is started on diltiazem by her cardiologist for angina control. Is it safe to prescribe trazodone for insomnia at this dose?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether trazodone 50 mg nightly is safe for a 62-year-old woman with chronic stable angina, hypertension, and long-standing rheumatoid arthritis on prednisone 5 mg daily, given her current medications include methotrexate, folic acid, metoprolol, amlodipine, and newly added diltiazem. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the evidence base for trazodone in primary insomnia and guideline positions. Then, I should verify pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug–drug interactions, especially CYP3A4 effects and QT risk. Next, I will assess cardiovascular risks, including bradycardia, hypotension, and arrhythmias. After that, I need to consider age-related pharmacology and bleeding risk. Finally, I will synthesize a risk–benefit conclusion and outline safer alternatives and monitoring if trazodone is still considered off-label, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical indication and whether trazodone has supportive evidence for primary insomnia. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends against trazodone for chronic insomnia based on limited benefit, with only small improvements in subjective sleep quality and no consistent improvement in objective sleep parameters; the VA/DoD guideline similarly advises avoiding trazodone for chronic insomnia disorder, so using it here would be off-label and not guideline-supported for primary insomnia [^111DA9Eb] [^112YbrR2] [^1115Mv1c] [^111va9Qp].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacokinetic interaction with diltiazem. Trazodone is a CYP3A4 substrate, and diltiazem is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor; coadministration can increase trazodone exposure substantially, with ritonavir data showing roughly 2.4-fold increases in AUC and 2.2-fold prolongation of half-life, and clarithromycin studies demonstrating impaired clearance and enhanced sedation, so a 50 mg dose could behave like a higher dose in this context, increasing adverse effects without added benefit [^1124EWrg] [^114u33Xy] [^116cRSnX].

> I need to check the pharmacodynamic cardiovascular risks next. Trazodone prolongs the QT interval and has been associated with torsade de pointes even at doses ≤ 100 mg, with FDA warnings to avoid use in patients with known QT prolongation or with other QT-prolonging drugs; diltiazem itself can cause bradycardia and AV block, and when combined with a beta-blocker like metoprolol, the risk of bradycardia and conduction delay increases, so layering trazodone onto this regimen adds arrhythmic risk without clear therapeutic gain [^113JR21g] [^115JhyMK] [^1142LRMk] [^116Dv1aF].

> Hold on, I should verify the bleeding risk because she is on methotrexate and prednisone. Trazodone increases bleeding risk via serotonin reuptake inhibition and carries warnings with NSAIDs, antiplatelets, and anticoagulants; while she is not on NSAIDs here, chronic glucocorticoid use already elevates GI bleeding risk, so adding trazodone could compound that risk, especially if NSAIDs are ever introduced or if platelet function is impaired [^114ArdGz] [^1143nsyp].

> Let me consider age-related pharmacology and fall risk. Older adults have higher rates of orthostatic hypotension and sedation with trazodone, and population data associate trazodone with higher adverse outcome rates compared with tricyclics in older people, reinforcing caution in this 62-year-old; additionally, trazodone has been linked to extrapyramidal symptoms even at low doses in the elderly, which could worsen gait and fall risk [^114WTbak] [^1116wQ3v].

> But wait, what if the insomnia is severe and refractory to nonpharmacologic measures? I should double-check safer pharmacologic options. CBT-I is first-line for chronic insomnia; if medication is needed, short-term use of agents like zaleplon or eszopiclone is guideline-supported, whereas trazodone is not recommended for primary insomnia; if a sedating antidepressant is contemplated for comorbid depression or anxiety, mirtazapine or a low-dose tricyclic like doxepin 3–6 mg may be considered with careful monitoring, but neither would mitigate the QT and bradycardia concerns present here [^111DA9Eb] [^113k86QM] [^1158HTu3].

> I will now examine the bottom line. Given the lack of efficacy for primary insomnia, the CYP3A4 interaction with diltiazem that increases trazodone exposure, the additive bradycardia/QT risk with diltiazem and metoprolol, the elevated bleeding risk with glucocorticoids, and the age-related susceptibility to hypotension and falls, trazodone 50 mg nightly is not safe or appropriate in this patient; if, despite this, it is still used off-label, I would start at 25 mg, obtain a baseline ECG to assess QTc, recheck electrolytes, monitor for orthostasis, and avoid other QT-prolonging or CYP3A4-inhibiting drugs, but I should emphasize that this is a risk-mitigation strategy rather than an endorsement of use [^113JR21g] [^115JhyMK] [^1142LRMk] [^114ArdGz].

> Final recommendation: No, it is not safe to prescribe trazodone 50 mg nightly for this patient given her cardiovascular comorbidities, current medication regimen, and age; prioritize CBT-I and consider guideline-supported hypnotics if needed, and if an antidepressant is otherwise indicated for mood, select an agent with a more favorable cardiac risk profile and avoid QT-prolonging combinations [^111DA9Eb] [^1115Mv1c] [^111va9Qp].

---

Trazodone 50 mg nightly is **not safe** for this patient due to **QT prolongation risk** [^113JR21g] and **bradycardia risk** from combining trazodone with metoprolol and diltiazem [^1142LRMk]. Diltiazem is a **moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor** [^114u33Xy] that can increase trazodone levels and adverse effects, including hypotension and syncope [^1124EWrg]. Given her age, cardiovascular disease, and polypharmacy, **alternative insomnia therapies** (e.g. CBT-I, melatonin, or a short-acting hypnotic) are preferred [^111DA9Eb] [^1115Mv1c]. If trazodone is used, start at 25 mg, monitor ECG and electrolytes, and watch for bradycardia and orthostatic symptoms [^113JR21g].

---

## Pharmacological considerations

### Trazodone pharmacokinetics and metabolism

Trazodone is metabolized primarily by **CYP3A4** [^1168aJPv]; inhibitors of this pathway can increase trazodone exposure and adverse effects [^1124EWrg]. Diltiazem is a **moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor** [^notfound] and may raise trazodone levels, increasing sedation, hypotension, and cardiac risks [^1124EWrg].

---

### Cardiovascular risks associated with trazodone

Trazodone can prolong the **QT interval** [^113JR21g] and cause torsade de pointes, especially in patients with preexisting cardiac disease or when combined with other QT-prolonging drugs [^1177BMH1]. It also causes **orthostatic hypotension and syncope**, which may be amplified with antihypertensives [^113JR21g].

---

### Interaction with metoprolol and diltiazem

Metoprolol and diltiazem both depress **AV nodal conduction** and can cause bradycardia; combining them with trazodone may further increase this risk [^1142LRMk]. Diltiazem can also increase metoprolol levels, compounding bradycardia and hypotension [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **AASM guidelines**: Recommend against trazodone for chronic insomnia due to limited efficacy and safety concerns [^111DA9Eb] [^111va9Qp].
- **VA/DoD guidelines**: Advise avoiding trazodone for chronic insomnia because of adverse effects and limited benefit [^1115Mv1c].
- **FDA warnings**: Trazodone is contraindicated in patients with known QT prolongation or at risk of torsade de pointes; caution is advised in patients with cardiac disease [^111einms] [^113JR21g].

---

## Patient-specific risk assessment

| **Risk factor** | **Relevance to trazodone use** |
|-|-|
| Age (62 years) | Increased risk of orthostatic hypotension, falls, and QT prolongation [^notfound] |
| Cardiovascular disease (chronic stable angina) | Increased risk of arrhythmias and QT prolongation [^113JR21g] |
| Medications (metoprolol, diltiazem) | Increased risk of bradycardia, hypotension, and QT prolongation [^1142LRMk] [^113JR21g] |
| Electrolyte status (normal) | No immediate contraindication, but monitoring is advised [^notfound] |

---

## Alternative pharmacological options

- **CBT-I**: First-line for chronic insomnia; no pharmacological interactions or cardiac risks [^notfound].
- **Melatonin**: Safe in older adults; minimal interaction potential.
- **Short-acting hypnotics (e.g. zaleplon)**: FDA-approved for short-term insomnia; use cautiously in older adults [^113k86QM].

---

## Clinical recommendations

If trazodone is considered despite risks, use the following approach:

- **Start low**: 25 mg PO qHS with possible titration to 50 mg if tolerated.
- **Monitor ECG**: Baseline and periodic ECG to assess QT interval [^notfound].
- **Check electrolytes**: Baseline and periodic potassium and magnesium [^notfound].
- **Watch for bradycardia**: Monitor heart rate and blood pressure closely [^notfound].
- **Educate**: Counsel on orthostatic symptoms and fall risk [^1143nsyp].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Trazodone 50 mg nightly is **not safe** for this patient due to QT prolongation and bradycardia risks from concomitant metoprolol and diltiazem, plus diltiazem's CYP3A4 inhibition. Use **alternative therapies** such as CBT-I, melatonin, or a short-acting hypnotic; if trazodone is used, start at 25 mg with close monitoring [^111DA9Eb] [^1115Mv1c].

### Trazodone in the elderly: risk of extrapyramidal acute events [^1116wQ3v]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Trazodone is a second-generation atypical antidepressant exercising selective inhibitory action on the transport of serotonin. It also has an antagonist effect, similar to nefazodone, on the 5HT1 and 5HT2 receptors, probably due to the therapeutic effects of such substances. It is very effective in the treatment of depression, in anxiety and insomnia. Its known side effects mainly occur with prolonged use of daily doses of 150–200 mg. The ability to enhance drowsiness may be associated with some risk in elderly patients. This clinical case illustrates an acute extrapyramidal event induced by a low dose of trazodone.

### Trazodone hydrochloride [^1177BMH1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Monitor all patients taking trazodone for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with trazodone and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of trazodone with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms.

5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias

Clinical studies indicate that trazodone hydrochloride may be arrhythmogenic in patients with preexisting cardiac disease. Arrhythmias identified include isolated PVCs, ventricular couplets, tachycardia with syncope, and torsade de pointes. Postmarketing events, including torsade de pointes have been reported at doses of 100 mg or less with the immediate-release form of trazodone. Trazodone should also be avoided in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias, as well as other circumstances that may increase the risk of the occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death, including symptomatic bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, and the presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval. Trazodone is not recommended for use during the initial recovery phase of myocardial infarction. Caution should be used when administering trazodone to patients with cardiac disease and such patients should be closely monitored, since antidepressant drugs (including trazodone) may cause cardiac arrhythmias [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

### Does trazodone have a role in palliating symptoms? [^1173G8t9]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Trazodone is a unique antidepressant, which blocks the postsynaptic serotonin (5-HT) receptors, 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C), and weakly inhibits presynaptic 5-HT transporters.

Discussion

Trazodone is well-absorbed by the mouth and is metabolized by three cytochromes: CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Clinical benefits include reduced insomnia in those depressed and/or on antidepressants. Pain may be relieved by mechanisms similar to venlafaxine. Delirium unresponsive to neuroleptics has been reported to respond to trazodone. Drug interactions are a risk due to cytochrome metabolism.

Conclusion

Trazodone has a unique pharmacology, which may be an advantage in palliating symptoms; however, little evidence is available through cohort or randomized trials to give guidance to its use.

### QT prolongation and delayed atrioventricular conduction caused by acute ingestion of trazodone [^116qguzT]. Clinical Toxicology (2008). Low credibility.

Trazodone possesses minimal anticholinergic properties and, therefore, is generally regarded as having less cardiotoxic potential than other antidepressants. This report describes a young woman who developed significant QT prolongation and delayed atrioventricular nodal conduction after acute trazodone overdose. The case adds to the existing literature because it has a number of strengths, namely that confounding drugs and alcohol were lacking, trazodone exposure was confirmed by drug assay, and early presentation to hospital gave a valuable opportunity to study the time-course of the cardiac effects. This case reminds us to consider the possibility of cardiotoxic effects after trazodone overdose, even in young patients with no established cardiovascular disease.

7. Drug Interactions

MAOIs

MAOIs should not be used within 14 days of trazodone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants

Trazodone may enhance the response to alcohol, barbiturates, and other CNS depressants.

Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors

In vitro drug metabolism studies suggest that there is a potential for drug interactions when trazodone is given with cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors. The effect of short-term administration of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily, 4 doses) on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of trazodone (50 mg) has been studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax of trazodone increased by 34%, the AUC increased 2.4 fold, the half-life increased by 2.2 fold, and the clearance decreased by 52%. Adverse effects including nausea, hypotension, and syncope were observed when ritonavir and trazodone were coadministered. It is likely that ketoconazole, indinavir, and other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole may lead to substantial increases in trazodone plasma concentrations with the potential for adverse effects. If trazodone is used with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, the risk of cardiac arrhythmia may be increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] and a lower dose of trazodone should be considered.

Caution should be used when administering trazodone to patients with cardiac disease and such patients should be closely monitored, since antidepressant drugs (including trazodone) may cause cardiac arrhythmias [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Trazodone prolongs the QT/QTc interval. The use of trazodone should be avoided in patients with known QT prolongation or in combination with other drugs that are inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, voriconazole), or known to prolong QT interval including Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class 3 antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), certain antipsychotic medications (e.g., ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine), and certain antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin). Concomitant administration of drugs may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.4 Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope

Hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope has been reported in patients receiving trazodone hydrochloride. Concomitant use with an antihypertensive may require a reduction in the dose of the antihypertensive drug.

### Trazodone hydrochloride oral (Raldesy) [^115JhyMK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias

Clinical studies indicate that trazodone hydrochloride may be arrhythmogenic in patients with preexisting cardiac disease. Arrhythmias identified include isolated PVCs, ventricular couplets, tachycardia with syncope, and torsade de pointes. Postmarketing reports, including torsade de pointes have been reported at doses of 100 mg or less with the immediate-release trazodone hydrochloride tablets. RALDESY should also be avoided in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias, as well as other circumstances that may increase the risk of the occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death, including symptomatic bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, and the presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval. RALDESY is not recommended for use during the initial recovery phase of myocardial infarction. Caution should be used when administering RALDESY to patients with cardiac disease and such patients should be closely monitored, since antidepressant drugs (including RALDESY) may cause cardiac arrhythmias [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Trazodone hydrochloride prolongs the QT/QTcinterval. The use of RALDESY Should be avoided in patients with known QT prolongation or in combination with other drugs that are inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, voriconazole), or known to prolong QT interval including Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class 3 antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), certain antipsychotic medications (e.g., ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine), and certain antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin). Concomitant administration of drugs may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Trazodone hydrochloride [^114ArdGz]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Trazodone prolongs the QT/QTc interval. The use of trazodone should be avoided in patients with known QT prolongation or in combination with other drugs that are inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, voriconazole), or known to prolong QT interval including Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class 3 antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), certain antipsychotic medications (e.g., ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine), and certain antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin). Concomitant administration of drugs may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.4 Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope

Hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope has been reported in patients receiving trazodone hydrochloride. Concomitant use with an antihypertensive may require a reduction in the dose of the antihypertensive drug.

5.5 Increased Risk of Bleeding

Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including trazodone, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.

2. Dosage and Administration

2.1 Dose Selection

An initial dose of 150 mg/day in divided doses is suggested. The dosage should be initiated at a low-dose and increased gradually, noting the clinical response and any evidence of intolerance. Occurrence of drowsiness may require the administration of a major portion of the daily dose at bedtime or a reduction of dosage.

The dose may be increased by 50 mg/day every 3 to 4 days. The maximum dose for outpatients usually should not exceed 400 mg/day in divided doses. Inpatients (i.e., more severely depressed patients) may be given up to but not in excess of 600 mg/day in divided doses.

Once an adequate response has been achieved, dosage may be gradually reduced, with subsequent adjustment depending on therapeutic response.

2.2 Improtant Administration Instructions

Trazodone hydrochloride tablets can be swallowed whole or administered as a half tablet by breaking the tablet along the score line.

Trazodone hydrochloride tablets should be taken shortly after a meal or light snack.

2.3 Screen for Bipolar Disorder Prior to Starting Trazodone

Prior to initiating treatment with trazodone hydrochloride tablets or another antidepressant, screen patients for a personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

2.4 Switchning to or from Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor Antidepressant

At least 14 days must elapse between discontinuation of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) antidepressant and initiation of trazodone hydrochloride tablets. In addition, at least 14 days must elapse after stopping trazodone hydrochloride tablets before starting an MAOI antidepressant [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

2.5 Dosage Recommendations for Concomitant Use with Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors or Inducers

Coadministration with Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors

Consider reducing trazodone dose based on tolerability when trazodone is coadministered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Coadministration with Strong CYP3A4 Inducers

Consider increasing trazodone dose based on therapeutic response when trazodone is coadministered with a strong CYP3A4 inducer [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

2.6 Discontinuation of Treatment with Trazodone

Adverse reactions may occur upon discontinuation of trazodone [See Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Gradually reduce the dosage rather than stopping trazodone abruptly whenever possible.

Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

In humans, trazodone is well absorbed after oral administration without selective localization in any tissue. When trazodone is taken shortly after ingestion of food, there may be an increase in the amount of drug absorbed, a decrease in maximum concentration and a lengthening in the time to maximum concentration. Peak plasma levels occur approximately one hour after dosing when trazodone is taken on an empty stomach or two hours after dosing when taken with food.

Metabolism

In vitro studies in human liver microsomes show that trazodone is metabolized to an active metabolite, m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Other metabolic pathways that may be involved in metabolism of trazodone have not been well characterized.

Elimination

In some patients trazodone may accumulate in the plasma.

Drug-Drug Interactions

See also PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions. In vitro drug metabolism studies reveal that trazodone is a substrate of the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme and trazodone metabolism can be inhibited by the CYP3A4 inhibitors ketoconazole, ritonavir, and indinavir. The effect of short-term administration of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily, 4 doses) on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of trazodone (50 mg) has been studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax of trazodone increased by 34%, the AUC increased 2.4-fold, the half-life increased by 2.2-fold, and the clearance decreased by 52%. Adverse effects including nausea, hypotension, and syncope were observed when ritonavir and trazodone were co-administered.

Carbamazepine induces CYP34A. Following co-administration of carbamazepine 400 mg/day with trazodone 100 mg to 300 mg daily, carbamazepine reduced plasma concentrations of trazodone (as well as mCPP) by 76 and 60%, respectively, compared to pre-carbamazepine values.

For those patients who responded to trazodone HCl, one-third of the inpatients and one-half of the outpatients had a significant therapeutic response by the end of the first week of treatment. Three-fourths of all responders demonstrated a significant therapeutic effect by the end of the second week. One-fourth of responders required 2–4 weeks for a significant therapeutic response.

### Is trazodone effective and safe for treating insomnia?… [^111va9Qp]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Is trazodone effective and safe for treating insomnia. Evidence-Based Answer Trazodone should not be used to treat insomnia. Trazodone decreases the number of nightly awakenings and may slightly improve subjective sleep quality, but it does not significantly improve total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, or waking time after sleep onset. Evidence Summary A 2018 meta-analysis examining the use of trazodone for insomnia included seven RCTs with 429 adults. Six trials took place in the outpatient setting, and one trial combined inpatients and outpatients. 1 Patients with insomnia were included regardless of whether it was primary or secondary insomnia. Primary outcomes included sleep efficiency and self-reported sleep quality.

When trazodone was compared with placebo, there was no significant improvement in sleep efficiency and small to no change in sleep quality. 2 Selection criteria included an age of 18 years or older and a primary diagnosis of insomnia; patients with other comorbidities were included. Results indicated moderate improvement in subjective outcomes measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index compared with placebo. Two low-quality RCTs used polysomnography to assess sleep efficiency and found no difference. One low-quality RCT showed more adverse effects, including morning grogginess, dry mouth, and thirst, at two weeks with trazodone compared with placebo.

Recommendations From Others The American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guidelines for the pharmacologic treatment of insomnia in adults recommend that clinicians do not use trazodone for sleep-onset or sleep-maintenance insomnia. 4 Copyright © Family Physicians Inquiries Network.

### Trazodone hydrochloride [^113rGfYh]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Dose Selection

An initial dose of 150 mg/day in divided doses is suggested. The dosage should be initiated at a low-dose and increased gradually, noting the clinical response and any evidence of intolerance. Occurrence of drowsiness may require the administration of a major portion of the daily dose at bedtime or a reduction of dosage.

The dose may be increased by 50 mg/day every 3 to 4 days. The maximum dose for outpatients usually should not exceed 400 mg/day in divided doses. Inpatients (i.e., more severely depressed patients) may be given up to but not in excess of 600 mg/day in divided doses.

Once an adequate response has been achieved, dosage may be gradually reduced, with subsequent adjustment depending on therapeutic response.

2.2 Important Administration Instructions

Trazodone hydrochloride tablets can be swallowed whole or administered as a half tablet by breaking the tablet along the score line.

Trazodone hydrochloride tablets should be taken shortly after a meal or light snack.

2.3 Screen for Bipolar Disorder Prior to Starting Trazodone Hydrochloride Tablets

Prior to initiating treatment with trazodone hydrochloride tablets or another antidepressant, screen patients for a personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

2.4 Switching to or from Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor Antidepressant

At least 14 days must elapse between discontinuation of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) antidepressant and initiation of trazodone hydrochloride tablets. In addition, at least 14 days must elapse after stopping trazodone hydrochloride tablets before starting an MAOI antidepressant [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: a potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^115uCm4W]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

There are also inherent limitations to our study, primarily due to its retrospective nature. Ideally, we would prospectively standardize medication dosage and timing, after randomized allocation between groups, and monitor medication compliance across a predefined time period. For example, benefits observed in the trazodone group may reflect better overall medical management of participants by their physicians and delayed cognitive decline due to unaccounted factors. Possible adverse effects of trazodone were not explicitly reported during the assessment of participants' medication regimen. It is thus possible there is a biased selection against people who tried but did not tolerate trazodone for inclusion in the trazodone group, but who could have been included in the trazodone non-user group. Such participants may be more resistant in achieving better sleep consolidation through SWS enhancers. Alternatively, there may be different metabolism of trazodone in these participants, given that prior work indicates its active metabolite may have different effects on alertness compared to trazodone itself, a possibility that personalized medicine may be able to address. Eventually, optimal accounting for confounders necessitates prospective double-blind randomized trials to confirm that differential rates of cognitive decline are directly caused by trazodone. Such prospective studies, ideally incorporating interval cognitive evaluations, could also answer whether potential long-term trazodone benefits are due to continuous modulation of brain networks, or whether they primarily reflect early treatment period effects. Even though there are no prospective long-term studies of trazodone for insomnia in elders, long-term persistent benefits have been observed in depression.

### Effects of ranolazine with atenolol, amlodipine, or diltiazem on exercise tolerance and angina frequency in patients with severe chronic angina: a randomized controlled trial [^112fCGSZ]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Many patients with chronic angina experience anginal episodes despite revascularization and antianginal medications. In a previous trial, antianginal monotherapy with ranolazine, a drug believed to partially inhibit fatty acid oxidation, increased treadmill exercise performance; however, its long-term efficacy and safety have not been studied in combination with beta-blockers or calcium antagonists in a large patient population with severe chronic angina.

Objectives

To determine whether, at trough levels, ranolazine improves the total exercise time of patients who have symptoms of chronic angina and who experience angina and ischemia at low workloads despite taking standard doses of atenolol, amlodipine, or diltiazem and to determine times to angina onset and to electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemia, effect on angina attacks and nitroglycerin use, and effect on long-term survival in an open-label observational study extension.

Design, Setting, and Patients

A randomized, 3-group parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 823 eligible adults with symptomatic chronic angina who were randomly assigned to receive placebo or 1 of 2 doses of ranolazine. Patients treated at the 118 participating ambulatory outpatient settings in several countries were enrolled in the Combination Assessment of Ranolazine In Stable Angina (CARISA) trial from July 1999 to August 2001 and followed up through October 31, 2002.

Intervention

Patients received twice-daily placebo or 750 mg or 1000 mg of ranolazine. Treadmill exercise 12 hours (trough) and 4 hours (peak) after dosing was assessed after 2, 6 (trough only), and 12 weeks of treatment.

Main Outcome Measures

Change in exercise duration, time to onset of angina, time to onset of ischemia, nitroglycerin use, and number of angina attacks.

Results

Trough exercise duration increased by 115.6 seconds from baseline in both ranolazine groups (pooled) vs 91.7 seconds in the placebo group (P = 0.01). The times to angina and to electrocardiographic ischemia also increased in the ranolazine groups, at peak more than at trough. The increases did not depend on changes in blood pressure, heart rate, or background antianginal therapy and persisted throughout 12 weeks. Ranolazine reduced angina attacks and nitroglycerin use by about 1 per week vs placebo (P < .02). Survival of 750 patients taking ranolazine during the CARISA trial or its associated long-term open-label study was 98.4% in the first year and 95.9% in the second year.

Conclusion

Twice-daily doses of ranolazine increased exercise capacity and provided additional antianginal relief to symptomatic patients with severe chronic angina taking standard doses of atenolol, amlodipine, or diltiazem, without evident adverse, long-term survival consequences over 1 to 2 years of therapy.

### Effect of viloxazine and trazodone in obstructive sleep apnoea: a randomised, placebo-controlled, cross-over study [^114PYvAJ]. Thorax (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Combination of the noradrenergic atomoxetine with either the antimuscarinic aroxybutynin or trazodone has been shown to improve obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) severity. However, atomoxetine may contribute to apnoea-cycling and reduced drug tolerability due to wake-promoting, especially in a subgroup (poor cytochrome 2D6 metabolisers leading to higher blood concentration of medication). We investigated the effect of a potentially more manageable noradrenergic, viloxazine, with and without trazodone, on OSA severity.

Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 24 patients with OSA (18–75 years) were analysed and randomised to 500 mg viloxazine, 500/75 mg viloxazine-trazodone (vilo-trazo) or placebo; taken before bed for 2 weeks with 1-week washout between treatments. In-laboratory polysomnography was performed at the end of each cross-over period. Mixed-model analyses compared the effect of vilo-trazo versus placebo on AHI 4 (apnoea-hypopnoea index with 4% desaturations; primary outcome) and hypoxic burden (secondary outcome). Additional outcomes examined the effects of vilo-trazo versus viloxazine on total sleep time (TST) and wake-after-sleep-onset (WASO). Safety endpoints (patient-reported outcomes, heart rate and adverse events) were also assessed.

Results

Vilo-trazo reduced AHI 4 (mean difference (95% CI): 10.5 (6.6, 13.6) events/hour, p < 0.001) and hypoxic burden (16.7 (9.6, 21.8) %min/hr, p < 0.001) versus placebo. Compared with viloxazine, TST tended to be longer on vilo-trazo (22.3 (-1.4, 46.0) min, p < 0.065), while WASO was unchanged. TST and WASO remained significantly reduced on vilo-trazo versus placebo. Both interventions worsened patient-reported outcomes, although to a lesser extent on vilo-trazo, and increased heart rate versus placebo. Commonly reported adverse events were insomnia, constipation, headache and xerostomia.

Conclusions

Viloxazine-trazodone reduced OSA severity. Potential deleterious effects of viloxazine on sleep quality appeared partly attenuated by trazodone.

### Amlodipine besylate (amlodipine) [^115Ln5Wj]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

Adult Patients

The antihypertensive efficacy of amlodipine has been demonstrated in a total of 15 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies involving 800 patients on amlodipine and 538 on placebo. Once daily administration produced statistically significant placebo-corrected reductions in supine and standing blood pressures at 24 hours postdose, averaging about 12/6 mmHg in the standing position and 13/7 mmHg in the supine position in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Maintenance of the blood pressure effect over the 24-hour dosing interval was observed, with little difference in peak and trough effect. Tolerance was not demonstrated in patients studied for up to 1 year. The 3 parallel, fixed dose, dose response studies showed that the reduction in supine and standing blood pressures was dose-related within the recommended dosing range. Effects on diastolic pressure were similar in young and older patients. The effect on systolic pressure was greater in older patients, perhaps because of greater baseline systolic pressure. Effects were similar in black patients and in white patients.

Pediatric Patients

Two hundred sixty-eight hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years were randomized first to amlodipine 2.5 or 5 mg once daily for 4 weeks and then randomized again to the same dose or to placebo for another 4 weeks. Patients receiving 5 mg at the end of 8 weeks had lower blood pressure than those secondarily randomized to placebo. The magnitude of the treatment effect is difficult to interpret, but it is probably less than 5 mmHg systolic on the 5 mg dose. Adverse events were similar to those seen in adults.

Effects in Chronic Stable Angina

The effectiveness of 5 to 10 mg/day of amlodipine in exercise-induced angina has been evaluated in 8 placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of up to 6 weeks duration involving 1038 patients (684 amlodipine, 354 placebo) with chronic stable angina. In 5 of the 8 studies significant increases in exercise time (bicycle or treadmill) were seen with the 10 mg dose. Increases in symptom-limited exercise time averaged 12.8% (63 sec) for amlodipine 10 mg, and averaged 7.9% (38 sec) for amlodipine 5 mg. Amlodipine 10 mg also increased time to 1 mm ST segment deviation in several studies and decreased angina attack rate. The sustained efficacy of amlodipine in angina patients has been demonstrated over long-term dosing. In patients with angina there were no clinically significant reductions in blood pressures (4/1 mmHg) or changes in heart rate (+0.3 bpm).

### Prevalence of potentially harmful multidrug interactions on medication lists of elderly ambulatory patients [^116SN6Aj]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Multidrug interactions

Adverse drug reactions have been estimated by the FDA to be the fourth leading cause of death in the US resulting in costs of over $500 billion. Drug-drug interactions increase the likelihood of ADEs either because both drugs have the same target or effect, or one drug inhibits the metabolism of the other. It follows that the probability of patients experiencing ADEs would be further amplified if three or more drugs interacted with each other. We found that 1.3% of the 6,545 medication lists of a cohort of elderly ambulatory patients contained MDIs. The prevalence of MDIs in medication lists was considerably higher in those that included one of a subset of medications; MDIs were identified in more than 20% of the medication lists containing amiodarone or methotrexate and more than 10% of lists containing bupropion, tramadol, trazodone, cyclobenzaprine, fluoxetine, ondansetron, or quetiapine (Table 2).

Common medications and amplification of ADEs

Medications for psychiatric conditions were the medications most frequently involved in MDIs, accounting for 35.1% of all medications involved, a finding consistent with several prior studies of two-drug interacting pairs. Given the frequency of psychotropic medications in MDIs, the most common potential serious ADEs were those associated with psychotropic medications, namely prolonged QT, seizures, and serotonin syndrome.

Nearly all MDIs could amplify the risk of patients experiencing associated ADEs. There are two predominant mechanisms of amplification. First, there are pharmacodynamic additive effects of medications such as prolonging the QT interval, lowering the seizure threshold, or causing the serotonin syndrome. Second, there were pharmacokinetic additive effects in which multiple interactions could result in steep increases in the concentration of participating medications resulting from CYP inhibition. Sutherland et al. found that 4% of elderly patients in the cohort they studied were taking multiple inhibitors of the same CYP enzyme. Psychotropic medications, which were the most common class of medications represented in MDIs from our study, operate by both mechanisms to amplify the risk of serotonin syndrome, seizures, and torsades de pointes. Patient F (Supplementary Table 1) is likely to have significantly elevated levels of the psychotropic mirtazapine resulting from the inhibition of its metabolism by both bupropion and fluoxetine and the inhibition of fluoxetine's metabolism by bupropion. Age-related changes in pharmacokinetics due to diminished hepatic and renal function in the elderly make pharmacokinetic interactions especially likely.

The five treatment conditions were: placebo + placebo; zolpidem + placebo; zolpidem + clarithromycin; trazodone + placebo; and trazodone + clarithromycin. Coadministration of clarithromycin increased trazodone area under the curve, prolonged elimination half-life, increased peak plasma concentration (C(max)), and reduced oral clearance. In contrast, clarithromycin had no significant effect on any kinetic parameter for zolpidem. Clarithromycin did not potentiate sedation caused by zolpidem. However, clarithromycin coadministered with trazodone significantly increased self- and observer-rated sedation and ratings of feeling "spacey". Thus, short-term clarithromycin coadministration significantly impairs trazodone clearance, elevates plasma concentrations, and enhances sedative effects. However, clarithromycin has no significant kinetic or dynamic interaction with zolpidem.

### Antidepressant use and risk of adverse outcomes in older people: population based cohort study [^114WTbak]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Other outcomes

Other outcomes for which some evidence of an association with antidepressant use exists include all cause mortality, seizures, road traffic accidents, and adverse drug reactions, but results are not consistent and evidence in older people with which to compare our findings is lacking.

Clinical implications and future research

Some of our findings are unexpected — in particular, that contrary to expectations tricyclic antidepressants seem to be the safest class of antidepressant in older people for the adverse outcomes considered in this study. Tricyclic antidepressants were prescribed at lower doses than the other drugs, but some evidence shows that low dose tricyclic antidepressants are similar to higher dose tricyclics in reducing symptoms of depression. Little evidence exists as to whether low dose tricyclic antidepressants are as efficacious as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors at higher doses in the treatment of depression; in addition, tricyclic antidepressants may be associated with higher discontinuation rates owing to side effects such as sedation and dry mouth. The potential risks and benefits of different antidepressants therefore need careful consideration when these drugs are prescribed to older people.

Further research is needed to confirm our findings. Few randomised trials of antidepressants have been done in older people, in a primary care setting, with sufficient size and length of follow-up to assess adverse outcomes as well as benefits, so a long term randomised trial of antidepressants in older people with depression in primary care is needed to compare benefits and risks of more common adverse events between a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a low dose tricyclic antidepressant. Research is also needed to confirm our findings with other data sources of older people in a community setting and to assess any risks associated with switching between antidepressant drugs. If our findings are confirmed in other studies, this would have implications for the selection of antidepressant treatment in older people, who are already at higher risk of many of these adverse outcomes.

Conclusions

This study has found that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and drugs in the group of other antidepressants were associated with an increased risk of several adverse outcomes compared with tricyclic antidepressants. Among the most commonly prescribed individual drugs, trazodone, mirtazapine, and venlafaxine were associated with the highest rates for some outcomes. As this is an observational study, it is susceptible to confounding by indication, channelling bias, and residual confounding. Other differences in characteristics may exist between patients prescribed different antidepressant drugs, which we have not adjusted for and which may account for some of the associations between the drugs and the adverse outcomes. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.

### Association of oral anticoagulants and verapamil or diltiazem with adverse bleeding events in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and normal kidney function [^116x5Dkv]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the association of oral anticoagulants and verapamil hydrochloride or diltiazem hydrochloride with adverse bleeding events in patients with no kidney disease?

Findings

In this comparative effectiveness study using data from 48 442 patients, rates of bleeding were increased for patients receiving dabigatran etexilate with concomitant verapamil or diltiazem compared with those who were receiving concomitant amlodipine or metoprolol therapy. Other direct oral anticoagulants had no evidence of these drug-drug interactions.

Meaning

These findings suggest that prescribers may need to avoid P-glycoprotein–related drug-drug interactions with dabigatran regardless of kidney function.

### An investigation of psychoactive polypharmacy and related gender-differences in older adults with dementia: a retrospective cohort study [^114jFtgK]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this large cohort of PLWD from a provincially funded prescription drug program, psychoactive medication polypharmacy defined as exposure to three psychoactive medications for 30 days or more was present in 19.3% of subjects. Among those who experienced psychoactive polypharmacy, citalopram was the most dispensed psychoactive medication, being dispensed to 19.3% of subjects. The finding that an antidepressant was the most dispensed class of medication had both positive and negative considerations. A positive interpretation is that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are likely to have fewer central nervous system related adverse effects than other antidepressants or antipsychotics. Additionally, most SSRIs are less anticholinergic than tricyclic antidepressants (which is favourable for older adults with dementia) and may be better tolerated with less risk of precipitating further cognitive impairment. However, SSRIs are not without risks and are known, for example, to be associated with risks of falls and fractures, and citalopram is also associated with QT prolongation. Trazodone was second in frequent dispensation to those with an episode pf psychoactive polypharmacy and is frequently used for sleep or agitation despite a lack of established research confirming safety and effectiveness. While we were not able to capture dose or indication it is likely that some significant portion of trazodone dispensation was intended to support sleep or agitation (especially in the evening). Like other antidepressants there are risks associated with its use for older adults with dementia. Notably, the combination of trazodone and zopiclone was ninth on the top 10 list of combinations in our study; this may represent concerning use of two medications for one indication (sedation).

### Treatment of depression in patients with concomitant cardiac disease [^111Q17kc]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Depressed patients are at increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) and those with concomitant depression and CVD are at increased risk of death. The safety and efficacy of antidepressants in patients with CVD varies greatly between the agent used and type of disease. This review will summarize the CV adverse effect and drug interaction profile of antidepressants and discuss the use of antidepressants in CVD patients. We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and The Cochrane Library from inception to June 2014 to identify studies relevant to antidepressant use in patients with CVD. Primary references from the identified articles were also evaluated for inclusion. Descriptive analysis was performed for the included studies in this review. Orthostatic hypotension was more common with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), trazodone and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Hypertension can be significant with serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and MAOIs. The potential for QT prolongation is present with TCAs, certain selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), certain SNRIs and mirtazapine. Due to its low risk of drug-drug interactions, adverse effect profile and potential for beneficial antiplatelet activity, sertraline could be considered the choice antidepressant for patients with ischemic heart disease. SSRIs and potentially SNRIs are relatively safe and effective options for patients with heart failure. In patients at high risk for ventricular arrhythmias, bupropion has the overall lowest risk for QT prolongation. TCAs and MAOIs should be avoided in patients with concomitant CVD. In conclusion, due to the increased morbidity and mortality associated with comorbid CVD and depression, practitioners should readily assess and initiate management of depression in such patients. The choice of antidepressant should take into account the potential CV impact of the various agents balancing safety and efficacy.

### Ranolazine (Ranexa) [^112uyQb6]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

14.1	Chronic Stable Angina

CARISA (Combination Assessment of Ranolazine In Stable Angina) was a study in 823 chronic angina patients randomized to receive 12 weeks of treatment with twice-daily RANEXA 750 mg, 1000 mg, or placebo, who also continued on daily doses of atenolol 50 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, or diltiazem CD 180 mg. Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed.

In this trial, statistically significant (p < 0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each RANEXA dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose.

The effects of RANEXA on angina frequency and nitroglycerin use are shown in Table 2.

Tolerance to RANEXA did not develop after 12 weeks of therapy. Rebound increases in angina, as measured by exercise duration, have not been observed following abrupt discontinuation of RANEXA.

RANEXA has been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of RANEXA 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with RANEXA 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p = 0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p = 0.014) were observed with RANEXA compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates.

### Metoprolol (Metoprolol tartrate) [^1142LRMk]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

- Catecholamine-depleting drugs may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents. (7.1)

- Patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reaction. (7.2)

- CYP2D6 Inhibitors are likely to increase metoprolol concentration. (7.3)

- Concomitant use of glycosides, clonidine, and diltiazem and verapamil with beta-blockers can increase the risk of bradycardia. (7.4)

- Beta-blockers including metoprolol, may exacerbate the rebound hypertension that can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. (7.4)

7.1 Catecholamine Depleting Drugs

Catecholamine depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents. Observe patients treated with metoprolol tartrate plus a catecholamine depletor for evidence of hypotension or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.

7.2 Epinephrine

While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge and may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat an allergic reaction.

7.3 CYP2D6 Inhibitors

Drugs that are strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and propafenone were shown to double metoprolol concentrations. While there is no information about moderate or weak inhibitors, these too are likely to increase metoprolol concentration. Increases in plasma concentration decrease the cardioselectivity of metoprolol [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Monitor patients closely, when the combination cannot be avoided.

7.4 Negative Chronotropes

Digitalis glycosides, clonidine, diltiazem and verapamil slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use with beta-blockers can increase the risk of bradycardia.

If clonidine and a beta-blocker, such as metoprolol are coadministered, withdraw the beta-blocker several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine because beta-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension that can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If replacing clonidine by beta-blocker therapy, delay the introduction of beta-blockers for several days after clonidine administration has stopped.

### Recommendations for management of clinically significant drug-drug interactions with statins and select agents used in patients with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^117JMHTP]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Statin–calcium channel blocker combinations — dose limits and agent selection are specified as follows: Combination therapy with atorvastatin and diltiazem results in a minor increase in statin exposure and this combination therapy is reasonable. Diltiazem administered with either lovastatin or simvastatin is associated with moderate increases in statin exposure, although these combination therapies may be considered in appropriate patients. Coadministration of verapamil with lovastatin or simvastatin results in moderate increases in statin exposure. Therefore, these combination therapies may be considered when the potential for benefit outweighs potential risks. Doses of lovastatin or simvastatin > 20 mg daily when coadministered with amlodipine are not recommended. A non–CYP3A4-metabolized statin is preferred in combination with diltiazem or verapamil. Doses of simvastatin > 10 mg daily and doses of lovastatin > 20 mg daily when used with diltiazem or verapamil are not recommended. However, it should be noted that verapamil labeling recommends a higher dose limit of lovastatin of 40 mg daily when coadministered with verapamil. For adult patients on stable therapy with simvastatin 80 mg daily (a dose that is no longer recommended for general use), clinicians should change to a non–CYP3A4 statin such as pravastatin, rosuvastatin, or pitavastatin if therapy with diltiazem or verapamil is initiated. Caution should be exercised with statin-CCB combination therapy in patients of various ethnic backgrounds, particularly those of Asian descent.

### Recommendations for management of clinically significant drug-drug interactions with statins and select agents used in patients with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114u33Xy]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Diltiazem and verapamil — effects on simvastatin and lovastatin exposure and product labeling are as follows: Diltiazem and verapamil are moderate to weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, and in 10 healthy volunteers diltiazem increased the Cmax of simvastatin by 3.6-fold and simvastatin acid by 3.7-fold (P < 0.05), with the AUC of simvastatin increased by 5-fold (P < 0.05) and the elimination t1/2 by 2.3-fold (P < 0.05); diltiazem also increased the AUC of lovastatin by 3.6-fold and Cmax from 6 ± 2 to 26 ± 9 ng/mL but did not change the elimination t1/2. Current labeling advises that the dose of simvastatin not exceed 10 mg daily when co-prescribed with diltiazem or verapamil in adult patients and that the dose of lovastatin not exceed 20 mg daily; the approved labeling for diltiazem recommends the use of non–CYP3A4-metabolized statins in combination with diltiazem if possible; the product labeling for atorvastatin does not include dose adjustments for combination therapy with amlodipine, diltiazem, or verapamil, and labeling for verapamil recommends that when coadministration lower doses of atorvastatin may be considered.

### Single-substance trazodone exposures reported to US poison centers from 2000 to 2019 [^116oXqWA]. Clinical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Individual case reports describe trazodone overdose resulting in QTc prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias. The clinical effects and outcomes associated with trazodone exposures on a large-scale basis are less well known.

Objective

The primary objective was to characterize the severity of single substance trazodone exposures and identify any relationships that may exist between dose of trazodone and severity of exposure. The secondary objective was to describe these exposures from a demographic and clinical symptom standpoint.

Methods

A retrospective review of single-substance trazodone exposures reported to the National Poison Data System (NPDS) from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2019 was performed. The primary objective was to characterize the severity of trazodone exposures and relationships between ingested dose and level of care required or medical outcome.

Results

A total of 118,773 cases were included in the analysis of demographics and level of care required. A majority (59.5%) of cases did not require medical admission. Of the 81,698 cases with known medical outcomes, the most common clinical effects included mild-moderate CNS depression (49.7%), QTc prolongation (12.2% of cases in 2019), vomiting (9.0%), hypotension (7.0%), and tachycardia (7.0%). The median ingested dose associated with treatment, and release from the emergency department was 600mg compared to 1500mg in those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Regarding medical outcome, median ingested dose ranged from 600mg in those experiencing no effect to 1500mg in those experiencing major effects. Cardiac-related clinical effects and the need for cardiac-specific interventions were overall infrequent. A dose-response relationship was identified for level of care and medical outcome.

Conclusions

Many trazodone exposures can be characterized as low severity due to the infrequent need for healthcare facility admission and large proportion of cases that experienced no effects or only minor effects.

### Diltiazem hydrochloride (Tiazac) [^111zKuTZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Beta-blockers: Controlled and uncontrolled domestic studies suggest that concomitant use of diltiazem hydrochloride and beta-blockers is usually well tolerated, but available data are not sufficient to predict the effects of concomitant treatment in patients with left ventricular dysfunction or cardiac conduction abnormalities. Administration of diltiazem hydrochloride concomitantly with propranolol in five normal volunteers resulted in increased propranolol levels in all subjects and bioavailability of propranolol was increased approximately 50%. In vitro, propranolol appears to be displaced from its binding sites by diltiazem. If combination therapy is initiated or withdrawn in conjunction with propranolol, an adjustment in the propranolol dose may be warranted (see WARNINGS).

Buspirone: In nine healthy subjects, diltiazem significantly increased the mean buspirone AUC 5.5-fold and Cmax4.1-fold compared to placebo. The T½and Tmaxof buspirone were not significantly affected by diltiazem. Enhanced effects and increased toxicity of buspirone may be possible during concomitant administration with diltiazem. Subsequent dose adjustments may be necessary during coadministration, and should be based on clinical assessment.

Carbamazepine: Concomitant administration of diltiazem with carbamazepine has been reported to result in elevated serum levels of carbamazepine (40% to 72% increase), resulting in toxicity in some cases. Patients receiving these drugs concurrently should be monitored for a potential drug interaction.

Cimetidine: A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak diltiazem plasma levels (58%) and AUC (53%) after a 1-week course of cimetidine 1200 mg/day and a single dose of diltiazem 60 mg. Ranitidine produced smaller, nonsignificant increases. The effect may be mediated by cimetidine's known inhibition of hepatic cytochrome P450, the enzyme system responsible for the first-pass metabolism of diltiazem. Patients currently receiving diltiazem therapy should be carefully monitored for a change in pharmacological effect when initiating and discontinuing therapy with cimetidine. An adjustment in the diltiazem dose may be warranted.

Clonidine: Sinus bradycardia resulting in hospitalization and pacemaker insertion has been reported in association with the use of clonidine concurrently with diltiazem. Monitor heart rate in patients receiving concomitant diltiazem and clonidine.

### Quetiapine for insomnia associated with refractory depression exacerbated by phenelzine [^115qmeC8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To report the successful treatment of phenelzine-associated insomnia with low-dose quetiapine in a patient with refractory depression.

Case Summary

A 42-year-old white man with severe major depression unresponsive to selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, bupropion, and tricyclic antidepressants improved following treatment with the monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) phenelzine. Insomnia, present to a moderate degree prior to antidepressant therapy, worsened markedly following phenelzine treatment and failed to respond to diphenhydramine, temazepam, triazolam, clonazepam, zolpidem, or trazodone given at high therapeutic doses. Sleep disturbance resolved with low-dose (50 mg) adjunctive quetiapine, with no adverse effects.

Discussion

Major depression refractory to standard therapy is a common and serious condition. Some cases respond to MAOIs; however, orthostatic hypotension and insomnia frequently occur. Potentially serious MAOI interactions with psychotropic drugs have raised concerns about combining these agents. In this case, a failure of a number of other medications known to treat MAOI-associated insomnia safely prompted a trial of quetiapine. Despite the possibility that enhanced serotonergic activity might have resulted in serotonin syndrome, no adverse interactions between phenelzine and quetiapine were noted. The use of low-dose, once-daily quetiapine, along with its unique binding properties, may account for its increased safety in combination with phenelzine.

Conclusions

This case illustrates that low-dose quetiapine may be an alternative treatment for phenelzine-associated insomnia. Further case reports are needed to establish the safety and effectiveness of combining these agents.

### Association of oral anticoagulants and verapamil or diltiazem with adverse bleeding events in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and normal kidney function [^112FctRa]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Our objective was to conduct a targeted comparative safety analysis of the potential drug-drug interaction between verapamil or diltiazem and DOACs using an active comparator study design to reduce the residual confounding present in existing real-world studies. An ideal active comparator should be either of the same medication class or be used for similar purposes as the reference product. Therefore, we selected 2 different comparators: amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocking antihypertensive drug, and metoprolol, a β-blocker antihypertensive that is also recommended for heart rate control in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. These 2 drugs are not classified as P-gp or CYP3A4 inhibitors and provide similar pharmacologic pathways and therapeutic uses compared with verapamil and diltiazem. We aimed to compare the risk of major, moderate, and minor adverse bleeding events among patients with concomitant use of DOACs and verapamil or diltiazem vs concomitant use of DOACs and amlodipine or metoprolol.

Adverse effects of long-term glucocorticoid therapy include higher event rates in exposed rheumatoid arthritis cohorts and risks even at low doses; a British cohort study involving 9387 patients with rheumatoid arthritis observed over a median of 8 years with an average prednisolone dose of 5.8 mg/day for approximately 9.5 months exhibited elevated rates of diabetes, osteoporosis, fractures, hypertension, thrombotic events, gastrointestinal complications, and increased mortality compared to those not treated with glucocorticoids, and studies have linked even low dose use (prednisone 2.5–7.5 mg/day) to increased risks.

### 2021 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^112dwZWq]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Use of glucocorticoids — patients taking glucocorticoids to remain at target: Addition of/switching to DMARDs is conditionally recommended over continuation of glucocorticoids for patients taking glucocorticoids to remain at target. This recommendation assumes that improved disease control with DMARDs should allow less use of glucocorticoids. The recommendation is conditional because the continued use of glucocorticoids may be required for patients who do not respond to DMARDs even after maximizing methotrexate dosage and switching DMARD classes.

### Silent ischemic interval on exercise test is a predictor of response to drug therapy: a randomized crossover trial of metoprolol versus diltiazem in stable angina [^116kAf3p]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Background and Hypothesis

There is no method available to predict the relative antianginal efficacy of beta blockers and calcium-channel antagonists. The present study was undertaken to assess the role of silent ischemic interval (SII) on exercise treadmill test (ETT) as a predictor of response to therapy with metoprolol and diltiazem in patients with stable angina.

Methods

Thirty-four patients with stable angina were divided into two groups depending upon the presence or absence of an SII gap of at least 1 min between onset of ST depression and appearance of angina on ETT. Metoprolol (50–100 mg twice daily) and diltiazem (60–120 mg three times daily) were randomly assigned for 6 weeks to patients in each group, and then patients were crossed over for further 6 weeks after a washout period of 2 weeks. Antianginal efficacy was assessed by clinical and exercise parameters.

Results

In patients with SII, the clinical responder rate was better with metoprolol than with diltiazem (90 vs. 60%, respectively), and on ETT, metoprolol produced significant improvement in the total exercise time (p < 0.01), time to 1 mm ST depression (p < 0.01), time to angina (p < 0.01), and a significant decrease in peak rate-pressure product (p < 0.001), whereas diltiazem had no significant effect on exercise parameters. However, in patients without SII, metoprolol and diltiazem had a similar clinical responder rate (57%), and both produced a significant increase in total exercise time (p < 0.01), time to 1 mm ST depression (p < 0.01), and time to angina (p < 0.01). In addition, metoprolol had a significant effect on peak rate-pressure product (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Silent ischemic interval on ETT can be a predictor of response to antianginal therapy in stable angina, as patients with SII respond better to metoprolol and those without SII respond equally to both metoprolol and diltiazem.

Case presentation

A 62-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a fall, and described 6 weeks of lethargy, night sweats and mouth ulcers, as well as a 10% weight loss over 6 months.

His history was most significant for rheumatoid arthritis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, controlled hypertension, transient ischaemic attack and an excised squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. He was a former smoker with a 20 pack-year history. Relevant medications for his rheumatoid arthritis included methotrexate 20 mg weekly, folic acid 5 mg weekly, leflunomide 20 mg daily and prednisolone 5 mg daily, the doses of which had been constant for approximately 18 months. In addition, he had been recently treated for vitamin B12 deficiency by his general practitioner.

Initial laboratory investigations revealed a macrocytic anaemia (haemoglobin 95 g/L, mean corpuscular volume 101 fL), leucopenia (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 1.0×10⁹/L and lymphocyte count 0.5×10⁹/L), deranged liver function tests and acute kidney injury. The initial platelet count was normal at 171×10⁹/L. C reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were not elevated and a whole body CT scan was unremarkable. Vitamin B12 levels were adequate, consistent with recent replacement. His methotrexate was ceased, and on the third day of his admission he was presumptively treated for methotrexate toxicity with calcium folinate rescue; however, serum methotrexate levels subsequently returned as undetectable.
