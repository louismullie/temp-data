## Question

What is posterior ankle impingement syndrome (PAIS), and how does it occur?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what posterior ankle impingement syndrome (PAIS) is and how it occurs. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and clinical construct. Then, the posterior ankle anatomy and key structures involved. Next, I should examine the kinematic mechanisms — acute traumatic versus chronic repetitive — by which impingement occurs. After that, I will distinguish osseous from soft-tissue drivers and outline the sequential pathophysiology. Then, I need to consider contributing risk factors and at-risk populations. Finally, I should review the clinical presentation and diagnostic context, including imaging nuances, and end with a succinct synthesis tying mechanism to presentation.

> Let me first confirm the core definition. Posterior ankle impingement syndrome is a clinical disorder characterized by posterior ankle pain provoked during forced plantar flexion, typically reflecting a mechanical conflict within the posterior ankle compartment; it may arise acutely after hyper-plantar flexion trauma or chronically from repetitive stress, and while os trigonum pathology is common, PAIS encompasses broader osseous and soft-tissue etiologies beyond accessory ossicles alone [^112rdGuz] [^113JHiDn] [^115afBya].

> I need to check the anatomic substrate next. The impingement interface is classically between the posterosuperior talus and the tibial plafond within the tibiocalcaneal interval during terminal plantar flexion, with potential involvement of the posterior talar processes (including a Stieda process), os trigonum, posterior joint capsule, flexor hallucis longus (FHL) tendon and retinaculum, posterior intermalleolar ligament, and Kager's fat pad; the posterior talofibular and intermalleolar ligaments can contribute to the impingement complex and are anatomically contiguous with structures abutting the FHL tunnel [^115kALEp] [^111Gkth1] [^115afBya] [^113tNe8v].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without clarifying the kinematic mechanism. PAIS reflects a failure to accommodate the physiologic narrowing of the posterior ankle interval at maximal plantar flexion: a single hyper-plantar flexion event can acutely bruise or trap tissues, whereas repetitive end-range plantar flexion in activities like ballet en pointe/demi-pointe or soccer push-off cumulates microtrauma, provoking synovitis, capsular thickening, and conflict of posterior talar structures against the tibial plafond and calcaneus [^115kALEp] [^112rdGuz] [^112oGDoh] [^115afBya].

> Let me consider the pathophysiologic sources, and I should confirm osseous versus soft-tissue drivers. Osseous contributors include os trigonum syndrome with degenerative synchondrosis change, fragmentation, or impaction, an elongated lateral talar process (Stieda process), and posterior calcaneal bone spikes after calcaneal fracture malunion; soft-tissue drivers include post-traumatic synovitis, intra-articular fibrotic bands, posterior capsular hypertrophy, and FHL tenosynovitis, with rare chondrogenic meniscus-like or hyaline-like tissue generation described in dancers; I should double-check the os trigonum prevalence, which is typically reported in the 7–25% range, consistent with population anatomical variability [^111GscuP] [^112SwAdh] [^112fKdmM] [^116bXbmM] [^115kALEp] [^115afBya] [^111GTF51] [^1164bPBa].

> Next, I should review the sequential cascade to ensure the mechanism is coherent. Forced plantar flexion first reduces the posterior compartment volume and brings bony prominences or hypertrophied soft tissues into conflict, which then triggers synovitis, capsular inflammation, and scarring; with chronic loading, bone marrow edema occurs in the posterior talus or os trigonum consistent with microtrabecular injury, and adjacent FHL irritation or tenosynovitis evolves, culminating in painful mechanical blockade and functional limitation during plantar flexion [^115kALEp] [^111Gkth1] [^1153JGTC] [^115afBya].

> But wait, what if underlying predispositions amplify this cycle? I need to ensure I factor in risk modifiers. Anatomical predisposition such as the presence of an os trigonum increases susceptibility, and chronic lateral ankle instability may create pathological anterior talar translation that exacerbates posterior conflict during plantar flexion; high-risk groups include ballet dancers, soccer players, gymnasts, and other athletes with repetitive end-range plantar flexion demands, and delayed recognition is reported in adolescents with sports specialization, often after multiple misdiagnoses [^1164bPBa] [^1155FKrT] [^117399av] [^115kALEp] [^111GscuP] [^111Yotzs].

> I will now examine the clinical presentation and diagnostic context, but let me first confirm the key symptom pattern. Patients report chronic or recurrent posterior ankle pain worsened by forced plantar flexion or push-off, often with stiffness and focal posterolateral tenderness; diagnosis is primarily clinical, but imaging supports etiology: the posterior impingement radiographic view improves os trigonum detection over the lateral radiograph, MRI delineates bone marrow edema, synovitis, posterior capsular thickening, FHL tenosynovitis, and Kager's fat pad edema, and SPECT/CT can help discriminate metabolically active from inactive os trigonum when conventional imaging is inconclusive; unresolved "sprain" pain should prompt reconsideration of impingement and mimickers in persistent cases [^112rdGuz] [^115zbqUF] [^111Gkth1] [^115afBya] [^115fN4Ff] [^112oGDoh].

> Hmm, wait a minute — I initially thought to call MRI the "gold standard", but I should verify that language. While MRI is generally the preferred comprehensive modality for depicting both osseous and soft-tissue features of PAIS and os trigonum syndrome, the diagnosis remains primarily clinical and arthroscopy is the definitive modality when needed; guideline frameworks for chronic ankle/foot pain also endorse radiographs as first-line imaging and MRI when clinical suspicion persists or soft-tissue characterization is required, so I should avoid overstating MRI as the "gold standard" despite its superior soft-tissue and marrow sensitivity [^111Gkth1] [^115afBya] [^112rdGuz] [^116BtoQ4] [^115L1ZTk].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Posterior ankle impingement syndrome is a motion-related mechanical compression disorder in which posterior ankle structures — including posterior talar processes or an os trigonum, posterior capsule, synovium, the posterior intermalleolar region, and the FHL complex — are pinched between the talus and tibia/calcaneus during forced plantar flexion; it arises either acutely from hyper-plantar flexion or, more commonly, cumulatively via repetitive end-range plantar flexion in athletes, with a pathophysiology that spans osseous impaction and soft-tissue inflammation/fibrosis, bone marrow edema, and tendon irritation, producing characteristic posterior pain and mechanical limitation, especially in dancers and soccer players [^115kALEp] [^112rdGuz] [^111GscuP] [^115afBya] [^1153JGTC].

---

Posterior ankle impingement syndrome (PAIS) is a motion-related disorder characterized by **posterior ankle pain during forced plantarflexion** [^112rdGuz], most often due to repetitive microtrauma or a single hyperplantarflexion event. The key mechanism is **mechanical conflict** between the posterior talus (os trigonum or Stieda process) and the tibia or calcaneus, often with soft-tissue inflammation or FHL tenosynovitis [^112SwAdh]. It is common in ballet dancers, soccer players, and gymnasts due to repeated plantarflexion [^115kALEp] and can also follow ankle sprains or fractures [^111GscuP] [^116bXbmM]. Diagnosis is primarily clinical [^112rdGuz], supported by imaging (radiographs, CT, MRI) [^112SwAdh] [^116BtoQ4], and management is typically **conservative**, with surgery reserved for refractory cases [^111GscuP] [^113ntACp].

---

## Anatomical structures involved

PAIS involves the following **anatomical structures**:

- **Os trigonum**: An accessory ossicle posterior to the talus [^111GscuP], present in 7–25% of the population [^1164bPBa], and a common cause of PAIS [^112SwAdh].

- **Stieda process**: An elongated lateral tubercle of the posterior talar process [^112fKdmM] that can impinge between the tibia and calcaneus.

- **Flexor hallucis longus (FHL) tendon**: Runs through the posterior ankle [^112SwAdh] and can develop tenosynovitis due to repetitive friction or impingement [^115afBya].

- **Posterior ankle capsule and ligaments**: Including the posterior talofibular ligament [^113tNe8v], which can become inflamed or thickened, contributing to impingement [^113JHiDn].

---

## Pathophysiology and mechanisms

PAIS results from **mechanical conflict** between posterior ankle structures during **forced plantarflexion**. The primary mechanisms include:

- **Repetitive microtrauma**: Common in ballet dancers, soccer players, and gymnasts [^115kALEp], leading to chronic inflammation, synovitis, and soft-tissue thickening [^111GscuP] [^112SwAdh].

- **Acute hyperplantarflexion injury**: Single traumatic events causing acute inflammation, synovitis, or fracture of the posterior talar process [^112rdGuz] [^115kALEp].

- **Accessory ossicles**: The os trigonum or Stieda process [^112SwAdh] can become symptomatic due to repetitive impingement, leading to chronic pain and inflammation [^111GscuP].

- **Soft-tissue impingement**: Synovitis, capsular thickening, or FHL tenosynovitis can cause pain and mechanical limitation of ankle motion [^112SwAdh] [^1153JGTC].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients with PAIS typically present with **posterior ankle pain** exacerbated by forced plantarflexion, such as during dancing, kicking, or downhill running [^112rdGuz] [^115afBya]. Swelling and stiffness localized to the posterior ankle are common, often with tenderness to palpation [^112SwAdh]. Mechanical symptoms, including catching, locking, or clicking due to impingement of bony or soft-tissue structures, may also occur [^112SwAdh].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis of PAIS is **primarily clinical**, supported by imaging studies:

- **Clinical examination**: Posterior ankle pain reproduced by forced plantarflexion, tenderness over the posterior talus, and positive hyperplantarflexion test [^112rdGuz] [^111cVP4U].

- **Radiographs**: Lateral ankle radiographs can identify os trigonum or Stieda process [^111Gkth1]; the posterior impingement view improves detection sensitivity [^115zbqUF].

- **MRI**: Gold standard for evaluating soft-tissue involvement, bone marrow edema, synovitis, and FHL tenosynovitis [^112SwAdh] [^1153JGTC] [^115afBya].

- **CT**: Useful for detailed assessment of bony structures and complex cases [^112SwAdh] [^115L1ZTk].

---

## Treatment options

Treatment of PAIS typically follows a **stepwise approach**, with **conservative management** as the initial treatment — rest, activity modification, physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications, and corticosteroid injections [^111GscuP] [^111cVP4U]. Surgical intervention is indicated for **refractory cases or persistent symptoms despite conservative treatment**, with options including **arthroscopic or open excision** of the os trigonum or Stieda process and debridement of inflamed soft tissues [^113ntACp] [^117GTzSj] [^111ZFz2V].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Overall, **prognosis** is favorable with appropriate treatment [^116cNkRW]; conservative management is effective in most cases, and surgery provides good outcomes for refractory cases [^111GscuP] [^113ntACp]. Recurrence rates are **low** with proper management [^111GscuP], though symptoms may persist or recur if underlying anatomical abnormalities are not addressed [^113ntACp] [^114CHi1S].

---

Posterior ankle impingement syndrome (PAIS) is a motion-related disorder characterized by **posterior ankle pain during forced plantarflexion** and caused by mechanical conflict between posterior ankle structures. It is common among athletes and dancers and is managed primarily with **conservative treatment**, with surgery reserved for refractory cases.

### Posterior ankle impingement in athletes: Pathogenesis, imaging features and differential diagnoses [^115kALEp]. European Journal of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Posterior ankle impingement is a clinical diagnosis which can be seen following a traumatic hyper-plantar flexion event and may lead to painful symptoms in athletes such as female dancers ('en pointe'), football players, javelin throwers, and gymnasts. Symptoms of posterior ankle impingement are due to failure to accommodate the reduced interval between the posterosuperior aspect of the talus and tibial plafond during plantar flexion and can be due to osseous or soft tissue lesions.

There are multiple causes of posterior ankle impingement. Most commonly, the structural correlates of impingement relate to post-traumatic synovitis and intra-articular fibrous bands, scar tissue, capsular scarring, or bony prominences.

The aims of this pictorial review article are to describe different types of posterior ankle impingement due to traumatic and non-traumatic osseous and soft tissue pathology in athletes, describe diagnostic imaging strategies of these pathologies, and illustrate their imaging features, including relevant differential diagnoses.

### Posterior ankle impingement syndrome [^112rdGuz]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2005). Low credibility.

Posterior ankle impingement syndrome is a clinical disorder characterized by posterior ankle pain that occurs in forced plantar flexion. The pain may be acute as a result of trauma or chronic from repetitive stress. Pathology of the os trigonum-talar process is the most common cause of this syndrome, but it also may result from flexor hallucis longus tenosynovitis, ankle osteochondritis, subtalar joint disease, and fracture.

Patients usually report chronic or recurrent posterior ankle pain caused or exacerbated by forced plantar flexion or push-off maneuvers, such as may occur during dancing, kicking, or downhill running. Diagnosis of posterior ankle impingement syndrome is based primarily on clinical history and physical examination. Radiography, scintigraphy, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging depict associated bone and soft-tissue abnormalities. Symptoms typically improve with nonsurgical management, but surgery may be required in refractory cases.

### Os trigonum syndrome [^111GscuP]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2014). Low credibility.

Os trigonum syndrome is the result of an overuse injury of the posterior ankle caused by repetitive plantar flexion stress. It is predominantly seen in ballet dancers and soccer players and is primarily a clinical diagnosis characterized by exacerbated posterior ankle pain while dancing on pointe or demi-pointe or during push-off maneuvers. Symptoms may improve with rest or activity modification. Imaging studies, including a lateral radiographic view of the ankle in maximal plantar flexion, typically reveal the os trigonum between the posterior tibial lip and calcaneus. If an os trigonum is absent on radiography, an MRI may reveal scar tissue behind the posterior talus, a condition associated with similar symptoms. Os trigonum syndrome is often associated with pathology of the flexor hallucis longus tendon.

Treatment begins with nonsurgical measures. In addition to physical therapy, symptomatic athletes may need surgical excision of the os trigonum due to the unavoidable plantar flexion associated with their sport. This surgery can be performed using open or arthroscopic approaches.

### Sesamoids and accessory ossicles of the foot: anatomical variability and related pathology [^112SwAdh]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Pathology attributed to the os trigonum is encompassed by the term os trigonum syndrome, which falls within the spectrum of posterior ankle impingement syndrome. Pain associated with the os trigonum may be related to degenerative changes at the synchondrosis, fracture of the posterior lateral talar process, local synovitis, flexor hallucis longus tenosynovitis, or intra-articular loose bodies. Repetitive plantar flexion predisposes individuals to this syndrome, as seen in ballet dancers, basketball players, and football players. Clinically, patients may experience chronic pain with stiffness, soft tissue swelling, and tenderness to deep posterolateral palpation.

On imaging, radiographs demonstrate the presence or absence of an os trigonum, soft tissue swelling, and infiltration of fat. CT may demonstrate fractures or fragmentation, and degeneration at the synchondrosis. MRI is the superior imaging modality in the evaluation of posterior ankle impingement syndrome, as intrinsic osseous pathology and associated soft tissue abnormalities such as synovitis and tenosynovitis are readily apparent.

### Outcome of resection of a symptomatic os trigonum [^113akL5H]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2003). Low credibility.

While an os trigonum at the posterolateral aspect of the talus is usually asymptomatic, this inconsistently present accessory bone has been associated with persistent posterior ankle pain, described as the os trigonum syndrome. We present the clinical results of excision of the os trigonum through a posterolateral approach and report several factors affecting the clinical outcome.

- **Methods**: During a five-year period from 1994 through 1999, forty-one patients experienced failure of nonoperative treatment of os trigonum syndrome and underwent excision of a symptomatic os trigonum. In all cases, the os trigonum syndrome was diagnosed based on the history, physical examination, and radiographs. Postoperatively, patients were evaluated according to the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Hindfoot Scale. A questionnaire assessed the effect of several factors on the clinical outcome.

- **Results**: The average duration of follow-up was forty-four months. The postoperative AOFAS score averaged 87.6 points. Thirty-three patients with symptoms for two years or less before the surgery had an average postoperative score of 90 points compared to 78 points for the eight patients with preoperative symptoms for more than two years (p = 0.011). Eight patients experienced sural nerve sensory loss, which was temporary in four and permanent in four. A superficial wound infection developed in one patient, and reflex sympathetic dystrophy developed in another.

- **Conclusions**: An os trigonum that is persistently symptomatic can significantly affect clinical outcomes.

### Anterior ankle impingement syndrome is less frequent, but associated with a longer absence and higher re-injury rate compared to posterior syndrome: a prospective cohort study of 6754 male professional soccer players [^112dPLnT]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2022). Low credibility.

During the 18-season period, a total of 3,686,838 hours of exposure and 25,462 injuries were reported. Ninety-three AAIS and PAIS syndromes (0.4%) were recorded in 77 players. Eleven players sustained two to four syndrome presentations each during the study period. The right ankle was affected in 50 cases (54%) and the left ankle in 41 cases (44%), while only 2 cases were bilateral (2%). The mean age at the time of presentation was 25.4 ± 4.2 years. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between players who suffered AAIS and PAIS.

- **Injury characteristics**: AAIS and PAIS represented 35 (38%) and 58 (62%) of the ankle impingement cases, respectively. The majority had a gradual onset (both n = 51, 55%) and occurred during training. Sixteen (18%) cases were considered exacerbations of symptoms. AAIS and PAIS were similar with regard to injury characteristics, except for a greater proportion of AAIS being re-injuries [11 (32%) vs. 5 (9%); P < 0.01] and having a gradual onset [24 (69%) vs. 27 (47%); P = 0.03]. Information about player contact was collected from the 2004/05 season onward and was available for 76 of 93 injuries. Of those 76 impingement injuries, there was a noncontact injury mechanism in 53 (69%) of the cases, with no difference in mechanisms between AAIS and PAIS.

### Arthroscopic treatment for anterior ankle impingement: A systematic review of the current literature [^115TF8WE]. Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

To provide a comprehensive overview of the clinical outcomes of arthroscopic procedures used as a treatment strategy for anterior ankle impingement, a systematic literature search was performed using the Medline, Embase (Classic), and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) databases.

Studies meeting the following inclusion criteria were reviewed: those reporting outcomes of arthroscopic treatment for anterior ankle impingement; those with more than 20 patients; those with a study population of at least 18 years of age; and those in English, Dutch, German, Italian, or Spanish. Two reviewers independently performed data extraction, which included population characteristics, as well as both primary and secondary outcome measures. The Downs and Black scale was employed to assess the methodological quality of randomized and nonrandomized studies included in this review.

Twenty articles were included in this systematic review. Overall, good results were observed for arthroscopic treatment in patients with anterior ankle impingement. Studies reporting patient satisfaction rates showed high percentages of good to excellent satisfaction (74% to 100%). Additionally, the percentages of patients willing to undergo the same procedure again were also high (94.3% to 97.5%). Complication rates were low (4.6%), particularly regarding major complications (1.1%). The high heterogeneity of the included studies made it impossible to compare the results of the studies, including…

### Anterior ankle impingement syndrome is less frequent, but associated with a longer absence and higher re-injury rate compared to posterior syndrome: a prospective cohort study of 6754 male professional soccer players [^112nQ3L9]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2022). Low credibility.

The median absence following an ankle impingement injury was 7 (IQR 16) days, and 15 (16%) of the injuries were severe, with more than 28 days on the sidelines.

- **Severity of ankle impingement in male professional soccer players**: The severity analysis revealed that anterior ankle impingement syndrome (AAIS) and posterior ankle impingement syndrome (PAIS) differ in terms of absence duration.

- **Injury absence and severity**: Median absence was significantly longer in AAIS compared to PAIS [10 (22) vs. 6 (11) days; P = 0.023]. Gradual-onset injuries resulted in significantly longer median absences compared to acute-onset injuries [8 (22) vs. 5 (11) days; P = 0.014].

In this study, data are expressed as mean ± SD or n (%).

### Anterior ankle impingement syndrome is less frequent, but associated with a longer absence and higher re-injury rate compared to posterior syndrome: a prospective cohort study of 6754 male professional soccer players [^1164bPBa]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2022). Low credibility.

The annual socioeconomic loss due to soccer injuries costs over $US 30 billion worldwide, with the ankle region being the fifth most commonly injured location, representing 13% of all injuries in soccer. Player contact is a predominant cause of foot and ankle injuries (32–74%), but injuries also occur without player contact. Ankle impingement is recognized as a common source of pain, limited range of motion, and potential time loss in soccer.

Ankle impingement is considered a syndrome and can be due to a broad range of pathologies and etiologies. They may present as acute traumatic injuries but more commonly as gradual-onset conditions due to repetitive stress. While ankle impingement syndromes can be classified in detail according to the anatomical zone into anterior, anterolateral, anteromedial, posterolateral, and posteromedial, most practitioners categorize them, for simplicity, into either anterior ankle impingement syndrome (AAIS) or posterior ankle impingement syndrome (PAIS). AAIS was first recognized by Morris, who named it "athlete's ankle" in 1943, and later described as the "footballer's ankle" by McMurray in 1950. It is more commonly a bony impingement of tibiotalar osteophytes that has been reported to affect up to 60% of professional soccer players. PAIS, on the other hand, arises more commonly due to forced or repetitive plantarflexion of the ankle, which stresses the posterior ankle structures in the tibiocalcaneal interval narrowed by bony structures such as os trigonum, which is present in 7–25% of the general population.

### Anatomical variation in the ankle and foot: From incidental finding to inductor of pathology. Part I: Ankle and hindfoot [^111Gkth1]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Symptoms of os trigonum syndrome may result from various situations and consist of chronic pain with stiffness, soft tissue swelling, and tenderness to palpation in the postero-lateral aspect. The os trigonum syndrome constitutes a subtype of posterior ankle impingement syndrome.

Radiographs can detect the presence of an os trigonum; however, their sensitivity is limited in assessing early bone changes associated with pathology development. The posterior impingement view has been shown to be more sensitive than the lateral view in the detection of an os trigonum.

Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are capable of detecting associated bone and soft tissue abnormalities. On CT images, irregularity and sclerosis, or changes related to degenerative alterations on the articular surfaces of the synchondrosis, may be present due to chronic stress and abnormal movement.

On MRI images, the presence of bone marrow oedema in both aspects of the synchondrosis, fluid within or joint effusion, or signs of soft tissue involvement, such as oedema in surrounding structures or tenosynovitis of the flexor hallucis longus, will be indicative of os trigonum syndrome.

Increased signal intensity is seen in the subchondral bone in both aspects of the synchondrosis (white arrows), with a small amount of fluid in the posterior aspect of the tibio-talar joint.

### Anterior ankle impingement syndrome is less frequent, but associated with a longer absence and higher re-injury rate compared to posterior syndrome: A prospective cohort study of 6754 male professional soccer players [^111r5z3E]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2022). Low credibility.

Data collection was undertaken in accordance with the 2006 consensus statement on how to conduct injury surveillance research in soccer and in line with the recent 2020 International Olympic Committee (IOC) consensus statement. The overall study methodology has previously been described in detail.

In brief, all first team players in the included teams were invited to participate in the study. At the beginning of every season, teams appointed a contact person within their medical team to be responsible for collecting data and communicating with the study group. Player baseline data were collected at inclusion on an annual basis. All individual player exposures during supervised training sessions and matches were recorded on standard attendance records. Time loss injuries were registered on standard injury cards containing information about the type, location, and circumstances of the injury. The appointed contact person reported attendance records and injury cards monthly to the study group, which checked the reports and sent feedback to the teams to clarify any missing or unclear data. No specific diagnostic criteria for anterior ankle impingement syndrome (AAIS) and posterior ankle impingement syndrome (PAIS) were used, and it was up to the medical staff to classify the injuries and refer for imaging or any other consultations needed. All injuries were given a diagnostic code by the study group per the Orchard Sports Injury Classification System (OSICS) 10. Injury was defined as any physical complaint sustained by a player that resulted from a soccer match or soccer training and led to the player being unable to take part.

### The ESSKA-AFAS international consensus statement on peroneal tendon pathologies [^113sNYNo]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

This consensus statement was initiated by the Ankle and Foot Associates (ESSKA-AFAS) of the European Society of Sports Traumatology, Knee Surgery and Arthroscopy (ESSKA). ESSKA is one of the leading organizations worldwide concerning sports-related pathology. Using the Nominal Group Technique or mini-Delphi method, an international consensus panel (ICP) was selected by the board of the ESSKA-AFAS based on extensive knowledge and experience regarding the management of, and science pertaining to, peroneal injury. The panel was specifically compiled to gain a global representation that would cover a spectrum of opinions relevant to peroneal pathology. In total, fourteen orthopedic surgeons, one PhD student, and one physiotherapist were invited to join the panel. All participants were required to have at least one published or submitted peer-reviewed paper on the topic. Represented countries included Australia, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.

After the initial proposal of potential discussion topics by the board of ESSKA-AFAS, the ICP agreed upon ten final questions requiring accurate study and consensus assessment. The questions were unanimously considered to represent controversial and relevant topics for daily practice. Each subject was designated to two independent panel members who individually performed a literature search using the PubMed and Cochrane databases to identify relevant literature published before the panel meeting date.

### Outcomes of a 2-portal endoscopic technique for osseous lesions resulting in posterior ankle impingement syndrome [^114CHi1S]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Posterior ankle impingement syndrome is common in sporting populations and encompasses a range of disorders that cause posterior ankle pain during maximal forced plantarflexion. The aim of this study was to evaluate the short- and medium- to long-term outcomes of 2-portal endoscopic surgery for osseous lesions causing posterior ankle impingement syndrome. This was a retrospective case series analysis of all patients who underwent 2-portal endoscopic surgery at a single institution between 2005 and 2016. Visual analogue scales and selected components of the Short Form of the Revised Foot Function Index were used to assess ankle function, with the median follow-up time being 4.8 years. Of the 52 patients, 49 (94%) were able to return to their previous sport/physical activity, with the mean time taken being 5.8 months. At the completion of follow-up, the mean pain score during exercise had improved from 7.5 to 0.9 points. The mean work and sporting function scores also improved, from 5.9 to 9.6 points and 2.9 to 8.8 points, respectively. The mean score of the Short Form of the Revised Foot Function Index also improved by 77.7 points, from 84.4 to 6.7 at the completion of follow-up. There were no postoperative infections or any other major complications. This study provides strong supporting evidence for the use of hindfoot endoscopy in the treatment of posterior ankle impingement syndrome in athletes.

### The ESSKA-AFAS international consensus statement on peroneal tendon pathologies [^1112LShQ]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

- **Key features for diagnosis**: Initial assessment of a patient presenting with an acute ankle injury should follow the Ottawa ankle guidelines. Based on imaging and physical examination, a specialist should be consulted for further examination. Both US and MRI are appropriate imaging modalities for the evaluation of peroneal tendons. Peroneal tendoscopy should be reserved for patients with high clinical suspicion of peroneal tendon pathology based on history and clinical exam, but with the absence of any positive findings on imaging. See Fig. 1 for a schematic algorithm on diagnostic management of peroneal tendon pathology.

- **Rationale**: Pathology of the peroneal tendons may present with a broad variety of symptoms. Acute dislocations typically present following an identifiable injury in a previously asymptomatic ankle. On investigation, there is posterolateral swelling and tenderness specifically over the SPR. Dislocation can frequently be reproduced on resisted eversion of the ankle.

		Acute tears are likely to present with a sudden onset of pain and swelling, which also might be caused by additional pathology such as a lateral ligament rupture often accompanying the acute pathology. Acute injuries present with bogginess and tenderness to palpation around the distal fibula. PB tears usually present with pain around the distal fibula, whereas PL tears typically present with pain near the peroneal tubercle and cuboid tunnel. Examination may also reveal respective weakness during ankle eversion and first ray plantarflexion.

Late complications after calcaneal fracture usually result in lateral heel pain. Malunion of joint depressed type calcaneal fracture can lead to posterior ankle impingement pain. This condition is caused by the posterior calcaneal bone spike formed just behind the posterior calcaneal facet. We describe a technique to resect the offending posterior calcaneal bone spike to relieve the posterior ankle impingement pain.

### Endoscopic versus open excision of os trigonum for the treatment of posterior ankle impingement syndrome in an athletic population: A randomized controlled study with 5-year follow-up [^113ntACp]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Open surgical excision of the os trigonum has been the traditional treatment for posterior ankle impingement syndrome (PAIS). However, the endoscopic excision has recently gained popularity. The purpose of our study was to compare the results of endoscopic versus open excision of a symptomatic os trigonum for the treatment of PAIS in an athletic population. It was hypothesized that the endoscopic technique would be superior to the open technique regarding functional outcomes, pain, and time to return to training and the previous sports level.

- **Study design**: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.

- **Methods**: From 2008 to 2011, 52 athletes underwent symptomatic os trigonum excision; 26 athletes had an open procedure (group A) and 26 had an endoscopic procedure (group B). The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot score and the Visual Analog Score-Foot and Ankle (VAS-FA) were obtained, and the time to return to training and to the previous sports level was recorded.

- **Results**: Patients in group B appeared to have significant improvement of AOFAS hindfoot score compared with those in group A (P < .05), whereas no statistical significance was found for the postoperative VAS-FA scores between the two groups. The mean ± SD time to return to training was 9.58 ± 3.98 weeks for group A and 4.58 ± 1.47 weeks for group B (P < .001). The time to return to the previous sports level was 11.54 ± 3.89 weeks for group A and 7.12 ± 2.25 weeks for group B (P < .001). The overall complication rate was 23% for group A (6 cases) and 3.8% for group B.

### Arthroscopic versus posterior endoscopic excision of a symptomatic os trigonum: a retrospective cohort study [^111ZFz2V]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Both subtalar arthroscopic and posterior endoscopic techniques are used to treat posterior ankle impingement syndrome (PAIS); however, there have been no studies comparing the two procedures.

- **Hypothesis**: Both arthroscopic and endoscopic excisions of the os trigonum are safe and effective in treating PAIS.

- **Study design**: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.

- **Methods**: Twenty-eight patients were treated with excision of the os trigonum either by an arthroscopic technique (16 patients) or an endoscopic technique (12 patients). The mean patient age was 29.8 years (range, 17–55 years), and the mean follow-up period was 30 months (range, 18–58 months). Preoperative and postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) score for pain, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, and Maryland Foot Score (MFS) were used to analyze the functional results. Duration of surgery, time to return to sports (RTS), and patient satisfaction were evaluated as well. The size of the os trigonum was measured using T1-weighted sagittal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The clinical and MRI results were compared between the two groups.

- **Results**: The VAS score, AOFAS score, and MFS for both the arthroscopic group (preoperative: 6.3, 63.8, and 61.5, respectively; postoperative: 1.2, 89.9, and 89.6, respectively) and endoscopic group (preoperative: 6.7, 64.8, and 62.5, respectively; postoperative: 1.2, 89.9, and 88.4, respectively) improved significantly (P < .01). The mean surgery and RTS times were 39.4 minutes and 7.5 weeks in the arthroscopic group and 34.8 minutes and 8.0 weeks in the endoscopic group.

### "Web impingement" of the ankle: a case report [^114pMDyP]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Fibrous bands differ from meniscoid tissue, the main distinction being that the meniscoid is attached at one end, whereas the fibrous band is attached at both ends. The meniscoid is flattened and usually tapers at its free end, originating at the inferolateral gutter on the anterior talofibular ligament or on the deltoid ligament on the medial side. A fibrous band is cord-like in cross-section and can be found anywhere in the joint.

A specimen was prepared by Golanó to illustrate fibrous bands in the anterior ankle recess, causing a web over the anterior dome of the talus (Fig. 3). Following repetitive impingement of the talar surface on the web with active dorsiflexion, superficial fraying of the cartilage of the anterior dome of the talus can be observed, which is in accordance with Guhl and Stone's findings.

- **Anatomical ankle specimen**: The arrows in Fig. 3 indicate a fibrous band extending from the distal tibia to the talus and fibula. Lateral malleolus (1), medial malleolus (2), anterior tibiofibular ligament (3), anterior talofibular ligament (4), tibionavicular part of the deltoid ligament (5), anterior tibiotalar part of the deltoid ligament (6), dorsal talonavicular ligament (7), subtalar joint (8), tarsal sinus (9).

Limitations of the present study include the small patient group and short follow-up period. Tol et al. demonstrated excellent or good results following a 5–8-year follow-up for arthroscopic treatment of anterior soft-tissue ankle impingement. However, comparable long-term results for the treatment pathology of the present study are lacking.

Regarding the follow-up and surveillance for ankle sprain, particularly in rehabilitation, the NATA 2013 guidelines recommend offering intervention strategies that address specific deficits in athletes with chronic ankle instability. These strategies should focus on balance, strength, and dynamic movements, including changes in direction, to reduce the risk of recurrent ankle sprains in patients with functional deficits.

### Tarsal tunnel syndrome associated with a bipartite talus [^117S4qS2]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Given evidence against other common causes of TTS, the bony process of the posterior fragment of the bipartite talus was believed to contribute to TTS through compression of the tibial nerve. Surgical management was pursued to remove the bone fragment, release the flexor retinaculum, and decompress the tarsal tunnel. As in a previously described study, patients with a compressive structure as the cause of their tibial neuropathy, treated with separation of the flexor retinaculum along with the removal of the space-occupying mass, were found to have a greater rate of symptom improvement compared with patients who received surgical treatment for TTS secondary to venous dilatations or of idiopathic origin. Other studies also demonstrate good postoperative recovery for patients with TTS after the removal of an extrinsic compressive etiology, with a positive Tinel sign indicative of a good prognosis, particularly with early surgical management. In this patient, the presence of TTS secondary to the fragment made removing it essential.

In the management of symptomatic bipartite talus, preoperative planning must consider the extent of articular involvement, with more articular involvement potentially contributing to subtalar instability after removal. In cases of potentially unstable subtalar joints, posterior fragments have been fused with the talar body and subtalar arthrodesis has been used. However, in smaller fragments, surgical removal without additional fixation has also been shown to have satisfactory outcomes.

### Surgical treatment for posterior ankle impingement [^117GTzSj]. Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

This study aims to provide an overview of both the open and endoscopic procedures used to treat posterior ankle impingement, as well as an analysis, evaluation, and comparison of their outcomes.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature search of the Medline, Embase (Classic), and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) databases and the Cochrane Database of Clinical and Randomized Controlled Trials was performed. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Downs and Black scale.

- **Results**: After reviewing 783 studies, 16 trials met the inclusion criteria. Of these trials, 6 reported on open surgical techniques and 10 evaluated endoscopic techniques. The complication rate (15.9% vs 7.2%) and time to return to full activity (16.0 weeks vs 11.3 weeks) differed between the two groups, both favoring endoscopic surgery.

- **Conclusions**: Although the level of evidence of the included studies is relatively low, it can be concluded that the endoscopic technique is superior to the open procedure.

- **Level of evidence**: Level IV, systematic review of Level IV studies.

### Editorial commentary: Ankle anterior impingement is common in athletes and could be under-recognized [^114rs9HP]. Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Arthroscopic treatment of anterior ankle pain shows good results, with high patient satisfaction and low complication rates. Anterior pain with ankle hyperdorsiflexion, restriction of dorsiflexion, and swelling, particularly in a soccer player or ballet dancer, is a classic presentation. Ankle anterior impingement is common in athletes and could be under-recognized.

All workup of lateral ankle instability should include a thorough history of the condition and a history of prior ankle instability and injuries. Many additional risk factors have also been identified, including intrinsic risk factors such as younger age and body mass index. Particularly in athletes, a detailed history of muscle strength and postural work has been shown to be correlated with lateral ankle instability, showing that those who do not engage in these types of activities are at higher risk of injury.

### Dysplasia epiphysealis hemimelica of talus mimicking posterior ankle impingement syndrome in a young male: a case report with review of the literature [^117P3ZPn]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Dysplasia epiphysealis hemimelica is a rare skeletal developmental disorder representing an osteocartilaginous tumor arising from one or more epiphyses during childhood. We report a case of a young male who presented with complaints of pain and swelling in the posteromedial aspect of the left ankle with the clinical diagnosis of posterior impingement syndrome. Imaging studies, including radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, suggested the possibility of localized juxta-articular dysplasia epiphysealis hemimelica arising from the talus. The patient was successfully treated by surgical excision. The postoperative histologic findings were consistent with osteochondroma. This case report emphasizes the possibility of dysplasia epiphysealis hemimelica in the differential diagnosis of impingement syndromes around the ankle. The aim of the present study was to familiarize clinicians with this rare entity, because the number of documented cases has been increasing.

### Current concepts review: Evaluation and management of posterior hip pain [^116RK2K8]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2018). Low credibility.

Understanding the etiology of and evolving research on intra- and extra-articular hip complaints requires comprehensive diagnosis and management of the spectrum of posterior hip diseases. Interest in posterior hip disorders has increased in recent years as new studies and theories have emerged regarding the disease process. Although most of the differential diagnoses around the posterior hip have traditionally been considered uncommon, recent reports suggest that these complaints have instead been commonly overlooked. Failure to identify the cause of posterior hip pain in a timely manner can increase pain perception, deteriorate the patient's hope, and consequently affect quality of life.

Posterior hip pain could be differentiated as intrapelvic and extrapelvic, and differential diagnosis is made based on a comprehensive history, physical examination, and imaging studies. Plain radiography, CT, MRI, 3T MRI, and imaging-guided injection tests are usually necessary for accurate diagnosis. Surgical intervention, whether endoscopic or open, is required for patients with long-standing symptoms for whom nonsurgical treatment has been unsuccessful and who have experienced temporary relief of their symptoms after injection. Orthopedic surgeons are uniquely trained in understanding the anatomy, biomechanics, clinical evaluation, and treatment of all five layers of the hip.

### SPECT/CT for discrimination between active and inactive os trigonum in posterior ankle syndrome [^115fN4Ff]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2025). Low credibility.

[99m Tc]-3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid bone scintigraphy was used to differentiate between posterior impingement syndrome and Haglund syndrome in a 34-year-old man with unclear right-sided ankle pain. The patient had an accessory os trigonum bilaterally, and previous X-ray, MRI, and CT were inconclusive. Using SPECT/CT with new iterative reconstruction algorithms based on CT images, the pathologic activation of bone metabolism at the right-sided os trigonum and the adjacent talus joint was revealed. Other causes of posterior ankle pain were ruled out, and posterior impingement syndrome was diagnosed.

### Anatomical variation in the ankle and foot: From incidental finding to inductor of pathology. Part II: Midfoot and forefoot [^115rB5GD]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Differential diagnosis has to be made with avulsion fractures of the tuberosity, which result from acute eversion of the foot and increased tension of the posterior tibialis tendon. These may occur in conjunction with impaction fractures of the cuboid, which can aid in diagnosis. A background of trauma and an irregular, rather than a smooth, separation line from the tubercle suggests a fracture (Fig. 5). The ossicle is typically well corticated with smooth contours and is bilateral. Clinically, and sometimes radiologically, a complete disruption of the synchondrosis with avulsion of the ossicle can resemble a fracture.

### Chronic lateral ankle instability increases the likelihood for surgery in athletes with os trigonum syndrome [^111DAGJs]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2019). Low credibility.

Materials and methods:

The pre-operative magnetic resonance images (MRI) of 80 professional athletes referred for surgical consultation at the Aspetar Hospital Orthopaedic Surgery Department during the past 5 years (2013–2017) were evaluated for the presence of chronic or acute lateral ligament complex injury. Inclusion criteria included the confirmation of an os trigonum on MRI imaging, a positive hyper-plantar flexion clinical test, and being a registered professional athlete with the Qatar Olympic Committee. The exclusion criterion was having previous ankle surgery or a malleolar fracture (lateral or medial).

A radiologist, blinded to the research question at Aspetar Hospital, was asked to review all ankle MRI images. The radiologist answered the following five radiological questions for each athlete:

- **Confirmation of os trigonum in the ankle**: yes/no.
- **Anterior talo-fibular ligament status**: grade 1–3.
- **Calcaneo-fibular ligament status**: grade 1–3.
- **Posterior talo-fibular ligament status**: grade 1–3.
- **Acute (< 6 weeks after trauma) or chronic ligament injury (≥ 3 months after trauma)**: assessed along the Radiological MRI guidelines.

This cohort was subdivided into two groups: a surgical (n = 40) and a non-surgical (n = 40) cohort. The division was decided based on a positive clinical hyper-plantar flexion test, a positive ultrasound-guided injection, and no improvement after 6 weeks of conservative rehabilitation.

All athletes were clinically evaluated by the same orthopaedic ankle expert and were diagnosed with a positive…

### Traumatic and non-traumatic bone marrow edema in ankle MRI: a pictorial essay [^1153JGTC]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Bone marrow edema (BME) can be a very sensitive sign in the different types of impingement. Posttraumatic changes, such as local synovitis, scars, thickened articular capsule or ligaments, and osteophytes, may cause different impingement syndromes based on the localization. The most common impingement is anterolateral impingement, followed by posterior and anterior impingement. BME is a bone manifestation of impingement.

- **Anterolateral impingement**: An uncommon complication of ATFL injury, it results in hemarthrosis and synovitis, less often in the thick inferior part of the ATFL. The anterolateral gutter becomes filled with synovitis, scar tissue, and small osseous fragments.

- **Posterior impingement**: An elongated posterior process of the talus or an os trigonum causes posterior ankle impingement. BME found in the posterior process of the talus or in the os trigonum, edema in Kager's fat pad, and effusion in the posterior ankle recess are frequent findings.

- **Anterior impingement**: This manifests as a painful limitation of dorsal ankle flexion, mostly in football players, called "footballers' ankle". Accumulation of micro-trauma on the talar neck and anterior distal tibia may result in synovitis, thickening of the articular capsule, or osteophytes with BME.

- **Figure 19**: A 22-year-old soccer player presented with chronic anterior ankle pain. There was no history of specific ankle trauma, leading to suspicion of anterior impingement. MRI showed anterior impingement with osteophytes (arrows) and bone marrow edema.

### Anterior ankle impingement syndrome is less frequent, but associated with a longer absence and higher re-injury rate compared to posterior syndrome: A prospective cohort study of 6754 male professional soccer players [^112rGFQF]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2022). Low credibility.

The principal findings of this study were that posterior ankle impingement syndrome (PAIS) occurred more frequently than anterior ankle impingement syndrome (AAIS). PAIS presented more often with a gradual onset, whereas AAIS led to a longer average absence and more re-injuries.

We calculated from Tables 4 and 5 that the total number of absence days for AAIS was 770, and for PAIS, it was 696. The number of days players are absent is a key message that coaches are attentive to, and the fact that PAIS has almost the same consequences for a team as the more well-known AAIS might provide new and useful information.

### Return to training and playing after posterior ankle arthroscopy for posterior impingement in elite professional soccer [^116cNkRW]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Posterior ankle impingement syndrome (PAIS) was first described in ballet dancers but is increasingly being diagnosed in other sports. Operative treatment may be indicated when nonoperative measures have failed. Traditionally, operative treatment has involved an open approach; more recently, posterior ankle arthroscopy has been employed.

- **Purpose**: This study was conducted to describe the factors that influence return to play in professional athletes after posterior ankle arthroscopy for posterior ankle impingement syndrome.

- **Study design**: Case series; Level of evidence 4.

- **Methods**: A consecutive series of 28 elite professional soccer players who had clinically and radiologically diagnosed posterior ankle impingement syndrome that failed to respond to nonoperative treatment underwent posterior ankle arthroscopy for bony or soft tissue posterior ankle impingement syndrome over 5 years.

- **Results**: Of the 28 players, 27 were available for follow-up. Five had a diagnosis of soft tissue impingement and underwent debridement with flexor hallucis longus release, 13 had a symptomatic os trigonum that was excised arthroscopically, and 9 had removal of a bony avulsion fragment from the posterior ankle ligament complex. The mean length of time to return to training postoperatively was 34 days and return to playing was 41 days (range, 29–72 days). The duration of symptoms before surgery and excision of bony impingement were significantly correlated with the time to return to training and playing. There were no major complications and no reoperations at an average of 23 months.

### Endoscopic treatment of the posterior ankle impingement syndrome on amateur and professional athletes [^116rwXNA]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2016). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether professional and amateur athletes showed differences in ankle function when treated with an endoscopic technique for posterior ankle impingement syndrome. The study also aimed to verify the impact of the presence of associated lesions on clinical evolution and to assess the time to return to sport, with the hypothesis that time would be the only difference between the groups.

- **Methods**: Thirty-two athletes with a diagnosis of posterior impingement syndrome underwent surgery endoscopically. The American Orthopaedics Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scale was used to compare functional results between amateur (15) and professional athletes (17). Satisfaction, time to return to sport, operative time, intraoperative findings, and complications were evaluated. The presence of associated injuries interfering with these results was verified.

- **Results**: The preoperative AOFAS score range for the professional group was 62.9 ± 14 preoperatively and 92.3 ± 7.7 postoperatively, while for the amateur group, it was 67.9 ± 19.7 preoperatively and 94 ± 9.3 postoperatively. Satisfaction was excellent or good in 94% of all cases and fair in 6%. The average time of surgery was 48.3 ± 25 minutes. Bone involvement was present in 100% of cases, and complications occurred in three cases. The time to return to sports was similar (not significant) in both groups, with the mean time being 15.6 ± 13.7 weeks for professionals and 16.3 ± 9 weeks for amateurs.

- **Conclusion**: No significant difference was found regarding functional results and time to return to sports between professional and amateur athletes operated on. Athletes showed mainly good and excellent results and a low complication rate.

### A 2-portal endoscopic approach for diagnosis and treatment of posterior ankle pathology [^113tA81i]. Arthroscopy (2000). Low credibility.

We describe a 2-portal endoscopic approach of the hindfoot with the patient in the prone position. By means of this approach, it is possible to visualize and treat a variety of posterior ankle problems. Not only can the pathology of the posterior ankle joint and subtalar joint be visualized and treated, but also periarticular pathology, such as calcifications or scar tissue, can be diagnosed and treated. We describe a professional ballet dancer with chronic flexor hallucis longus tendinitis and a posterior ankle impingement syndrome caused by an os trigonum of both ankles. The patient was successfully treated by removing the os trigonum and releasing the flexor hallucis longus tendon. She resumed her professional activities within two months after endoscopic treatment.

### Delayed diagnosis of posterior ankle impingement in pediatric and adolescent patients: Does radiology play a role [^111Yotzs]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Posterior ankle impingement syndrome (PAIS) results from the pinching of anatomical structures in the posterior part of the ankle. The objective of this study is to identify the possible role of imaging in the delayed diagnosis of PAIS and to identify key findings on imaging that suggest PAIS in pediatric and adolescent patients.

- **Materials and methods**: Data were collected prospectively in patients younger than 18 years of age who underwent arthroscopy after being diagnosed with PAIS. Imaging was reviewed retrospectively by two radiologists, compared with findings in the literature and an age-matched control group, and correlated with arthroscopic findings. Pre- and postsurgical Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain and American Orthopedic Foot Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot scores were noted.

- **Results**: Thirty-eight patients (20 females, 18 males), 51 ankles, with an average age of 12.9 years had an average 18-month delay in diagnosis. Twenty-seven of the 38 (73%) patients had previously seen multiple medical providers and were given multiple misdiagnoses. Radiographs were reported normal in 34/47 (72%) ankles. Thirty patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Findings included the presence of an os trigonum/Stieda process (94%) with associated osseous edema (69%), flexor hallucis longus (FHL) tenosynovitis (16%), and edema in Kager's fat pad (63%). Although individual findings were noted, the impression in the MRI reports in 16/32 (50%) did not mention PAIS as the likely diagnosis. There was a significant difference in the MRI findings of ankle impingement in the patient population.

### Persistent ankle pain following a sprain: A review of imaging [^112oGDoh]. Emergency Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

The initial diagnosis of an "ankle sprain" is not always correct. Prolonged pain, swelling, and disability sufficient to limit activity and refractory to treatment following an ankle injury are not typical of an ankle sprain and should alert the clinician to the possibility of an alternative or associated diagnosis.

Several conditions can be misdiagnosed as an ankle sprain, including ankle syndesmosis injuries, sinus tarsi syndrome, ankle and hind foot fractures, osteochondral lesions, posterior tibialis and peroneal tendons abnormalities, spring ligament damage, impingement syndromes, and reflex sympathetic dystrophy. In this review, we discuss the imaging features of these conditions that can clinically mimic an ankle sprain. It is crucial to remember that unresolved ankle pain following an injury is not always just due to a "sprain".

### Combined arthroscopic and fluoroscopic guidance in the atraumatic treatment of posterior ankle impingement syndrome [^114ipMKJ]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Posterior ankle impingement syndrome can result from chronic overuse or acute trauma. When coupled with the presence of an anatomic bony anomaly, the patient can present with significant pain with maximal plantarflexion. Treatment involves resection of the site of bony impingement, such as the os trigonum or a fractured Steida's process, along with circumferential fibrosis and inflammation. The presented technique involves a stepwise approach incorporating focused arthroscopic release of the surrounding fibrosis and atraumatic fluoroscopic resection of the bony source of impingement. Thus, a minimal amount of trauma is incurred to the patient, and fragment resection is performed in an efficient manner.

### Posterior ankle decompression with os trigonum or Stieda process resection in dancers: Case series report and review of the literature [^1118TjmT]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

This case series reports the outcome of posterior ankle decompression and os trigonum or Stieda process resection utilizing an open posterolateral approach in 54 professional, pre-professional, and dedicated recreational dancers. All procedures were performed by a single surgeon at the same facility between 2008 and 2018. The surgical technique is described in detail. Data related to the results of the surgery were gathered via follow-up questionnaire and verified by referencing the patients' medical records.

Outcomes were self-assessed in categories ranging from excellent through moderate to poor. Eighty-nine percent of the dancers (N = 48 of 54) chose excellent or good, 11% (N = 6) chose moderate, and none selected poor. These results were compared with those achieved in 17 previous studies reporting the use of both open (posterolateral and posteromedial) and arthroscopic/endoscopic techniques in dancers. This comparison found similarly favorable reported outcomes but also great variation in methodology for determining patient reported outcomes (PROs).

While the preferred surgical technique for posterior ankle decompression remains controversial, the open posterolateral approach utilized in this series resulted in a high expectation of return to dance with minimal complications. The need for a dancer-specific PRO tool is discussed.

### Anterior ankle impingement syndrome is less frequent, but associated with a longer absence and higher re-injury rate compared to posterior syndrome: a prospective cohort study of 6754 male professional soccer players [^112paMmS]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2022). Low credibility.

The present study found that soccer players with ankle impingement were able to return to play (RTP) at a median of 7 days (10 days in anterior ankle impingement syndrome [AAIS] and 6 days in posterior ankle impingement syndrome [PAIS], respectively) following the injury occurrence, with only 16% of the injuries requiring longer than 28 days to recover. Importantly, our data included both injuries with nonsurgical and surgical treatment, whereas a few other studies have reported RTP details on surgically treated PAIS in soccer players exclusively. For example, Lopez-Valerio et al. reported on 20 professional soccer players in Brazil who were treated arthroscopically for PAIS, noting a mean RTP to the previous level of activity at an average of 46.9 days. Similarly, Calder et al. reported an average of 34 days to return to training and 41 days to RTP in elite soccer players following arthroscopic surgery of PAIS. They also reported a sooner return in players with soft tissue rather than bony impingements. Finally, Kudaş et al. reported an average RTP at 36 days of nonsurgical treatment in elite Turkish soccer players with PAIS. Murawski and Kennedy reported RTP at a mean of 7 weeks (5–13 weeks) post-arthroscopic debridement of AAIS in a mixed population. The days of absence in the study are fewer than reported in the literature and are to be interpreted with caution due to the lack of treatment data and detailed pathology (e.g. soft tissue vs. bony impingement).

In the present study, AAIS led to significantly greater days of absence than PAIS. While such a comparison was not the main objective of this study, it could pot

### Peroneus tertius syndrome: A rare cause of anterolateral ankle and rearfoot pain [^117TUGNC]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

There is limited literature describing anterolateral ankle or rearfoot pain associated with the peroneus tertius tendon. The purpose of this study is to define peroneus tertius syndrome, in which the peroneus tertius tendon causes catching or locking over the anterolateral ankle or rearfoot with accompanying pain. We present a retrospective case series involving four patients diagnosed with peroneus tertius syndrome, discuss symptoms for clinical diagnosis, review radiographic imaging, and outline a minimally invasive operative technique for resection of the symptomatic tendon. Furthermore, we sought to evaluate postoperative outcomes and satisfaction scores after surgical management.

All patients experienced resolution of symptoms by the fourth postoperative week. There was a statistically significant improvement in visual analog scale scores (average ± SD, 7.75 ± 0.96 preoperative to 0.75 ± 1.19 postoperative; p = .002). Overall patient satisfaction was 100%, with improved functional status and no evidence of symptoms at the final follow-up (average 18.88 ± 8.68 months). Our results demonstrate that excision of a symptomatic peroneus tertius provides resolution of symptoms, facilitates a quick return to activity, and has excellent patient outcomes. We suggest that during the evaluation of anterolateral ankle or rearfoot pain, peroneus tertius syndrome be considered as part of the differential diagnosis.

### MR imaging as a problem solving tool in posterior ankle pain: A review [^112N3JFu]. European Journal of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Posterior ankle pain is a significant cause of chronic pain and disability, affecting a diverse range of individuals. Proper identification of the cause is essential for timely and adequate treatment. However, identifying the cause and excluding mimickers is often challenging for physicians due to the complex nature of the joint. Additionally, pathologies that can cause posterior ankle pain may occur independently or coexist with one another.

Clinical conditions that may present as posterior ankle pain include:

- **Posterior ankle impingement**: This occurs when the soft tissue or bone is compressed at the back of the ankle.
- **Achilles tendon pathology**
- **Medial flexor tendon pathology**
- **Peroneal pathology**
- **Retrocalcaneal bursitis**: Inflammation of the bursa located between the heel bone and the Achilles tendon.
- **Posterior subtalar tarsal coalition**: A congenital condition impacting foot motion.
- **Sinus tarsi syndrome**: Pain at the outer part of the ankle and foot.
- **Tarsal tunnel syndrome**: Compression of the nerve that passes through the ankle.

This review introduces the concepts of pathophysiology involved in the main conditions associated with posterior ankle pain. It also examines the role of MR imaging in diagnosing and managing each condition. Early and specific detection of pathology can facilitate appropriate and time-sensitive treatment, thereby improving clinical outcomes.

### Chronic lateral ankle instability increases the likelihood for surgery in athletes with os trigonum syndrome [^1155FKrT]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2019). Low credibility.

Biomechanical testing has demonstrated that a severe ankle sprain creates a pathological anterior translation of the ankle (Fig. 1) but not a posterior translation. The implication of this is that the hyper plantar-flexion position of the ankle could create a greater mechanical posterior ankle conflict in the presence of a combined lateral ankle instability. These two important findings could explain why chronic lateral ligament instability is a key variable in the development of os trigonum syndrome. It might also clarify why bony anterior impingement is frequently observed in combination with a restricted ankle range of motion, whereas this is rarely the case in bony posterior impingement.

- **Anterior translation illustration**: Anterior translation of the ankle (white arrow) in an athlete with os trigonum syndrome and combined chronic lateral ligament instability of the ankle

An MRI study in athletes with os trigonum syndrome (sagittal T1-weighted and fat-suppressed T2-weighted images) observed abnormal signal intensity in the lateral talar tubercle and/or os trigonum, consistent with bone marrow edema. Considering the mechanisms of injury, this abnormal signal intensity could be the result of bone impaction, representing micro-trabecular fractures, edema, and/or hemorrhage of the bone marrow without disruption of the cortex. Most ankle sprains occur in plantar flexion and inversion. When considering the repetitive dynamic movements involved in agility sports, this ankle position in athletes with a deficient lateral ligament might explain why the os trigonum undergoes increased mechanical stress.

Regarding preventative measures for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome, specifically in terms of primary prevention, the WA-FAI 2016 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to determine which individuals with cam or pincer morphologies will develop FAIS syndrome. It is recognized that preventive measures may have a role in high-risk populations; however, offering surgery to these individuals is rarely indicated.

### Anatomy of the ankle ligaments: a pictorial essay [^113tNe8v]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2010). Low credibility.

The posterior talofibular ligament originates from the malleolar fossa, located on the medial surface of the lateral malleolus, and courses almost horizontally to insert in the posterolateral talus. In plantar flexion and in the neutral ankle position, the ligament is relaxed, while in dorsiflexion, the ligament is tensed. Due to the multifascicular aspect of this ligament, it inserts in multiple areas. Fibers insert in the posterior surface of the talus, in the lateral talar process or os trigonum, if present. Some fibers can contribute to forming the tunnel for the flexor hallucis longus tendon (see Fig. 8).

Moreover, a group of fibers fuses with the posterior intermalleolar ligament. The posterior intermalleolar ligament has been the subject of recent studies because of its involvement in the posterior soft tissue impingement syndrome of the ankle. Its prevalence of occurrence is noted both in radiological and anatomical studies.

### Impingement syndromes of the ankle and hindfoot [^113JHiDn]. Pediatric Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

Ankle impingement refers to a chronic, painful mechanical limitation of ankle motion caused by soft-tissue or osseous abnormality affecting the tibiotalar joint or extraarticular soft tissues. It can be associated with a prior single traumatic event or repetitive microtrauma, often in adolescents with an anatomical predisposition. Impingement syndromes at the tibiotalar joint can be subdivided into the following: anterior, anterolateral, anteromedial, posterior, or posteromedial. Extraarticular impingement can consist of talocalcaneal or subfibular impingement. Impingement syndromes are just one possible etiology of persistent ankle pain and, although the diagnosis is often made or suspected clinically, the radiologist might be the first person to raise the possibility of the diagnosis or be called upon to provide support for the clinically suspected diagnosis. In this article, I review the etiology, imaging findings, and treatment associated with these conditions.

### MRI features of posterior ankle impingement syndrome in ballet dancers: a review of 25 cases [^115afBya]. Clinical Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to describe the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of posterior ankle impingement syndrome (PAIS) in classical ballet dancers. A retrospective review was conducted on 25 MRI examinations of the ankle performed on 23 ballet dancers over a 26-month period. The images were examined for osseous and soft-tissue anatomical variants at the posterior ankle and imaging signs of PAIS. All patients presented with symptoms and signs suggestive of PAIS, including posterior ankle pain, swelling, and stiffness during plantar flexion.

Anatomical variants predisposing individuals to PAIS, such as os trigonum and a tuberosity arising from the superior calcaneum, were clearly depicted. The most common imaging feature of PAIS in this series was a high T2 signal posterior to the talocalcaneal joint, indicating synovitis (n = 25). Other common findings included thickening of the posterior capsule (n = 13) and tenosynovitis of the flexor hallucis longus (n = 17). An os trigonum was infrequently observed (n = 7). Bone marrow edema, which was often seen in the posterior talus (n = 10) or in a patchy distribution (n = 10), was also noted.

In conclusion, MRI is a useful diagnostic tool in PAIS, demonstrating the anatomical variants and the range of osseous and soft-tissue abnormalities associated with this condition. Prospective studies are needed to understand the significance and importance of individual MRI findings in relation to the symptoms of PAIS.

### Posterior ankle impingement caused by hyaline-like cartilage generation in ballet dancers — a report of 2 cases [^111GTF51]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Posterior ankle impingement syndrome is predominantly observed in ballet dancers and is frequently associated with specific ballet movements, such as pointe and demi-pointe, where the entire body weight is supported by the maximally plantar-flexed ankle. We conducted arthroscopic debridement for two dedicated ballet dancers suffering from intervening soft tissue causing posterior ankle impingement syndrome (PAIS). In both cases, T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed low-signal intensity of meniscus-like soft tissue without abnormal osseous findings, extending from the posterior side of the talus to Kager's fat pad.

To examine the intervening soft tissue in detail, we performed a histological evaluation using hematoxylin and eosin staining, Safranin O fast green staining, and immunohistochemistry for type I and type II collagen. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed cartilage-like tissue with chondrocyte-like cells in contact with fibrous tissue. The extracellular matrix in the cartilage zone was consistently stained by Safranin O and type II collagen staining, with no staining for type I collagen. These findings suggested that the meniscus-like soft tissue, appearing as low-signal intensity on MRI at the posterior side of the talus, included hyaline-like cartilage. To our knowledge, these were rare cases of hyaline-like cartilage generation causing PAIS in ballet dancers, potentially associated with specific ballet movements resulting in chondrogenesis.

### ACR appropriateness criteria chronic ankle pain [^116BtoQ4]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). High credibility.

Chronic ankle pain is a common clinical problem whose cause is often elucidated by imaging. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria for chronic ankle pain define best practices for image ordering. Clinical scenarios are followed by the imaging choices and their appropriateness. The information is presented in ordered tables with an accompanying narrative explanation to guide physicians in ordering the right test. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions, reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel.

The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies, such as the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In situations where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Chronic lateral ankle instability increases the likelihood for surgery in athletes with os trigonum syndrome [^117399av]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2019). Low credibility.

The etiology and incidence of os trigonum syndrome in professional athletes is highly variable. There is a paucity of data to ascertain why some athletes evolve towards surgery whilst others remain asymptomatic. We hypothesized that a lateral ligament ankle injury would increase the likelihood for surgery in those athletes with os trigonum syndrome.

- **Methods**: Eighty professional athletes with clinical and radiological signs of os trigonum syndrome were identified to ascertain the incidence of injury to the lateral ligamentous ankle complex (acute and chronic) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This cohort was subdivided into two groups; a surgical (n = 40) and a non-surgical (n = 40) cohort. Surgical division was decided if (1) the clinical hyper-plantar flexion test was positive, (2) a positive diagnostic ultrasound-guided injection, and (3) no improvement was observed after 6 weeks of conservative rehabilitation.

- **Results**: From the surgical cohort, 37 players (94.1%) had a chronic lateral ankle ligament injury on MRI, whilst 3 players (5.9%) had an acute lateral ankle ligament injury. Binary logistic linear modeling revealed that having a chronic lateral ligament injury increases the likelihood of os trigonum syndrome surgery by ten times compared to those with an acute lateral ligament injury.

- **Conclusion**: Professional athletes with chronic lateral ligament ankle injury have an approximate ten times greater risk for os trigonum syndrome surgery compared to athletes with acute lateral ligament ankle injury.

Level of evidence: IV.

### Posterior hindfoot arthroscopy: A review [^117NmCzf]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In recent years, minimally invasive surgery has developed and progressed the standard of care in orthopaedics and sports medicine. In particular, the use of posterior hindfoot arthroscopy in the treatment of posterior ankle and hindfoot injury is increasing rapidly as a means of reducing pain, infection rates, and blood loss postoperatively compared with traditional open procedures. In athletes, hindfoot arthroscopy has been used effectively in expediting rehabilitation and ultimately in minimizing the time lost from competition at previous levels. Van Dijk et al. were the first to describe the original two-portal technique, which remains the most commonly used by surgeons today and forms the basis for this review.

The evidence in the literature supports the use of two-portal hindfoot arthroscopy as a safe, primary treatment strategy for symptoms of posterior ankle impingement, including resection of os trigonum; treatment of flexor hallucis longus and peroneal tendon injury; treatment of osteochondral lesions of the ankle; and the resection of subtalar coalitions. In this review, we present, where possible, an evidence-based literature review on the arthroscopic treatment of posterior ankle and hindfoot abnormalities. Causes, diagnosis, surgical technique, outcomes, and complications are each discussed in turn.

### The Warwick agreement on femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAI syndrome): an international consensus statement [^112wTmr4]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on femoroacetabular impingement syndrome:

- **Definition**: FAIS is a motion-related clinical disorder of the hip characterized by a triad of symptoms, clinical signs, and imaging findings. It represents symptomatic premature contact between the proximal femur and the acetabulum.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of FAIS involves abnormal contact between the femoral head and the acetabulum due to bony abnormalities. This contact can lead to shearing forces at the acetabular labrum and cartilage during physiological hip motion, potentially causing cartilage wear and eventual osteoarthritis.

- **Epidemiology**: The epidemiology of FAIS remains largely unknown. Imaging findings suggestive of the syndrome are prevalent in asymptomatic individuals, with a higher prevalence observed in athletes.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include genetic predisposition, participation in certain sports, and developmental hip disorders, such as hip dysplasia or Perthes disease.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with FAIS often present with motion- or position-related pain in the hip or groin. Pain may also occur in the back, buttock, or thigh. Additionally, they may describe clicking, catching, locking, stiffness, limited range of motion (typically restricted internal rotation in flexion), or giving way. Patients with FAIS may also demonstrate altered gait mechanics and hip joint loading.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of FAIS can vary widely and is influenced by factors such as the type of FAIS (cam, pincer, or mixed) and the extent.

### Anterior ankle impingement syndrome is less frequent, but associated with a longer absence and higher re-injury rate compared to posterior syndrome: A prospective cohort study of 6754 male professional soccer players [^114n23ar]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2022). Low credibility.

- **Injury incidence and injury burden**: The overall incidence of ankle impingement was 0.03 injuries (95% CI 0.02–0.03) per 1000 hours. The incidence during match play was fivefold higher than during training [0.08 (95% CI 0.06–0.10) injuries per 1000 match hours vs. 0.02 injuries (95% CI 0.01–0.02) per 1000 training hours, RR 4.7 (95% CI 3.1–7.1)].

The incidence of posterior ankle impingement syndrome (PAIS) was almost twofold higher than anterior ankle impingement syndrome (AAIS) [0.02 (95% CI 0.001–0.02) injuries per 1000 hours vs. 0.01 (95% CI 0.01–0.01) injuries per 1000 hours, RR 1.7 (95% CI 1.1–2.5)]. This difference was mainly seen during match play [0.05 (95% CI 0.04–0.08) vs. 0.02 (95% CI 0.01–0.04) injuries per 1000 match hours, RR 2.5 (95% CI 1.3–4.9)]. No difference was seen during training [0.01 (95% CI 0.01–0.01) vs. 0.01 (95% CI 0.00–0.01) injuries per 1000 training hours, RR 1.2 (95% CI 0.7–2.1)].

A total of 1517 days of absence were reported due to ankle impingement (1046 days due to training injuries and 471 days due to match injuries). This represents an overall injury burden of 0.4 days per 1000 hours, with 0.2 days per 1000 hours calculated for both AAIS and PAIS.

### Posterior ankle impingement in two athletic twin brothers, could genetics play a role [^1156Dtkr]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Pain posteriorly in the ankle can be caused by bony impingement of the posterolateral process of the talus. This process impinges between the tibia and calcaneus during deep forced plantar flexion. If this occurs, it is called posterior ankle impingement syndrome. We report the case of two athletic monozygotic twin brothers with bony impingement posteriorly in the left ankle. Treatment consisted of ankle arthroscopy in both patients, during which the symptomatic process was easily removed. At three months after surgery, both patients were completely free of pain, and one of the brothers had already returned to sports. The posterior ankle impingement syndrome is not a rare syndrome, but it has not been described in siblings thus far. That these two patients are monozygotic twin brothers suggests that genetics could play a role in the development of skeletal deformities that can result in posterior ankle impingement syndrome.

### Advances in diagnosis and management of lateral ankle instability: A review of current literature [^112UnnQ2]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Many different physical examination modalities exist for the ankle, but when examining reported sensitivity and specificity data, the importance of palpation of the ligaments is emphasized, with sensitivities ranging from 78% to 92% in some studies. With minimal superficial overlying tissue, palpation of the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) and calcaneofibular ligament (CFL) provides a great starting point for the examination of the lateral ankle.

For the ATFL in particular, some common tests include the standard anterior drawer test and the anterolateral drawer, with literature suggesting superior sensitivity and specificity with the anterolateral drawer in comparison with the anterior drawer. In the anterior drawer test, the examiner stabilizes the talofibular joint while using the other hand to hold the heel and translate it anteriorly. If this same motion is replicated with the ankle in maximal dorsiflexion, it is called an anterolateral drawer.

More recent literature also suggests the use of a reverse anterolateral drawer with greater sensitivity, especially for more chronic tears. In the reverse anterolateral drawer, the hindfoot is stabilized while a posterior force is applied onto the tibia. The anterior drawer can also help identify pathology of the CFL in conjunction with the ATFL, particularly when done with dorsiflexion, but it is not very sensitive for isolated CFL injuries.

Similarly, talar tilt can also be used to test for the CFL, particularly when done in 10° of dorsiflexion to help isolate the CFL, but small differences that may be present are hard to identify.

### Diagnosing heel pain in adults [^114Fvvc7]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Heel pain is a common condition in adults that may cause significant discomfort and disability. A variety of soft tissue, osseous, and systemic disorders can cause heel pain. Narrowing the differential diagnosis begins with a history and physical examination of the lower extremity to pinpoint the anatomic origin of the heel pain.

The most common cause of heel pain in adults is plantar fasciitis. Patients with plantar fasciitis report increased heel pain with their first steps in the morning or when they stand up after prolonged sitting. Tenderness at the calcaneal tuberosity usually is apparent on examination and is increased with passive dorsiflexion of the toes.

Tendonitis also may cause heel pain. Achilles tendonitis is associated with posterior heel pain, and bursae adjacent to the Achilles tendon insertion may become inflamed and cause pain.

Calcaneal stress fractures are more likely to occur in athletes who participate in sports that require running and jumping. Patients with plantar heel pain accompanied by tingling, burning, or numbness may have tarsal tunnel syndrome.

Heel pad atrophy may present with diffuse plantar heel pain, especially in patients who are older and obese. Less common causes of heel pain, which should be considered when symptoms are prolonged or unexplained, include osteomyelitis, bony abnormalities such as calcaneal stress fracture, or tumor.

Heel pain rarely is a presenting symptom in patients with systemic illnesses, but the latter may be a factor in persons with bilateral heel pain, pain in other joints, or known inflammatory arthritis conditions.

### Ankle arthritis - an important signpost in rheumatologic practice [^114LAcNQ]. Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Despite recent major advances in the management of rheumatic diseases, clinical diagnosis can remain challenging. Pattern recognition is an essential part of this process, encompassing all aspects of the patient's history, examination, and investigation results. Assessing the individual joints affected is particularly important in formulating a differential diagnosis. For example, there is characteristic involvement of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) and first carpo-metacarpal joints in osteoarthritis (OA), whereas these joints are generally spared in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

This review article focuses on the ankle joint across the spectrum of rheumatic conditions, where it is differentially affected in certain arthritides and spared in others. In this regard, the ankle is an interesting and perhaps neglected signpost in the process of differential diagnosis. Special attention is also drawn to peri-articular mimics of ankle arthritis, as the hind foot is a complex region requiring careful clinical examination to assess the cause of pain and swelling.

### Clinical evaluation and treatment of posterior impingement in dancers [^111cVP4U]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2009). Low credibility.

Os trigonum impingement is a frequent cause of posterior ankle pain in ballet dancers due to the need for extreme plantar flexion during the execution of relevé in demipointe and en pointe positions. Clinical examination, along with standard and modified X-rays, should be conducted to clearly identify the site and extent of the impingement. If a posterior impingement is clinically diagnosed, standard and modified magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should also be performed.

From September 2005 to September 2006, 186 young trainee ballet dancers were evaluated, with twelve suffering from posterior ankle pain. Of these, six were identified with os trigona. All affected ballet dancers received nonoperative treatment, resulting in good outcomes for nine of them. Conservative treatment failed in only three cases after 1–4 months of physical and medical therapies. In these instances, favorable results were achieved through surgical excision of the accessory ossicle.

- **Modified imaging techniques**: Modified X-ray and MRI help determine the site and extent of the posterior impingement. If properly diagnosed, the majority of cases can achieve good results through a nonoperative approach.

### Arthroscopic excision of the talar Stieda's process [^112fKdmM]. Arthroscopy (2006). Low credibility.

Posterior impingement syndrome is one of the causes of posterior ankle pain. When the talar lateral process is long, it is referred to as Stieda's process, which can become impinged between the tibia and calcaneus. We report the case of a 19-year-old patient suffering from posterior ankle pain, diagnosed with posterior impingement of Stieda's process. The patient did not respond to conservative treatment and thus underwent arthroscopic excision.

The ankle was accessed through standard posterior lateral and trans-Achilles portals. A 4.5-mm diameter 30 degrees arthroscope was utilized. The soft tissues surrounding the talus were cleared using a motorized shaver, allowing visualization of the posterior aspect of the subtalar joint. Stieda's process was observed impinging between the tibia and the calcaneus during forced plantar flexion. The talar process was excised with a burr until the impingement was resolved. The patient resumed contact sports 8 weeks post-surgery.

Arthroscopic excision of the lateral process of the talus can be performed easily, allowing for a relatively quick return to sports.

### The posterior impingement view: an alternative conventional projection to detect bony posterior ankle impingement [^115zbqUF]. Arthroscopy (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of the study was to clinically evaluate the diagnostic value of the new posterior impingement (PIM) view in the detection of an os trigonum, compared with the standard lateral view, using computed tomography (CT) as a reference standard.

- **Methods**: Three observers, two experienced (orthopaedic surgeon and radiologist) and one inexperienced (resident), independently scored 142 radiographic images for the presence of an os trigonum. The diagnostic performance was assessed using the computed tomographic scan as the reference standard. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated.

- **Results**: The PIM view had significantly superior accuracy compared with the lateral view for each observer: orthopaedic surgeon, PIM view = 90 versus lateral view = 75 (P = 0.013); radiologist, PIM view = 80 versus lateral view = 64 (P = 0.019); resident, PIM view = 90 versus lateral view = 79 (P = 0.039). The mean sensitivity and specificity of the lateral view for all observers was 50% and 81%, respectively. For the PIM view, this was 78% and 89%, respectively. The PPV was 50% for the lateral view and 70% for the PIM view. The NPV was 84% for the lateral view and 93% for the PIM view.

- **Conclusions**: The PIM view has significantly superior diagnostic accuracy compared with the conventional lateral view in the detection of an os trigonum. In cases of symptomatic posterior ankle impingement, we advise that a PIM view be used instead of or in addition to the standard lateral view for detection of posterior ankle impingement.
