## Question

How to lower blood sugar levels in the morning and night time

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to lower morning and nighttime blood sugar levels, with explicit step-by-step logic and self-verification language preserved and enhanced. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of morning hyperglycemia and nocturnal hypoglycemia. Then, I should verify circadian and hormonal contributors. Next, I will examine lifestyle strategies, followed by pharmacologic approaches. After that, I need to review monitoring and titration protocols. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, individualized plan and highlight special populations and safety considerations, ensuring each step is supported by appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities we are targeting: morning hyperglycemia includes the dawn phenomenon, which is a pre-breakfast rise driven by circadian increases in hepatic glucose production and insulin resistance, and the Somogyi effect, which is rebound hyperglycemia after nocturnal hypoglycemia; I should also remember that late, large dinners can artifactually elevate fasting glucose and confound basal insulin titration, so I need to keep that in mind before escalating therapy [^111D73xL] [^115wXxAF] [^115Tym4f].

> Wait, let me verify the circadian physiology because it drives both morning and nighttime patterns; insulin secretion and sensitivity follow a diurnal rhythm with higher sensitivity in the morning and reduced sensitivity in the biological evening, while growth hormone and cortisol surges in the early morning increase hepatic glucose output and antagonize insulin, contributing to the dawn phenomenon; this means timing of meals, exercise, and medications can leverage or be undermined by these rhythms [^115CVoqQ] [^114hFkMT] [^113FAa9i].

> I will now examine lifestyle strategies for morning hyperglycemia, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I initially thought a high-carb breakfast might help by triggering insulin, but wait, higher glycemic load breakfasts are linked to lower subsequent alertness and may worsen postprandial spikes, so I should correct that and recommend a lower-glycemic breakfast with adequate protein and fiber to blunt excursions and align with circadian physiology; also, moving more during the day and avoiding late dinners can meaningfully reduce fasting glucose and the dawn phenomenon, and I should confirm that frequent light activity breaks during prolonged sitting improve fasting glucose and dampen dawn magnitude, which they do [^113NqSSm] [^114hFkMT] [^114Gb1pX].

> Next, I should review lifestyle strategies for nighttime hypoglycemia; let me consider exercise timing first, because evening exercise increases delayed hypoglycemia risk up to 24 hours via increased insulin sensitivity and altered counterregulation; the evidence supports a 20% basal insulin reduction on exercise days, pairing with low-glycemic post-exercise and bedtime snacks, and ensuring consistent sleep duration, as sleep restriction impairs insulin sensitivity and increases hypoglycemia risk; I should double-check that structured education on hypoglycemia recognition and treatment remains foundational, and yes, guidelines emphasize education and SMBG/CGM to mitigate nocturnal hypoglycemia [^111BZFVM] [^1175Rjag] [^113NKdXY] [^113BaFCd].

> Let me think about pharmacologic strategies for morning hyperglycemia; basal insulin is the cornerstone, and I should confirm that evening dosing of long-acting analogs like glargine or degludec aligns with circadian insulin needs and suppresses hepatic glucose production overnight, with treat-to-target titration to fasting glucose improving A1c; if dawn phenomenon persists, splitting basal or using CSII with programmable basal profiles can deliver more insulin in the early morning hours, and I need to ensure I titrate cautiously to avoid nocturnal hypoglycemia [^114X65qs] [^115cobjQ] [^115JWsTZ].

> Hold on, I should verify oral and injectable non-insulin options; metformin reduces hepatic glucose production and can attenuate dawn phenomenon, SGLT2 inhibitors lower fasting glucose via urinary glucose loss, and GLP-1 receptor agonists improve postprandial control; I need to check timing nuances, as oral semaglutide requires a 30-minute pre-meal fast for absorption, and incretin-based therapies primarily target postprandial rather than fasting glycemia, so they are adjuncts rather than replacements for basal strategies in dawn phenomenon [^113X2Lfu] [^113eirwb] [^114X65qs].

> For nighttime hypoglycemia, I should confirm that switching from NPH to long-acting basal analogs reduces nocturnal hypoglycemia, and that sensor-augmented pumps with predictive low-glucose suspend meaningfully reduce overnight lows; I need to ensure I also consider individualized bedtime snacks when indicated, recognizing that while conventional snacks or uncooked cornstarch have mixed efficacy, low-glycemic, fiber-rich options may help some patients, and that adjuncts like bedtime terbutaline can prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia but often raise fasting glucose, requiring careful dose selection and monitoring [^114TPXyY] [^112wY9rw] [^1147AqPF] [^114XPzPR].

> Next, I should review monitoring and titration; CGM is invaluable for identifying dawn phenomenon, detecting nocturnal hypoglycemia, and guiding basal adjustments, and I should confirm that professional interpretation of AGP reports helps distinguish dawn from Somogyi and optimize therapy; for basal insulin, treat-to-target algorithms titrating every few days to fasting glucose are effective, and I need to watch for overbasalization signaled by a bedtime-to-morning glucose differential ≥ 50 mg/dL, which should prompt reassessment of meal timing, prandial coverage, and basal distribution rather than simply increasing basal further [^116dXDZf] [^111uX4DA] [^114TPXyY].

> Let me synthesize a practical, individualized plan; first, characterize the phenotype with CGM or structured SMBG to separate dawn phenomenon, Somogyi effect, and late-dinner effects; second, implement lifestyle measures including earlier dinners, lower-glycemic breakfasts, daytime activity, and sleep hygiene; third, optimize pharmacotherapy by aligning basal insulin timing and dose with circadian needs, adding metformin or SGLT2 inhibition as appropriate, and using GLP-1 RA for postprandial control; fourth, mitigate nocturnal hypoglycemia with basal analogs, CGM-enabled alerts or suspend features, exercise-day basal reductions, and selective bedtime strategies; finally, iterate every 1–2 weeks using fasting and overnight data to titrate safely and avoid both hyper- and hypoglycemia [^11295JA4] [^114TPXyY] [^111uX4DA].

> But wait, what about special populations; in type 1 diabetes, dawn phenomenon is common and CSII with dynamic basal profiles is often the most precise approach, while evening exercise mandates a 20% basal reduction and low-GI feeding to prevent delayed hypoglycemia; in type 2 diabetes, early addition of basal insulin can blunt dawn and extend glycemic durability; in older adults, I should prioritize hypoglycemia avoidance with longer-acting basal analogs and less aggressive targets; for shift workers, I need to anchor meal and insulin timing to wake periods rather than clock time and use CGM to navigate circadian misalignment [^115JWsTZ] [^1175Rjag] [^114X65qs] [^115LqJYu].

> I should double-check safety considerations; alcohol in the evening can cause delayed morning hypoglycemia via impaired counterregulation, so counseling and glucose monitoring are essential; recurrent nocturnal hypoglycemia can precipitate hypoglycemia unawareness, so I must avoid overbasalization and consider technology-enabled prevention; and I need to ensure patients have rescue carbohydrates and a written sick-day plan, with education reinforced regularly to sustain safe, effective self-management [^113PSmxW] [^113BaFCd] [^1145SjR5].

> In summary, lowering morning and nighttime glucose requires aligning interventions with circadian physiology, leveraging CGM to individualize therapy, and balancing basal strategies to suppress dawn hepatic output while preventing nocturnal hypoglycemia; I should confirm that modest, consistent adjustments across meals, activity, sleep, and medications outperform large, sporadic changes, and that iterative review of overnight profiles guides durable improvements in A1c and quality of life [^115CVoqQ] [^114TPXyY] [^111uX4DA].

To lower morning and night blood sugar, **target the dawn phenomenon** with evening basal insulin [^114X65qs] or a bedtime snack [^115wXxAF] to reduce overnight hepatic glucose output [^114X65qs]. For night lows, **reduce evening basal insulin** [^1143ckMH] or use CGM with low-glucose suspend [^112wY9rw] to prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia. Key steps: avoid late, high-GI meals [^114hFkMT]; take metformin at bedtime [^notfound]; exercise earlier in the day [^11438mCn]; and monitor bedtime, 2–3 AM, and morning glucose to guide adjustments [^11295JA4].

## Morning hyperglycemia (dawn phenomenon)

The dawn phenomenon is a **pre-breakfast rise in glucose** driven by overnight hepatic glucose production and insulin resistance [^111D73xL]; management focuses on suppressing hepatic output and aligning insulin timing with circadian rhythms [^114X65qs].

---

### Pharmacological strategies

- **Evening basal insulin**: Long-acting analogs (glargine, degludec) at bedtime [^112GxQkP] suppress dawn hepatic glucose output and lower fasting glucose [^114X65qs] [^111iKmji].

- **Metformin at bedtime**: Metformin reduces hepatic glucose production and can blunt the dawn rise when taken in the evening [^113X2Lfu].

- **GLP-1 receptor agonists**: Weekly semaglutide or dulaglutide can improve fasting control and reduce dawn excursions [^notfound].

---

### Lifestyle modifications

- **Avoid late, high-GI meals**: Late, high-GI dinners worsen morning hyperglycemia; aim for earlier, lower-GI meals [^115Tym4f] [^117RHKgc].

- **Consistent sleep schedule**: Regular sleep and ≥ 7 hours/night improve insulin sensitivity and reduce dawn effects [^113NKdXY] [^116yrbyX].

- **Morning exercise**: Light-to-moderate morning activity improves insulin sensitivity and lowers fasting glucose [^notfound].

---

## Nocturnal hypoglycemia

Nocturnal hypoglycemia is common in insulin-treated patients [^112wdVg8] and is linked to **increased morbidity and mortality** [^112wdVg8]; prevention centers on reducing overnight insulin exposure and using alarms [^111Kdbxp].

---

### Pharmacological strategies

- **Basal insulin adjustment**: Reduce evening basal dose by ~20% [^1143ckMH] or use longer-acting analogs (degludec, U-300 glargine) to lower nocturnal hypoglycemia risk [^114TPXyY].

- **CGM with low-glucose suspend**: Sensor-augmented pumps with predictive low-glucose suspend reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia without increasing ketosis [^112wY9rw] [^113AXhGa].

- **Bedtime snack**: A low-GI snack (e.g. oat bar, yogurt) can prevent lows, especially after evening exercise or alcohol [^116rQovE] [^1145SjR5].

---

### Lifestyle modifications

Avoid **evening alcohol**, which increases nocturnal hypoglycemia risk [^1145SjR5]; eat regular meals with consistent carbs; and use structured glucose monitoring (bedtime, 2–3 AM, fasting) to detect and guide adjustments [^11295JA4] [^116dXDZf].

---

## Monitoring and individualized adjustments

Continuous glucose monitoring (**CGM**) [^111bfiUJ] or frequent **self-monitoring** (bedtime, 2–3 AM, fasting) [^11295JA4] enables timely detection of dawn phenomenon and nocturnal hypoglycemia, supporting tailored therapy changes. Therapy should be **individualized** based on CGM/SMBG patterns, comorbidities, and patient preferences to balance efficacy and hypoglycemia risk [^112DUTcc].

### How people wake up is associated with previous night's sleep together with physical activity and food intake [^113NqSSm]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The macronutrient composition of a meal can significantly dictate the subsequent change in blood glucose. However, different individuals respond with markedly different blood glucose responses to the same macronutrient meal due to a broad collection of reasons. This suggests that, independent of the nutritional content of the food an individual eats, there is a need to additionally measure, and account for, the inter-individual difference in blood glucose response to that meal.

Guided by this dissociation, the final analyses assessed associations between alertness and the body's glycemic food response Here, on days when an individual experienced a higher blood glucose response to that same standardised breakfast meal, the lower their levels of alertness that following morning, and vice versa. Importantly, this effect was not explained by breakfast macronutrient composition. Therefore, our findings establish that it is both the macronutrient profile of food and the way in which the body processes that food — here on the basis of glycemic blood glucose levels. We show that both independently predict that relationship with morning alertness.

That a higher level of blood glucose is associated with a lower level of alertness would, after first glance, contravene the popular cultural belief of a "sugar rush" that boosts vigilance. However, contrary to this common fiction, and consistent with the current findings, experimental evidence has established that high glucose consumption results in a "sugar crash" and thus reduced alertness. Specifically, attentive levels of consciousness and associated cognition decrease soon after the ingestion of high-glycemic foods, such as potatoes and sugar-sweetened beverages. Adding further support to the notion of a sugar crash demonstrated in the current study, a recent meta-analysis reported that high subsequent glycemic responses to morning breakfast meals are associated with impaired, rather than enhanced, cognitive performance.

How and why alertness levels drop significantly following a high-glycemic meal has been linked to glucose-sensing neurons in the brain and may accurately account for our related findings. Indeed, when glucose-sensing neurons are activated by high(er) levels of blood sugar, these sugar-sensing brain cells inhibit the otherwise wake-promoting orexin system within the lateral hypothalamus, the blockade of which results in decreased alertness.

### Systematic literature review: should a bedtime snack be used to treat hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes? [^115wXxAF]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes poses a significant and growing health risk. It is estimated that in 2019, ∼9.3% of the population or 463 million adults had diabetes worldwide with ∼90% of these cases being type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is a well-documented risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, reducing life expectancy by 5–15 y. Without appropriate management, this can lead to uncontrolled blood glucose concentrations and an increased risk of complications such as blindness, amputation, and CVD. HbA1c is an important indicator of glycemic control over the preceding 2–3 mo, comprising contributions from both postprandial and fasting glucose concentrations. Findings from several cohort studies have demonstrated a 2-fold greater risk of CVD with high HbA1c or fasting glucose concentrations. Accordingly, targeting HbA1c < 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) and fasting glucose < 7.2 mmol/L remain the cornerstone of diabetes treatment in order to reduce the risk of the above-mentioned diabetes complications.

Fasting hyperglycemia is the term that describes elevated glucose concentrations upon waking after a nocturnal fast. In the morning, a cascade of gluconeogenic hormones are released as the body wakes, often causing a hyperglycemic event which if not regulated is known as the dawn phenomenon. Alternatively, another concept known as the Somogyi effect can occur, which describes the onset of hyperglycemia first induced by a hypoglycemic event that triggers high levels of gluconeogenesis to compensate for the dip in blood glucose. A potential strategy to reduce morning hyperglycemia is to consume a bedtime snack. Theoretically, ingestion of a snack before bedtime could mitigate fasting hyperglycemia by decreasing the nocturnal fasting window, reducing the gluconeogenic demands on the liver. Additionally, reducing the fasting window may elicit the second meal effect, which refers to the lasting impact a prior meal has on blood glucose concentrations following a subsequent meal. Furthermore, if ingestion of a bedtime snack results in fasting normoglycemia, overall glucose control and hence HbA1c could be improved.

### "Mild dysglycemia" in type 2 diabetes: to be neglected or not? [^112yqSq1]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2015). Low credibility.

"Mild dysglycemia" in type 2 diabetes can be defined by the range of HbA1c levels ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) and < 7% (53 mmol/mol), which corresponds to when the risk for vascular complications begins to increase. This "mild dysglycemia" is characterized by both a dawn phenomenon (a spontaneous blood glucose rise in the early morning) and an excess of post-prandial glucose excursions in the absence of abnormal elevation in basal glucose, especially during nocturnal periods. This represents an intermediary stage between pre-diabetes (HbA1c ≥ 5.7%, 39 mmol/mol, and < 6.5%, 48 mmol/mol) and those who begin to show a steadily progressive worsening in basal glucose (HbA1c ≥ 7%, 53 mmol/mol). Should this relatively minor intermediate dysglycemic phase deserve more attention, that is the question. The now available incretin-based therapies, and more specifically the DPP-4 inhibitors provide the clinician with the possibility to reduce or eradicate both the dawn phenomenon and post-meal glucose excursions with minimal side effects. The availability of 24-h glycemic profiles in those with "mild dysglycemia" will help to describe their individual glycemic phenotype, based on which the early and appropriate life style changes and/or pharmacological interventions can be introduced.

### Thirty years of research on the dawn phenomenon: lessons to optimize blood glucose control in diabetes [^111D73xL]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

More than 30 years ago in Diabetes Care, Schmidt et al. defined "dawn phenomenon", the night-to-morning elevation of blood glucose (BG) before and, to a larger extent, after breakfast in subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Shortly after, a similar observation was made in type 2 diabetes (T2D), and the physiology of glucose homeostasis at night was studied in normal, nondiabetic subjects. Ever since the first description, the dawn phenomenon has been studied extensively with at least 187 articles published as of today. In this issue, Monnier et al. report an additional observation on the dawn phenomenon in a large group of T2D subjects and quantify its role on overall BG control. Given this information and the extensive data to date, an assessment of our knowledge in this area should be determined. Specifically, what have we learned from the last 30 years of research on the dawn phenomenon? What is the appropriate definition, the identified mechanism(s), the importance (if any), and the treatment of the dawn phenomenon in T1D and T2D?

### Misled by the morning "Fasting" plasma glucose [^115Tym4f]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2015). Low credibility.

Because of its ease and simplicity of its measurement, the morning fasting plasma glucose (FPG), has been as used a surrogate marker for the entire basal day when titrating once-nightly basal insulin. Common in obese insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes, late and large evening meals elevate the FPG. This has led to dosing of basal insulin well beyond the basal requirements and contributes to hypoglycemia and weight gain seen with this therapy. It is recommended that during basal insulin titration, the evening meal be limited and hypoglycemia be monitored early in the morning, that bewitching time when the "peakless" basal insulin's action is peaking and the predawn phenomenon insulin sensitivity is higher.

### The relative contribution of diurnal and nocturnal glucose exposures to HbA1c in type 1 diabetes males: a pooled analysis [^113geFMm]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The impact of excessive glucose exposure on the development of long-term diabetes complications is well established with studies showing unequivocally that improved long-term glucose control prevents and delays complications and reduces mortality. HbA1c is widely accepted as the hallmark measure of long-term glucose control, and this serves as the principal basis for treatment decisions aimed at reducing the risk of complications in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). HbA1c reflects time-averaged mean blood glucose over a 8–12 week period and is derived from a composite of fasting and mealtime glucose responses, and impacted by glycaemic variability as well as non-glycaemic parameters such as nutritional deficiencies, genetic factors, and personal characteristics including age and adiposity. However, the exact contribution of day-to-day glucose exposure to variation in HbA1c has not been fully established in T1D.

The advent of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology, enables comprehensive glucose profiling for sustained periods of time under free living conditions, providing a unique opportunity to assess the individual contribution of discrete time intervals (e.g. mealtimes, overnight periods, and early mornings) as well as glycaemic variability to HbA1c. The ability to identify which aspects of every-day living contribute most to long-term glycaemic control, is important to our understanding of how treatment interventions or changes to daily self-management may improve long-term outcomes in T1D. In this current analysis, we aimed to compare the strength of associations across a range of CGM-derived glycaemic metrics with HbA1c levels in patients with T1D. Further, we estimated the variance in HbA1c explained by pre- and postprandial glycaemia, nocturnal glycaemia, glycaemic variability, and non-glycaemic factors.

### The dawn phenomenon revisited: implications for diabetes therapy [^114JRDKK]. Endocrine Practice (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To summarize current data on the magnitude, prevalence, variability, pathogenesis, and management of the dawn phenomenon in patients with diabetes mellitus.

Methods

On the basis of the pertinent available literature and clinical experience, we propose a quantitative definition of the dawn phenomenon, discuss potential pathogenic mechanisms, and suggest management options.

Results

The "dawn phenomenon" is a term used to describe hyperglycemia or an increase in the amount of insulin needed to maintain normoglycemia, occurring in the absence of antecedent hypoglycemia or waning insulin levels, during the early morning hours. To be clinically relevant, the magnitude of the dawn increase in blood glucose level should be more than 10 mg/dL or the increase in insulin requirement should be at least 20% from the overnight nadir. Controversy exists regarding the frequency, reproducibility, and pathogenesis of the dawn phenomenon. Approximately 54% of patients with type 1 diabetes and 55% of patients with type 2 diabetes experience the dawn phenomenon when the foregoing quantitative definition is used. The most likely pathogenic mechanism underlying the dawn phenomenon is growth hormone-mediated impairment of insulin sensitivity at the liver and muscles. The exact biochemical pathways involved are unknown. Therapeutic decisions aimed at correcting fasting hyperglycemia should take into account the variability and magnitude of the dawn phenomenon within individual patients. Successful insulinization appears to minimize the effects of the dawn phenomenon. Currently, no subcutaneous depot preparation of insulin exists that is capable of mimicking the basal insulinsecretion of the healthy pancreas.

Conclusion

Increases in the bedtime doses of hypoglycemic agents with nighttime peaks in action may correct early morning hyperglycemia but be associated with undesirable nocturnal hypoglycemia. Targeted continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion programming can facilitate the prevention of early morning hyperglycemia in selected patients.

4 MONITORING

4.1 How to monitor

If the patient is receiving only basal insulin, with or without other diabetes medications, blood glucose monitoring should be performed when fasting to evaluate the impact of basal insulin on overnight glycaemic control. If HbA1c levels are not properly controlled and FPG values are within range, additional monitoring may help evaluate postprandial glucose (PPG) control to decide if treatment intensification is needed. PPG monitoring does not need to occur after each meal and can be rotated or performed after the largest meal. Additional monitoring may also help the patient understand glycaemic fluctuations which may aid in identifying situations that can increase the risk of hypoglycaemia; for example, a large decline in bedtime to morning blood glucose may herald overlooked nocturnal hypoglycaemia.

In recent years, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has emerged as a complementary method for the assessment of glucose levels. Although there is no evidence for use of CGM in patients with T2DM initiating basal insulin, it may be useful in the case of patients intensifying insulin therapy with prandial insulin.

4.2 Glycaemic variability

Glycaemic variability is a term used ambiguously to describe both within‐day and inter‐day variations in blood glucose values. Within‐day blood glucose fluctuations are normal and represent glucose fluctuations caused by food and exercise. Given the recommendation to monitor only FPG in patients using basal insulin, inter‐day glucose variations are a more frequent and relevant problem in this type of patient.

Glucose variability is a predictor of hypoglycaemia. High glucose variability in patients with T2DM is associated with increased rates of overall symptomatic, nocturnal symptomatic and severe hypoglycaemia, and needs to be addressed in order to mitigate the risk.

There are many factors that may affect glucose variability and identifying them can help both the healthcare provider and patient to understand the clinical scenarios and make the appropriate decisions. Evidence suggests stressful experiences may destabilize blood glucose levels through physiological mechanisms but also through interfering in self‐care behaviours. A diabetes‐specific instrument, where patients look for patterns in their perceived stress levels and their blood glucose levels, may help patients to understand the relationship between stress and blood glucose levels. A higher degree of physical activity can lower FPG, and therefore, a change in exercise pattern could cause variability in FPG. Specific exercise recommendations are discussed in a later section. Dietary changes can impact FPG variability. For example, a very low‐carbohydrate diet or alcohol consumption can affect insulin sensitivity and blood glucose fluctuations. Avoiding extreme changes in diet and limiting alcohol intake are thus recommended to reduce FPG variability.

### Target for glycemic control: concentrating on glucose [^116tCwAC]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

A tool for integrating the different periods of daytime

Whereas many physicians continue to emphasize fasting glucose and A1C to guide management of diabetes, observational studies have indicated that glucose testing at postprandial and postabsorptive time points could play an important role. For instance, lessons from physiology tell us that humans spend half of their lives in postprandial states. The postprandial state, with respect to glucose, is defined as a 4-h period that immediately follows ingestion of a meal. During this period, dietary carbohydrates are progressively hydrolyzed through several sequential enzymatic actions. Even though the insulin response rapidly reduces the postprandial glucose excursion with a return to baseline levels within < 2 h, the overall period of absorption has approximately a 4-h duration that corresponds to the postprandial state. The postabsorptive state consists of a 6-h period that follows the postprandial period. During this time interval, glucose concentrations remain within a normal range in nondiabetic individuals through the breakdown of the glycogen (glycogenolysis) stored during the postprandial period. The "real" fasting state commences only at the end of the postabsorptive period (∼10–12 h after the beginning of the last meal intake). During the fasting state, plasma glucose is maintained at a near-normal level by the gluconeogenesis: glucose derived from lactate, alanine, and glycerol. Therefore, it appears that in a nondiabetic patient who takes three meals per day at relatively fixed hours, the 24-h period of the day can be divided into three periods corresponding to fasting, postprandial, and postabsorptive states. The postprandial period (4 h each) is equal to 12 h and covers a full half-day period of time (Fig. 1). The real fasting period is only limited to a 3- to 4-h period of time at the end of the night. Furthermore, taking into account the overlap between the postprandial and postabsorptive periods, it can be asserted that all the remaining parts of daytime correspond to postabsorptive states (Fig. 1). Although the postprandial glucose excursions are usually higher and last for longer, with greater variability, in patients with diabetes compared with those in healthy individuals, these three periods remain present in patients with diabetes. Therefore, the ideal regimen for assessing blood glucose variations over daytime should include one or several time points of self-monitoring of blood glucose within each of these three periods. Accordingly, for the last few years, we have been advised to use the four-point glycemic profile as an investigative tool for the monitoring of blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes. The prebreakfast glucose is a reflection of the real fasting state, the mid-morning and the 2-h postlunch values can be considered to reflect postprandial periods, and finally the 5-h postlunch glucose (extended postlunch value) is a marker of a postabsorptive period. It is obvious that, in non–insulin-using type 2 diabetic patients, such a four-point glycemic profile should not be regularly performed every day. For that reason, in these patients, we have limited the use of self-monitoring of blood glucose to once a day, but we recommend to rotate glucose testing at the different times of the day over a 4-day period to have a broader picture of the glucose fluctuations over daytime.

### Insulin therapy and dietary adjustments to normalize glycemia and prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia after evening exercise in type 1 diabetes: a randomized controlled trial [^111BZFVM]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The American Diabetes Association advocates regular exercise in type 1 diabetes, as this is associated with an improvement in a wide range of health outcomes. In reality, however, incorporation of exercise into everyday life is significantly hampered by the risk of exercise-induced hypoglycemia. Fear of hypoglycemia, particularly during the night, is a major barrier to participation in regular exerciseas the risk of hypoglycemia is magnified when exercise is performed in the evening, as falling blood glucose is likely to occur while sleeping. Indeed, a large proportion of patients with type 1 diabetes report a lack of practical advice for preventing hypoglycemia after exercise, and many feel largely uninformed about insulin administration and carbohydrate intake around exercise. Moreover, considering the complexity in normalizing glycemia acutely after exercise, many patients are concerned about losing control of wider diabetes management and long-term glycemic control when exercise is performed regularly. Clearly, it is imperative that individuals can effectively manage glycemia following exercise in order to benefit from adherence to regular exercise.

Our laboratory has demonstrated that it is possible to normalize glycemia early after exercise by making mealtime adjustments to both rapid-acting insulin administrationand postexercise carbohydrate composition. Specifically, consuming postexercise foodstuffs that elicit a low glycemic index (GI), while employing a reduction to rapid-acting insulin dose, protects patients from early-onset hypoglycemia, and minimizes exposure to postprandial hyperglycemia and inflammation. Unfortunately, these acute prandial adjustments carry only short-lasting protection from hypoglycemia; glucose nadirs are still likely to occur beyond ∼8 h postexercise, and during the hours of sleep if exercise is performed in the evening. It may be prudent to adjust the dose of basal insulin that is administered over the course of the exercise day. Considering that late falls in glycemia following evening exercise typically coincide at ∼8 h postexercise, and during the time of sleep, basal insulin may play a major role. Although basal insulin reduction is sometimes advocated in clinical practice, there is currently a lack of evidence to support this advice, especially if patients are also employing acute prandial-based strategies.

### Insulin therapy and dietary adjustments to normalize glycemia and prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia after evening exercise in type 1 diabetes: a randomized controlled trial [^1175Rjag]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2015). Medium credibility.

Key messages

Evening-time exercise is a frequent cause of severe hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes and fear of this deters participation in regular exercise.
Recommendations for normalizing glycemia around exercise consist of prandial adjustments to bolus insulin therapy and food composition, but this carries only short-lasting protection from hypoglycemia.
We show that by reducing basal insulin dose in combination with reduced prandial bolus insulin and low glycemic index carbohydrate feeding, exercise-induced hypoglycemia can be avoided for 24 h following evening exercise. Moreover, this strategy is not associated with hyperglycemia, or adverse metabolic disturbances.

Meal intakes timing of ingestion: morning versus dinner

Evidence suggests that meal ingestion in the morning and late evening (time of day) influence glucose metabolism in humans. Earlier studies, using mixed meals or glucose infusion, have reported circadian responses of reduced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in healthy participants for the evening rather than in the morning –. An acute study by Sato et al. examined the effects of a late evening meal on diurnal variation of blood glucose in healthy individuals, assessed by continuous glucose monitoring (CGMS™). There was an increase in blood glucose after the late evening meal which shifted towards later at night, with peaking of blood glucose observed during sleep. Late evening meals may cause postprandial hyperglycaemia with this decrease in glucose tolerance from morning towards the night.

A cohort study was the first to show the relationship between late-night dinner consumption and glycaemic control in type 2 diabetics, whereby having a late dinner meal after 8 pm was independently associated with an increase in HbA1c. In some acute trials, both healthy individuals, and type 2 diabeticsshowed significantly higher blood glucose and insulin values after night-time meals. These studies deduce that the disruption of the circadian rhythm led to the exacerbation of the physiological nocturnal decrease of glucose tolerance. Peter et al. showed that type 2 diabetic subjects who ate three identical meals had glucose excursions that were higher in the morning than in the evening. There was increased glucose tolerance in response to the first and third meals of the day, irrespective of glycaemic control. There was also a change in circadian variation in insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetics. Type 2 diabetics exhibit a different daily circadian pattern from healthy individuals, with increased insulin sensitivity towards the night, and higher glucose excursions in the morning than in the evening.

Glycemic index (GI) and meal timings

The glycemic index (GI) is defined as the blood glucose raising potential of carbohydrate foods. Low GI carbohydrates have shown to be beneficial as they have a lower impact on blood glucose concentrations and protect against hypoglycaemia. There is good evidence to suggest that it also avoids large fluctuations in blood glucose levels.

Some intervention studies have aimed to establish if varying the GI and the time at which meals are consumed impacts on postprandial glucose and insulin responses. A four-way, randomized crossover study in healthy individuals, by Morgan et al. compared the glycaemic effects of varying the GI and glycaemic load (GL) (GL = GI × carbohydrate content) and the timing of meal consumption, with most of the energy consumed either for breakfast or for dinner. In their first observation, higher GL meals consumed in the evening led to higher glucose and insulin response compared with consuming the same meal in the morning. In the second part of the study, a high GI diet given in the evening, produced an even more pronounced effect on glucose and insulin. These results confirmed that the quality and quantity of carbohydrates, i.e. the GI and GL in addition to the time at which the meal is consumed, influences glycaemic control and insulin secretion. An additional randomised crossover study in healthy subjects investigated the effect of low and high GI meals on glucose levels, when given in the earlier or latter part of the day. Postprandial glucose response in the evening was greater even after the low GI meal. These results suggest that low GI foods, even if they were consumed in the night, was less efficient in glucose control. Low GI foods were more effective in glucose control in the morning. This could possibly be explained by the changes in insulin sensitivity which has been reported to decrease during the day. Furthermore, an additional influence is due to hormones such as glucagon and cortisol which are affected by circadian rhythms, and in turn influence insulin secretion and glycaemic response. A recent intervention investigated the timing of low GI meals in the morning (0800 h), evening (2000h) and midnight (0000 h). The low GI meals consumed in the evening and midnight resulted in higher glucose excursions with concomitant higher insulin levels, compared with the morning. Collectively, these studies have shown that having a low GI meal, irrespective of meal size, improved glycaemic response in the morning but had little impact at night. This temporal difference has been associated with the effect that the endogenous circadian rhythm has on glucose metabolism.

Insulin

Insulin Circadian Rhythm

Insulin secretion is regulated by the intricate interplay between nutrient sensing, gastro-entero-pancreatic hormones, and the autonomic nervous system. Glucose, along with certain other sugars metabolized by the pancreatic islets, plays a pivotal role in stimulating insulin release. Consequently, both basal and peak insulin levels are closely correlated with glucose concentrations and the timing of meals. During prolonged fasting, glucose and insulin levels decrease further; however, they typically remain measurable within the range of 2 to 5 mU/mL. Insulin secretion exhibits a robust circadian rhythmicity, with serum insulin concentration increasing from a nadir between midnight and 6and peaking between noon and 6, which is critical for maintaining normal glucose homeostasis (Fig. 1A). This has been demonstrated by one study that, through the application of a circadian misalignment protocol, clearly showed that the diurnal rhythm of β-cell sensitivity is intrinsically regulated by the circadian clock. By reversing participants' behavioral cycles, the authors successfully isolated the effects of the circadian phase from external factors such as the sleep/wake and feeding/fasting cycles. The findings revealed a significant reduction in glucose tolerance during the biological evening compared to the biological morning, even under conditions of behavioral misalignment. This reduction, attributed to a 27% decrease in early-phase insulin secretion, provides strong evidence that the diurnal variation in β-cell sensitivity is driven by the circadian clock itself, independent of external behavioral influences. This circadian rhythm may contribute to the improved glucose tolerance observed in the morning hours relative to the evening.

### Safety of nighttime 2-hour suspension of basal insulin in pump-treated type 1 diabetes even in the absence of low glucose [^111PHwoF]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

An integrated sensor-augmented pump system has been introduced that interrupts basal insulin infusion for 2 h if patients fail to respond to low-glucose alarms. It has been suggested that such interruptions of basal insulin due to falsely low glucose levels detected by sensor could lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. We hypothesized that random suspension of basal insulin for 2 h in the overnight period would not lead to clinically important increases in blood β-hydroxybutyrate levels despite widely varying glucose values prior to the suspension.

Research Design and Methods

Subjects measured blood glucose and blood β-hydroxybutyrate levels using a meter each night at 9:00 p.m., then fasted until the next morning. On control nights, the usual basal rates were continued; on experimental nights, the basal insulin infusion was reprogrammed for a 2-h zero basal rate at random times after 11:30 p.m.

Results

In 17 type 1 diabetic subjects (mean age 24 ± 9 years, diabetes duration 14 ± 11 years, A1C level 7.3 ± 0.5% [56 mmol/mol]), blood glucose and blood β-hydroxybutyrate levels were similar at 9:00 p.m. on suspend nights (144 ± 63 mg/dL and 0.09 ± 0.07 mmol/L) and nonsuspend nights (151 ± 65 mg/dL and 0.08 ± 0.06 mmol/L) (P = 0.39 and P = 0.47, respectively). Fasting morning blood glucose levels increased after suspend nights compared with nonsuspend nights (191 ± 68 vs. 141 ± 75 mg/dL, P < 0.0001), and the frequency of fasting hypoglycemia decreased the morning following suspend nights (P < 0.0001). Morning blood β-hydroxybutyrate levels were slightly higher after suspension (0.13 ± 0.14 vs. 0.09 ± 0.11 mmol/L, P = 0.053), but the difference was not clinically important.

Conclusions

Systems that suspend basal insulin for 2 h are safe and do not lead to clinically significant ketonemia even if the blood glucose level is elevated at the time of the suspension.

### Basal-bolus insulin regimen for hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus: a practical approach [^1143ckMH]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

If the fasting or pre-breakfast blood glucose is 70–90 mg/dl (3.9–5.0 mmol/L), the dose of basal insulin should be decreased by 1 unit (10% if the dose of basal insulin is > 10 units). If the fasting or pre-breakfast blood glucose is < 70 mg/dl (3.9 mmol/L) or the patient experiences nocturnal hypoglycaemia, the basal insulin dose should be decreased by 2 units (10–20% if the dose of basal insulin is > 10 units) and the bedtime snack(s) policy reviewed.

In a scenario where twice-daily basal insulin is used, the adjustments may be more complex. It should be understood that the primary action of basal insulin is that of regulating pre-meal blood glucose values. Accordingly, the morning dose of basal insulin should be adjusted based upon the pre-dinner blood glucose value and less commonly the pre-lunch blood glucose value. The increase in the dose of morning basal insulin is only justified if the upward drift of blood glucose starts after the peak of lunch time prandial insulin is over, implying that the post-lunch blood glucose is in target but the pre-dinner and evening blood glucose values are elevated. However, when both the pre-dinner blood glucose and post-lunch blood glucose levels are elevated, it is the dose of prandial (before lunch) insulin that should primarily be adjusted, and not that of basal insulin. Similarly, in the case of preprandial hypoglycaemia (during the pre-lunch or pre-dinner period), the morning basal insulin dose should be decreased, provided the hypoglycaemia is not explained by missed or inadequate snacks or other factors (such as exercise, vomiting and/or diarrhea). Basal insulin adjustment is explained in the context of various case scenarios in Table 8.

### Nocturnal hypoglycemia: clinical manifestations and therapeutic strategies toward prevention [^116rQovE]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the features of nocturnal hypoglycemia and various preventive strategies.

Methods

We discuss the physiologic changes, the potential precipitating factors, the immediate and long-term effects, and the currently available options for treatment of nocturnal hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes.

Results

Nocturnal hypoglycemia is common in patients with type 1 diabetes and is usually asymptomatic. Nocturnal hyperinsulinemia frequently occurs with insulin therapy, and although blood glucose levels are often low during sleep, they are seldom measured routinely. Almost 50% of all episodes of severe hypoglycemia occur at night during sleep. Such episodes can cause convulsions and coma and have been implicated as a precipitating factor in cardiac arrhythmias resulting in sudden death — the "dead-in-bed syndrome". Nocturnal hypoglycemia seems to have no immediate detrimental effect on cognitive function; however, on the following day, mood and well-being may be adversely affected. Recurrent exposure to nocturnal hypoglycemia may impair cognitive function; other substantial long-term morbidity includes the development of acquired hypoglycemia syndromes, such as impaired awareness of hypoglycemia, through the putative effect of unsuspected recurrent episodes of nocturnal hypoglycemia.

Conclusion

In efforts to decrease the risk of nocturnal hypoglycemic episodes, various strategies can be used to minimize the nocturnal hyperinsulinemia that is associated with many insulin replacement regimens. Regular blood glucose monitoring (particularly at bedtime), the ingestion of appropriate bedtime snacks, and the utilization of short- and long-acting insulin analogues may all help to prevent or minimize the frequency of nocturnal hypoglycemia.

### Frequency of morning ketosis after overnight insulin suspension using an automated nocturnal predictive low glucose suspend system [^114aDuhq]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

As part of an in-home randomized trial assessing an automated nocturnal predictive low glucose suspend system, blood and urine ketone levels were measured each morning, irrespective of the blood glucose level, in individuals with type 1 diabetes who were between 15 and 45 years of age. This provided a large data set with standardized data collection for assessing the frequency of morning blood and urine ketone levels and their relationship to the blood glucose level. The measurements from the control mornings provide a relatively unique opportunity to determine the frequency of elevated ketone levels according to the blood glucose level, which can be useful for informing patients as well as for serving as a benchmark for studies involving automated suspension of insulin delivery. Overall, the frequency of elevated ketone levels was similar after intervention and control nights. Even after ≥ 2 h of overnight suspension of insulin delivery, the presence of blood ketone levels ≥ 0.6 mmol/L, or moderate or large urine ketone levels was very uncommon (∼1%) and was no higher than it was after intervention nights with no pump suspension or control nights. Moderate elevation of the morning fasting blood glucose level (200–300 mg/dL) increased the likelihood that ketones would be present only slightly and, thus, was not a good predictor of the presence of ketones. There were too few mornings (7 of 977 mornings [0.7%]) with a fasting glucose level > 300 mg/dL and a prolonged pump suspension to assess with reasonable precision the association of these factors with elevated ketone levels.

Our results are consistent with a number of prior studies in which insulin delivery was experimentally suspended for varying lengths of time to assess the effect on blood glucose and ketone levels (Table 2). In these mostly inpatient studies, ketonemia and/or ketonuria occurred if insulin delivery was suspended for a long enough period of time, but ketosis declined rapidly once insulin delivery was restored. Our results also are consistent with those of studies conducted using the low glucose suspend feature of the Paradigm Veo pump, which have demonstrated that a 2-h suspension of insulin delivery when a hypoglycemic threshold is reached is safe and does not increase the risk of ketoacidosis. Our study differs from the prior reports in having almost 2,000 at-home blood and urine ketone measurements obtained in a standardized manner irrespective of the blood glucose level, and provides valuable data with respect to the expected frequency of blood and urine ketone levels with and without pump suspension.

### Timing modulates the effect of sleep loss on glucose homeostasis [^115W1yNr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Chronobiological factors may modulate the impact of sleep loss on glucose homeostasis. However, these interactions have not been systematically assessed in humans.

Objective

To assess the effect of sleep loss during the late vs early night on glucose homeostasis.

Design

Fifteen normal-weight men participated in three conditions of a randomized, balanced crossover study comprising two conditions with shortened sleep (i.e., 4 hours of sleep during the first or the second half of the night) and a control condition with 8 hours of sleep. Glucose, insulin, cortisol, and glucagon were measured. Insulin sensitivity and secretion were assessed with a Botnia clamp.

Results

Compared with regular sleep duration, sleep loss reduced insulin sensitivity (M-value; P = 0.031) irrespective of early- or late-night timing (P = 0.691). The disposition index (i.e., the β-cell response adjusted for insulin sensitivity) also tended to be impaired by short sleep (P = 0.056) but not by sleep timing (P = 0.543). In contrast, sleep loss in the second half but not the first half of the night induced reductions in morning glucagon and cortisol levels (P < 0.031) followed by a transient increase in cortisol (P < 0.044).

Conclusions

Although sleep deprivation acutely reduced insulin sensitivity irrespective of its nocturnal timing, sleep loss in the early morning compromised α-cell and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity to a greater extent than sleep loss in the first half of the night. This pattern suggests that the timing of sleep restriction can partly potentiate its deleterious metabolic effects.

### The relative contribution of diurnal and nocturnal glucose exposures to HbA1c in type 1 diabetes males: a pooled analysis [^111PDek9]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Glucose exposure during sleep, including early-morning, as well as wake-up glucose, and CV, were not associated with HbA1c in this study. 91% of our patients encountered hypoglycaemia during sleep, with the average time spent in hypoglycaemic ranges between ~30 90-min. Previously, it has been reported that a 1% increase in HbA1c is associated with 41% decrease in the risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia. Further, we observed a noticeable rise in glucose levels during the early hours of the morning in ~20% of our patients (Fig. 1D). A transient increase in morning time glucose concentrations, termed the dawn phenomenon, is a well-established and frequent event in T1D. However, on average, wake-up glucose concentrations were largely comparable to mean 24-h glucose levels, and lower than postprandial glucose concentrations. In our analysis, both early-morning glycaemia (captured 2-h prior to wake-up) as well as wake-up glucose levels were not significantly associated with HbA1c indicating that the dawn phenomenon played a relatively minor role in influencing long-term glucose control in our subjects. Generally, stable glucose levels are defined as a CV < 36%. The average CV in our cohort was ~34%, although this ranged considerably between patients (Range: 25–50%), and mean 24-h glucose SD was 2.7 mmol/L which is consistent with previous assessments of glycaemic variability in T1D. It possible, that heterogeneity within our sample contributed to a lack of association between these metrics and HbA1c.

### Glycemic control and hypoglycemia: is the loser the winner? [^112wdVg8]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Severe hypoglycemic episodes often occur during sleep, when the intensity and recognizability of counterregulatory responses tend to be diminished, thereby depriving individuals of the adequate stimulus to counteract hypoglycemia. These episodes, termed nocturnal hypoglycemia (NH), may result in part from insufficient food intake and/or inappropriate insulin dosage the previous evening. Asymptomatic NH is a relatively common phenomenon affecting up to 50% of adults and 78% of children and lasting as long as several hours. Moreover, NH is suspected to contribute to the "dead-in-bed syndrome" that leads to the mortality of 6% of type 1 diabetic individuals below the age of 40 years.

In addition to NH, individuals may also fail to recognize hypoglycemic episodes during the day. Such desensitization is due to decreased neuroendocrine responses to hypoglycemia that dampen symptomatic responses. Men are more prone to desensitization, whereas women inherently exhibit decreased counterregulatory responses to hypoglycemia. Thus, in both sexes, the warning signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia are typically not exhibited until blood glucose drops to dangerously low levels. Even two episodes of moderate hypoglycemia are sufficient to decrease counterregulatory hormonal responses to hypoglycemia. Hence, as has been said, hypoglycemia begets hypoglycemia.

Hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure may also result from intense physical activity. Exercise-induced hypoglycemia occurs up to 17 h after cessation of physical activity and can result from increased insulin sensitivity and glucose utilization. Furthermore, counterregulatory responses may be reduced by 50% during hypoglycemia following moderately intense exercise.

From a practical perspective, a 10-s "sprint" of maximal effort immediately before or after moderately intense physical activity may reduce the rapid fall in glucose level associated with exercise. The sprint stabilizes glycemia in the period of early recovery from exercise, possibly by facilitating the release of counterregulatory response hormones.

### Insulin therapy and dietary adjustments to normalize glycemia and prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia after evening exercise in type 1 diabetes: a randomized controlled trial [^115ifwzA]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Evening-time exercise is a frequent cause of severe hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes, fear of which deters participation in regular exercise. Recommendations for normalizing glycemia around exercise consist of prandial adjustments to bolus insulin therapy and food composition, but this carries only short-lasting protection from hypoglycemia. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the impact of a combined basal-bolus insulin dose reduction and carbohydrate feeding strategy on glycemia and metabolic parameters following evening exercise in type 1 diabetes.

Methods

Ten male participants (glycated hemoglobin: 52.4 ± 2.2 mmol/mol), treated with multiple daily injections, completed two randomized study-days, whereby administration of total daily basal insulin dose was unchanged (100%), or reduced by 20% (80%). Participants attended the laboratory at ∼08:00 h for a fasted blood sample, before returning in the evening. On arrival (∼17:00 h), participants consumed a carbohydrate meal and administered a 75% reduced rapid-acting insulin dose and 60 min later performed 45 min of treadmill running. At 60 min postexercise, participants consumed a low glycemic index (LGI) meal and administered a 50% reduced rapid-acting insulin dose, before returning home. At ∼23:00 h, participants consumed a LGI bedtime snack and returned to the laboratory the following morning (∼08:00 h) for a fasted blood sample. Venous blood samples were analyzed for glucose, glucoregulatory hormones, non-esterified fatty acids, β-hydroxybutyrate, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor α. Interstitial glucose was monitored for 24 h pre-exercise and postexercise.

Results

Glycemia was similar until 6 h postexercise, with no hypoglycemic episodes. Beyond 6 h glucose levels fell during 100%, and nine participants experienced nocturnal hypoglycemia. Conversely, all participants during 80% were protected from nocturnal hypoglycemia, and remained protected for 24 h postexercise. All metabolic parameters were similar.

Conclusions

Reducing basal insulin dose with reduced prandial bolus insulin and LGI carbohydrate feeding provides protection from hypoglycemia during and for 24 h following evening exercise. This strategy is not associated with hyperglycemia, or adverse metabolic disturbances.

### Minimizing hypoglycemia while maintaining glycemic control in diabetes [^111Cn7hm]. Diabetes (2008). Low credibility.

Boosting glucose counterregulation.

A number of human studies in experimental settings have measured the potential of pharmacological activation of counterregulatory mechanisms to boost blood glucose levels and therefore reduce the risk of hypoglycemia, particularly at night. Alanine may restore deficient glucagon responses in individuals with type 1 diabetes at least in part. Nocturnal hypoglycemia can be prevented by oral terbutaline given at bedtime in contrast to the relative ineffectiveness of bedtime snacks but at the expense of a higher fasting glucose concentration. The authors commented that finding a dose that could reliably prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia without raising fasting glucose concentrations is challenging.

It is noteworthy that, as with other potential treatments described above, these small-scale studies that provide proof of principle have not been followed by larger trials, have not been adequately powered, and are of insufficient duration to measure differences in severe hypoglycemia. It is unclear whether this gap in the literature is related to a perception that therapies are ineffective, the difficulty in securing funding, or merely the logistics in running multicenter trials.

### Improved glycaemic control induced by evening activity breaks does not persist overnight amongst healthy adults: a randomized crossover trial [^111LYyLm]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

To compare the effects of 4hours of laboratory-based regular activity breaks (RABs) and prolonged sitting (SIT) on subsequent 48-h free-living interstitial glucose levels in a group of healthy adults.

Materials and Methods

In this randomized crossover trial, participants completed two 4-h laboratory-based interventions commencing at ~5:00pm: (1) SIT and (2) SIT interrupted with 3min of body weight resistance exercise activity breaks every 30min (RABs). Continuous glucose monitoring was performed during the intervention and for 48-h after, during which time participants returned to a free-living setting.

Results

Twenty-eight adults (female n = 20, mean ± SD age 25.5 ± 5.6years, body mass index 29.2 ± 6.9kg/m 2) provided data for this analysis. During the intervention period, RABs lowered mean interstitial glucose by 8.3% (-0.47mmol/L/4h, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.74 to -0.20; p = 0.001) and area under the curve (AUC) by 8.9% (-2.01mmol/L/4h, 95% CI -3.05 to -0.97; p < 0.001) compared to SIT. Measures of glycaemic variability were not significantly different during the intervention. There were no significant differences in mean glucose and AUC between conditions during the first nocturnal period and 24-h post intervention. When compared to SIT, RABs increased continuous overall net action of glucose at 1h and SD glucose by 22% (0.18mmol/L, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.29; p = 0.018) and 26% (95% CI 4.9 to 42.7; p = 0.019) in the first nocturnal period and by 10% (0.09mmol/L, 95% CI 0.01, 0.17; p = 0.025) and 15% (95% CI 6.6 to 22.4; p = 0.001) in the 24-h post intervention period, respectively.

Conclusion

Performing activity breaks in the evening results in acute reductions in interstitial glucose concentrations; however, the magnitude of these changes is not maintained overnight or into the following 48hours.

### Insulin therapy and dietary adjustments to normalize glycemia and prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia after evening exercise in type 1 diabetes: a randomized controlled trial [^116rBPnE]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2015). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study demonstrates that combining a reduced basal-bolus insulin dose, along with low GI carbohydrate feeding, provides full protection from exercise-induced hypoglycemia for a total of 24 h after exercise. Notably, when basal insulin dose was reduced by 20%, there was a clear normalization of glycemia during the night, protecting all participants from nocturnal hypoglycemia with concomitant hyperglycemia. In addition, we show that adopting this strategy does not induce other metabolic disturbances.

To our knowledge, we have, for the first time, demonstrated that it is possible to completely avoid acute and late-nocturnal hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes, despite performing a prolonged bout of moderate-to-vigorous intensity running (expending ∼740 kcal and running 7.3 km) exercise in the evening. In addition, we show that while protecting patients from hypoglycemia, it is also possible to reduce exposure to hyperglycemia. Typically, preventing hypoglycemia after exercise occurs as a consequence of inducing hyperglycemia; avoidance of this is critical for long-term diabetes management, especially if exercise is to be performed regularly and consistently. We required our participants to reduce the total amount of basal insulin by 20% (∼7 IU), in addition to reducing pre-exercise and post-exercise prandially administered rapid-acting insulin dose, and consuming low GI carbohydrates after exercise, to achieve this. As this is a strategy that can be readily communicated to patients, these data have considerable clinical relevance. Effectively managing the risk of hypoglycemia and normalizing glycemia following exercise is critical for safe long-term exercise adherence, and potentially improvements in wider diabetes management.

Differences in glycemia did not become apparent until ∼6 h postexercise, suggesting that reducing total basal insulin dose does not alter acute postprandial glucose handling or acute glycemic control following exercise. Beyond ∼6 h postexercise, interstitial glucose concentrations began to fall under the non-reduced basal insulin condition with the first episode of hypoglycemia occurring at ∼8 h postexercise (∼02:00 h). Further falls in glycemia were evident during the night, such that 90% of patients experienced nocturnal hypoglycemia when basal dose was not reduced. This is in keeping with our previous findingsand those of others, and highlights that falls in glycemia during the night cannot be prevented when employing prandial adjustments only. Conversely, when a basal reduction is employed in combination with acute prandial adjustments, glycemic control is maintained throughout the evening and night, protecting all patients from hypoglycemia.

### Target for glycemic control: concentrating on glucose [^1111NC9S]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

A tool for improving our knowledge on the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes

Type 2 diabetes is a disease characterized by three main abnormalities: 1) a defect of β-cell function, 2) a state of insulin resistance, and 3) an overproduction of glucose by the liver. Despite that currently available oral hypoglycemic agents are able to target deficiencies in either the endogenous insulin secretion or the insulin sensitivity at different target sites, the attainment of satisfactory diabetes control becomes more and more difficult the longer the duration of the disease.

By analyzing continuous glucose patterns over 24 h, we recently demonstrated that the deterioration of glucose homeostasis can be approximated to a three-step process. The first step corresponds to a loss in postprandial control that occurs in patients with A1C levels between 6.5 and 6.9% and with mean diabetes duration of 4.4 years. As mentioned above, the second step is characterized by a deterioration of the glycemic control during the pre- and postbreakfast periods in patients who exhibit A1C levels between 7 and 7.9% and who have mean diabetes duration of 8.4 years. The final step in the deterioration of diabetic control occurs generally beyond the end of the first decade of diabetes duration and is represented by a chronic sustained basal hyperglycemia over both nocturnal and interprandial periods and excess postprandial glycemia. In conclusion, the natural history of the worsening of dysglycemia in type 2 diabetes is marked by an early loss of prandial glycemic control that precedes a deterioration of basal hyperglycemia. This deterioration progresses from a period corresponding to a short time interval limited to the end of the overnight fast up to an extended period that covers the nocturnal and interprandial periods considered as a whole. The prebreakfast glucose deterioration that occurs at the end of the overnight fast is known as the "dawn phenomenon" and is mainly explained by the circadian variation of the hepatic glucose production that starts to rise in the evening and reaches a peak toward the end of the nocturnal period. These abnormal high glucose excursions that are observed after breakfast can be depicted as an "extended dawn phenomenon", which is due to the remnant effect of the hepatic glucose overproduction during the morning period in combination with the dietary intake of carbohydrates at breakfast. The "dawn" and the "extended dawn" phenomena are two main causes of failure in the diabetic control of many patients with type 2 diabetes, especially those who have A1C levels ranging from 7 to 8% and who are already treated with maximal doses of oral hypoglycemic agents. Such observations help us to understand why type 2 diabetes, a relentless progressive disease, requires advances from monotherapy with oral antidiabetic agents to combination therapy using multiple oral agents and finally insulin replacement without undue delay.

### Flash glucose-sensing technology as a replacement for blood glucose monitoring for the management of insulin-treated type 2 diabetes: a multicenter, open-label randomized controlled trial [^115YxBE9]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

This European study is the first to investigate the use of flash sensor-based glucose technology as a replacement for standard self-monitoring of blood glucose in individuals with type 2 diabetes treated with intensive insulin therapy. Whilst the primary endpoint was not achieved (no difference in HbA1c change between the groups at 6 months), the secondary endpoints demonstrate a number of interesting findings for further consideration including use of the technology is associated with reduced time in hypoglycemia, particularly nocturnal; treatment satisfaction improved across two questionnaire methodologies; HbA1c improvement combined with reduced hypoglycemia measures were observed in the < 65 years subgroup; and the safety data confirms that flash glucose monitoring technology is an effective and safe replacement for blood glucose monitoring.

There is a paucity of data on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) use in type 2 diabetes and, to our knowledge, no recent randomised, controlled studies in this population using intensive insulin therapy. Available data for CGM use in those using oral glucose-lowering medication or basal insulin with higher baseline HbA1c values indicate they are more likely to show benefit with a reduction in this clinical marker. However, hypoglycaemia was not an endpoint in these studies, and exposure to hypoglycaemic risk is much less in treatment regimens excluding prandial insulin. Reductions in hypoglycaemic markers generally require de-escalation of glucose-lowering therapy with less stringent glucose targets. In the intervention group, HbA1c level improved with significantly reduced exposure to hypoglycaemia.

Reductions in hypoglycemia in the intervention group were present across all age groups, particularly significant in those aged above 65 years, and over 24 h of the day, with benefit particularly pronounced during nighttime. Reduced nocturnal hypoglycemia likely resulted through learning from historical nighttime sensor glucose data leading to adjustments in pre-bedtime snacks or overnight basal insulin doses. Improved daytime hypoglycemia was likely achieved through a combination of on-demand access to real-time sensor glucose results with trend arrows, enabling preventative action and informing behavior modification, alongside HCP review of glucose reports with the participant, to alter the balance of insulins. Smaller, daily adjustments to insulin doses or proportions may not be apparent in the total insulin dose. Given the association of hypoglycemia with adverse clinical outcome, including enhanced risk of cardiovascular events, increased hospital admissions, and reduced survival, these results for multiple hypoglycemia-related secondary endpoints highlight the effectiveness and safety of this technology and its potential for improving glycemic control. Detection of hypoglycemia, especially nocturnal, can be difficult with intermittent glucose monitoring even when it is performed frequently.

### Thirty years of research on the dawn phenomenon: lessons to optimize blood glucose control in diabetes [^114X65qs]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Two messages from the data of Monnier et al. are important. First, the dawn phenomenon is confirmed as a frequent event across the heterogeneous population of T2D independent of (oral) treatment and studied in everyday life conditions, not only in the setting of specialized clinical research units. Second, the article reaffirms that the primary target of treatment in T2D is to reestablish near-normoglycemia before and after breakfast (i.e. to treat the dawn phenomenon) to lower mean daily BG and A1C.

The absolute overnight increase in fasting IG observed is in the range of that reported previously for BG at dawn (–,), and the postbreakfast IG is higher as compared with the postlunch and dinner values. Thus, the dawn phenomenon induces hyperglycemia not only before, but, to a larger extent, after breakfast as well. Over the years, fasting (and postbreakfast) hyperglycemia in T2D worsens as result of progressively impaired pancreatic B-cell function on the background of continued insulin resistance primarily at dawn (,–) and independently of age. Because it is an early metabolic abnormality leading over time to the vicious circle of "hyperglycemia begets hyperglycemia" by glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity, the dawn phenomenon in T2D should be treated early and appropriately before A1C continues to increase.

Oral medications do not adequately control the dawn phenomenon, even when given in combination. Sulphonylureas are less than ideal due to risk of hypoglycemia in the afternoon or evening, when the dose is increased to counteract the hyperglycemia of dawn phenomenon. Incretins are designed to elegantly improve the postprandial, not the fasting, periods. The evening replacement of basal insulin, which abolishes the dawn phenomenon by restraining hepatic glucose production and lipolysis, is an effective treatment as it mimics the physiology of glucose homeostasis in normal, nondiabetic subjects.

Early use of basal insulin in T2D is an add-on option treatment after failure of metformin to control A1C < 7.0%. However, to fight the clinical inertia, it would be wise to consider initiation of basal insulin (effective, easy, safe, and "natural") before — not after — A1C has increased well beyond 7.0%, as usually it is done in practice currently. Basal insulin may be initiated to prevent the increase of A1C > 7.0% by reducing nocturnal hyperglycemia and the dawn phenomenon (Fig. 2).

### Insulin therapy and dietary adjustments to normalize glycemia and prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia after evening exercise in type 1 diabetes: a randomized controlled trial [^112mNDxV]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2015). Medium credibility.

Immediately on awakening (∼13 h postexercise; 07:30 h; figure 3), interstitial glucose was significantly less under 100% with participants typically in the hypoglycemic range (100% 3.3 ± 0.6, 80% 8.1 ± 0.6 mmol/L; p = 0.008; figure 2). Fasted, resting venous blood glucose was significantly lower under 100% (100% 3.7 ± 0.3, 80% 7.7 ± 0.9 mmol/L; p < 0.001; figure 1), and significantly less than concentrations measured on the morning before exercise (p < 0.001). In comparison, participants under 80% were typically in the euglycemic range on awakening, and displayed similar blood glucose concentrations to the morning before exercise (p > 0.05). There were no differences is serum insulin at this time (table 1), with concentrations similar to those elicited on the morning before exercise (p > 0.05). There were no conditional differences in the temporal changes of counter-regulatory hormones or metabolites during this time (table 1 and figure 2). In addition, TNF-α was unchanged in both conditions. IL-6 was significantly lower under 100% (figure 2), with concentrations under 80% remaining similar to both pretrial morning and trial resting samples (figure 2).

Over the course of the postexercise day, participants under 100% spent more time hypoglycemic (interstitial glucose < 3.9 mmol/L: 100% 264 ± 22 vs 80% 5 ± 6 min; p < 0.001) and hyperglycemic (interstitial glucose > 8.0 mmol/L: 100% 123 ± 21 vs 80% 67 ± 16 min; p = 0.004) ranges, with less time in euglycemia (interstitial glucose 3.9–8.0 mmol/L: 100% 643 ± 54 vs 80% 1048 ± 71 min; p = 0.007) than those under the 80% condition. During this time, total energy consumed was significantly greater under 100% (100% 1143 ± 48, 80% 714 ± 48 kcal; p < 0.001), with increased contribution from carbohydrate (100% 76 ± 3, 80% 69 ± 3%; p = 0.004). Levels of activity were similar between conditions with total number of steps comparable (100% 4231 ± 102, 80% 4301 ± 132 steps; p = 0.602).

### What's the time? Does the artificial pancreas need to know? [^1114ZJMo]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

The development of a closed-loop artificial pancreas (AP) represents a major technological effort that aims to improve glucose control, prevent complications, and decrease disease burden for patients with diabetes. An AP consists of three components: 1) a subcutaneous glucose monitor, 2) a subcutaneous insulin pump, and 3) an automated control algorithm (Fig. 1). Until recently, clinical trials investigating AP function were limited to controlled, in-hospital settings. However, several recent studies showed that an AP can maintain or even improve glycemic control outside of the hospital.

FIG. 1.
Schematic overview of a closed-loop AP. A closed-loop AP consists of a glucose sensor, an insulin pump, and a control algorithm. The algorithm controls insulin infusion rate based on recent glucose values, recent insulin infusion, and individual-specific information on insulin sensitivity. The latter is often initially derived from body weight, and total and basal insulin doses. In addition, the algorithm needs information on physical activity and meal announcement. Incorporating individual diurnal insulin sensitivity patterns possibly may improve algorithm performance.

Several types of control algorithms have been developed. On the one hand, proportional-integrative derivative algorithms use a classical feedback approach. On the other hand, model-predictive control (MPC) algorithms continuously update a strategic plan for glucose control. These MPC algorithms can possibly be further improved by taking the daily variation in insulin sensitivity into account. It has been known for a long time that glucose levels in type 1 diabetes show an increase in the early morning (the dawn phenomenon), and in silico it is possible to incorporate a daily rhythm in basal insulin secretion into an MPC algorithm to deal with this difference in basal insulin requirement. The daily variation in meal responses may be a further opportunity for algorithm developers to improve MPC.

Glucose levels and glucose tolerance show clear 24-h rhythms that are induced by the circadian timing system. These consist of a central clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus and peripheral clocks in metabolic tissues such as liver, pancreas, and adipose tissue. In rodents and humans, the magnitude of glucose and insulin excursions after a meal depends on the time of the day. In healthy subjects, postprandial glucose excursions are lower in the morning than in the evening, which may be the result of the 24-h rhythm of insulin sensitivity with increased insulin sensitivity in the morning.

### The chronobiology of hormone administration: "Doctor, what time should I take my medication? " [^113eirwb]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 Receptor Agonist Therapy

The timing of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) administration can significantly impact their effectiveness in managing obesity and diabetes. While the optimal timing may vary depending on the specific GLP-1RA and individual patient factors, there are general guidelines based on current research and clinical practice.

For daily administered GLP-1RAs, such as liraglutide, it is often recommended to take them at the same time each day to maintain consistent blood levels. Some studies suggest that taking these medications before breakfast can help with appetite suppression throughout the day. Although administering the medication later in the day to mimic the late afternoon peak would indeed be more in time with the described circadianity, the reduced hunger suppression being experienced right before the subsequent administration the morning after makes this timing impractical.

Oral semaglutide, indicated for diabetes, should be taken on an empty stomach upon waking up in the morning. After taking semaglutide, it is crucial to wait at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking, or taking any other oral medications. In 2023, a randomized trial investigated the effect of various dosing schedules on the PK of oral semaglutide in healthy subjects. Compared to an overnight pre-dose fast followed by a 30-minute post-dose fast (reference arm), shorter pre-dose fasting times of 2, 4, or 6 hours followed by a 30-minute post-dose fast resulted in significantly lower semaglutide exposure, as measured by the area under the curve (AUC) and peak concentration (C max) after the tenth dose. These findings indicate that while shorter pre-dose fasting times reduce semaglutide absorption, maintaining an overnight fast before dosing and at least a 30-minute fast after dosing allows for adequate drug exposure, consistent with current prescribing recommendations.

For weekly GLP-1RAs like semaglutide and dulaglutide, or on the contrary, for those with a short t 1/2 such as exenatide, the administration cannot intrinsically respect circadianity. For example, exenatide should be taken within 60 minutes before the 2 main meals of the day, at least 6 hours apart. This timing helps maximize its effect on postprandial blood glucose levels.

Ultimately, the best time to administer GLP-1RAs may vary based on individual lifestyle, meal patterns, and side effects. Patients should work closely with their healthcare provider to determine the most suitable timing for their specific situation and to ensure optimal management of obesity and diabetes (Fig. 1B).

### The chronobiology of hormone administration: "Doctor, what time should I take my medication? " [^112GxQkP]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Insulin Therapy

Since the introduction of exogenous insulins, insulin therapy has become a cornerstone in the management of diabetes, especially insulin-dependent forms, where different formulations can be used to meet patients' individual needs. These formulations include rapid-acting, short-acting, intermediate-acting, and long-acting insulins, each designed to mimic the body's natural insulin response to meals.

The timing of long-acting insulin injections depends on factors like blood glucose levels, food consumption, exercise, and the types of insulin adopted. The optimal timing for administering long-acting insulin in clinical practice remains an area of ongoing investigation. While an evening administration is commonly employed, a 2015 study by Porcellati et al directly compared the PK and PD of insulin glargine after evening vs morning subcutaneous injection in individuals with T2DM, showing that the pharmacodynamic profile of insulin glargine differed based on the timing of administration. With morning dosing, insulin activity was greater during the initial 0 to 12-hour period. Conversely, evening administration resulted in enhanced activity in the subsequent 12- to 24-hour window post-injection. However, glargine PK, plasma C-peptide levels, and overall 24-hour PD were comparable between the 2 administration time points.

These results highlight that the differences in insulin activity are driven by circadian variations in insulin sensitivity, which is typically lower during the night and early morning hours compared to the afternoon, rather than an inherent property of insulin glargine itself. This study also highlights the need to consider the role of diurnal rhythms in insulin action when optimizing basal insulin therapy in patients with T2DM. For instance, morning administration of long-acting insulin is recommended for patients who receive glucocorticoids in the morning and experience glycemic spikes in the afternoon. In summary, evening administration of long-acting insulin is recommended for patients with T2DM not taking glucocorticoids, although it is not mandatory. For optimal blood glucose management, it is important to take long-acting insulin at the same time(s) each day, whether in the morning or at another consistent time (Fig. 1B).

### Frequency of morning ketosis after overnight insulin suspension using an automated nocturnal predictive low glucose suspend system [^113AXhGa]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the effect of overnight insulin pump suspension in an automated predictive low glucose suspend system on morning blood glucose and ketone levels in an attempt to determine whether routine measurement of ketone levels is useful when a closed-loop system that suspends insulin delivery overnight is being used.

Research Design and Methods

Data from an in-home randomized trial of 45 individuals with type 1 diabetes (age range 15–45 years) were analyzed, evaluating an automated predictive low glucose pump suspension system in which blood glucose, blood ketone, and urine ketone levels were measured on 1,954 mornings.

Results

One or more pump suspensions occurred during 744 of the 977 intervention nights (76%). The morning blood ketone level was ≥ 0.6 mmol/L after 11 of the 744 nights (1.5%) during which a pump suspension occurred and 2 of the 233 nights (0.9%) during which there was no suspension compared with 11 of 977 control nights (1.1%). The morning blood ketone level was ≥ 0.6 mmol/L after only 2 of 159 nights (1.3%) with a pump suspension exceeding 2 h. Morning fasting blood glucose level was not a good predictor of the presence of blood ketones.

Conclusions

Routine measurement of blood or urine ketones during use of an automated pump suspension system using continuous glucose monitoring, whether threshold based or predictive, is not necessary. Recommendations for checking ketone levels should be no different when a patient is using a system with automated insulin suspension than it is for conventional diabetes self-management.

### Insulin therapy and dietary adjustments to normalize glycemia and prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia after evening exercise in type 1 diabetes: a randomized controlled trial [^114LGURN]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2015). Medium credibility.

In summary, this is the first study to demonstrate that exercise-induced hypoglycemia can be avoided, without exposure to hyperglycemia, when people with type 1 diabetes employ a combined basal-bolus insulin reduction and low GI carbohydrate feeding strategy. This strategy does not significantly augment ketonemia or cause other metabolic disturbances.

Results

Glycemic control was similar during the 24 h prior to each initial morning visit (CGM mean interstitial glucose: 100% 8.1 ± 0.3, 80% 8.2 ± 0.4 mmol/L; p = 0.962; and total interstitial glucose area under the curve: 100% 11 593 ± 547, 80% 12 024 ± 949 mmol/L/min; p = 0.876). During this time, no differences were observed in total energy consumed (100% 2333 ± 167, 80% 2357 ± 191 kcal; p = 0.982), with contribution from carbohydrate (100% 53 ± 3, 80% 53 ± 3%; p = 0.998), fat (p = 0.998), and protein (p = 0.991) similar. In addition, total rapid-acting insulin units administered (100% 30 ± 3, 80% 30 ± 3 IU; p = 0.922) as well as levels of activity (100% 5721 ± 96, 80% 5703 ± 101 steps; p = 0.901) were comparable.

On the morning of the trial, resting, fasted blood glucose concentrations (figure 1), and fasting serum insulin were similar between conditions (table 1). In addition, there were no differences in counter-regulatory hormone, metabolite (table 1), or inflammatory cytokines (figure 2).

### Diurnal timing of physical activity in relation to obesity and diabetes in the German national cohort (NAKO) [^116PMb5C]. International Journal of Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The primary findings of our study indicate that physical activity in the afternoon and evening is more strongly inversely associated with both obesity and diabetes compared to morning activity. In contrast, nighttime physical activity is positively related to obesity and diabetes. These associations persisted across different levels of employment status, shift work, and sleep duration. In further analyses using substitution models, replacing afternoon or evening activity with morning activity was associated with higher odds of obesity and diabetes. Since overall physical activity levels were held constant (mutual adjustment for overall levels), any increase in morning activity corresponded to a decrease in afternoon or evening activity. This suggests that although morning activity is not harmful, afternoon and evening activity provide significantly greater health benefits. This was also indicated by the non-linear continuous relationships between physical activity timing and obesity and diabetes, with steeper slopes observed for afternoon and evening activity compared to morning activity. Additional interaction analyses revealed that afternoon activity partially diminished the beneficial effects of morning activity, indicating a potential ceiling effect, where increasing both morning and afternoon activity beyond certain levels may not provide additional advantages. Further analyses also suggested that higher levels of daytime activity could offset the adverse effects of nighttime activity on diabetes but not entirely on obesity.

The biological mechanisms linking physical activity timing to metabolic health are not yet fully understood. However, exercise capacity and the associated metabolic pathways follow a diurnal rhythm, and timing plays a crucial role in enhancing the beneficial metabolic effects of exercise. Late-day exercise, in particular, is associated with peak mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism, resulting in significant metabolic benefits. Moreover, afternoon and evening physical activity improves circulating levels of blood glucose, insulin, and triglycerides more effectively than activity performed earlier in the day. In both healthy and individuals with pre-diabetes, plasma glucose clearance is more efficient in the morning compared to the evening following similar glucose intake, as insulin sensitivity decreases later in the day. Consequently, exercising in the late afternoon or evening may be particularly beneficial for improving glycemic control when insulin sensitivity is at its lowest. Exercise at this time helps counteract reduced insulin sensitivity by increasing glucose uptake in muscle through insulin-independent pathways, such as AMPK activation and contraction-induced GLUT4 translocation.

Prandial insulin dose adjustment — hyperglycemia: For pre-midday meal glucose > 110 mg/dL, increase the morning meal dose by 10% to 20%; for pre-evening glucose > 140 mg/dL, increase the midday meal dose by 10% to 20%; and for bedtime glucose > 140 mg/dL, increase the pre-evening meal dose by 10%. Fixed-dose insulin can be titrated by 2 units every 2 to 3 days relying on the morning FBG because of the presence of basal insulin.

### Thirty years of research on the dawn phenomenon: lessons to optimize blood glucose control in diabetes [^111iKmji]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Figure 2
Overnight plasma glucose and insulin concentrations in a group of T2D subjects (n = 8, age 53 ± 4 years, diabetes duration 3 ± 1 years, A1C 6.89 ± 0.05% [52 ± 0.5 mmol/mol], all on metformin only) before and after 6-month treatment with evening dose of insulin glargine (0.20 ± 0.02 U/Kg/day) as add-on to metformin. Basal insulin near-normalized the fasting BG by two mechanisms: partly by reducing the midnight BG and partly by totally abolishing the BG increase of the dawn phenomenon of the baseline study (18 mg/dL), as result of overnight sustained increase in plasma insulin concentration by ∼4 μU/mL. At the end of observation, the removal of the dawn phenomenon resulted in a decrease of A1C of 6.5 ± 0.1% (48 ± 0.7 mmol/mol). This validates the estimated contribution of the dawn phenomenon to the increased A1C calculated by Monnier et al. of 0.39% (4.3 mmol/mol) (G.B.B. unpublished data).

In summary, despite the extensive number of publications today, the dawn phenomenon remains an area of research interest and, importantly, a target for clinical modulation that should be taken into account whenever choosing treatments.

### Is prevalence of atherosclerotic risk factors increasing among young adults? It depends on how you ask [^113eF6h5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Diabetes mellitus

According to the current guidelines from the American Diabetes Association, diabetes mellitus can be clinically diagnosed by the following: (1) fasting glucose of ≥ 126 mg/dL after at least 8 hours of no caloric intake, (2) blood glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL after a 2‐hour glucose challenge of 75‐g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water, (3) hemoglobin A1C (HgA1C) ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol), or (4) clinical symptoms of hyperglycemia with a random glucose level of ≥ 200 mg/dL. 12 Although HgA1C was collected for all participants, fasting glucose and the 2‐hour glucose tolerance test results were only collected in those participants of the morning sessions. To avoid selection bias and reduction of the sample size, we chose to use only HgA1C as the clinical criterion for diagnosing diabetes mellitus. Clinical diabetes mellitus is defined by meeting any of the following 3 conditions: (1) HgA1C ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol), (2) answering yes to the question "Are you now taking insulin?", or (3) answering yes to the question "Are you now taking pills to lower your blood sugar?"

Diabetes mellitus by self‐report is defined as answering yes to any of the following 3 questions: (1) "Have you ever been told by a physician or health professional that you have diabetes mellitus or sugar diabetes mellitus?", (2) "Are you now taking insulin?", or (3) "Are you now taking diabetic pills to lower your blood sugar?"

### How people wake up is associated with previous night's sleep together with physical activity and food intake [^1155tGnZ]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

We first tested the experimental hypothesis that day-to-day fluctuations in alertness are associated with changes in sleep the night prior, physical activity across the previous day, as well as first food intake upon awakening for the analysis day in question (targeting breakfast nutritional composition and consequential blood sugar response).

The average of all initial morning alertness ratings logged by participants within the first three hours after the start of the standardised breakfast meal was used to compute a daily morning alertness score for each participant (Fig. 2c, d). This time period was defined within the experimental design, such that participants were instructed to first rate their alertness in the morning when they started their breakfast, and then to rate their alertness at several time points during the three hours following breakfast start (t = 0, +0.5, +1.5, and +2.5 hours).

Participants were further instructed to avoid any snacking and/or physical activity during that time window (see "Methods"). This ensured a null or low impact of potential confounders (snacks, physical activity) of morning alertness, as well as a high temporal causality between the predictors of interest — prior sleep, prior physical activity, same-day morning breakfast composition and consequential glucose response, and the outcome of interest: alertness. On average, participants started their breakfast at 8h12 am ± 1h24 min (Fig. 2d). The average latency between the sleep offset (estimated from the accelerometer) and breakfast start was 1h08 min ± 1h21 min.

A linear mixed-effects model was built to test the association between each aforementioned predictor and morning alertness. A detailed description of the predictors can be found in the "Methods" section. Importantly, all predictors were included in a single linear mixed model to estimate the contribution of each predictor, whilst simultaneously adjusting for all the others. All linear mixed models reported thereafter were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), zygosity, sunrise time, daylight saving time (DST) and weekend. To account for the natural between-person variability in sleep, the sleep predictors — duration, efficiency and waketime — were normalised using person-mean centering, i.e. expressed as a deviation from a person's average across the two weeks of the study. Unless otherwise specified, all p-values reported in the following paragraphs were obtained from two-tailed Wald tests.

### The effects of transition from bedtime to morning glargine administration in patients with poorly regulated type 1 diabetes mellitus: Croatian pilot study [^113vMi2A]. Diabetes Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Former studies investigating the effect time of administration in patients with T1DM demonstrated a similar reduction in HbA1c with morning and bedtime insulin glargine dosages as the present study; however, those studies showed no significant difference in the frequency or duration of hypoglycemia during the day or the night irrespective of the timing of glargine injection. In the present study, a significant reduction of HbA1c was registered at 12 weeks after initial transition, without changes in insulin doses and with lower rates of hypoglycemic episodes (especially in the morning). Decrease in pre-lunch and pre-dinner BG values and an increase in fasting glycaemia were also observed. This suggests that an improvement of overall glycemic control was achieved due to a decrease of glucose variability regardless of higher fasting BG values. Since glucose fluctuation is a well-recognized glycemic disorder next to hyperglycemia both fasting and postprandial and is held accountable for excessive glycation and generation of oxidative stress, its decrease could potentially have an important impact on development of chronic complications.

Recently, Porcellati et al. demonstrated that the pharmacodynamics of insulin glargine differs depending on time of administration. The 24-h glucose infusion rate area under the curve (AUC [0–24 h]) was similar in evening and morning studies; however, morning administered insulin activity was greater in the first 0–12 h, while with evening administration the activity was greater in the 12–24-h period following dosing in patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It was speculated that these results could reflect the impact of circadian changes in insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes (lower in the night-early morning). The question remains as to whether the same explanation could be applied to patients with T1DM in the present study. The variability of the dawn phenomenon is an individual characteristic and should be considered prior to reaching any therapeutic decisions aimed at correcting fasting hyperglycemia. Obviously, increases in bedtime doses of hypoglycemic agents may correct early morning hyperglycemia but may also be associated with undesirable nocturnal and early morning hypoglycemia as well as reactive hyperglycemia during the daytime leading to overall poor glycemic control and acute glucose fluctuations.

The present study has several limitations. The number of subjects was small and the treatment period short. It is also an observational study and thus potentially biased since study effect cannot be excluded although there was a 3-month run in period with strict self control. A large-scale, long-term randomized clinical study is required for confirmation of the present results.

### Evaluation of the regulatory effect of the pan-PPAR agonist chiglitazar on the dawn phenomenon [^116Vvog4]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a highly prevalent and complex chronic disease worldwide. With the rise of unhealthy dietary habits, sedentary lifestyles, and reduced physical activity, the incidence of diabetes has rapidly increased. According to a survey by the International Diabetes Federation, the incidence rate among young individuals in the United States has been growing at an annual rate of 7.1%. DM and its associated complications are significant contributors to human mortality. Therefore, maintaining stable and normalized blood glucose levels and preventing or reducing complications are key therapeutic goals in DM management. However, recent clinical observations have noted a marked increase in the frequency of the dawn phenomenon (DP) among diabetic patients, adding to patients' psychological burden and posing challenges for clinical blood glucose management.

The term "dawn phenomenon (DP)" was introduced over 30 years ago to describe a rise in blood glucose from the nocturnal nadir to early morning in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Later, this phenomenon was also observed in type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The presence of DP not only influences choices, dosages, and timing of oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin during the night but also complicates clinical blood glucose management, intensifying blood glucose fluctuations and raising the risk of diabetic complications. Although the exact mechanism of DP remains unclear, existing research suggests it is associated with biological clock disruption and an increase in counter-regulatory hormones.

### Evaluation of the regulatory effect of the pan-PPAR agonist chiglitazar on the dawn phenomenon [^113X2Lfu]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

This study has several limitations:
Retrospective observational design and sample size: This is a retrospective observational study with a small sample size and short observation period. The effects and duration of chiglitazar's improvement on the dawn phenomenon, as well as the potential for other adverse events, require further validation with a larger patient population and extended study duration. Current therapeutic approaches for managing the dawn phenomenon (DP) primarily focus on insulin therapy adjustments, oral glucose-lowering agents, and lifestyle modifications. Basal insulin titration and long-acting insulin analogs, such as glargine and degludec, are commonly used to suppress early morning hyperglycemia; however, they require careful dose adjustments to minimize nocturnal hypoglycemia risk. Additionally, some patients may require split-dose basal insulin regimens to better control nocturnal glucose fluctuations. Among oral antidiabetic agents, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors have been reported to reduce fasting blood glucose levels and may attenuate DP by promoting urinary glucose excretion overnight. Similarly, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors improve postprandial glucose metabolism but show inconsistent effects on DP. Metformin, due to its hepatic glucose production suppression, is sometimes used as an adjunct to mitigate DP, though its effect on nocturnal glucose regulation remains limited. Comparing chiglitazar to other PPAR agonists, pioglitazone (a PPAR-γ agonist) has demonstrated glucose-lowering effects and some impact on DP. However, pioglitazone's use is often restricted due to side effects such as weight gain and fluid retention. In contrast, chiglitazar, as a pan-PPAR agonist, activates PPAR-α, PPAR-δ, and PPAR-γ, potentially offering a broader metabolic benefit with improved insulin sensitivity and lipid regulation while reducing the dawn phenomenon intensity. Beyond pharmacologic approaches, lifestyle interventions, including meal timing adjustments, late-night carbohydrate intake modification, and structured exercise routines, have been explored as non-pharmacologic strategies to manage DP. While these methods can be beneficial, their effectiveness varies among individuals and often depends on long-term adherence. Our findings suggest that chiglitazar represents a novel therapeutic strategy for mitigating DP, potentially through a mechanism that extends beyond conventional glucose-lowering pathways. Its effects may be linked to circadian rhythm regulation, particularly through modulation of REV-ERB nuclear receptors, offering an alternative approach for patients who experience persistent morning hyperglycemia despite existing treatments. Further research is warranted to confirm its long-term efficacy and compare its effects directly with other established interventions.
Limited blood glucose measurement points: The blood glucose values of the subjects were measured at two specific time points. Although these time points are supported by some literature, the inherent variability may introduce substantial error into the study results.
Potential influence of nocturnal hypoglycemia: The potential influence of nocturnal hypoglycemia cannot be fully excluded. Although we omitted data from days with nocturnal blood glucose < 70 mg/dl, we cannot entirely rule out residual errors from this factor.
Predominantly type 2 diabetes population: The study population consisted mainly of typical type 2 diabetes patients, so extrapolating these findings to other diabetic populations may be limited by the inclusion and exclusion criteria of this study.
Hypothesized mechanisms of chiglitazar in improving the dawn phenomenon: The proposed mechanisms by which chiglitazar improves the dawn phenomenon are partly based on animal studies; further large-scale clinical trials are needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms in humans. In summary, while this study offers new clinical insights into the potential of chiglitazar in ameliorating the dawn phenomenon in diabetic patients, it has notable limitations. For patients with various diabetes types, poor blood glucose control, or even diabetic complications, a single medication may not suffice to address the dawn phenomenon. More clinical experience and individualized treatment plans are needed to develop more detailed glucose-lowering strategies.
Although our study demonstrated significant improvements in dawn phenomenon intensity, fasting blood glucose, and lipid metabolism after chiglitazar treatment, we acknowledge that the lack of a parallel placebo or control group limits the ability to definitively attribute these effects solely to chiglitazar. As a retrospective clinical study, our design does not fully exclude the possibility that other factors, such as lifestyle changes, hospitalization conditions, or natural disease progression, may have influenced the observed metabolic improvements. However, we attempted to minimize confounding variables through the following measures: (1) hospitalized treatment setting: all patients remained in the hospital throughout the study period, ensuring consistent dietary intake and treatment regimens, which reduces lifestyle-related variability. (2) Short-term observation period: the relatively short duration of the study minimizes the potential impact of natural disease progression on glucose and lipid metabolism. (3) self-controlled design: each patient effectively served as their own control, allowing for a direct comparison of pre- and post-treatment metabolic parameters. Despite these efforts, we recognize that a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design would provide stronger evidence by controlling for confounding factors and allowing direct comparisons with a placebo or standard-of-care treatment. Future studies should incorporate RCT methodologies to validate these findings and further elucidate chiglitazar's specific role in dawn phenomenon modulation.
Although our study suggests that chiglitazar may modulate the dawn phenomenon via circadian rhythm regulation, we acknowledge that no direct biomarker evidence (e.g. melatonin or cortisol levels) was included to confirm this hypothesis. The regulatory role of PPARs in circadian rhythm and glucose metabolism has been explored in previous studies, but currently, no research has specifically examined chiglitazar's impact on circadian biomarkers in diabetic patients. To better validate this hypothesis, future studies should incorporate biomarker assessments such as: 1. Melatonin and cortisol rhythms: Evaluating these key circadian hormones could provide insight into chiglitazar's effects on hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis regulation and its potential role in mitigating the dawn phenomenon. 2. Core circadian gene expression: Measuring genes such as BMAL1, CLOCK, REV-ERBα, and PER genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or adipose tissue may help establish whether chiglitazar exerts its effects through circadian transcriptional control. 3. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM): Integrating CGM data with circadian biomarker measurements could provide a comprehensive understanding of chiglitazar's effects on nocturnal glucose fluctuations and dawn phenomenon modulation. Given the current lack of direct experimental validation, we emphasize that our proposed mechanism remains hypothetical, based on existing studies linking PPAR activation to circadian control. Further well-designed clinical and mechanistic studies are needed to confirm these findings and determine whether chiglitazar's glucose-lowering effects are partially or primarily mediated by circadian regulation.
Although this study provides valuable insights into the effects of chiglitazar on the dawn phenomenon, we acknowledge that subgroup analysis based on patient characteristics (e.g. age, sex, diabetes duration, and comorbidities) was not performed due to the limited sample size. Given that metabolic responses to treatment may vary among different patient populations, future studies with larger cohorts and stratified analyses are warranted to explore potential differential efficacy of chiglitazar. Previous studies have suggested that longer diabetes duration and underlying comorbid conditions such as hypertension and dyslipidemia may influence glucose regulation and response to insulin-sensitizing therapies. Therefore, an in-depth analysis of how these factors affect chiglitazar's efficacy could provide personalized therapeutic insights. Future research should aim to incorporate subgroup analyses and assess treatment response across different patient demographics to optimize clinical decision-making.
While our study demonstrated significant improvements in fasting glucose levels and HbA1c, the precise impact of chiglitazar on insulin sensitivity and β-cell function remains unclear due to the lack of post-treatment insulin and C-peptide measurements. The HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) and HOMA-β (β-cell function index) are widely used to assess insulin resistance and pancreatic β-cell function, but these indices require both fasting glucose and fasting insulin (or C-peptide) values for accurate calculation. Due to data limitations in our study design, post-treatment insulin and C-peptide levels were not available, making it impossible to retrospectively compute HOMA-IR or HOMA-β. Nevertheless, previous studies have suggested that PPAR agonists improve insulin sensitivity through multiple mechanisms, including enhanced lipid metabolism, adipocyte differentiation, reduced inflammation, and mitochondrial function modulation. To further elucidate chiglitazar's role in glucose homeostasis, future studies should incorporate direct insulin sensitivity assessments, such as: 1. HOMA-IR and HOMA-β calculations, with fasting insulin and C-peptide measurements at multiple time points. 2. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies, which represent the gold standard for assessing insulin sensitivity. 3. Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) with insulin response curves, to provide additional insights into β-cell function dynamics. Given these limitations, we acknowledge that our study primarily focuses on glycemic control outcomes rather than the detailed mechanistic impact on insulin resistance or β-cell function. Future well-designed studies with comprehensive metabolic assessments will be necessary to further validate chiglitazar's effects on insulin sensitivity and pancreatic β-cell function.

### Exercise / physical activity in individuals with type 2 diabetes: a consensus statement from the American College of Sports Medicine [^112sBJhx]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2022). High credibility.

Exercise timing relative to meals in type 2 diabetes: Most acute exercise studies have examined effects on glycemic control at breakfast, demonstrating better management with light- or moderate-intensity aerobic exercise undertaken postprandially in individuals with T2D, but this glycemic benefit does not necessarily carry over to lunch; only one study found better glycemic management with exercise before breakfast. In a comparison of 2 wk of morning or afternoon HIIE (three times a week) training in men with T2D, afternoon sessions reduced blood glucose more than morning sessions, which actually increased glycemia, and overall, postprandial exercise provides better glucose control by attenuating acute glycemic spikes, with a longer duration (≥ 45 min) providing the most consistent benefits.

### Magnitude of the dawn phenomenon and its impact on the overall glucose exposure in type 2 diabetes: is this of concern? [^115LGB8d]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The present results, which were analyzed after a rigorous validation of glucose monitoring, indicate that in non–insulin-treated persons with type 2 diabetes, the median magnitude of the dawn glucose increase is ∼16 mg/dL and relatively stable across the groups of subjects selected either by categories of treatment or HbA 1c levels. In the population considered as a whole and in the different groups selected by treatments, the highest peak glucose value of the circadian glucose profile was observed during the postbreakfast period. This observation is in agreement with previous reports. These excessive postbreakfast glucose excursions correspond to the so-called "extended dawn phenomenon", which is characterized by the fact that the glucose tolerance is worse in the early morning than at any other time of the day. The dawn and extended dawn phenomena behave conjointly since they depend on an increase in both hepatic glucose output/neoglucogenesis and peripheral insulin resistance in the early morning period. Consequently, it is important first to assess whether the dawn phenomenon exerts a remnant effect on the glycemic profile and further to quantify this impact on the overall glucose exposure which was the main purpose of this study. The comparison of the subsets matched for the nocturnal glucose nadir and separated by the presence/absence of a dawn phenomenon showed that the differences in HbA 1c levels and mean glucose concentrations were ∼4 mmol/mol (0.4%) and 12 mg/dL, respectively. However, it should be noted that discrepancies in statistical significances were observed in the different groups. In the subjects treated with diet alone, the differences were only significant for the mean glucose concentrations and not for HbA 1c, while the reverse was observed in the patients on OHAs. Such discrepancies could be due to the reduction in sample size when participants were divided into subsets. Also, it is always difficult to extrapolate to prolonged periods of time (∼3 months for the HbA 1c) the effect of the presence or absence of the dawn phenomenon, as its assessment on 2 consecutive days is not necessarily a reflection of what happens during longer periods of time. The dawn glucose rise from nocturnal nadir to prebreakfast time is subject to large day-to-day fluctuations, supported by the fact that in the current study, the median of between-day difference in the magnitude of the dawn phenomenon is as high as 15.0 mg/dL. Therefore, averaging the dawn phenomenon on 2 consecutive days and assessing its impact on the averaged 2-day mean glucose concentrations and HbA 1c levels is an approach that was designed for attenuating its interday variability. Extending the CGM for longer periods risked the loss of both reliability of the glucose sensor and acceptance of the monitoring device by the participants. Our findings are supported by the fact that the impact of the dawn phenomenon in the overall population (12 mg/dL on the mean glucose concentration and 4 mmol/mol [i.e. 0.4% on HbA 1c]) is in broad agreement with the relationship that was previously established by Nathan et al. in the A1C-Derived Average Glucose study (i.e. any increment of 29 mg/dL in mean glucose concentration corresponds to a 1% increment in HbA 1c).

### Hypoglycemia: from the laboratory to the clinic [^113E9Z7c]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Future directions for adjunctive therapies to protect against severe hypoglycemia.

Despite its lack of universal or lasting success, avoidance of hypoglycemia remains the most proven and effective strategy for reducing an individual's risk of severe hypoglycemia. Research into improving our ability to avoid exposure to subphysiological glucose concentrations remains a top priority. Current therapeutic strategies should target avoidance of exposure to low glucose concentrations and ways of achieving this including ruling out or treating predisposing comorbidities, use of structured patient education around insulin usage and hypoglycemia avoidance as well as use of pump therapy, glucose monitoring strategies, and even for intractable problems, consideration of replacement of active islet tissue by transplantation. However, complete protection against hypoglycemia remains an elusive goal, and research continues into other nonglycemic strategies that might give further protection.

Based on an understanding of the mechanisms of glucose sensing and normal counterregulation, people are beginning to test the use of pharmacological agents to defend against severe hypoglycemia. To counteract the observed defect in catecholamine responses to hypoglycemia in those with long-standing type 1 diabetes, Cryer and colleagues examined the ability of the β2-adrenergic agonist terbutaline to diminish the risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia. The first study did reduce hypoglycemia rates but at the expense of a generalized elevation of the blood glucose through the night. More recently a lower dose has been tried that achieved a better balance, but the effects of elevating background catecholamine action will require careful further testing.

### Insulin therapy and dietary adjustments to normalize glycemia and prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia after evening exercise in type 1 diabetes: a randomized controlled trial [^116E1rgp]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2015). Medium credibility.

Within the literature, alterations to the basal component of an insulin regimen have been predominantly trialed in individuals treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy. When infusion rate is reduced or suspended for exercise, the risk of developing hypoglycemia can be reduced by up to two-thirds. However, a large proportion of patients are treated using a basal-bolus regimen with multiple daily injections (MDIs). This is a far less flexible method of insulin delivery than CSII, meaning even small changes in dose may have significant and long-lasting effects. Moreover, there is even less information for performing exercise in the evening, especially when insulin replacement is provided using MDIs. While reducing basal insulin dose could potentially prevent hypoglycemia in the hours following exercise, it is possible that heavily reducing pre-exercise and post-exercise rapid-acting insulin dose may induce periods of sustained hyperglycemia, promoting inflammation and causing other hormonal and metabolic disturbances.

This study aimed to examine the effects of reducing basal insulin dose, when employing acute prandial adjustments to rapid-acting insulin and carbohydrate feeding, on early, late-nocturnal, and next day glycemia, after evening exercise in type 1 diabetes. In addition, we aimed to assess the impact of such a strategy on the metabolic, inflammatory, and counter-regulatory hormonal responses.

### Diurnal variation in fasting plasma glucose: implications for diagnosis of diabetes in patients examined in the afternoon [^112Z6VhF]. JAMA (2000). Excellent credibility.

Context

Current diagnostic criteria for diabetes are based on plasma glucose levels in blood samples obtained in the morning after an overnight fast, with a value of 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) or more indicating diabetes. However, many patients are seen by their physicians in the afternoon. Because plasma glucose levels are higher in the morning, it is unclear whether these diagnostic criteria can be applied to patients who are tested for diabetes in the afternoon.

Objectives

To document diurnal variation in fasting plasma glucose levels in adults not known to have diabetes, and to examine the applicability to afternoon-examined patients of the current diagnostic criteria for diabetes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Analysis of data from the US population-based Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988–1994) on participants aged 20 years or older who had no previously diagnosed diabetes, who were randomly assigned to morning (n = 6483) or afternoon (n = 6399) examinations, and who fasted prior to blood sampling.

Main Outcome Measures

Fasting plasma glucose levels in morning vs afternoon-examined participants; diabetes diagnostic value for afternoon-examined participants.

Results

The morning and afternoon groups did not differ in age, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, physical activity index, glycosylated hemoglobin level, and other factors. Mean (SD) fasting plasma glucose levels were higher in the morning group (5.41 [0.01] mmol/L [97.4 ¿0.3¿ mg/dL]) than in the afternoon group (5.12 [0.02] mmol/L [92.4 ¿0.4¿ mg/dL]; P < .001). Consequently, prevalence of afternoon-examined participants with fasting plasma glucose levels of 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) or greater was half that of participants examined in the morning. The diagnostic fasting plasma glucose value for afternoon-examined participants that resulted in the same prevalence of diabetes found in morning-examined participants was 6.33 mmol/L (114 mg/dL) or greater.

Conclusions

Our results indicate that if current diabetes diagnostic criteria are applied to patients seen in the afternoon, approximately half of all cases of undiagnosed diabetes in these patients will be missed.

### Frequency of morning ketosis after overnight insulin suspension using an automated nocturnal predictive low glucose suspend system [^1166qNSD]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Probability of a morning blood ketone level ≥ 0.6 mmol/L predicted by morning blood glucose level, along with 95% pointwise confidence bands after intervention nights (A) and after control nights (B).

With respect to the association between blood and urine ketone measurements, mean (± SD) blood ketone levels were 0.11 ± 0.08, 0.23 ± 0.18, and 0.31 ± 0.25 mmol/L, respectively, on mornings where the urine ketone level was negative, trace, and small after intervention nights (P < 0.001), and 0.11 ± 0.08, 0.19 ± 0.13, and 0.39 ± 0.32 mmol/L, respectively (P < 0.001), after control nights. As seen in, 91% of 977 intervention mornings and 93% of 977 control mornings had negative or trace urine ketone levels and blood ketone levels of ≤ 0.2 mmol/L. There was only one instance after an intervention night and two instances after a control night where urine ketone levels were moderate or large and serum ketone levels were < 0.3 mmol/L.

### Value of capillary glucose profiles in assessing risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes based on continuous glucose monitoring [^111UXuo5]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Hypoglycemia frequently occurred during the nighttime in people with T1D. Low HbA1c, reduced mean blood glucose, and great fluctuation of glucose were contributory factors for nocturnal hypoglycemia. Individualized glycemic targets should be emphasized for safe control of diabetes. On the basis of capillary glucose profiles, fasting blood glucose, blood glucose at bedtime, and the BGn model were identified as potential indicators for nocturnal hypoglycemia. Our study addressed the detection and prediction of hypoglycemia during sleep in T1D, which may support further development of preventive strategies.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114TPXyY]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Basal insulin management — risk reduction and overbasalization signals — states that long-acting basal analogs (U-100 glargine and degludec or detemir) have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of level 2 hypoglycemia and nocturnal hypoglycemia compared with NPH insulin, that longer-acting basal analogs (U-300 glargine or degludec) convey a lower nocturnal hypoglycemia risk than U-100 glargine, and that an initial dose reduction is reasonable and typically needed when switching from insulin detemir or U-300 glargine to another insulin; evaluation for overbasalization should be prompted by clinical signals such as bedtime-to-morning glucose differential ≥ 50 mg/dL [≥ 2.8 mmol/L].

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management [^11438mCn]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Glycemic pathophysiology in physical activity — exercise intensity, duration, and timing influence glucose regulation and risks for hypo- or hyperglycemia in diabetes. During activity, counterregulatory hormones including glucagon, cortisol, growth hormone, and catecholamines are released, and in athletes with diabetes these may lead to hyperglycemia if carbohydrate intake and insulin dose are not adjusted. In individuals without diabetes, insulin levels in anaerobic and high-intensity exercise (> 80% of VO2 max) do not decrease as significantly as in aerobic activities. After exercise, glucose uptake remains elevated by insulin-dependent and insulin-independent processes; if exercise is prolonged, insulin-dependent mechanisms can continue up to 48 h, and exercise lasting greater than 60 min has been shown to increase peripheral insulin sensitivity for up to 48 h postexercise. The glycemic response to exercise varies by time of day with the risk for nocturnal hypoglycemia highest when exercise is completed in the evening, and in summary brief high-intensity exercise has been shown to cause hyperglycemia whereas long-duration aerobic exercise is more likely to cause hypoglycemia.

### The SNMMI procedure standard / EANM practice guideline for pediatric gastric emptying [^116RHbE2]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2025). High credibility.

Diabetes mellitus — gastric emptying study preparation and glucose thresholds: In patients with diabetes mellitus, the blood glucose level should be checked before the gastric emptying study, and if allowed by institutional policies, the patient may use their glucometer or point-of-care testing with a departmental glucometer should be performed, and this blood glucose level should be included in the study report. The patient should follow their endocrinologist's instructions to administer the correct insulin dose, the patient must not be hyperglycemic at the time of the study, and the goal is to have the fasting glucose < 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L). If the blood glucose level is > 275 mg/dL (15.3 mmol/L), the glucose should be lowered with insulin to < 275 mg/dL (15.3 mmol/L), or the exam should be postponed and rescheduled once there is improved glycemic control. Symptomatic hypoglycemia may be associated with an increase in the rate of gastric emptying, and scheduling in the early morning after typical nocturnal fasting or using an alternative schedule may work better to achieve a four-hour fast.

### Scientific advisory on nocturnal hypoglycemia in insulin-treated patients with diabetes: recommendations from Indian experts [^114bLzFW]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Insulin is one of the commonly prescribed glucose lowering agents in diabetes. Hypoglycemia is the most common complication, and severe hypoglycemia is the most serious complication of insulin therapy. Almost half of all severe hypoglycemia episodes (HEs) occur at night. However, patients are often unaware of their nocturnal hypoglycaemia (NH) risk. Additionally, both healthcare professionals and patients find it difficult to manage NH. The purpose of this expert group meeting is to improve NH awareness and provide guidance for the physicians to recognize and manage NH.

Method

The panel of experts in an e-board deliberated extensively upon the available literature and guidelines on hypoglycemia and NH discussed the consensus on definition, detection, reporting, monitoring, treatment, and optimization of therapy in NH.

Result

& Conclusion: Though there are many guidelines on the management of HEs in patients with diabetes, very few touch the topic of NH. This scientific advisory on management of NH in insulin treated patients with diabetes is formulated to address this gap in understanding regarding management of NH. The experts provide recommendations for the nocturnal window, defining NH based on blood glucose values, recognition, prevention and management of NH.

### Morning hyperglycemic excursions: a constant failure in the metabolic control of non-insulin-using patients with type 2 diabetes [^1147ZtR3]. Diabetes Care (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether, over daytime, one or several hyperglycemic excursions exist that can be general failures in the glycemic control of patients with type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

In 200 non-insulin-using patients with type 2 diabetes, diurnal plasma glucose and insulin profiles were studied. Plasma glucose concentrations were measured after an overnight fast (at 8:00 A.M. immediately before breakfast), during the postprandial period (at 11:00 A.M. and 2:00 P.M.), and during the postabsorptive period (at 5:00 P.M., extended postlunch time).

Results

In the population considered as a whole, prelunch glucose concentrations (12.0 mmol/l) were found to be significantly increased (P < 0.0001) when compared with those observed at 8:00 A.M. (8.8 mmol/l), at 2:00 P.M. (10.5 mmol/l), and at 5:00 P.M. (8.6 mmol/l). Similar significant excursions (P < 0.0001) in prelunch glucose were observed within subsets of patients selected from the following criteria: 1) body weight, 2) HbA(1c), 3) categories of treatment, and 4) residual beta-cell function. From the calculation of areas under the daytime glucose curves, the relative contributions of postprandial and fasting glucose to the total glucose increment were found to be similar.

Conclusions

High plasma glucose excursions over morning periods seem to be a permanent failure in non-insulin-using patients with type 2 diabetes, whatever the clinical (BMI), biological (HbA(1c)), therapeutic, and pathophysiological (residual beta-cell function) status. Midmorning glucose testing should be recommended for detecting such abnormalities and for correcting them with appropriate therapies.

### Magnitude of the dawn phenomenon and its impact on the overall glucose exposure in type 2 diabetes: is this of concern? [^112KfsV4]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

This study was conducted in a total of 248 persons with type 2 diabetes who were selected for final analysis after screening for eligibility among a total population of 292 subjects who underwent 3-day ambulatory CGM. Criteria of exclusion from the initial screened list of potential participants included those who had a HbA 1c level ≥ 86 mmol/mol (≥ 10%) and/or had experienced a recent illness or been treated with steroids during the 3-month period preceding the investigation. In addition, exclusion criteria from the final analysis were unexpected disruption in the glucose monitoring or insufficient number of blood glucose tests for the calibration of the CGM (four tests were required daily for this purpose). Unacceptable calibration meant an accuracy criterion with a correlation coefficient of < 0.79 (35 patients out of 292 [i.e. 12.0%]). Finally, we excluded all participants who reported at least one clinical hypoglycemic event over the test period in order to avoid any false interpretation of glucose rises in the early morning.

### How people wake up is associated with previous night's sleep together with physical activity and food intake [^112qvKYY]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Since the OGTT is a non-standard breakfast meal, and participants were asked not to consume caffeinated drinks the morning of the OGTT (see "Methods"), the inclusion of the OGTT as a breakfast meal could potentially bias the association between alertness and the standardised meals. However, additional analyses revealed that all the above effects remained similar when removing the OGTT from the analysis while leaving other standard breakfast meals within the model (Supplementary Table 3). Moreover, caffeine intake was largely absent for the majority of observations (86% null + 12% missing = 98%), suggesting that most breakfast meals were not accompanied by any caffeinated drinks. Because of this low variance, breakfast caffeine intake was not included in the model. Nevertheless, including breakfast caffeine intake did not change the significance of the other predictors, and breakfast caffeine intake by itself was not a significant predictor of morning alertness — both with and without the OGTT (p = 0.11 and p = 0.605 respectively).

The above data describe the association between the nutritional composition of the breakfast meal consumed and subsequent morning alertness. However, such data do not address the metabolic downstream consequence of that meal: the physiological glucose response to the breakfast meal. Addressing this question, and using a CGM device (see "Methods"), post-breakfast glucose levels were uniquely associated with subsequent morning alertness, such that a lower post-breakfast glycemic load (i.e. area under the curve of blood glucose in the 2 hours following the breakfast) predicted a superior subsequent alertness (p < 0.001; Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 1).

As a collective, analyses of this first component of the study demonstrate that morning alertness was significantly, and independently so, associated with the factors of (1) sleep (specifically a longer sleep duration, the offset timing of a later morning awakening and lower levels of movement during the night), (2) physical activity (increased activity on the previous day), (3) breakfast composition (high carbohydrates meal), and (4) post-breakfast blood glucose response (lower glycemic load).

### Insulin therapy in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus: a narrative review [^115JWsTZ]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Dawn Phenomenon and Insulin: Implications on Dose Timing

Patients with T1DM in general experience a modest rise in blood glucose of approximately 0.8–1.4 mmol/mol (approx. 14–25 mg/dL) in the morning hours (both before and after breakfast), an increase known as the dawn phenomenon. In some patients, the degree of this increase could be much more pronounced. Nocturnal spikes of growth hormone and/or cortisol, both with hyperglycemic effects, are the likely causes of this phenomenon, usually of higher magnitude in adolescents and young adults. CGM greatly assists in the diagnosis of dawn phenomenon. Some of the strategies to counteract this effect include adjusting the dose, type, or timing (i.e. dinnertime to bedtime) of basal insulin, changing to an earlier injection of the morning bolus insulin, or using CSII for extra insulin delivery during the early morning hours, as needed. CSII delivery is the gold standard for patients with a pronounced dawn phenomenon.

### Glycemic control is impaired in the evening in prediabetes through multiple diurnal rhythms [^116Njst1]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2014). Low credibility.

Aims

Recent studies suggest that circadian rhythms regulate glucose metabolism, weight loss, and even drug efficacy. Moreover, molecules targeted at the circadian clock show promise in treating metabolic disease. Therefore, this study set out to better characterize interactions among diurnal rhythms in prediabetes.

Methods

Ten subjects with prediabetes completed oral glucose tolerance tests at 0700h and 1900h on the same day. Lipids and hormones were also measured.

Results

Two-hour and three-hour glucose tolerances were worse in the evening by 40 ± 52mg/dl (p = 0.02) and 62 ± 46mg/dl (p = 0.001), respectively. These impairments were explained by lower insulin sensitivity (OGIS; 5.14 ± 1.02 vs. 4.74 ± 0.77mg/kg/min; p = 0.03) and 2-hour AUC insulin levels (87.4 ± 37.6 vs. 69.8 ± 40.2mU∙hr/l; p = 0.02) in the evening. Intriguingly, more insulin resistant subjects had weaker rhythms in insulin sensitivity (r = -0.66; p = 0.04) but enhanced rhythms in insulin (r = -0.67; p = 0.03) and cortisol (r = -0.78; p = 0.008) levels. Importantly, the rhythms in cortisol primarily but also insulin sensitivity drove the declines in evening glucose tolerance (r = 0.86; p = 0.002).

Conclusions

Glycemic control is dramatically impaired in the evening in people with prediabetes, particularly when the cortisol rhythm is weak, but is unrelated to the rhythm in insulin levels. Therefore, food intake at dinnertime may need to be curbed in prediabetes.

### Glycaemic impact of the pre-exercise timing of an elevated glucose target implemented using an automated insulin delivery system in adults with type 1 diabetes [^116HgrdW]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Our observations indicate that during morning MIE, average glucose levels during and after exercise were higher compared to afternoon MIE. Previous exercise studies implemented in a fasted state have also demonstrated an attenuated fall in glucose compared to afternoon exercise, likely due to lower insulin on board after prolonged fasting, a natural circadian rhythm resulting in higher counterregulatory hormone‐mediated insulin resistance, and increased fat versus carbohydrate metabolism. However, it is important to note that prandial status rather than the time of day may be the greater determinant of glycaemia, as morning postprandial MIE, and HIE, have demonstrated greater reductions in blood glucose with exercise compared with our own observations despite similar starting glucose levels, emphasising the importance of minimising bolus insulin action prior to exercise. While the current study showed no effect of intensity on glycaemic outcomes, previous studies have demonstrated that the glucose drop during exercise is modestly mitigated for vigorous versus moderate exercise (2–5 mmol/L for MIE and 2–4 mmol/L for HIE)likely due to increased counterregulatory hormone stimulation. The differences observed here could possibly be attributed to the fact that MIE and HIE sessions in the current study were not matched for total work and thus may be in part related to greater energy expenditure rather than intensity per se. Overall, these findings are in line with the available literature regarding exercise intensity, and timing of the day, as an influence on hypoglycaemia risk. Given the effects of morning exercise to mitigate dropping glucose compared to afternoon exercise and MIE, and previous studies demonstrating a moderate protective effect of HIE, those at increased risk of hypoglycaemia may be recommended to perform exercise as HIE in the morning, particularly in the fasted state prior to a meal bolus.

### Hypoglycemia [^113BaFCd]. Canadian Journal of Diabetes (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for hypoglycemia, more specifically with respect to general principles, DC 2018 guidelines recommend to consider adopting the following strategies to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes at high risk:

- avoid using pharmacotherapies associated with increased risk of recurrent or severe hypoglycemia

- provide standardized education targeting rigorous avoidance of hypoglycemia while maintaining overall glycemic control

### The loss of postprandial glycemic control precedes stepwise deterioration of fasting with worsening diabetes [^116koeVB]. Diabetes Care (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to determine whether the loss of fasting and postprandial glycemic control occurs in parallel or sequentially in the evolution of type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

In 130 type 2 diabetic patients, 24-h glucose profiles were obtained using a continuous glucose monitoring system. The individuals with type 2 diabetes were divided into five groups according to A1C levels: 1 (< 6.5%, n = 30), 2 (6.5–6.9%, n = 17), 3 (7–7.9%, n = 32), 4 (8–8.9%, n = 25), and 5 (≥ 9%, n = 26). The glucose profiles between the groups were compared. The overall glucose concentrations for the diurnal, nocturnal, and morning periods, which represent the postprandial, fasting, and the dawn phenomenon states, respectively, were also compared.

Results

Glucose concentrations increased steadily from group 1 to 5 in a stepwise manner. The initial differences in mean glucose concentrations reaching statistical significance occurred 1) between groups 1 and 2 (6.4 vs. 7.7 mmol/l, P = 0.0004) for daytime postprandial periods, followed by differences; 2) between groups 2 and 3 (7.5 vs. 9.3 mmol/l, P = 0.0003) for the morning periods (dawn phenomenon); and finally 3) between groups 3 and 4 (6.3 vs. 8.4 mmol/l, P < 0.0001) for nocturnal fasting periods.

Conclusions

The deterioration of glucose homeostasis in individuals with type 2 diabetes progressed from postprandial to fasting hyperglycemia following a three-step process. The first step related to the three diurnal postmeal periods considered as a whole, the second step occurred during the morning period, and the third and final step corresponded to sustained hyperglycemia over the nocturnal fasting periods. Such a description of the key stages in the evolution of type 2 diabetes may be of interest for implementing antidiabetes treatment.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management [^111Kdbxp]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Post-exercise nocturnal hypoglycemia risk and mitigation in type 1 diabetes include percentage-based insulin reductions and monitoring strategies. Individuals with type 1 diabetes are at risk for delayed nocturnal hypoglycemia following daytime exercise. For those with MDI, risk may be minimized through approximately 20% reduction of daily basal insulin dose, reduced prandial bolus insulin, and low glycemic index carbohydrate feeding after evening exercise. For those using CSII, basal rate reductions of approximately 20% at bedtime for 6 h after afternoon exercise may limit nocturnal hypoglycemia. Other strategies include a bedtime snack, glucose checks overnight, and/or use of CGM with alarms and automatic pump suspension.

### Nocturnal hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes: an assessment of preventive bedtime treatments [^114XPzPR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

We assessed four putative bedtime treatments in the prevention of nocturnal hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

Plasma glucose concentrations were measured every 15 min from 2200 h through 0700 h in 21 patients with type 1 diabetes (mean ± sd HbA(1C) = 7.1 ± 1.0%) on five occasions with, in random sequence, bedtime (2200 h) administration of 1) no treatment, 2) a snack, 3) the snack plus the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose, 4) an uncooked cornstarch bar, or 5) the beta(2)-adrenergic agonist terbutaline.

Results

In the absence of a bedtime treatment, 27% of the measured nocturnal plasma glucose concentrations were less than 70 mg/dl (3.9 mmol/liter) in 12 patients; 16, 6, and 1% were less than 60, less than 50, and less than 40 mg/dl (3.3, 2.8, and 2.2 mmol/liter), respectively. Neither the snack (without or with acarbose) nor cornstarch raised the mean nadir nocturnal glucose concentration or reduced the number of low glucose levels or the number of patients with low levels. Terbutaline raised the mean nadir nocturnal glucose concentration (mean ± se, 127 ± 11 vs. 75 ± 9 mg/dl; P < 0.001), eliminated glucose levels less than 50 mg/dl (P = 0.038), reduced levels less than 60 mg/dl (P = 0.005) to one, and reduced levels less than 70 mg/dl (P = 0.001) to five (four at 2215 h, one at 2230 h). However, it also raised glucose levels the following morning.

Conclusions

Nocturnal hypoglycemia is common in aggressively treated type 1 diabetes. Bedtime administration of a conventional snack or of uncooked cornstarch does not prevent it. That of terbutaline prevents nocturnal hypoglycemia but causes hyperglycemia the following morning. The efficacy of a lower dose of terbutaline remains to be determined.

### How much do I give? Dose estimation formulas for once-nightly insulin glargine and premeal insulin lispro in type 1 diabetes mellitus [^113gtv23]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the mathematical relationships between dosing factors in type 1 diabetic patients using multiple daily injections.

Methods

In this single-center, prospective study in type 1 diabetic patients, the basal continuous glucose monitoring glucose target was less than 130 mg/dL with fewer than 10% of 24-hour readings at less than 70 mg/dL. Basal glucose for the 4-hour meal periods was obtained from once-daily serial meal omissions. On an isocaloric, 50% carbohydrate, fixed diet, the insulin to carbohydrate ratio was adjusted to achieve a 2- to 4-hour postbolus glucose value within ± 20% of premeal glucose. For determining dosing formulas, the slope of the linear regression line comparing the variables of weight, total daily dose (TDD), total basal dose (TBD), insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio (ICR), and correction factor (CF) was determined.

Results

Forty-nine patients were included. Titrating insulin glargine to the morning glucose led to hypoglycemia during the rest of the day (2 PM to 4 AM). Therefore the basal glucose target was the nondawn phenomenon portion of the day. The resulting estimation formulas could be rounded to the following: TBD = 0.2 x weight (kg) | TBD = 0.33 x TDD | 90/TBD = ICR = CF/4.5.

Conclusions

Smaller insulin glargine doses to achieve control are in contrast to those much larger doses reported in clinical trials in multiple daily injection-treated type 1 diabetes in which the morning fasting glucose is the basal insulin target.

### Minimizing hypoglycemia while maintaining glycemic control in diabetes [^115emSwQ]. Diabetes (2008). Low credibility.

Benefits of long-acting insulin analogs have been modest in both types of diabetes with little if any difference in glycemic control and only slight reductions in hypoglycemia, mostly at night. The combination of both long- and short-acting insulin analogs leads to significant albeit minor reductions in both A1C and hypoglycemia in adults with type 1 diabetes.

A major difficulty in interpreting the mountain of data regarding insulin treatment is that the limitation of its delivery is just one of many factors determining glycemic control and the risk of hypoglycemia. Thus, regulatory clinical trials may underestimate the potential benefit because they rarely recruit highly motivated individuals who are expert at self-managing their diabetes and can best utilize the pharmacokinetic advantages. Regulatory trials may also favor conventional insulins because clinical experience with the newer insulins is often necessary to establish the most effective combination and timing of injection. However, because asymptomatic nocturnal hypoglycemia may contribute to the generation of hypoglycemia unawareness, such insulins should be offered to those skilled in insulin self-management who are experiencing hypoglycemic problems.

### Associations between physical activity patterns and cardiovascular events and risk factors: cross-sectional and prospective studies [^116ZW9D4]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

International guidelines recommend 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity (PA) per week to maintain good health. Research has long focused on frequency, intensity, and total amount of PA, but the optimal timing of PA remains unclear regarding general health benefits.

A few studies have focused on health and cardiometabolic effects of PA timing. A systematic review in 2020 showed no conclusive evidence favoring PA at a certain time of day for effect on adiposity markers and cardiometabolic biomarkers. Still, a recent study using accelerometer-based PA evaluation in the UK Biobank showed an association between morning PA and lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), irrespective of daily total PA. Another study on the same cohort assessed the effects of the timing of moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) on all-cause and specific mortality; the authors concluded that CVD mortality was lower in participants whose MVPA was higher at midday and in the afternoon. Indeed, timing of PA and its concordance with chronotype appear to be an important factor in CVD mortality risk, with early morning and nighttime PA being less favorable than midday activity.

In a post-hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial, Albalak et al showed an association between increased morning PA and several metabolic parameters, including body mass index (BMI). A cross-sectional analysis of a diabetic population showed sex differences, morning MVPA being associated with better cardiorespiratory fitness in males, whereas evening MVPA was associated with better cardiorespiratory fitness in females. In a Dutch cohort, insulin resistance was reduced in groups with higher afternoon and evening MVPA compared to a group with evenly distributed MVPA throughout the day. Similarly, evening PA was associated with better blood pressure outcomes in Japanese male workers, and with better health-related fitness in Finnish workers. Still, the analysis of existing data is complicated as most authors used different methods to quantify PA and its timing.

Hence, our study aimed to assess the impact of the time of day of accelerometery-assessed PA on cardiometabolic parameters (BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, blood glucose levels, lipid levels) using data from a population-based study.

### Terbutaline and the prevention of nocturnal hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes [^112DJFYR]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Bedtime administration of 5.0 mg of the beta(2)-adrenergic agonist terbutaline prevents nocturnal hypoglycemia but causes morning hyperglycemia in type 1 diabetes. We tested the hypothesis that 2.5 mg terbutaline prevents nocturnal hypoglycemia without causing morning hyperglycemia.

Research Design and Methods

This was a randomized double-blind crossover pilot study (placebo, 2.5 mg terbutaline, and 5.0 mg terbutaline) in 15 patients with type 1 diabetes.

Results

Mean ± SE nadir nocturnal plasma glucose concentrations were 87 ± 14 mg/dl following placebo, 100 ± 14 mg/dl following 2.5 mg terbutaline, and 122 ± 13 mg/dl following 5.0 mg terbutaline (P < 0.05 vs. placebo). Nadir levels were < 50 mg/dl in 5, 2, and 0 patients (P < 0.05 vs. placebo), respectively. Morning levels were 113 ± 18, 127 ± 17, and 183 ± 19 mg/dl (P < 0.02 vs. placebo), respectively.

Conclusions

Terbutaline may be shown to be effective and safe in the prevention of nocturnal hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes in a suitably powered randomized controlled trial.

### Magnitude of the dawn phenomenon and its impact on the overall glucose exposure in type 2 diabetes: is this of concern? [^111E7p22]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Clinical and laboratory data of the entire study population (n = 248) and for the three different groups selected by treatment are included in Table 1, after exclusion of the patients who did not fulfill the selection criteria. Age and BMI, but not sex ratio, were similar in all groups. The mean maximum glucose concentrations of the circadian glycemic profiles were observed after breakfast during the morning period. In all groups, the prebreakfast mean glucose concentrations (i.e. the value after the overnight fast) were significantly higher (P < 0.0001) than the nadir values observed during the nocturnal periods.

Magnitude of the dawn phenomenon

The absolute median glucose increments (∂ glucose, mg/dL) from nocturnal nadir to prebreakfast value did not statistically differ (P = 0.37) when the different groups selected by categories of treatment were compared (Table 1). Slight but not significant differences (P = 0.14) were observed across groups of subjects individualized according to their HbA 1c levels: median ∂ glucose (interquartile range) 11.0 (0–26.8 mg/dL), 19.5 (0–33.0 mg/dL), and 18.0 (0–39.5 mg/dL) according to whether the subjects had HbA 1c levels < 53 mmol/mol (< 7%; n = 111), between 53 and 62.9 mmol/mol (7–7.9%; n = 90), and ≥ 64 mmol/mol (≥ 8%; n = 47), respectively.

Impact of the dawn phenomenon on the total glucose exposure

As indicated in Table 2, when the glucose threshold of the dawn phenomenon was set at 20 mg/dL, both the HbA 1c levels and the averaged 24-h mean glucose values in the paired subsets of subjects matched for glucose nadir in the overall population (n = 136) were statistically greater (P = 0.007 and P = 0.0009, respectively) in those subjects who exhibited the dawn phenomenon compared with those who did not. The mean differences between the two paired subsets were 4.3 ± 1.3 mmol/mol for HbA 1c and 12.4 ± 2.4 mg/dL for averaged 24-h mean intracutaneous glucose concentrations. An illustration of these results is given by the differences of the mean glycemic profiles obtained in the two paired subsets of participants included in the overall population after matching for nocturnal nadirs (Fig. 2 A).

### Hypoglycemia and diabetes: a report of a workgroup of the American diabetes association and the endocrine society [^116McCs1]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Dietary intervention

Patients with diabetes need to recognize which foods contain carbohydrates and understand how the carbohydrates in their diet affect blood glucose. To avoid hypoglycemia, patients on long-acting secretagogues and fixed insulin regimens must be encouraged to follow a predictable meal plan. Patients on more flexible insulin regimens must know that prandial insulin injections should be coupled to meal times. Dissociated meal and insulin injection patterns lead to wide fluctuations in plasma glucose levels. Patients on any hypoglycemia-inducing medication should also be instructed to carry carbohydrates with them at all times to treat hypoglycemia.

The best bedtime snack to prevent overnight hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes has been investigated without clear consensus. These conflicting reports suggest that the administration of bedtime snacks may need to be individualized and be part of a comprehensive strategy (balanced diet, patient education, optimized drug regimens, and physical activity counseling) for the prevention of nocturnal hypoglycemia.

Exercise management

Physical activity increases glucose utilization, which increases the risk of hypoglycemia. The risk factors for exertional hypoglycemia include prolonged exercise duration, unaccustomed exercise intensity, and inadequate energy supply in relation to ambient insulinemia. Postexertional hypoglycemia can be prevented or minimized by careful glucose monitoring before and after exercise and taking appropriate preemptive actions. Preexercise snacks should be ingested if blood glucose values indicate falling glucose levels. Patients with diabetes should carry readily absorbable carbohydrates when embarking on exercise, including sporadic house or yard work. Because of the kinetics of rapid-acting and intermediate-acting insulin, it may be prudent to empirically adjust insulin doses on the days of planned exercise, especially in patients with well-controlled diabetes with a history of exercise-related hypoglycemia.

### Target for glycemic control: concentrating on glucose [^112DUTcc]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

A tool for choosing between insulin regimens in patients suffering from severe insulin deficiency

Insulin should be implemented as soon as oral hypoglycemic agents at maximal doses do not achieve satisfactory diabetic control. At present, there is little doubt that patients with a sustained level of A1C > 8% should be treated with insulin. Because in these patients basal hyperglycemia is preponderant over prandial hyperglycemia, insulin regimens based on basal insulin should be preferred to prandial insulin at initiation of the insulin therapy. If the target cannot be achieved, premeal boluses of rapid insulin analogs should be added, especially before the meals that result in the more pronounced glycemic excursions. The problem is slightly more complex in those patients who exhibit A1C levels between 7 and 8%. In this situation, most patients are reluctant to being treated with insulin. Furthermore, despite recent publications of more stringent recommendations, many physicians delay insulin treatment until further deterioration in A1C occurs. The new recommendations indicate that insulin treatment should be initiated as soon as A1C remains above 7%, with maximal doses of oral hypoglycemic agents combining insulin sensitizers (metformin + glitazone) with an insulin secretagogue. These recommendations are in agreement with our data, since the mean interval of time that separates the moment at which A1C levels reach 7 and 8% is ∼4 years, a duration that is not negligible in terms of risk for development or progression of diabetic complications. At present, it is recommended to start insulin with one injection of a long-acting insulin analog before dinner or at bedtime. With such a regimen, the insulin action reaches a maximum over a period corresponding to the dawn and extended dawn phenomena, i.e. over a period that covers the end of the overnight fast and the postbreakfast period. In patients with A1C ranging between 7 and 8%, plasma glucose values over this time interval are usually more elevated than at any other period of daytime. However, this group of patients can be divided into two subsets according to whether prebreakfast glucose levels were lower or greater than 126 mg/dl (7 mmol/l). Most patients (more than two-thirds) had glucose patterns with both a "dawn" and "extended dawn" phenomena (Fig. 3) and should be treated with a single injection of long-acting insulin analog before dinner or at bedtime. In less than one-third, prebreakfast glucose values remained below 126 mg/dl (Fig. 3). In this latter subgroup of patients, the dawn phenomenon was absent. Nevertheless, these patients with near-normal glycemia before breakfast experience abnormal postbreakfast excursions, which result in sustained hyperglycemia over the entire morning period. To combat this glycemic profile, which is limited to the postbreakfast period, it is probably preferable to administer a small bolus of a rapid-acting insulin analog at prebreakfast than a long-acting insulin analog before dinner or at bedtime. Continuous glucose monitoring can be a useful tool for guiding the choice between these two insulin regimens. When this type of monitoring is not available, the clinician can use, as a surrogate, the glucose values at prebreakfast and at 2-h postbreakfast times. The observation of concomitant elevation of both pre- and postbreakfast glucose suggests that the basal hyperglycemia should be controlled first and, as a consequence, that the insulin regimen should be initiated with either intermediate-acting insulin or a long-acting insulin analog. By contrast, an elevated postbreakfast level with a near-normal fasting glucose level indicates that a bolus of rapid insulin analog should be administered before breakfast to blunt the postbreakfast glucose excursions. Tailoring the insulin replacement rather than adopting standardized insulin strategies is a more logical approach to achieve satisfactory metabolic control.

### Metabolic implications of exposure to light at night: lessons from animal and human studies [^112wkMfq]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute Effects of Exposure to LAN on Human Metabolism

In an experiment in which 48 participants were exposed to a night of dim light, sleep duration was decreased without affecting salivary melatonin levels (86). In another study in 14 men, salivary cortisol levels were acutely increased by a light pulse in the morning but not in the evening (87). Similarly, in an experiment involving 17 men, exposure to light acutely increased heart rate in the morning and middle of the night but not in the evening. Furthermore, the increase in heart rate was intensity dependent in the morning but not in the evening (88). Increased heart rate during morning light exposure has been shown to likely rely on an increase in sympathetic activity (89, 90). Interestingly, morning light has also been shown to cause elevated plasma triglycerides levels in healthy men and elevated plasma glucose levels and plasma TAG levels in men with type 2 diabetes, indicating exposure to light in the morning increases energy availability (89).

A study in 17 participants found that salivary melatonin levels as well as evening preprandial plasma free‐fatty acid levels were decreased in individuals exposed to a night of bright light compared with a night of dim light. Evening postprandial plasma glucose and insulin levels were elevated in individuals exposed to a night of bright light. Basal TAG levels and basal plasma glucose and insulin levels were similar between lighting conditions (91). Another study in eight male participants also found that LAN elevated postprandial plasma insulin levels in the evening. Interestingly, plasma insulin and glucagon‐like peptide 1 levels were also elevated after a meal in the morning following LAN exposure. Postprandial glucose levels were not affected at any time point in this study. Plasma glucocorticoid levels were briefly elevated by LAN in the middle of the night. Plasma melatonin levels were decreased (92).

Results of experiments using LAN and light in the morning indicate light has an arousing effect on humans at the onset of the activity period, which is most likely mediated by the autonomic nervous system. Results of LAN exposure on plasma cortisol levels and heart rate at the beginning of the subjective night differed from results found in the morning, indicating the arousing effects of LAN are circadian‐phase dependent. Contrarily, effects of LAN on postprandial plasma glucose and insulin levels at the beginning of the subjective night and the following morning were similar, suggesting acute effects of LAN on glucose metabolism are more constant. Impairment of glucose metabolism indicates LAN might especially propose a risk to individuals that are prone to or suffer from type 2 diabetes.

### Influence of a β-glucan-enriched bedtime snack on nocturnal blood glucose levels in diabetic children [^1147AqPF]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The high prevalence of low nocturnal blood glucose levels is a major problem in the treatment of children with diabetes.

Methods

The effect of a beta-glucan-enriched bedtime snack on nocturnal blood glucose levels was examined in comparison with an equicaloric conventional snack in 38 children with diabetes during a 12-night study period.

Results

A significant influence of the type of bedtime snack on the blood glucose course until 2 AM could be observed (P < 0.05). However, there was no difference in the prevalence of nocturnal hypoglycemic blood glucose levels, which was 27% at 2 AM.

Conclusion

Silent nocturnal hypoglycemia is common in children with diabetes. The introduction of a fiber-enriched bedtime snack may flatten the blood glucose curve before midnight but cannot prevent low 2 AM blood glucose. Other therapeutic strategies that reduce the risk of asymptomatic and symptomatic nocturnal hypoglycemia would be beneficial to many children with diabetes.

### Insulin therapy and dietary adjustments to normalize glycemia and prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia after evening exercise in type 1 diabetes: a randomized controlled trial [^112J2Huk]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2015). Medium credibility.

At 60 min postexercise, participants self-administered a rapid-acting insulin dose reduced by 50% (4.0 ± 0.3 IU) into the contralateral abdominal site to the previously administered pre-exercise rapid-acting insulin injection. With this, participants consumed a carbohydrate-based postexercise meal (basmati rice, tomato-based sauce, turkey breast, and an isomaltulose orange flavored drink (10% solution); 402 ± 31 kcal) designed to elicit a low GI (GI = 37) response, providing 1.0 g carbohydrate/kg body mass, as per Campbell et al. Following this meal, participants were discharged, receiving transport home. CGM continued to capture overnight interstitial glucose under free-living conditions between evening and morning visits. At approximately 180 min following the postexercise meal (240 min postexercise), participants consumed a low GI (GI = 38) bedtime snack (Soya and linseed burgen sliced bread, and an isomaltulose orange flavored drink (10% solution); 204 ± 9 kcal), equating to ∼0.4 g carbohydrate/kg body mass, and omitting rapid-acting insulin. Participants were contacted before the bedtime snack to ensure compliance. Participants were required to replicate sleeping patterns as much as possible across trials.

On the subsequent morning (∼08:00 h), following each main trial, participants returned to the laboratory for a fasting blood sample and were given a standardized breakfast meal (sugar-coated corn flakes, peaches, semiskimmed milk; 415 ± 17 kcal) administering their usual (full/unchanged) rapid-acting insulin dose (8.0 ± 1.0 IU). Following consumption of this meal, participants were discharged from the laboratory with monitoring of interstitial glucose via CGM for a further 11 h (ie, 24 h from exercise cessation). During this time, participants continued to self-record their diet using the weighed food diaries. Basal dose over the course of this day was maintained at 100% according to each participant's usual regimen.

### Dosing of insulin glargine in the treatment of type 2 diabetes [^115cobjQ]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease characterized by insulin resistance and declining beta-cell function, often leading to a requirement for insulin therapy to maintain good glycemic control and prevent diabetes-associated complications. Adequate insulin dosing is crucial to the achievement of good glycemic control with minimal hypoglycemia, and dose titration immediately following insulin initiation is needed to ensure its success. Insulin may be initiated as an add-on therapy to oral treatment using a single evening basal insulin dose and titrating according to fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels (with an ideal target of < 5.5 mmol/L [< 100 mg/dL] to achieve glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c] < 7%).

Objective

This review investigated options for, and clinical efficacy of, titration algorithms of insulin glargine in type 2 diabetes.

Methods

Articles from peer-reviewed journals were identified through searches of MEDLINE (years: 2000–2006). Search terms included insulin glargine, titration, algorithm, and type 2 diabetes. Studies were assessed and included in this review if they provided information regarding the method of dose titration of insulin glargine used.

Results

A total of 12 studies were identified and included in this review. In the 24-week Treat-to-Target study, in which 756 patients were randomized to receive either insulin glargine or neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, once-daily using a simple titration regimen (titration of daily insulin dose by 0–2, 2, 4, or 6–8 IU if mean fasting plasma glucose over the 3 previous days was ≥ 5.6- < 6.7, ≥ 6.7- < 7.8, ≥ 7.8- < 10.0 or ≥ 10 mmol/L [≥ 100- < 120, ≥ 120- < 140, ≥ 140- < 180, or ≥ 180 mg/dL], respectively, in the absence of plasma glucose < 4.0 mmol/L [< 72 mg/dL]) more patients reached HbA1c ≤ 7% without nocturnal hypoglycemia with insulin glargine versus NPH insulin (33.2% vs 26.7%; P < 0.05). In the 24-week AT.LANTUS (A Trial comparing LANTUS Algorithms to achieve Normal blood glucose Targets in subjects with Uncontrolled blood Sugar) study, 4961 patients were randomized to receive insulin glargine with either clinic-managed (as in the Treat-to-Target study) or patient-managed dose titration (increase insulin dose by 2 IU every 3 days in the absence of blood glucose < 4.0 mmol/L [< 72 mg/dL]). Greater reductions in HbA(1c) were found with patient- versus clinic-managed titration (-1.22% vs -1.08%; P < 0.001), and fewer patients experienced hypoglycemia with clinic-managed titration (29.8% vs 33.3%; P < 0.01).

Conclusions

The results from the studies discussed in this review suggest that adequate titration of the insulin dose, either by physicians or by patients, can help patients reach treatment goals, including HbA(1c) < 7% and FBG < 5.5 mmol/L (< 100 mg/dL). The choice between algorithms may depend on clinical circumstance and a patient's willingness and ability to become more involved in management of therapy.

### Magnitude of the dawn phenomenon and its impact on the overall glucose exposure in type 2 diabetes: is this of concern? [^112jG2UD]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

The dawn phenomenon (i.e. the spontaneous glucose rise during early morning hours) was quantified by subtracting the glucose nadir from the glucose value observed just before the beginning of breakfast. Even though measurements of glucose in the interstitial fluid from CGM readings are lower than venous plasma glucose concentrations, it should be noted that in the current study, the dawn phenomenon was assessed from differences between interstitial values. The upward glycemic variation during the night was only considered a dawn phenomenon if its magnitude was above the stochastic spontaneous glucose fluctuations during the early morning period after an overnight fast. According to this remark, a threshold of 20 mg/dL was chosen because it appears more tenable than others that were previously used. This choice was based on three main principles. First, a value of 20 mg/dL approximates to the 95% CI of total intra- and interassay variability applied to a true fasting glucose concentration of 126 mg/dL. This value is comparable to those observed at prebreakfast times in the overall population and in the different groups of the current study (Table 1). Second, this value of 20 mg/dL is nearest to that recently observed for the mean magnitude of the dawn glucose rise in type 2 diabetes. Third, as indicated above and according to the calculations that were made by comparing the dawn glucose rises on study days 1 and 2, the median of interday difference was 15 mg/dL.

### Magnitude of the dawn phenomenon and its impact on the overall glucose exposure in type 2 diabetes: is this of concern? [^111bfiUJ]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

The term "dawn phenomenon" was introduced by Schmidt et al. in the early 1980s. Within a few years, it became obvious that this phenomenon corresponded to a spontaneous rise in plasma glucose and/or insulin requirements toward the end of the nocturnal period, in the absence of any intake of dietary carbohydrates. The dawn phenomenon was initially regarded as a causative factor for glucose instability, and although there are many uncertainties about its impact on overall glycemic control, these have never been adequately addressed. There are several potential reasons that can contribute to this deficiency. One of the main reasons resides in the fact that the definition is based on a dawn increment in glucose levels from the nocturnal nadir to the prebreakfast glucose value. As a consequence, the quantification of the dawn phenomenon requires accurate detection of the nocturnal nadir glucose concentration. Such determinations only became possible with the advent of continuous ambulatory interstitial glucose monitoring (CGM), which permits the calculation of the absolute differences between the nocturnal nadirs and the prebreakfast glucose values. The current study was therefore designed using CGM to revisit the dawn phenomenon, which continues to remain a subject of debate. The first objective was to gain further insight into the assessment of its magnitude in a large group of persons with type 2 diabetes, using CGM on an ambulatory basis in real-life conditions on 2 consecutive days. In addition, we set out to explore the impact of the dawn phenomenon on the overall glucose exposure that was assessed both by the HbA 1c levels and 24-h mean glucose concentrations calculated from the CGM using the average of 2 consecutive days to account for the interday fluctuations of the dawn phenomenon at an individual level. Should the current study be able to show that the presence or absence of the dawn phenomenon resulted in differences in glycemic control, this might incite health care providers to assess for and devise therapeutic strategies to avoid this phenomenon in an attempt to achieve better overall glycemic control in subjects with type 2 diabetes.

### Secretion of glucagon, GLP-1 and GIP may be affected by circadian rhythm in healthy males [^113jC4La]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, the cosinor analyses calculated peak time of both plasma levels of glucagon, GLP-1, and GIP were around 18:00 h, before dinner was served at 19:00 h. Glucose peaks much later at 23:26 h which may be due to the lower levels of the measured hormones with blood glucose lowering effects late in the evening.

Like in our study, earlier studies have shown that the release of GLP-1 and GIP are more pronounced in the morning compared with the afternoon or evening. Studies investigating night shift workers who eat during the night have also shown that the same meal eaten during the day and the night results in higher postprandial glucose concentrations during the night, which could be a result of lower circadian levels of glucagon and the incretin hormones during the night.

The lower levels of GLP-1 and GIP in the evening, could be an explanation for the often increased intake of food late in the evening. Other studies have shown that sleep deprivation increases appetite and compromise insulin sensitivity and reduced sleep quality decreases GLP-1 blood levels and fullness score in the afternoon leading to increased food intake. Furthermore, exposure of artificial light at late evening or at night which is part of our modern lifestyle affects the circadian rhythm and may thereby affect the secretion of our metabolic hormones. This support findings of altered metabolic risk in patients with a disturbed circadian rhythm.

To our knowledge, a diurnal rhythm of glucagon in controlled settings using a validated ELISA has not previously been reported. Determinants of glucagon plasma levels are complex as several factors including glucose, GLP-1 and GIP regulates glucagon secretion. Whereas GLP-1 and glucose inhibit glucagon secretion, GIP stimulates its secretion. Glucagon, GLP-1 and GIP fluctuated with the similar rhythmics although GIP had larger numerical differences compared to glucagon and GLP-1. Together, this may contribute to a circadian rhythm of glucagon in conjunction with the fact that a protein-rich meal may itself overrule any inhibitory actions of both glucose and GLP-1, since in a case of a protein-rich meal, amino acids stimulate the secretion of glucagon from the α-cell.

### Sweet dreams? – nocturnal hypoglycemia in children with type 1 diabetes [^113GzBQA]. Pediatric Diabetes (2002). Low credibility.

Hypoglycemia is an inevitable consequence of the treatment of type 1 diabetes in childhood. Nocturnal hypoglycemia is often considered as merely the submerged part of this serious complication yet there are reasons to believe that hypoglycemia occurring during sleep may be different in physiological terms. Glucose homeostasis during fasting, delayed effects of exercise and alterations in sleep physiology, itself, may not only affect the risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia but may influence the ability to correct glucose concentration as it falls, leading to episodes of hypoglycemia which are both profound and prolonged. The etiology and potential repercussions are incompletely understood and the most appropriate defense remains unclear. A greater understanding of this enigmatic phenomenon is essential before appropriate methods for hypoglycemia avoidance can be developed.

### Terbutaline and the prevention of nocturnal hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes [^111gFdbW]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Iatrogenic hypoglycemia is the limiting factor in the glycemic management of diabetes. Most episodes of hypoglycemia occur at night, specifically during sleep, in type 1 diabetes — a finding in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial that continues to be documented. Sympathoadrenal responses to hypoglycemia are reduced further during sleep, and, probably because of their markedly reduced sympathoadrenal responses, patients with type 1 diabetes are substantially less likely to be awakened by hypoglycemia than nondiabetic individuals.

Among the approaches to the prevention of nocturnal hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes, we found bedtime administration of a conventional snack, uncooked cornstarch, or an α-glucosidase inhibitor to be ineffective. In contrast, bedtime administration of the epinephrine-simulating β 2 -adrenergic agonist terbutaline in a dose of 5.0 mg prevented nocturnal hypoglycemia. However, it also caused hyperglycemia the following morning. Therefore, we used a randomized double-blind crossover design (placebo, 2.5 mg terbutaline, and 5.0 mg terbutaline) in a pilot study to test the hypothesis that bedtime administration of 2.5 mg terbutaline prevents nocturnal hypoglycemia without causing morning hypoglycemia in patients with aggressively treated type 1 diabetes.

### Dose-response between frequency of interruption of sedentary time and fasting glucose, the dawn phenomenon and night-time glucose in type 2 diabetes [^114Gb1pX]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

To explore the dose-response between frequency of interruption of sedentary time and basal glucose (fasting glucose, the dawn phenomenon and night-time glucose) in Type 2 diabetes.

Methods

In a randomized three-treatment, two-period balanced incomplete block trial, 12 people with Type 2 diabetes (age, 60.0 ± 3.2 years; BMI, 30.2 ± 1.4 kg/m 2) completed two of three conditions: sitting for 7 h interrupted every 60 min (Condition 1), 30 min (Condition 2), and 15 min (Condition 3) by 3-min light-intensity walking breaks. The activPAL3 and FreeStyle Libre were used to assess physical activity/sedentary behaviour and continuous glucose profile. Standardized meals were provided, and changes in basal glucose of the nights and early mornings before and after treatment conditions were calculated (mean ± SE).

Results

After treatment conditions, fasting glucose and duration of the dawn phenomenon were lower for Condition 3 (-1.0 ± 0.2 mmol/l, P < 0.02; -3.1 ± 1.3 h, P = 0.004) compared with Condition 1 (-0.1 ± 0.2 mmol/l; 1.9 ± 1.2 h). The magnitude of the dawn phenomenon was reduced in Condition 3 (-0.6 ± 0.4 mmol/l, P = 0.041) compared with Condition 2 (0.6 ± 0.3 mmol/l). Night-time glycaemic variability (coefficient of variation) was reduced in Condition 3 (-9.7 ± 3.9%) relative to Condition 2 (6.1 ± 4.8%, P < 0.03) and Condition 1 (2.5 ± 1.8%, P = 0.02). There was no change in night-time mean glucose.

Conclusions

Frequent interruptions of prolonged sitting with 3 min of light-intensity walking breaks every 15 min improves fasting glucose, the dawn phenomenon and night-time glycaemic variability, and this might be a simple therapeutic intervention to improve glucose control.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypoglycemia, more specifically with respect to patients with post-bariatric hypoglycemia, general principles, EASO 2017 guidelines recommend to direct treatment in the first 7–10 days after surgery toward fasting glucose values and instruct patients to test blood glucose at least BID - fast in the morning (target values: 100–120 mg/dL) and during the day (< 180 mg/dL 2 hours after a meal).

### Thirty years of research on the dawn phenomenon: lessons to optimize blood glucose control in diabetes [^113FAa9i]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Overnight plasma insulin and glucose concentrations in normal, nondiabetic subjects (data from ref.) and in three groups of intensively treated subjects with T1D that had basal insulin replaced as either NPH (n = 6, NPH three times/day, at breakfast, lunch and bedtime; dose at bedtime 0.22 ± 0.03 units/kg/day), CSII (n = 6, infusion of basal insulin as rapid-acting analog at single rate 0.7 ± 0.1 U/h), or LA-IA (n = 6, dinnertime injection of glargine 0.25 ± 0.02 units/kg/day). Despite the fact that the total daily dose of NPH was fractionated into three times a day, bedtime NPH resulted in early plasma insulin peak and later insulin waning. This increases the risk of hypoglycemia after midnight and results in hyperglycemia before breakfast (dawn phenomenon 55 mg/dL). CSII at single rate prevents early peak and later overnight waning of insulin (dawn phenomenon 17 mg/dL). With LA-IA glargine, there is no dawn phenomenon since BG decreases in the second part of night as a result of continuing subcutaneous insulin absorption at dawn (7–8 h postinjection), which tends to slightly increase plasma insulin bioavailability at this time of day (G.B.B. unpublished observations).

In T2D, identification of diurnal changes in BG goes back decades, but only quite recently fasting hyperglycemia has been attributed to a transient increase in hepatic glucose production (both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis) at dawn in the absence of compensatory insulin secretion. Monnier et al. report on the overnight (interstitial) glucose concentration (IG), as measured by continuous ambulatory IG monitoring, in three groups of 248 subjects with T2D (on diet only, on insulin sensitizers alone, or on secretagogues alone or in combination with insulin sensitizers). They observed an increase in IG from nocturnal nadir to prebreakfast values similar in the three groups (13–20 mg/dL). The prebreakfast increase in IG extended to the postbreakfast period with the highest value of day (mean values 191–208 mg/dL). Importantly, the dawn phenomenon had an impact on mean daily IG and A1C (mean increase of 0.39% [4.3 mmol/mol]), which was independent of treatment.

### Continuous glucose monitoring: impact on hypoglycemia [^112wY9rw]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2016). Low credibility.

The necessity of strict glycemic control is unquestionable. However, hypoglycemia remains a major limiting factor in achieving satisfactory glucose control, and evidence is mounting to show that hypoglycemia is not benign. Over the past decade, evidence has consistently shown that real-time continuous glucose monitoring improves glycemic control in terms of lowering glycated hemoglobin levels. However, real-time continuous glucose monitoring has not met the expectations of the diabetes community with regard to hypoglycemia prevention. The earlier trials did not demonstrate any effect on either mild or severe hypoglycemia and the effect of real-time continuous glucose monitoring on nocturnal hypoglycemia was often not reported. However, trials specifically designed to reduce hypoglycemia in patients with a high hypoglycemia risk have demonstrated a reduction in hypoglycemia, suggesting that real-time continuous glucose monitoring can prevent hypoglycemia when it is specifically used for that purpose. Moreover, the newest generation of diabetes technology currently available commercially, namely sensor-augmented pump therapy with a (predictive) low glucose suspend feature, has provided more convincing evidence for hypoglycemia prevention. This article provides an overview of the hypoglycemia outcomes of randomized controlled trials that investigate the effect of real-time continuous glucose monitoring alone or sensor-augmented pump therapy with a (predictive) low glucose suspend feature. Furthermore, several possible explanations are provided why trials have not shown a reduction in severe hypoglycemia. In addition, existing evidence is presented of real-time continuous glucose monitoring in patients with impaired awareness of hypoglycemia who have the highest risk of severe hypoglycemia.

### Feasibility of overnight closed-loop control based on hourly blood glucose measurements [^112v7V2Q]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Safe and effective closed-loop control (artificial pancreas) is the ultimate goal of insulin delivery. In this study, we examined the performance of a closed-loop control algorithm used for the overnight time period to safely achieve a narrow target range of blood glucose (BG) concentrations prior to breakfast. The primary goal was to compare the quality of algorithm control during repeated overnight experiments.

Materials and Methods

Twenty-three subjects with type 1 diabetes performed 2 overnight experiments on each of three visits at the study site, resulting in 138 overnight experiments. On the first evening, the subject's insulin therapy was applied; on the second, the insulin was delivered by an algorithm based on subcutaneous continuous glucose measurements (including meal control) until midnight. Overnight closed-loop control was applied between midnight and 6 a.m. based on hourly venous BG measurements during the first and second nights.

Results

The number of BG values within the target range (90–150 mg/dl) increased from 52.9% (219 out of 414 measurements) during the first nights to 72.2% (299 out of 414 measurements) during the second nights (p < .001, χ²-test). The occurrence of hypoglycemia interventions was reduced from 14 oral glucose interventions, the latest occurring at 2:36 a.m. during the first nights, to 1 intervention occurring at 1:02 a.m. during the second nights (p < .001, χ²-test).

Conclusions

Overnight controller performance improved when optimized initial control was given; this was suggested by the better metabolic control during the second night. Adequate controller run-in time seems to be important for achieving good overnight control. In addition, the findings demonstrate that hourly BG data are sufficient for the closed-loop control algorithm tested to achieve appropriate glycemic control.

### Evaluation of the regulatory effect of the pan-PPAR agonist chiglitazar on the dawn phenomenon [^11559D7T]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

The results of this study indicate that the novel pan-PPAR agonist chiglitazar not only improves lipid abnormalities in diabetic patients but also significantly ameliorates the dawn phenomenon. Compared with other oral hypoglycemic agents, chiglitazar demonstrates more stable and pronounced efficacy in blood glucose control, along with better safety and a lower incidence of adverse reactions. The dawn phenomenon is a common challenge in diabetes management; its presence not only imposes a psychological burden on patients but also complicates the selection, dosing, and timing of hypoglycemic agents, creating barriers in patient–provider communication and clinical management. This study's findings highlight the clear clinical benefits of chiglitazar in mitigating the dawn phenomenon, offering a new therapeutic approach and insights for future clinical practice. While our study demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in dawn phenomenon intensity following chiglitazar treatment (from 9.00 to 4.80 mg/dl, p < 0.01), the clinical significance of this reduction requires further consideration. The dawn phenomenon contributes to early morning hyperglycemia, which complicates glycemic control and often necessitates additional pharmacologic interventions, such as increased insulin doses or adjunctive glucose-lowering therapies. Even modest improvements in dawn phenomenon intensity can be beneficial, particularly in patients with unstable morning glucose levels, as they may reduce glycemic variability and potentially lower the risk of long-term diabetes-related complications. However, we acknowledge that the absolute magnitude of reduction observed in this study may not be sufficient as a standalone intervention for all patients. Future studies with larger sample sizes and extended follow-up periods are needed to determine whether this level of improvement translates into sustained clinical benefits, such as reduced insulin requirements, improved HbA1c levels, or a lower incidence of hypoglycemia. Additionally, exploring whether specific patient subgroups derive greater benefit from chiglitazar's effects on the dawn phenomenon could help refine its clinical application. While this study identified significant improvements in both lipid parameters and blood glucose levels following chiglitazar treatment, no significant correlation was observed between lipid changes and the reduction in dawn phenomenon intensity. This finding suggests that the glucose-lowering effects of chiglitazar may not be directly mediated through lipid metabolism but rather through alternative mechanisms. Chiglitazar's known effects on improving glucose and lipid metabolism have been well established in previous clinical and mechanistic studies. Given this, a detailed re-examination of these pathways in the current study would not contribute additional novelty. Instead, our findings indicate that circadian rhythm regulation and nuclear receptor interactions, particularly via REV-ERB pathways, may play a critical role in chiglitazar's ability to mitigate the dawn phenomenon. Emerging evidence suggests that PPAR activation can influence core clock genes, modulating diurnal metabolic rhythms and systemic glucose homeostasis. PPAR-α and PPAR-γ have been implicated in circadian regulation via their interactions with REV-ERB nuclear receptors, which are known to suppress BMAL1-CLOCK gene transcription and regulate hepatic glucose metabolism. These mechanisms may provide a plausible explanation for the observed improvements in dawn phenomenon intensity that were independent of lipid profile changes. Future studies with targeted molecular analyses and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) could further clarify the extent to which chiglitazar influences glucose homeostasis through circadian modulation rather than lipid regulation. Expanding this area of research may provide valuable insights into novel therapeutic strategies for addressing dawn phenomenon beyond traditional metabolic approaches.

### Effect of one week of CPAP treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea on 24-hour profiles of glucose, insulin and counter-regulatory hormones in type 2 diabetes [^116yrbyX]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Studies examining the impact of CPAP treatment on glycaemic control have yielded conflicting results, partly because of insufficient nightly CPAP use. We examined the 24-hour profiles of glucose, insulin and counter-regulatory hormones in 12 subjects with type 2 diabetes and OSA before and after 1 week of effective in-laboratory CPAP therapy over an entire 8-hour night thus ensuring optimal CPAP compliance. Blood samples were collected every 15 to 30 minutes for 24 hours under controlled conditions. The 24-hour mean glucose decreased from 153.2 ± 33.0 to 139.7 ± 24.2 mg/dL with CPAP (-13.5 ± 13.5 mg/dL; p = 0.005) without change in insulin levels. Morning fasting glucose levels decreased by 14.6 ± 3 mg/dL (P = 0.001) and the dawn phenomenon decreased by 7.8 ± 9.8 mg/dL (P = 0.019). CPAP treatment decreased norepinephrine levels while the 24-hour profiles of growth hormone and cortisol remained unchanged. In conclusion, 1 week of effective treatment of OSA over an entire 8-hour night results in a clinically significant improvement in glycaemic control via an amelioration of evening fasting glucose metabolism and a reduction in the dawn phenomenon, a late-night glucose increase that is not adequately treated by oral medications.

### The effect of evening alcohol consumption on next-morning glucose control in type 1 diabetes [^113PSmxW]. Diabetes Care (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Alcohol is associated with acute hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes. After drinking alcohol in the evening, delayed hypoglycemia has also been described, although its cause is unknown. We performed a controlled study to investigate this phenomenon.

Research Design and Methods

We admitted six men with type 1 diabetes (aged 19–51 years, HbA(1c) 7.0–10.3%) on two occasions, from 5:00 P.M. to 12:00 noon the following day. They received regular insulin injections before standardized meals, at 6:00 P.M. and 8:00 A.M., and a basal insulin infusion (0.15 mU x kg(-1) x min(-1)) from 11:00 P.M. They drank either dry white wine (0.75 g/kg alcohol) or mineral water at 9:00 P.M. over 90 min. Blood glucose, alcohol, insulin, cortisol, growth hormone, and glucagon levels were measured.

Results

Blood ethanol reached a mean (SEM) peak of 19.1 (1.2) mmol/l and was undetectable by 8:00 A.M. There were no significant differences in evening or overnight blood glucose levels between the studies. In the morning, fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels were significantly lower after consumption of wine (postprandial peak 8.9 [1.7] vs. 15 [1.5] mmol/l, P < 0.01), and from 10:00 A.M., five subjects required treatment for hypoglycemia (nadir 1.9–2.9 mmol/l). None of the subjects had hypoglycemia after consumption of water. After consumption of wine, growth hormone secretion was significantly reduced between midnight and 4:00 A.M. (area under the curve 2.1 [1.1] vs. 6.5 [2.1] microg. l(-1) x h(-1), P = 0.04). There were no differences in insulin or other hormone levels.

Conclusions

In type 1 diabetes, moderate consumption of alcohol in the evening may predispose patients to hypoglycemia after breakfast the next morning. This is associated with reduced nocturnal growth hormone secretion. Patients should be informed of this risk and advised regarding appropriate preventative measures.

### Habitual and recent sleep durations: graded and interactive risk for impaired glycemic control in a biracial population [^116EebNi]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

We examined how habitual sleep duration interacts with recent sleep (2 nights) to predict morning oral glucose tolerance test results. We hypothesized that short habitual and recent sleep durations would be additive for poor glucose control.

Methods

A biracial population of adults (n = 1559) without known diabetes and recruited from the workforce of 2 urban universities was assessed for glycated hemoglobin and underwent oral glucose tolerance testing. We used plasma 2-hour postloading (75 g) measurements. Participants answered sleep questions using 30-minute forced-choice formats. We employed multivariable logistic regression to derive odds ratios.

Results

Shorter habitual sleep duration was associated with greater odds ratios of glycated hemoglobin ≥ 6.0% increasing by 30-minute intervals beginning at < 7.0 hours and were more pronounced as durations shortened. Among participants with glycated hemoglobin < 6.0% and < 7.0 hours of habitual sleep (n = 636), abnormal glucose tolerance (2-hour oral glucose tolerance test ≥ 140 mg/dL) was significantly associated with a total sleep duration of ≤ 11 hours the 2 nights preceding oral glucose tolerance testing, but was not associated with longer sleep durations. Results were independent of age, sex, race, body mass index, smoking, history of cardiovascular disease, or use of antihypertensive or cholesterol-lowering medication. Additional analyses implied that longer-than-usual recent sleep durations were protective for abnormal oral glucose tolerance testing.

Discussion

Short habitual and recent sleep durations interact in predicting abnormal glucose on oral glucose tolerance testing. Self-reported data are sufficiently sensitive to reflect 30-minute differences in sleep between individuals. Future studies examining other aspects of sleep, such as perceived sleep quality and objectively measured sleep duration and architecture, would be necessary to confirm these findings.

Conclusions

Short sleep duration for 2 nights prior to morning oral glucose tolerance testing may elevate glucose levels, this effect being detected among individuals habitually obtaining < 7 hours sleep and obtaining ≤ 11 hours of sleep for 2 nights preceding testing.

### Insulin therapy and dietary adjustments to normalize glycemia and prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia after evening exercise in type 1 diabetes: a randomized controlled trial [^115vRA32]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2015). Medium credibility.

The interstitial glucose responses following the evening laboratory visit are presented in figure 3. There was a significant condition×time interaction (p = 0.002), and a significant time effect (p < 0.001) for interstitial glucose concentrations over the course of the postexercise period. Following discharge from the laboratory, glycemia remained similar between conditions throughout the late evening (1–5 h postexercise; 19:30–00:30 h; figure 3) with interstitial glucose typically in euglycemic ranges prior to the consumption of the bedtime snack (figure 3). Furthermore, interstitial glucose concentrations were comparable immediately before sleep (figure 3), and all participants under both conditions were protected from hypoglycemia during this time.

Figure 3
Time-course changes in interstitial glucose concentrations throughout the postlaboratory period. Data presented as mean ± SEM. Black trace = 100%, red trace = 80%. *Indicates a significant difference in interstitial glucose area under the curve between 100% and 80% (p ≤ 0.05). Vertical dashed line break indicates late-evening, nocturnal or daytime periods.

With 100%, glycemia fell at ∼6 h postexercise (01:30 h) with the first hypoglycemic episode occurring at ∼8 h postexercise, during the night. The interstitial glucose nadir (100% 2.6 ± 0.2 mmol/L) occurred at ∼8–12 h postexercise (02:45–06:45 h) and during the hours of sleep (figure 3). Conversely, glycemia was preserved throughout the night under 80% (figure 3). All participants under 80% were protected from nocturnal hypoglycemia, whereas nine participants (90%) experienced nocturnal hypoglycemia under 100% with three of those participants encountering two or more nocturnal hypoglycemic episodes. Moreover, total time spent in hypoglycemic ranges was significantly less under 80% (p < 0.001), with more time spent euglycemic (80% 397 ± 56, 100% 122 ± 28 min; p < 0.001).

### Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) | Diabetes… [^1145SjR5]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Overview Blood sugar levels change often during the day. When they drop below 70 mg/dL, this is called having low blood sugar. At this level, you need to take action to bring it back up. Low blood sugar is especially common in people with type 1 diabetes. Knowing how to spot low blood sugar is important because it can be dangerous if left untreated. Read more about what causes low blood sugar and common symptoms. Types Nighttime low blood sugar Low blood sugar can happen at any time during the day. Some people may experience low blood sugar while they sleep. Reasons this may happen include:

- Having an active day.
- Being physically active close to bedtime.
- Taking too much insulin.
- Drinking alcohol at night. Eating regular meals and not skipping them can help you avoid nighttime low blood sugar. Eating when you drink alcohol can also help. If you think you're at risk for low blood sugar overnight, have a snack before bed.

You may wake up when you have low blood sugar, but you shouldn't rely on that. A continuous glucose monitor can alert you if your blood sugar gets low while you're sleeping. Hypoglycemia unawareness You may not have any symptoms when your blood sugar is low. If you don't have symptoms, it will be harder to treat your low blood sugar early. This increases your risk of having severe lows and can be dangerous. This is more likely to happen if you:

- Have had diabetes for more than 5–10 years.
- Often have low blood sugar.
- Take certain medicines, such as beta blockers for high blood pressure. If you meet one or more of the above and you have hypoglycemia unawareness, check your blood sugar more often. Checking is especially important to do before driving or being physically active. Causes There are many reasons why you may have low blood sugar, including:

- Taking too much insulin.
- Not eating enough carbohydrates for how much insulin you take.
- Timing of when you take your insulin.
- The amount and timing of physical activity.
- Drinking alcohol.
- How much fat, protein, and fiber are in your meal.
- Hot and humid weather.
- Unexpected changes in your schedule.
- Spending time at a high altitude.
- Going through puberty.
- Having your period.

### Diabetes and shift work… [^115LqJYu]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- People who do shift work have added challenges in managing diabetes.
- Shift workers also have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
- Find out how to navigate shift work challenges to still manage diabetes. Shift work and sleep patterns Your body naturally has a circadian rhythm, which is an internal clock that helps control your sleep and digestion. Circadian rhythms are usually linked to daylight and nighttime, which helps you regulate your waking and sleeping hours. When you wake up in the morning, your body releases cortisol, a hormone that makes you feel alert and energized. In the evening, your body releases melatonin, which makes you sleepy. Your circadian rhythm also helps you release insulin, a hormone that balances your blood sugar levels. When overnight or rotating shifts disrupt your circadian rhythm, these hormones can also be disrupted.

Unbalanced cortisol and insulin levels can increase your blood sugar and cause insulin resistance. Healthy sleep is about more than just following your circadian rhythm. In addition to the timing and quality of your sleep, it also matters how much sleep you get. If you get less than 7 hours of sleep a day, you have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle tips for shift workers Eating Habits
- Try to eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner at your normal times as much as possible. Avoid large meals in the middle of the night to reduce the chance of a spike in your blood sugar.
- Grabbing convenience foods or vending machine snacks can be tempting when working overnight. Prepping your food ahead is a great way to set yourself up for success and have healthy options at any hour. Physical Activity
- Make a physical activity plan that allows you to work around your shifts and sleep. If you're unable to be active on workdays, focus on being active on your days off.
- Some people find that physical activity helps them sleep, while others find that it keeps them awake. Pay attention to how physical activity affects you so it won't interrupt your sleep. Blood Sugar Monitoring
- Monitoring your blood sugar helps you identify patterns, and timing matters. For people who work day shifts, blood sugar taken first thing in the morning will be a fasting measurement. Keep in mind this isn't always the case if you work overnight.
- Make sure you're checking your blood sugar consistently throughout your shift, especially if your job requires you to move around.
