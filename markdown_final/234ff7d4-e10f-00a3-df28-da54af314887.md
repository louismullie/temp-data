## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to estimate the sum of 711 and 497 and determine which range it falls into among the given options. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact sum. Then, I should verify the calculation with a quick mental check. Next, I will compare the result to each answer choice. Finally, I will confirm the correct option and briefly justify why the others are incorrect.

> Let me first confirm the exact arithmetic. 711 plus 497 equals 1,208, so the precise sum is 1,208.

> Wait, let me verify that mentally so I don't jump to conclusions. I can round 711 to 700 and 497 to 500, which gives 1,200, and then add back the 11 and subtract the 3 I rounded away, so 1,200 plus 11 minus 3 is 1,208, which matches the exact calculation.

> Now, I need to check which range contains 1,208. Option A is 50 to 400, which is far too low. Option B is 450 to 700, which is also too low. Option C is 750 to 1,000, which is still below 1,208. Option D is 1,050 to 1,300, and 1,208 sits squarely within that interval.

> Hold on, I should verify the boundaries to be sure. 1,208 is greater than 1,050 and less than 1,300, so it is indeed within the range specified by option D.

> Therefore, the correct answer is D. The sum 711 + 497 is between 1,050 and 1,300.

---

The sum of 711 and 497 is **1,208**, which falls between **1,050 and 1,300**. Therefore, the correct answer is **D**.

---

## Calculation

- **Exact sum**: 711 + 497 = 1,208
- **Range check**: 1,050 ≤ 1,208 ≤ 1,300

---

## Conclusion

The sum is between **1,050 and 1,300**, so the correct choice is **D**.

ADVERSE REACTIONS SECTION

Of the CELEBREX-treated patients in the pre-marketing controlled clinical trials, approximately 4,250 were patients with OA, approximately 2,100 were patients with RA, and approximately 1,050 were patients with post-surgical pain. More than 8,500 patients received a total daily dose of CELEBREX of 200 mg (100 mg twice daily or 200 mg once daily) or more, including more than 400 treated at 800 mg (400 mg twice daily). Approximately 3,900 patients received CELEBREX at these doses for 6 months or more; approximately 2,300 of these have received it for 1 year or more and 124 of these have received it for 2 years or more.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.

6.1 Pre-marketing Controlled Arthritis Trials

Table 1 lists all adverse events, regardless of causality, occurring in ≥ 2% of patients receiving CELEBREX from 12 controlled studies conducted in patients with OA or RA that included a placebo and/or a positive control group. Since these 12 trials were of different durations, and patients in the trials may not have been exposed for the same duration of time, these percentages do not capture cumulative rates of occurrence.

### Giant five-photon absorption from multidimensional core-shell halide perovskite colloidal nanocrystals [^83687b88]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Multiphoton action cross-section spectra in perovskite NCs

Figure 2a shows a summary of the excitation wavelength dependence of the slopes (that is, orders of MPA processes) for these halide perovskite NCs spanning from 675 to 2,300 nm. The slopes of PL from the NCs are around 2 in the wavelength range of 675–1,000 nm, clearly indicating 2PA. As the excitation wavelength increases to 1,050–1,500 nm, the slopes increase to around 3 — revealing a switch of the excitation mechanism to 3PA. 4PA processes (with slopes around 4) dominate as the excitation wavelength is further increased to the range of 1,550–2,000 nm. In the long wavelength range 2,050–2,300 nm, the slopes are around 5, indicating the dominance of 5PA processes. Due to the NCs' size inhomogeneity, ησ n at the wavelength boundaries contains an admixture of contributions from both the lower- and higher-order MPA process (that is, 2/3PA, 3/4PA and 4/5PA and so on). Instead of a sharp transition at the wavelength boundaries (of 1,050, 1,550 and 2,050 nm), the slope deviates from the integer value by∼20%. Figure 2b–d shows a direct comparison of the NCs' MEPL brightness (that is, ησ n) for lower orders, n = 2, 3 and 4, over the wavelength range 675–2,000 nm. Similar to ησ 5, their spectral dependences exhibit a general overall decreasing trend with increasing wavelength. Their corresponding σ n values obtained through applying the calculation equations (see Supplementary Notes for details) and employing the σ 2 values at 800 nm measured by Z -scan as a standard are given in Figure 2b–d insets. In all these cases, the core–shell MAPbBr 3 /(OA) 2 PbBr 4 NCs possess∼6–8 times larger ησ n values than the core-only MAPbBr 3 NCs. The ησ n spectra suggest that the growth of the 2D (OA) 2 PbBr 4 shell over MAPbBr 3 NCs only enhances their MPA and PLQY, while hardly changing their spectral response.

### Doping-enhanced radiative efficiency enables lasing in unpassivated GaAs nanowires [^4a1e1a6f]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

To identify the cavity modes from which lasing is observed we performed FDTD simulations (see Supplementary Note 10 and Supplementary Fig. 20). The mode with the lowest threshold gain (g th) requirement was found to be the TM01 mode, with g th = 1,050 cm −1 and Q ∼300. Plotting the spectral position of several resonant TM01 cavity modes (Fig. 4a; also determined through FDTD modelling), modes of axial order 33–35 are seen to provide a close match to the experimentally observed lasing peaks. The simulated Q factor for these modes is furthermore in good agreement with the experimentally measured FWHM.

In Fig. 4d, e, we fit the power-dependent emission behaviour of our doped NW laser with a rate equation model (dashed red line; see Supplementary Note 11, Supplementary Fig. 21 and Supplementary Table 2). A microscopic gain model was used here to describe the doped GaAs gain medium (see Supplementary Note 12, Supplementary Fig. 22 and Supplementary Table 3) while the non-radiative and radiative recombination rate constants were taken from the literature (Supplementary Note 8). The fit shown gives an ionized doping concentration of 2.0 × 10 19 cm −3, a beta factor (β) of 0.015 and g th of 1,300 cm −1. These estimates are consistent with our fits in Fig. 3, previous publicationsand threshold gain modelling, respectively.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^8e5f2482]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

Intranasal testosterone gel — FDA approved in 2014 — achieves maximum concentrations in about 40 minutes with a serum half‑life of 10‑100 minutes; the metered pump delivers 5.5 mg per actuation and the recommended dose is two pumps (one to each nostril) applied three times daily. In a 90‑day open label trial of 306 men using two actuations (11mg) three times daily, results at day 90 were available for 73 men: Sixty‑nine of 73 (90%) were within the study's specified normal range (300‑1,050 ng/dL) with a mean testosterone concentration of 421 ng/dL. Nasal delivery adverse effects included nasopharyngitis, rhinorrhea, and epistaxis occurring in 7‑10% of men.

### Massively multiplexed nucleic acid detection with cas13 [^3c515de6]. Nature (2020). Excellent credibility.

CARMEN–Cas13 is sensitive, specific, and statistically robust. CARMEN–Cas13 detects Zika sequences with attomolar sensitivity, harnessing the collateral cleavage activity, of CRISPR-Cas13 to match the sensitivity of specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking (SHERLOCK) and PCR-based assays, (Fig. 1c, Extended Data Fig. 3, Supplementary Discussion 1). Additionally, CARMEN–Cas13 benefits from the specificity of SHERLOCK; sequence-specific identification is achieved through Cas13–crRNA binding and recognition, mitigating concerns about off-target amplification that are common in other nucleic acid detection methods (Supplementary Discussion 2). Each CARMEN–Cas13 assay combines M samples and N crRNAs to perform M × N tests, with each test comprising a set of crRNA–sample droplet pair replicates (Supplementary Discussion 3). The droplet-level CARMEN–Cas13 reactions are highly reproducible, enabling 1,000 tests per standard-capacity chip (Extended Data Fig. 3, Supplementary Discussion 4).

Accurate testing of multiple samples for hundreds of microbial pathogens requires higher throughput than is offered by existing multiplexed detection systems. To enable highly multiplexed detection with high sample throughput, we developed a set of 1,050 solution-based colour codes using ratios of 4 commercially available, small-molecule fluorophores. Using the 1,050 colour codes, 99.5% of droplets can be correctly classified after permissive filtering that retains 94% of droplets (Extended Data Fig. 4, Supplementary Discussion 5). To match the throughput enabled by our 1,050 colour codes, we designed a massive-capacity chip (mChip) that allows more than 4,500 statistically replicated tests per chip (Extended Data Fig. 5). mChip reduces the reagent cost per test more than 300-fold relative to standard multiwell-plate SHERLOCK tests, while reducing pipetting steps and turnaround time (Extended Data Table 1, Supplementary Discussions 6, 7, 8).

### Optimization of b-value schemes for estimation of the diffusion coefficient and the perfusion fraction with segmented intravoxel incoherent motion model fitting [^972cca76]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

3.2 Simulations

Two b‐value schemes with eight acquisitions were compared to study the usefulness of the optimization procedure; the optimized scheme (b opt; 2 × 0, 3 × 200, 3 × 800 s/mm 2; see Table 1) was compared with b‐values linearly distributed in the available range (b lin; 1 × 0, 1 × 200, 1 × 300, 1 × 400, 1 × 500, 1 × 600, 1 × 700, 1 × 800 s/mm 2).

Table 1
Optimal number of acquisitions of each optimal b‐value for different total number of acquisitions (n tot) and the proportions for the limiting case of an infinite total number of acquisitions

Note

A set of Monte Carlo simulations with accompanying analyses was used 1) to validate the use of CRLB minimization for optimization of b‐value schemes for segmented IVIM model fitting and 2) to compare the b‐value schemes in terms of estimation variability.

The simulations were performed on a grid of 20 × 20 values of D and f linearly distributed in the ranges D ∊ [0.5 1.5] µm 2 /ms and f ∊ [0.05 0.40]. The ranges were somewhat wider than what was used in the optimization to enable study of the effect of optimization on parameter estimation error also outside the parameter ranges typically found in healthy liver. For each combination of D and f, and for each of the two b‐value schemes 20 000 data series were generated using the IVIM model (Equation 1) with Rician noise at an SNR of 15. Three sets of simulations were run with D✱ = 10, 20, or 50 µm 2 /ms to study the impact of the size of D*, i.e. the size of the signal contribution from the perfusion compartment for b > 0. The parameters D and f were estimated using the segmented fitting procedure where D was first estimated using nonlinear least squares and f was estimated from extrapolation as described in the Theory section. The estimated parameters were constrained to the ranges D ∊ [0 3] µm 2 /ms, f ∊ [0 1] and S 0 ∊ [0 2 S max], where S max is the maximum measured signal value.

### NELL-1 in the treatment of osteoporotic bone loss [^3eca7e49]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Assessments of NELL-1/integrin β1 interaction

Confirmation of NELL-1 binding to integrin β1 was performed in two methods, including thermal shift assays and computational modelling. The thermal shift assay was performed using the 7,300 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, CA). Before use, the environmentally sensitive fluorescent dye SYPRO Orange stock solution in dimethylsulphoxide (5,000 ×, Sigma) was diluted 1:125 in PBS. The samples were prepared in a 96-well plate in triplicate containing 2 μg NELL-1 and/or 1 μg integrin α3β1 (R&D Systems, 2840-A3-050) and freshly diluted SYPRO orange in PBS buffer (0.01 M, pH 7.4) with the total volume of 15 μl, and then the plate was sealed with optical quality sealing tape and centrifuged at 4,000 r.p.m. for 2 min. The fluorescent intensity was monitored as the plate was heated from 25 to 89 °C in an increment of 1 °C min −1. Second, computational modelling was performed between NELL-1 and the extracellular domain of integrin β1 based on RosettaDock. The three top-scoring models of NELL-1 to integrin β1 predicted by docking simulation are depicted in Supplementary Fig. 4.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^17ef9153]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D dosing in adults aged 50 years and older with indications for supplementation or treatment: Recommendation 11 states, "we suggest, daily, lower-dose vitamin D instead of non-daily, higher-dose vitamin D. (2 | ⊕⊕⊕◯)". The evidence base included 2 trials with 537 participants directly comparing intermittent high-dose vs daily lower-dose regimens, and an expanded review of 19 manuscripts from 15 studies involving 53 527 participants. Daily vitamin D doses ranged from 400 to 800 IU (10–20 µg), while non-daily regimens included 50 000 IU (1250 µg) every 2 weeks, 60 000–100 000 IU (1500–2500 µg) monthly, and 96 000–150 000 IU (2400–3750 µg) every 2 to 4 months. There was a trend for intermittent high-dose vitamin D to increase fracture risk (RR 1.08 [95% CI, 0.98–1.19]), with an estimated absolute effect of 5 more participants with a fracture per 1000 (1 fewer to 11 more). We did not identify evidence related to individuals younger than age 50 years.

### Infliximab for patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative colitis: an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^f0780531]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a serious inflammatory bowel disease with significant morbidity and mortality. Infliximab (IFX), a TNF-alpha antagonist, is recommended by the American Gastroenterological Association, but its clinical effectiveness and safety are based on limited studies. This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluates the efficacy and safety of IFX in moderate-to-severe active UC, providing evidence for its clinical application.

Methods

A systematic search of major English (PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library) and Chinese databases (CNKI, SinoMed, Wanfang, VIP) was conducted up to September 25, 2023, to identify RCTs comparing IFX against placebo, aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressants for moderate-to-severe UC. Pooled analyses assessed short- and long-term clinical response, clinical remission, endoscopic remission (mucosal healing), safety outcomes, and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Subgroup analyses, heterogeneity assessment, sensitivity analyses, publication bias evaluation (funnel plots), and meta-regression were performed.

Results

Twenty RCTs involving 2,350 patients (IFX: n = 1,300; controls: n = 1,050) were included. IFX demonstrated significant superior efficacy versus controls across all primary endpoints: short-term (RR = 1.38, P < 0.001) and long-term clinical response (RR = 1.52, P = 0.007); short-term (RR = 1.38, P < 0.001) and long-term clinical remission (RR = 1.52, P = 0.022); short-term (RR = 1.58, P = 0.001) and long-term endoscopic remission (RR = 1.39, P = 0.010). Adverse event rates did not differ significant between groups (RR = 1.00, P = 0.933). Meta-regression suggested geographical region as a potential source of heterogeneity for short-term clinical response.

Conclusions

IFX has a more positive effect on active UC than placebos, aminosalicylic acid preparations, steroids, or immunosuppressive drugs, but shows no superiority in terms of adverse responses.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^7fd11bb8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Recommendation 6 — general population aged 75 years and older: In the general population aged 75 years and older, we suggest empiric vitamin D supplementation because of the potential to lower the risk of mortality. Empiric vitamin D may include daily intake of fortified foods, vitamin formulations that contain vitamin D and/or daily intake of a vitamin D supplement, and for empiric supplementation, daily, lower-dose vitamin D is preferred over nondaily, higher doses. In trials informing this recommendation, vitamin D dosage ranged from 400 to 3333 IU [10 to 83 μg] daily equivalent; the estimated weighted average was approximately 900 IU (23 μg) daily, and participants in many trials were allowed to remain on routine supplements, including up to 800 IU (20 μg) of vitamin D daily.

### Growth and development of premature infants fed predominantly human milk, predominantly premature infant formula, or a combination of human milk and premature formula [^bec4fbc7]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Background

In a recent meta-analysis, human milk feeding of low birth-weight (LBW) infants was associated with a 5.2 point improvement in IQ tests. However, in the studies in this meta-analysis, feeding regimens were used (unfortified human milk, term formula) that no longer represent recommended practice.

Objective

To compare the growth, in-hospital feeding tolerance, morbidity, and development (cognitive, motor, visual, and language) of LBW infants fed different amounts of human milk until term chronologic age (CA) with those of LBW infants fed nutrient-enriched formulas from first enteral feeding.

Methods

The data in this study were collected in a previous randomized controlled trial assessing the benefit of supplementing nutrient-enriched formulas for LBW infants with arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. Infants (n = 463, birth weight, 750–1,800 g) were enrolled from nurseries located in Chile, the United Kingdom, and the United States. If human milk was fed before hospital discharge, it was fortified (3,050–3,300 kJ/L, 22–24 kcal/oz). As infants were weaned from human milk, they were fed nutrient-enriched formula with or without arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acids (3,300 kJ/L before term, 3,050 kJ/L thereafter) until 12 months CA. Formula fed infants were given nutrient-enriched formula with or without added arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acids (3,300 kJ/L to term, 3,050 kJ/L thereafter) until 12 months CA. For the purposes of this evaluation, infants were categorized into four mutually exclusive feeding groups: 1) predominantly human milk fed until term CA (PHM-T, n = 43); 2) ≥ 50% energy from human milk before hospital discharge (≥ 50% HM, n = 98); 3) < 50% of energy from human milk before hospital discharge (< 50% HM, n = 203); or 4) predominantly formula fed until term CA (PFF-T, n = 119).

Results

PFF-T infants weighed approximately 500 g more at term CA than did PHM-T infants. This absolute difference persisted until 6 months CA. PFF-T infants were also longer (1.0–1.5 cm) and had larger head circumferences (0.3–1.1 cm) than both PHM-T and ≥ 50% HM infants at term CA. There was a positive association between duration of human milk feeding and the Bayley Mental Index at 12 months CA (P = 0.032 full and P = 0.073 reduced, statistical models) after controlling for the confounding variables of home environment and maternal intelligence. Infants with chronic lung disease fed ≥ 50% HM until term CA (n = 22) had a mean Bayley Motor Index about 11 points higher at 12 months CA compared with infants PFF-T (n = 24, P = 0.033 full model).

Conclusion

Our data suggest that, despite a slower early growth rate, human milk fed LBW infants have development at least comparable to that of infants fed nutrient-enriched formula. Exploratory analysis suggests that some subgroups of human milk fed LBW infants may have enhanced development, although this needs to be confirmed in future studies.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^9b5741e3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D prevention guideline — trial design and measurement limitations: Expected greater benefit at lower baseline 25(OH)D contrasted with few randomized controlled trials in low-baseline populations, and many large trials had adequate baseline levels (eg, 25(OH)D 31 ng/mL [78 nmol/L]). Control groups were routinely exposed to vitamin D via sun and diet and many trials allowed continued supplements reflecting the DRI (eg, 600–800 IU [15–20 μg] daily for adults), which the panel notes may bias results toward the null. Most trials lacked a specific 25(OH)D eligibility threshold and were not designed or powered for subgroup analyses by baseline or achieved 25(OH)D; accordingly, the commissioned review does not include subgroup analyses by average baseline 25(OH)D. Additional constraints included insufficient duration to assess long-latency chronic disease outcomes and heterogeneity of doses and schedules, precluding specific dose recommendations (with doses summarized in technical remarks).

Aspirin dosing and bleeding risk in established coronary artery disease (CAD) indicate no added efficacy with higher doses and increased bleeding with very high doses. Across different daily doses of aspirin (50–1,500 mg vs 160–325 mg vs 75–150 mg vs < 75 mg), direct comparisons of high- vs low-dose aspirin found no significant differences, and uncertainty remains for aspirin < 75 mg versus ≥ 75 mg; indirect comparisons found no evidence that high doses (eg, ≥ 160 mg/d) are more effective than 75 to 160 mg. A 2007 systematic review identified eight prospective trials including nearly 10,000 patients taking aspirin 30 to 1,300 mg/d, in which a significant benefit of higher doses was not identified and, in most, the lowest event rates were seen in lower-dose groups. Regarding bleeding, a review including > 190,000 patients in 31 randomized controlled trials found aspirin > 200 mg associated with an ~30% increase in major bleeding compared with doses < 200 mg (P = 0.05), and nonmajor bleeding increased in patients receiving 100 to 200 mg of aspirin per day compared with < 100 mg/d; the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration found no difference in major extracranial bleed across < 75, 75–150, and 160–325 mg compared with placebo, and did not comment on > 325 mg. Taken together, these findings provide moderate-quality evidence to support the use of aspirin 75 to 100 mg/d for patients with established CAD.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^10a7a3b9]. Menopause (2021). High credibility.

Nutrition — calcium and vitamin D in postmenopausal women notes that the Institute of Medicine (IOM) proposed daily intakes of calcium for postmenopausal women were 1,000 mg to 1,200 mg, with an upper limit of 2,000 mg. Average dietary calcium intake in postmenopausal women in the United States and Canada is 700 mg to 800 mg, about one-third from dairy, so an average dairy-free diet contains up to 500 mg. Few healthy women need to take more than 500 mg to 600 mg of a calcium supplement to achieve the IOM-recommended daily intake. No serious adverse events have been observed with dietary calcium intake of less than 600 mg, and larger daily intakes are associated with gastrointestinal symptoms including bloating and constipation. In the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Calcium and Vitamin D Study the average dietary calcium intake was about 1,100 mg daily, and adding 1,000 mg of a calcium supplement daily increased the risk of kidney stones by 17%. Although a clinical trial and a meta-analysis raised the possibility that a supplement of 1,000 mg daily (total daily intake approximately 2,000 mg) is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, that association was not observed in the WHI, and a subsequent meta-analysis found that 2,000 mg to 2,500 mg per day was not associated with cardiovascular risk in healthy adults. In the absence of proof of benefit, a total daily calcium intake of more than 1,200 mg is not recommended for healthy postmenopausal women or those with osteoporosis.

Community-associated Clostridioides difficile infection (C. difficile) outcomes with systemic antibiotic exposure — burden, mortality, and hospitalizations are quantified as follows: Of estimated community-associated C. difficile infections in 2011, approximately 64% were exposed to antibiotics, representing 102,409 of 159,700 cases (95% CI, 85,056 to 119,040). In 2011, approximately 2,000 of 159,700 people with community-associated C. difficile infection died within 30 d of diagnosis (95% CI, 1,200 to 2,800), and with approximately 64% exposed to antibiotics, 1,280 deaths were due to community-associated C. difficile infection related to exposure to antibiotics (95% CI, 768 to 1,792), which represents a 0.8% mortality rate due to community-associated C. difficile infection related to exposure to antibiotics. Approximately 12.7% were admitted to hospital for community-associated C. difficile infection, representing 20,287 (95% CI, 16,878 to 23,622) of 159,700 total cases.

ChIP-sequencing

Cells were crosslinked in 1% formaldehyde at a concentration of 1 × 10 6 cells per mL for 5 min at room temperature under rotation, followed by quenching in 0.125 M glycine for 10 min. The crosslinked cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 405 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. A total of 2 × 10 6 fixed cells were lysed in 100 μl 1% SDS lysis buffer (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 5 mM EDTA, 0.2% NaN 3, 1% SDS and 3% Triton X) for 10 min on ice. The cell lysate was then diluted to 0.33% SDS (or 300 μl) with ChIP Dilution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.6, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA and 0.2% NaN 3) and resuspended several times using a syringe. The cell lysate was then divided into 150 μl aliquots and sheared on a Bioruptor Pico at high intensity for 2 × 8 cycles of 30 sec of 30 sec ON and 30 sec OFF. The sheared chromatin lysate was then centrifuged at 13 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to pellet debris. 300 µl of chromatin (2 × 10 6 cells) was diluted with 950 µl ChIP dilution buffer and 6.25 µl protease inhibitor cocktail (Diagenode) to 1,256.5 μl and then mixed without vortexing. For the ChIPs 200 µl of chromatin were mixed with 1 µg antibodies against H3K4me1 (Diagenode, pAb-194–050, Lot A1863-001D), H3K4me3 (Diagenode, pAb-003-050, Lot A5051-001P), H3K4me9 (Diagenode, pAb-193-050, Lot A1671-001P), H3K27ac (Diagenode, pAb-196-050, Lot A1723-0040), H3K27me3 (Diagenode, pAb-195-050, A1811-001P) and H3K27me3 (Diagenode, pAb-192-050, Lot A1847-001P). ChIPs were performed on IP-Star Compact Automated System (Diagenode) using the ChIP-indirect method and the Auto histone ChIP Kit (Diagenode). For the control 20 µl chromatin was diluted with 80 µl elution buffer. 4 µl of 5 M NaCl was added to chromatin. Chromatin was de-crosslinked at 65 °C overnight, followed by 1 h of RNAse A treatment (2 µl) at 60 °C and 3 h Proteinase K treatment (3 μl) at 55 °C. The DNA was then purified from the solution via phenol chloroform precipitation at −80 °C overnight. The DNA resuspended in 15 μl of nuclease free dH20. The purified DNA was quantified by Quibit. ChIP libraries were generated using Diagenode MicroPlex library preparation kits (C05010010) for Mf05 and Mf06 and NEBNext® Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (E7370S/L) for Mf07 and Mf08 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The libraries were paired-end sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform.

### Foundation models for fast, label-free detection of glioma infiltration [^41bae8e1]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

SRH imaging

All of the images in our study were acquired using intraoperative fibre-laser-based stimulated Raman scattering microscopy. The NIO Imaging System (Invenio Imaging) was used for all training and testing data collection. We have provided a detailed description of the imager and laser configuration in previous studies. In brief, a pump beam at 790 nm and a Stokes beam with a tuneable range from 1,015 nm to 1,050 nm was used to stimulate the surgical specimens. The settings allow for access to the Raman shift spectral range between 2,800 cm −1 and 3,130 cm −1. Images were acquired as 1,000 pixel-width strips with an imaging speed of 0.4 Mpx per strip. In normal imaging mode, each strip row is acquired independently in a left–right manner using a custom beam-scanning. Two image channels are acquired sequentially at 2,845 cm −1 (CH2 channel) and 2,930 cm −1 (CH3 channel) Raman wavenumber shifts. A stimulated Raman signal at 2,845 cm −1 represents the CH2 symmetric stretching mode of lipid-rich structures, such as myelinated axons. A second Raman peak at 2,930 cm −1 corresponds to protein- and nucleic acid-rich regions such as the cell nucleus and collagen. As all SRH strips are acquired through standard horizontal line scanning, low-resolution SRH images can be generated by directly downsampling SRH strip rows by a downsampling factor, such as 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 and so on. Halving the line sampling factor corresponds to a 2× imaging time savings. In fast imaging mode, single-channel images with a user-specified downsampling factor are acquired. The whole-slide SRH images are then split into 300 × 300 pixel patches without overlap using a sliding raster window over the full image. All models are trained using 16-bit, raw, greyscale SRH images. For the purposes of the study, SRH images were acquired as two-channel images (2,845 cm −1, 2,930 cm −1) for pathologist's review to determine ground truth tumour-infiltration labels.

### DNA methylation repels targeting of arabidopsis REF6 [^8e5016a6]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

ChIP-seq peaks were called using MACS2(v 2.1.1) with the "–gsize 1.19e8–keep-dup 1" option. Peaks were annotated to the gene with the closest TSS using ChIPseeker. To compare different epigenetic states of REF6-binding regions and non-REF6-binding regions that also harbor CTCTGYTY motifs, we artificially constructed 600-bp regions by sliding a window across the whole genome. The middle point of assumed 600-bp peak was set as the location of the first base of a non-binding CTCTCYTY motif and extended 300 bp in the both 5′ and 3′ directions. Deeptools2was used to create profile plots and heatmaps to display the occupancy signal over sets of genomic regions. MAnormwas used to normalize mapped read counts for regions of interest (merged ChIP-seq-enriched regions) and identify differential regions, using a fold change threshold of 4 and P -value threshold of 0.0001. Scatterplots of two normalized read counts and Pearson correlation coefficients were generated using R. To explore chromatin state surrounding the REF6-binding sites, we defined the heterochromatin regions (Chr1:12,500,000–17,050,000, Chr2:2,300,000–6,300,000, Chr3: 12,800,000–14,800,000, Chr4: 1,620,000–2,280,000; 2,780,000–5,804,000, Chr5: 10,680,000–14,000,000) across chromosomes by considering both H3K9me2 read densityand TE size.

### Efficacy and safety of a new topical testosterone replacement gel therapy for the treatment of male hypogonadism [^d5c2e745]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Testosterone replacement therapy is indicated for male hypogonadism. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of testosterone gel 2% (Tgel) over 90 days.

Methods

This phase 3, open-label, noncomparator study was conducted in adult hypogonadal men (2 consecutive fasting serum testosterone values < 300 ng/dL and > 86% subjects with symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency). Subjects applied Tgel 23 mg/day (single pump-actuation using a hands-free cap applicator). The dose was uptitrated to 46 mg/day after 2 weeks if the 4-hour serum total testosterone level was < 500 ng/dL. The dose could be further up- or downtitrated to 23, 46, and 69 mg on Days 21, 42, and 63. The primary endpoint included the percentage of subjects with average testosterone concentration (C ave (0–24)) between 300 and 1,050 ng/dL on Day 90. Safety endpoints were adverse events (AEs), laboratory parameters, and vital signs.

Results

Of the 159 who enrolled, 139 men completed the study. Approximately three-quarters (76.1%) of subjects met C ave criteria on Day 90. Most AEs were mild to moderate. There were 5 serious AEs, and 1 (myocardial infarction) was judged as possibly related to Tgel. Confirmed excessive increases in prostate-specific antigen or hematocrit levels were rare. Tgel had a favorable local skin tolerability profile.

Conclusion

Overall, 76% of subjects achieved C ave between 300 and 1,050 ng/dL with Tgel. Symptoms of testosterone deficiency improved with few safety concerns.

### In situ observation of step-edge in-plane growth of graphene in a STEM [^4f15d961]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Methods

Graphene synthesis and transfer

SC-BLG were grown by the ambient pressure CVD of methane (99.99%) on polycrystalline Cu foil. Before growth, the Cu foil was soaked in acetic acid for 30 min to remove the surface oxides. The Cu foil was then mounted in the CVD chamber and the furnace was ramped up to 1,050 °C over 40 min, with constant flow of Ar (300 s.c.c.m.) and H 2 (10 s.c.c.m.). After reaching 1,050 °C, the sample was annealed for 90 min without changing the gas flow. For graphene growth, methane (80 p.p.m.) was mixed with the flows of Ar (300 s.c.c.m.) and H 2 (15 s.c.c.m.). H 2 was fed into the reaction chamber for ~7 min to form bilayer graphene. After the growth, the Cu foil was moved to the cooling zone.

For the transfer process, the as-grown graphene sheet on Cu foil was first spin coated with a layer of polycarbonate, followed by etching in HCl aqueous solution to remove the Cu foil. The polycarbonate film and the attached graphene flakes were then transferred onto a Mo-quantifoil grid for TEM observations. EDS analyses demonstrate that there is no Cu left.

STEM and EELS observations

ADF imaging and EELS analysis were performed on a JEOL 2100F with a cold field-emission gun and an aberration corrector (the DELTA-corrector) operating at 60 kV. A Gatan GIF Quantum was used for the EELS chemical analyses. Typically, a 0.11-nm resolution was achieved for the STEM ADF imaging. The inner and outer collection angles for the ADF image (β 1 and β 2) were 58 and 129–140 mrad, respectively. The beam current was about 15 pA for the ADF imaging and EELS chemical analyses. The images shown in this paper are taken at high temperature (from 500 to 650 °C), while the experiments have been performed at a wider range of temperatures (from 300 to 1,000 K). Scan rate is 38 μs per pixel for faster scan and 58 μs for atomic resolution image. The images are filtered by a commercial software named HREM-Filters Pro. Vacuum conditions for different residual gas pressures were obtained by switching the trap pump on/off and by controlling the evacuation time.

### Genetic bases of resistance to the rice hoja blanca disease deciphered by a quantitative trait locus approach [^a11bf536]. G3 (2023). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Plant materials

Four O. sativa ssp. indica accessions were selected amongst the most resistant materials identified in: WAS 208-B-B-5-1-1-3 (IRGC 121855) thereafter abbreviated as WAS 208, Badkalamkati (IRGC 45011) (abb. Badka), PTB 25 (IRGC 6386), and Fedearroz 2000 (IRGC 124388) (abb. FD 2000). The main selection criteria were (1) the selected sources should show consistent and high resistance to RHB and (2) they should cover the genetic diversity spectrum of the indica cluster. Then, the 4 resistance sources were crossed with the highly susceptible japonica line Bluebonnet 50 (IRGC 121874) (abb. BBT 50), using BBT 50 as the male parent. Candidate F1 hybrids were checked for self-pollination of the mother plant with 48 SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) markers distributed along the rice genome. F2 (S1) populations were derived from self-pollination of the verified F1 hybrids. Each F2 plant was self-pollinated to produce F3 (S2) families. All panicles involved in crosses or self-pollination were bagged to avoid out-crossing.

Population sizes

The following population sizes were used for both genotyping in F2 plants and trait scoring in F3 families: WAS 208 × BBT 50: 104 F2, 1,040 F3 (ALA), 6,240 F3 (incidence); Badka × BBT 50: 105 F2, 1,050 F3 (ALA), 6,300 F3 (incidence); PTB 25 × BBT 50: 108 F2, 1,080 F3 (ALA), 6,480 F3 (incidence); and FD 2000 × BBT 50: 105 F2, 1,050 F3 (ALA), 6,300 F3 (incidence). Population sizes for ALA scoring are significantly lower than for incidence; however, as ALA is assessed using tube-based phenotyping (non-choice feeding test), precision is higher than for incidence measured in trays.

CB213 cross-species target affinities

A FortéBio OCTET instrument was used to study the interaction between CB213 with human (R&D Systems 2319-L3) and recombinant cynomolgus monkey LAG3-Fc tagged proteins (R&D System, 8578-PD-050) and similarly for recombinant human and cynomolgus monkey Fc-tagged PD1 (R&D Systems: 1086-PD, 8578-PD-050), and for albumin from human (Sigma Aldrich A3782), cynomolgus monkey (Abcam ab184894) and mouse (Sigma Aldrich A3559). Murine his-tagged LAG3 (Acro Biosystems LA3-M52H5) and recombinant mouse-PD1-human-Fc chimaera (R&D Systems, 1021-PD-100) proteins were also assessed, as was IgG from human serum (Sigma Aldrich I2511).

Targets in sodium acetate pH 6.0 were coupled to AR2G biosensors by amine coupling using the amine reagent coupling kit (2nd generation, FortéBio). Binding was then analysed against CB213 at a range of predetermined concentrations (7-point 2-fold dilution series in 1× dPBS + 0.02% Tween + 0.1% BSA, with a top concentration of 250 nM) with an association phase of 200 seconds and a dissociation phase of 300 seconds. The kinetics and affinities of the binding interactions were modelled using a 1:1 binding model and calculated using the FortéBio Analysis Software version 8.1 or above.

### Outcome comparison of 600-and 300-mg loading doses of clopidogrel in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: results from the ARMYDA-6 MI (antiplatelet therapy for reduction of MYocardial damage during angioplasty-myocardial infarction) randomized study [^a7d9f91d]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to compare 600- and 300-mg clopidogrel loading doses in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Background

Given the high thrombotic risk of patients with STEMI, greater platelet inhibition may improve outcome in those patients receiving percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Although observational data suggest that pretreatment with a 600-mg clopidogrel loading dose may be more effective than the 300-mg regimen in primary PCI, this hypothesis has never been tested in a randomized study.

Methods

A total of 201 patients undergoing primary PCI for STEMI randomly received a 600-mg (n = 103) or 300-mg (n = 98) clopidogrel loading dose before the procedure. The primary endpoint was the evaluation of the infarct size, defined as the area under the curve of cardiac markers.

Results

Infarct size was significantly lower in the high-dose regimen: median creatine kinase-myocardial band 2,070 ng/ml (interquartile range [IQR]: 815 to 2,847 ng/ml) versus 3,049 ng/ml (IQR: 1,050 to 7,031 ng/ml) in the 300-mg group, p = 0.0001; troponin-I 255 ng/ml (IQR: 130 to 461 ng/ml) versus 380 ng/ml (IQR: 134 to 1,406 ng/ml), p < 0.0001. In the 600-mg arm, Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow grade < 3 after PCI was less frequent (5.8% vs. 16.3%, p = 0.031), left ventricular ejection fraction at discharge was improved (52.1 ± 9.5% vs. 48.8 ± 11.3%, p = 0.026), 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events were fewer (5.8% vs. 15%, p = 0.049), and bleeding/entry site complications were not increased (secondary endpoints).

Conclusions

In STEMI patients, pre-treatment with a 600-mg clopidogrel loading dose before primary PCI was associated with a reduction of the infarct size compared with a 300-mg loading dose, as well as with improvement of angiographic results, residual cardiac function, and 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events; further studies are warranted to evaluate impact of such strategy on survival.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^a16bcc93]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Randomized trials — all-cause mortality with vitamin D supplementation: All-cause mortality was reported in 13 RCTs (81 695 participants); estimated daily vitamin D dosage varied between 400 IU (10 μg) and 4800 IU (120 μg), with a median of 2000 IU (50 μg), and most trials allowed supplemental vitamin D between 400 to 800 IU/d. The RR for mortality was 1.07 (95% CI, 0.95–1.20), translating to 2 more per 1000 (2 fewer to 6 more). Mortality risk appeared lower with calcium co-administration (RR 0.90 [95% CI, 0.79–1.01]) than with vitamin D alone (RR 1.12 [95% CI, 1.01–1.24]) (P for heterogeneity = .021), and higher with high dosages (RR 1.22 [95% CI, 1.06–1.39]) compared with standard dosages (RR 0.95 [95% CI, 0.86–1.04]) (P for heterogeneity = .003).

### Effect of testosterone solution 2% on testosterone concentration, sex drive and energy in hypogonadal men: results of a placebo controlled study [^ad33926c]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

We determined the effect of testosterone solution 2% on total testosterone level and the 2 symptoms of hypogonadism, sex drive and energy level.

Materials and Methods

This was a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo controlled, 16-week study to compare the effect of testosterone and placebo on the proportion of men with a testosterone level within the normal range (300 to 1,050 ng/dl) upon treatment completion. We also assessed the impact of testosterone on sex drive and energy level measured using SAID (Sexual Arousal, Interest and Drive scale) and HED (Hypogonadism Energy Diary), respectively. A total of 715 males 18 years old or older with total testosterone less than 300 ng/dl and at least 1 symptom of testosterone deficiency (decreased energy and/or decreased sexual drive) were randomized to 60 mg topical testosterone solution 2% or placebo once daily.

Results

Of study completers 73% in the testosterone vs 15% in the placebo group had a testosterone level within the normal range at study end point (p < 0.001). Participants assigned to testosterone showed greater baseline to end point improvement in SAID scores (low sex drive subset p < 0.001 vs placebo) and HED scores (low energy subset p = 0.02 vs placebo, not significant at prespecified p < 0.01). No major adverse cardiovascular or venous thrombotic events were reported in the testosterone group. The incidence of increased hematocrit was higher with testosterone vs placebo (p = 0.04).

Conclusions

Once daily testosterone solution 2% for 12 weeks was efficacious in restoring normal testosterone levels and improving sexual drive in hypogonadal men. Improvement was also seen in energy levels on HED though not at the prespecified p < 0.01. No new safety signals were identified.

### Vitamin D toxicity, policy, and science [^7ce57bff]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2007). Low credibility.

The serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration that is the threshold for vitamin D toxicity has not been established. Hypercalcemia is the hazard criterion for vitamin D. Past policy of the Institute of Medicine has set the tolerable upper intake level (UL) for vitamin D at 50 mug (2000 IU)/d, defining this as "the highest level of daily nutrient intake that is likely to pose no risks of adverse health effects to almost all individuals in the general population". However, because sunshine can provide an adult with vitamin D in an amount equivalent to daily oral consumption of 250 mug (10,000 IU)/d, this is intuitively a safe dose. The incremental consumption of 1 mug (40 IU)/day of vitamin D(3) raises serum 25(OH)D by approximately 1 nM (0.4 ng/ml). Therefore, if sun-deprived adults are to maintain serum 25(OH)D concentrations > 75 nM (30 ng/ml), they will require an intake of more than the UL for vitamin D. The mechanisms that limit vitamin D safety are the capacity of circulating vitamin D-binding protein and the ability to suppress 25(OH)D-1-alpha-hydroxylase. Vitamin D causes hypercalcemia when the "free" concentration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is inappropriately high. This displacement of 1,25(OH)(2)D becomes excessive as plasma 25(OH)D concentrations become higher than at least 600 nM (240 ng/ml). Plasma concentrations of unmetabolized vitamin D during the first days after an acute, large dose of vitamin D can reach the micromolar range and cause acute symptoms. The clinical trial evidence shows that a prolonged intake of 250 mug (10,000 IU)/d of vitamin D(3) is likely to pose no risk of adverse effects in almost all individuals in the general population; this meets the criteria for a tolerable upper intake level.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with seizures [^2a2b5704]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Emergency department seizures — phenytoin dosing and serum levels across studies are summarized as follows: In Wilder et al, 15 patients received "1,000 mg in divided doses (400 mg, 300 mg, 300 mg) at 2 h intervals", and "5 (33%) of 15 patients and 10 (66%) of 15 patients had a serum level ≥ 10 within 8 h and 24 h of the first dose, respectively". In Buchanan et al, steady state occurred at "7–8 d" with "5 (20%) of 24 patients" achieving "a serum level ≥ 10 mg/L at that time". In Gugler et al, after oral 300 mg for "14 d", "no patient on 300 mg orally for 14 d reached a serum level > 10 mg/L". In Svensmark et al, oral maintenance "200–700 mg/d" or IV "300–700 mg/d" led to "6–9 d to reach a level of 10 mg/L", and "18 h" for oral levels to match IV levels post-dose. In Earnest et al, loading "500–1,500 mg" yielded "200 (100%) of 200 patients" with a "serum phenytoin level ≥ 10 mg/L", with adverse events of "29 (15%)" local irritation, "3 (2%)" bradycardia, and "4 (2%)" dysrhythmias. In Cranford et al, IV phenytoin "(15–18 mg/kg)" and fixed "1,000 mg" produced a "2 h-level ≥ 10 mg/L", while "18 mg/kg" resulted in "almost all" with " ≥ 10 mg/L at 24 h"; seizures were controlled in "80%", in "~40%" with anoxic/metabolic disturbances, and "46%" developed hypotension. In Shaner et al, among "36 consecutive ED patients in status epilepticus", response latency was "shorter for patients receiving phenobarbital" with "similar complication rates".

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^8772bee3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Intermittent high-dose vitamin D — respiratory infections and renal safety outcomes: For participants with respiratory infections as the unit of analysis, there were no differences for vitamin D vs placebo (OR 1.00 [95% CI, 0.98–1.03]), and for number of infections the IRR was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.88–1.03) with intermittent, high-dose vitamin D. Nephrolithiasis reported with 50 000 to 100 000 IU (1250–2500 μg) every 2 to 4 weeks showed RR 1.00 (95% CI, 0.84–1.19); two studies of kidney disease reported RR 0.64 (95% CI, 0.28–1.47) with an estimated absolute effect size of 2 fewer per 1000 (3 fewer to 2 more), and no trials reported cases of symptomatic hypercalcemia.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^3ca0fba3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D — empiric supplementation in high‑risk prediabetes: For adults with high-risk prediabetes, in addition to lifestyle modification, we suggest empiric vitamin D supplementation to reduce the risk of progression to diabetes. Lifestyle modification must be a routine management component for adults with prediabetes. Trials informing this recommendation primarily related to adults identified as meeting 2 or 3 American Diabetes Association glycemia criteria (fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], 2-hour glucose after a 75-gram oral glucose challenge) for prediabetes and those with impaired glucose tolerance. In the trials, vitamin D dosages ranged from 842 to 7543 IU (21 to 189 μg) daily equivalent, with an estimated weighted average of approximately 3500 IU (88 μg) per day, and some trials allowed routine supplements including up to 1000 IU (25 μg) of vitamin D daily.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^0b919256]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Summary of evidence — benefits and harms: The systematic review included 25 trials (49 879 participants) evaluating vitamin D for all-cause mortality across settings including community (n = 17), nursing homes (n = 6), and hospital clinics (n = 2); most used vitamin D3, commonly as a daily dose (13 trials), either alone or with calcium, with follow-up from 12 weeks to 7 years (median 2 years). The evidence suggests vitamin D lowers mortality versus placebo or no D: RR 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93–1.00), absolute effect 6 fewer deaths per 1000 people (from 11 fewer to 0 more); community-based studies showed RR 0.95 [95% CI, 0.90–0.99], and among those with low vitamin D status (< 20 ng/mL [50 nmol/L]) results were consistent (RR of mortality 0.88 [95% CI, 0.46–1.67]). For fractures, trials reporting participants with fractures (43 585 participants) found RR 1.01 (95% CI, 0.94–1.08) with an estimated absolute effect of 1 fewer per 1000 people (from 5 fewer to 6 more).

### Comprehensive echocardiographic detection of treatment-related cardiac Dysfunction in adult survivors of Childhood cancer: results from the st. jude lifetime cohort study [^b0ad59e3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment-related cardiac death is the primary, noncancer cause of mortality in adult survivors of childhood malignancies. Early detection of cardiac dysfunction may identify a high-risk subset of survivors for early intervention.

Objectives

This study sought to determine the prevalence of cardiac dysfunction in adult survivors of childhood malignancies.

Methods

Echocardiographic assessment included 3-dimensional (3D) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), global longitudinal and circumferential myocardial strain, and diastolic function, graded per American Society of Echocardiography guidelines in 1,820 adult (median age 31 years; range: 18 to 65 years) survivors of childhood cancer (median time from diagnosis 23 years; range: 10 to 48 years) exposed to anthracycline chemotherapy (n = 1,050), chest-directed radiotherapy (n = 306), or both (n = 464).

Results

Only 5.8% of survivors had abnormal 3D LVEFs (< 50%). However, 32.1% of survivors with normal 3D LVEFs had evidence of cardiac dysfunction by global longitudinal strain (28%), American Society of Echocardiography-graded diastolic assessment (8.7%), or both. Abnormal global longitudinal strain was associated with chest-directed radiotherapy at 1 to 19.9 Gy (rate ratio [RR]: 1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14 to 1.66), 20 to 29.9 Gy (RR: 1.65; 95% CI: 1.31 to 2.08), and > 30 Gy (RR: 2.39; 95% CI: 1.79 to 3.18) and anthracycline dose > 300 mg/m(2) (RR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.31 to 2.26). Survivors with metabolic syndrome were twice as likely to have abnormal global longitudinal strain (RR: 1.94; 95% CI: 1.66 to 2.28) and abnormal diastolic function (RR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.39 to 2.03) but not abnormal 3D LVEFs (RR: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.74 to 1.53).

Conclusions

Abnormal global longitudinal strain and diastolic function are more prevalent than reduced 3D LVEF and are associated with treatment exposure. They may identify a subset of survivors at higher risk for poor clinical cardiac outcomes who may benefit from early medical intervention.

### Clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in South Africa [^1b572319]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Table 1
Clinical and economic outcomes of different COVID-19 vaccination program strategies of vaccine supply and vaccination pace under different scenarios of epidemic growth in South Africa.

Dominated: the strategy results in a higher ICER than that of a more clinically effective strategy, or the strategy results in less clinical benefit (more years-of-life lost) and higher health care costs than an alternative strategy.

ICER incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, R e effective reproduction number, USD United States dollars.

a Within each R e scenario, vaccination strategies are ordered from the lowest to highest cost per convention of cost-effectiveness analysis. ICERs are calculated compared to the next least expensive, non-dominated strategy. Displayed life-years and costs are rounded to the nearest hundred, whereas ICERs are calculated based on non-rounded life-years and costs, and then rounded to the nearest ten.

b When modeling a vaccination program that seeks to vaccinate 80% of the population, uptake among those eligible was increased to 80%, to avoid a scenario in which supply exceeds uptake. If uptake is not increased beyond 67%, then the strategy of vaccinating 67% of the population provides the most clinical benefit and results in an ICER of $9,960/YLS compared with vaccinating 40% of the population when R e is 1.4 and $1,990/YLS in an epidemic scenario with periodic surges.

c In the analysis of an epidemic with periodic surges, the basic reproduction number (R o) alternates between low and high values over time, and the R e changes day-to-day as the epidemic and vaccination program progress, and there are fewer susceptible individuals. For most of the simulation horizon, R o is 1.6 (equivalent to an initial R e of 1.1). However, during days 90–150 and 240–300 of the simulation, R o is increased to 2.6. This results in two epidemic waves with peak R e of ~1.4–1.5.

### Phase I trial of oral fenretinide in children with high-risk solid tumors: a report from the children's oncology group (CCG 09709) [^0fd10988]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the maximal tolerated dosage (MTD) of oral fenretinide given as intact capsules for 7 days, repeated every 21 days, in children with high-risk solid tumors.

Methods

Children 21 years of age or younger received daily doses from 350 mg/m2 to 3,300 mg/m2 (divided into two or three doses), with pharmacokinetics during course one. The MTD was defined as zero to one of six patients with dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), with at least two of three or two of six DLT at next higher dose.

Results

Fifty-four patients, age 2 years to 20 years (median, 9 years), were treated: neuroblastoma (n = 39), Ewing sarcoma (n = 5), and other (n = 10). Prior therapy included autologous stem cell transplantation (n = 42), 13-cis-RA (n = 35), and 9-cis-RA (n = 1). One of four patients at 1,050 mg/m2 with prior liver transplant had grade 3 ALT/abdominal pain/nausea/dehydration and grade 4 AST/emesis. At 1,860 mg/m2, one of seven patients had grade 3 hypoalbuminemia/hypophosphatemia. At 2,475 mg/m2, one of eight patients had grade 3 alkaline phosphatase; three of five patients had DLT at 3,300 mg/m2: grade 3 AST/ALT (n = 1), grade 4 bilirubin/grade 3 AST/ALT (n = 1), pseudotumor cerebri (n = 1). Pseudotumor cerebri also occurred at 600 mg/m2 and 800 mg/m2. There was one complete response and 13 patients with stable disease (SD) for 8 or more courses in 30 assessable neuroblastoma patients. SD for 8 or more courses was seen in one of five Ewing sarcoma patients and one melanoma patient. Mean N-4-hydroxyphenyl retinamide plasma level (day 7, steady-state concentration) was 9.9 mumol/L at MTD.

Conclusion

The pediatric MTD of oral capsular fenretinide was 2,475 mg/m2 per day, which achieved levels active against neuroblastoma in vitro with minimal toxicity. Response data support a phase II trial in neuroblastoma.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^92b2b2f1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — vitamin D for adults with prediabetes: In adults with prediabetes, in addition to lifestyle modification, we suggest vitamin D supplementation to reduce the risk of progression to diabetes. Technical remarks specify that lifestyle modification must be a routine management component for adults with prediabetes, and that trials primarily related to adults with high-risk prediabetes identified as meeting 2 or 3 American Diabetes Association glycemia criteria (fasting glucose, HbA1c, 2-hour glucose after a 75-gram oral glucose challenge). Across trials, vitamin D dosages ranged from 842 to 7543 IU (21 to 189 μg) daily equivalent with an estimated weighted average of approximately 3500 IU (88 μg) per day, and some trials allowed routine supplements up to 1000 IU (25 μg) of vitamin D daily. Baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels reported that the baseline mean 25(OH)D level in the 11 trials was 12 to 28 ng/mL (30–70 nmol/L), and among trials without baseline 25(OH)D as an eligibility criterion the baseline mean level of 25(OH)D was 18 to 28 ng/mL (45–70 nmol/L).

### BMP feed-forward loop promotes terminal differentiation in gastric glands and is interrupted by H. pylori-driven inflammation [^0b9300a7]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Organoid culture

To generate organoids, antrum tissue was incubated in PBS with 0.5 mM DTT and 3 mM EDTA for 90 min. Dissociated glands were washed with PBS, mixed with 50 µl Matrigel (BD), and plated in 24-well plates. After polymerization of Matrigel, murine gastric culture medium (Advanced Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium/F12 supplemented with B27, N2 (Invitrogen), N-acetyl cysteine (Sigma) penicillin/streptomycin containing 50 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 100 ng/ml noggin, 100 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor 10, 10 nM gastrin, Rspo1-conditioned medium, and Wnt3A-conditioned medium) was overlaid. The medium supplemented with growth factors was replaced every 2–3 days. Noggin was removed for the study of BMP-inhibitors, as well as in indicated cases for specific experiments to study the role of endogenous Bmp expression.

For indicated treatments, organoids were cultured in the murine gastric medium for 2 days followed by 4 days culture with mouse recombinant proteins: 50 ng mL −1 BMP2 (R&D, 355-BM-010), 30 ng mL −1 BMP4 (R&D, 5020-BP-010), 500 ng mL −1 GREM1 (R&D, 956-GR-050), 500 ng mL −1 GREM2 (R&D, 2069-PR-050), 300 ng mL −1 CHRDL1 (R&D, 1808-NR-050), or 100 ng mL −1 IFN-γ (R&D, 485-MI-100). For treatment with BMP2 and IFN-γ together, the concentration of recombinant BMP2 was reduced to 20 ng mL −1 in all conditions. The medium supplemented with growth factors was replaced every 2–3 days and new doses of recombinant proteins were added. For RSPO and WNT withdrawal, factors were removed or reduced in the medium at the beginning of the organoid culture. To visualize Lgr5 or Axin2 lineages in the organoids, 4OH-tamoxifen was added to cultures from Lgr5CreErt2/Rosa26-tdTomato or Axin2CreErt2/Rosa26-tdTomato mice at the indicated time points. Cultures were fixed with 4% PFA and analyzed by confocal microscopy as described above.

The Vitamin D and Type 2 Diabetes trial.

The Vitamin D and Type 2 Diabetes (D2d) study was a 22-site trial that took place from October 2013 through December 2018 in the United States. The study randomly assigned 2423 adults (mean age 60 years, mean BMI 32 kg/m 2) who met at least 2 of 3 glycemic criteria for prediabetes (FG 100–125 mg/dL; 2hG 140–199 mg/dL; HbA1c 5.7–6.4%) to treatment with 4000 IU of vitamin D 3 daily or placebo. The primary outcome was time-to-incident diabetes based on annual glycemic testing through FG, HbA1c and 2hG, and semiannually with FG and HbA1c. The trial design was event-driven, with a target number of diabetes events of 508. Mean baseline serum 25(OH)D level was 28 ng/mL (69 nmol/L) and 78% of participants had a level ≥ 20 ng/mL (49 nmol/L) (Table 3). During follow-up, mean serum 25(OH)D level in the vitamin D group rose to 54 ng/mL compared with 29 ng/mL in the placebo group. After a median follow-up of 2.5 years, 616 diabetes events had occurred: 293 in the vitamin D group and 323 in the placebo group (9.4 events vs 10.7 events per 100 person-years, respectively). In the ITT analysis, the risk of diabetes was not significantly lower in the vitamin D group (hazard ratio 0.88; 95% CI: 0.75–1.04).

In each of these 3 studies, protocol-specified adverse events of interest (hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and nephrolithiasis) were rare, and there were no significant differences between vitamin D and placebo.

### Differential effects of vitamin D2 and D3 supplements on 25-hydroxyvitamin D level are dose, sex, and time dependent: a randomized controlled trial [^90ea54aa]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D (D) supplements are indispensable for its world-wide deficiency. Controversy continues on ergocalciferol (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3) relative potency as well as on dosing-schedule and sex role in raising 25-hydroxy D (25(OH)D) level, the best indicator of D status.

Methods

We randomized 279 adults to daily D2, D3, D2/D3, or placebo; 2-weekly D2 or D3; or 4-weekly D2 or D3 (250,000 IU over/140 days). Randomization sequence, stratified by body-mass-index (BMI) and sex, was concealed from study coordinators and participants who were then blinded to capsules' content. D2, D3, 25(OH)D2, and 25(OH)D3 Serum levels were determined blindly on days 0,1,2,3,4,7,14, and 2-weekly thereafter by high performance liquid chromatography assay. The results of 269 participants were available for analysis. Primary endpoint was area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 25(OH)D (25(OH)D2 + 25(OH)D3) adjusted for sex, BMI, and baseline 25(OH)D level.

Results

Mean(SD) age was 33.0(8.5) year, 41% were males, and 85% completed follow-up. Baseline 25(OH)D level was 39.8(11.9) and increased by 3.3(11.6) and 28.6(16.3) nmol/L, in the placebo and active-treatment groups, respectively. AUC from day 0 to 140 (AUC 140) of 25(OH)D was 40% (D3 daily) to 55% (D3 2-weekly) higher with active-treatment than placebo (p < 0.001). 25(OH)D2 AUC 140 was higher in daily than 2-weekly (17%, p = 0.006) and 4-weekly (20%, p = 0.001) D2-treated groups. 25(OH)D3 AUC 140 was lower in daily than 2-weekly (11%, p = 0.002) and 4-weekly D3-treated groups (10%, p = 0.008). In D2-treated groups, there was 16.4 nmol/L decrease in 25(OH)D3 level that correlated (p < 0.001) with 25(OH)D2 level increase (r = 0.48) and baseline 25(OH)D level (r = 0.58), in one participant with measurable baseline 25(OH)D2 level, D3 caused a similar decrease in 25(OH)D2 level, while in the D2/D3-treated group, 25(OH)D3 level didn't increase. Incremental AUC from day 0 to 7 (AUC 7) of D3 and 25(OH)D3 in D3-treated groups were 118–243% higher and 31–39% lower, respectively, than incremental AUC 7 of D2 and 25(OH)D2 in D2-treated groups. Incremental AUC 7 of D3 and 25(OH)D3 in D3-treated groups and D2 and 25(OH)D2 in D2-treated groups were higher in females than males (55, 13, 64, and 28%, respectively). Baseline 25(OH)D level predicted response to D2 and D3 (p < 0.001), whereas, BMI was significant predictor only for early response to D2.

Conclusions

Effects of D2 and D3 supplements on 25 (OH)D level may be dosing-schedule and sex-dependent. D2-associated reduction in 25(OH)D3 level may be related to total 25(OH)D level rather than being D2-specific. D2 may be 25-hydroxylated faster than D3.

Comet assay

The HSPCs at different development stages and HSPCs cultured with or without FetuA (100 μg mL −1; 10318-H08H, SinoBiological) or ML216 (25 mΜ; S0469, Selleck) were treated with 20 μM etoposide (341205, Merck Millipore) for 30 min and then collected for the comet assay. A CometAssay kit from TREVIGEN (4250-050-k, R&D) was utilized to assess DNA damage. The alkaline method was utilized using the following steps: (1) 5,000 cells were mixed with 50 µl of melted LMAgarose (4250-050-02, R&D) at 37 °C and then pipetted onto a CometSlide; (2) the cells were then gelled for 3–5 min at 4 °C in the dark, followed by lysis with 4 °C lysis solution for 1 h; (3) the CometSlide was immersed in an alkaline unwinding solution (200 mM NaOH and 1 mM EDTA, pH > 13) for 1 h at 4 °C in the dark, and electrophoresis was conducted in the same solution at 20 V and 300 mA for 30 min at 4 °C); (4) the slides were washed twice with ddH 2 O for 5 min each, followed by washing with 70% ethanol for 5 min, and the slides were then dried at room temperature overnight; and (5) the dried agarose was stained with SYBR Green I (A25742, Thermo Fisher) nucleic acid gel stain for 30 min. Images were acquired with Las X (v4.7) on a Leica TCS Stellaris8 STED Microscope at ×20 resolution and analysed using OpenComet software (v1.3.1).

### Too many digits: the presentation of numerical data [^a41454ae]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Thus a decimal places rule that ignores significant digits does not work. But equally, and perhaps surprisingly, a significant digits rule that ignores decimal places does not always work either. Reporting risk ratios to three significant digits for example leads to the largest ratio below 1 being reported as 0.999 and the smallest above 1 as 1.01, with three and two decimal places, respectively. This is clearly unsatisfactory as they differ in precision by a factor of ten. In this instance a combination of significant digits and decimal places, the rule of four, works best: round the risk ratio to two significant digits if the leading non-zero digit is four or more, otherwise round to three.

The rule of four gives three decimal places for risk ratios from 0.040 to 0.399, two from 0.40 to 3.99 and one from 4.0 to 39.9. Applying it to the example of 22.68 above gives 22.7 (95% CI 7.5 to 74). Alternatively one can apply the rule with one less significant digit, giving 23 with CI 8 to 70.

Another example is the reporting of test statistics such as t or F. Specifying one decimal place would permit say t = 30.1, where 30 is clearly sufficient as it is so highly significant. Conversely specifying two significant digits would permit t = −0.13, where again the extra precision is irrelevant as it is far from significant. A suitable rule specifies up to one decimal place and up to two significant digits.

When comparing group means or percentages in tables, rounding should not blur the differences between them. This is the basis for the Hopkins two digits rule, whereby the mean has enough decimal places to ensure two significant digits for the SD. An analogous rule for percentages might be to use enough decimal places to ensure two significant digits for the range of values across groups, eg, if the range is 10% or more use whole numbers, if less than 1% use two decimal places, and otherwise one. In practice percentages are usually given along with their corresponding frequencies, so precision is less critical as the exact values can be calculated.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Cost-effectiveness of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy — across models and randomized trials — shows variable cost per life-year with a commonly cited comparator that renal dialysis costs approximately $50,000 to add 1 life-year of survival. Early modeling studies reported cost-effectiveness ratios of $17,000, $18,100, and $29,200 per year of life saved, and another model estimated between $27,300 and $54,000 per life-year gained with risk reductions of 40% and 20%. In randomized trials, MADIT found a 54% reduction in total mortality with $27,000 per life-year added, whereas CIDS found a 20% reduction with $139,000 per life-year added; AVID reported $66,677 per life-year added. In MADIT II, mortality was reduced by 32% with $39,200 higher costs; its cost-effectiveness ratio was $235,000 per year of life added at 2 years, projected between $78,600 and $114,000 per year of life added by 12 years. SCD-HeFT showed total mortality reduced by 23% with costs increased by $19,000 over 5 years and estimated a lifetime cost-effectiveness ratio of $38,400 per year of life added. A unified modeling framework across trials reported the cost-effectiveness of the ICD ranged from $25,300 to $50,700 per life-year added when mortality was reduced, but in CABG-Patch and DINAMIT, the ICD strategy was not cost-effective due to lower survival and higher costs. When restricted to appropriately selected patients, ICD implantation compares well to the standard benchmark of renal dialysis ($30,000 to $50,000 per year of life saved), and additional risk stratification of patients with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) may enhance cost-effectiveness. For cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), cost-effectiveness has not been evaluated extensively; CRT-P devices reduce hospitalization with cost offsets, are effective in improving quality of life (QOL) and may improve survival, CRT-D versus medical therapy appears favorable, and there are few comparative data for CRT-D versus CRT-P devices.

### Physical activity and excess body weight and adiposity for adults. American College of Sports Medicine consensus statement [^827077ba]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). High credibility.

ACSM consensus — enhanced long-term weight loss is associated with 200 to 300 min·wk−1 or ≥ 2000 kcal·wk−1 of leisure-time physical activity, yet randomized studies have not consistently supported this dose; after weight loss of ≥ 5%, 225 and 300 min·wk−1 were not superior to 150 min·wk−1 for enhancing weight loss maintenance over 12 months, and prescribing unsupervised 250 min·wk−1 did not elicit greater weight loss than prescribing unsupervised 150 min·wk−1; thus, physical activity targets may need to be initially set to progress to 150 min·wk−1 of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity with later progression when necessary.

### Differential effects of vitamin D2 and D3 supplements on 25-hydroxyvitamin D level are dose, sex, and time dependent: a randomized controlled trial [^29e109f1]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The primary aim of this randomized placebo-controlled, partially-blinded study on 269 healthy adults with mean 25(OH)D of 39.8 (11.9) nmol/L was to evaluate the relative efficacy of equi-unit D2 and D3 oral supplements given daily, 2-weekly, or 4-weekly in raising 25(OH)D level over 20 weeks. Predetermined secondary aims included comparing D2, D3, 25(OH)D2, and 25(OH)D3 levels. The primary outcome measure was adjusted area-under-the-curve between days 0 and 140 (AUC 140). The main results were: 1) in the long term (20 weeks), the D3 2-weekly followed by D3 4-weekly and D2 daily regimens were superior in raising 25(OH)D levels. In the first few weeks of treatment, however, the 4-weekly followed by 2-weekly regimens were superior to all daily regimens. 2) D3 2-weekly and 4-weekly regimens were consistently superior to the corresponding D2 regimens; however, D2 daily regimen was consistently superior to D3 daily regimen. 3) 25(OH)D2 level was significantly higher in the daily compared to the 2-weekly and 4-weekly D2-treated groups, whereas, 25(OH)D3 level was lower in the daily compared to the 2-weekly and 4-weekly D3-treated groups 4) The increase in 25(OH)D level was inversely related to baseline level, however, its inverse relation to BMI appeared to be D-type and time dependent (mainly short time after D2 treatment). 5) Daily, 2-weekly, and 4-weekly D2 regimens were associated with a similar and significant decrease in 25(OH)D3 level that correlated with the increase in 25(OH)D2 level and baseline 25(OH)D level, in one participant with measurable baseline 25(OH)D2 level, D3 caused a similar decrease in 25(OH)D2 level, while in the D2/D3-treated group, 25(OH)D3 level didn't increase. 6) The increases in D3 level in the 2-weekly and 4-weekly D3 treated groups were higher than the increases in D2 level in the corresponding D2 treated groups, the opposite was true for 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 levels. 7) Females had higher increases in D3, D2, 25(OH)D2, and 25(OH)D3 levels than males. 8) D treatment was associated with significant increases in urinary calcium and creatinine levels but not calcium/creatinine ratio.

### Uterine morcellation for presumed leiomyomas: ACOG committee opinion, number 822 [^b3097f13]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Uterine morcellation — prevalence of unexpected uterine sarcoma at surgery for presumed leiomyomas is quantified across multiple reviews: An FDA 2017 update included 23 studies, with 20 studies (totaling 90,910 women) informing prevalence, estimating uterine sarcoma at 1 in 305 to 1 in 360 women and leiomyosarcoma at 1 in 570 to 1 in 750 women. A 2015 meta-analysis of 133 studies reported leiomyosarcoma prevalence as 1 in 1,961 (0.051%; 95% credible interval, 0.16–0.98), and in 64 prospective studies approximately 1 in 8,300 (0.012%; 95% credible interval, 0.01–0.75). A single-institution series found two occult leiomyosarcomas in 8,720 surgeries (1 in 4,360 or 0.023%). An AHRQ review included 160 studies and 136,195 women (29% prospective), with overall risk 0.02% (range: 0.05–0.09%) in prospective studies and 0.08% (range: 0.05–0.13%) in retrospective studies, translating to fewer than 1–13 per 10,000 surgeries (1/10,000 to 1/770).

### Delayed peripheral facial palsy in the stapes surgery: can it be prevented? [^2c75910a]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to evaluate poststapedectomy-delayed facial palsy etiopathogenesis, risk factors, evolution, and prevention.

Materials and Methods

Seven hundred six stapedectomies performed in 580 patients were reviewed. In all patients who developed delayed facial palsy, the dates of onset and subside of facial palsy, the anatomic and pathologic predisposing factors, and a possible history for recurrent labial herpetic lesions were considered. The House-Brackmann (H-B) grading system was used to evaluate the facial function. Virus-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM antibodies against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 3 weeks after the onset of the paralysis. The results were compared with a control group without a history of recurrent herpes labialis.

Results

Poststapedectomy facial palsy developed in 7 out of 706 procedures. All 7 patients referred a history of recurrent labial herpetic lesions. One patient showed a facial palsy H-B grade II, 2 a grade III, and 3 a grade IV. After acyclovir therapy, 6 subjects recovered completely, whereas 1 maintained an H-B grade II. An increased IgG antibody titer was found in 6 of the patients with delayed facial palsy and in 1 out of 7 controls. Mean IgG titer was 1:14,050 in the subjects with delayed facial palsy and 1:2,300 in controls (P < .001).

Conclusions

Poststapedectomy-delayed facial palsy is likely caused by a reactivation of HSV-1, latent within the geniculate ganglion. The activation of the latent virus is more frequent in patients with a history of herpes labialis and can be prevented by an adequate acyclovir therapy.

When considering both the percentage of participants experiencing, and annualized rates of, documented symptomatic (≤ 3.9 mmol/l) hypoglycaemia at any time of day (24 h), results favoured Gla-300 during all predefined study periods (RR 0.42–0.85; Figure 2 A, B) with significant relative reductions in the annualized rate reported from baseline to month 6 [RR 0.62 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.87)], and during the first 8 weeks [RR 0.42 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.67) Figure 2 B]. Significant reductions with Gla-300 versus Gla-100 were also apparent when considering the percentage of participants affected by events defined by the more stringent glycaemic threshold; a 39% lower risk was observed for confirmed (< 3.0 mmol/l) or severe hypoglycaemia [RR 0.61 (95% CI 0.43 to 0.87)] and a 45% lower risk for documented (< 3.0 mmol/l) symptomatic hypoglycaemia [RR 0.55 (95% CI 0.37 to 0.82)] over the 6-month period (Figure 2 A).

Severe Hypoglycaemia

Severe hypoglycaemia was infrequent, and events were too few for meaningful analysis. Only 4 participants (1%) in each treatment group reported severe hypoglycaemia at any time of day (24 h; Table S1).

Patterns of Hypoglycaemia by Time of Day (24 h)

Figure 3 shows the distribution of hypoglycaemia by time of day, as the percentage of participants affected and as annualized event rates (panels A and C), and as differences between Gla-100 and Gla-300 during each time interval (panels B and D). Both the overall frequency of events reported and the differences between the treatment groups were greatest during the daytime, especially between 06:00 and 10:00 hours.

Step 4: Select the dose

Do not select a dose or press the injection button without a needle attached. This may damage your pen.

4A Make sure a needle is attached and the dose is set to "0".

4B Turn the dose selector until the dose pointer lines up with your dose.

If you turn past your dose, you can turn back down.
If there are not enough units left in your pen for your dose, the dose selector will stop at the number of units left.
If you cannot select your full prescribed dose, use a new pen or inject the remaining units and use a new pen to complete your dose.

How to read the dose window

Even numbers are shown in line with dose pointer.

Odd numbers are shown as a line between even numbers.

Units of Insulin Glargine in your pen:

Your pen contains a total of 300 units of Insulin Glargine. You can select doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains more than 1 dose.
You can see roughly how many units of insulin are left by looking at where the plunger is on the insulin scale.

Nocturnal

Fewer participants experienced ≥ 1 nocturnal (00:00–05:59 hours) confirmed [≤ 3.9 mmol/l (≤ 70 mg/dl)] or severe hypoglycaemic event with Gla-300 than with Gla-100 [54 vs 65% (Table 1); relative risk 0.84 (95% CI 0.75–0.94)], during the 12-month study period. The cumulative number of confirmed [≤ 3.9 mmol/l (≤ 70 mg/dl)] or severe hypoglycaemic events per participant increased more rapidly in the Gla-100 group for the first 6 months, after which the curves were roughly parallel (Figure 3B). Annualized rates of nocturnal confirmed [≤ 3.9 mmol/l (≤ 70 mg/dl)] or severe hypoglycaemia did not differ significantly between treatments [2.88 vs 3.19 events per participant-year; rate ratio 0.90 (95% CI 0.70–1.16); Table 1].

Other Hypoglycaemia Categories

Fewer participants reported ≥ 1 documented symptomatic hypoglycaemic event [≤ 3.9 mmol/l (≤ 70 mg/dl)] in the Gla-300 group compared with the Gla-100 group at any time of day or during the night (Table 1).

When the more stringent hypoglycaemia threshold [< 3.0 mmol/l (< 54 mg/dl)] was applied to the categories of documented symptomatic and confirmed or severe hypoglycaemia, no significant between-treatment differences were seen (Table 1).

Severe hypoglycaemia (any time of day) was reported by 6.7% of Gla-300- and 7.5% of Gla-100-treated participants (Table 1).

### Evaluating strategies for global respiratory pandemic control at ports: a modelling study [^2afa0472]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Results

Without intervention (S1) at medium compliance (50%), the estimated ratio of infections between low (0.001), intermediate (0.005), medium (0.01) and high (0.02) prevalence is approximately 1:5:9:15 (figure 1). At the baseline of no intervention (S1), approximately 3%, 15%, 28% and 47% of crews are infected across the different prevalence rates, totalling around 9400, 44 900, 82 600 and 141 300 infections per 300 000 crew across 10 000 vessels, where the enclosed surroundings on vessels support the rapid infection of the whole crew. When 7DQ (days in quarantine) is introduced (S2), averaged across strains, 1300 (range: 1100–1600), 8800 (7700–10 100), 14 600 (14 100–14 900) and 23 900 (21 500–25 200) estimated cases per 10 000 vessels are averted (figure 1). This increases to 2400 (2100–2600), 13 900 (13 700–14 000), 24 400 (23 300–25 400) and 40 900 (40 200–41 600) for 14DQ (S3). When a predeparture PCR test is introduced for 7DQ (S4), further reductions are observed at 6900 (6400–7100), 34 000 (33 500–34 400), 61 400 (60 400–62 200) and 102 100 (100 100–104 500). Similar results are observed for 14DQ (S5) at 6900 (6400–7300), 34 800 (34 600–35 100), 63 600 (61 500–65 100) and 106 800 (106 100–108 100).

### Biological dosimetry by automated dicentric scoring in a simulated emergency [^fce028c0]. Radiation Research (2013). Low credibility.

Dicentric chromosome analysis remains the most widely used method in biodosimetry. It has a lower detection limit of about 0.1 Gy, and allows one to distinguish between whole- and partial-body exposures. A drawback of the dicentric analysis is that it is a time consuming method and maybe difficult to implement in a mass casualty event. To try to increase the analysis capacity, automatic dicentric scoring (ADS) using image analysis software is being incorporated in several laboratories. Here we present the results obtained in an emergency exercise simulating 50 victims. The ability to distinguish different radiations scenarios is evaluated. To simulate whole-body exposures peripheral blood samples were irradiated at doses between 0–4.7 Gy, and to simulate partial-body exposures irradiated and nonirradiated blood were mixed in different proportions. With the data obtained from the first slide analyzed (with about 300–400 cells), 32 of 34 simulated whole-body exposures were correctly classified according to radiation exposure levels. For simulated partial-body irradiations, it was possible to detect them as partial exposures at the end of the first slide analyzed but only at the highest doses. In all cases the classification was updated every time the analysis of one additional slide was finished. The comparison between our present results and those reported in the literature for manual scoring shows that for triage purposes the ADS based on 300–400 cells is similar in efficiency to classifying the cases based on manual scoring of 50 cells. However, if one accounts for the associated uncertainties and the time needed for ADS, we suggest that ADS triage scoring should be based on about 1,000 cells. For final dose estimations the number of cells to score will depend on the initial estimated dose, and on the information contributed from physical dose-reconstruction or clinical symptoms. At doses higher than 1 Gy, we propose analysis of 1,500 and for lower doses or suspected partial-body exposures, the number of cells to score should be 3,000.

### Airborne infection with Bacillus anthracis – from Mills to mail [^0a0ae7f5]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Because our review of the literature did not provide a conclusive infectious dose for humans, we followed the approach first suggested by Wells of using units of quanta to represent the unit required to establish infection, as has been used in studies of tuberculosis and measles. Since the infectious dose of inhaled virulent anthrax spores cannot ethically be determined experimentally in humans, we estimated the 50% infectious dose (ID 50) based on data from the 8-hour inhaled dose measured in Manchester in 1957. The inhalation dose for workers in the area where four of the five cases of inhalation anthrax had occurred was estimated to be 140–690 spores < 5 µm in size (and 620–2,200 total spores), based on air sampling data. Sixteen presumably susceptible workers were in this area, so this estimate may be considered an ID 25, since 25% of the exposed persons were infected. On the basis of studies of 1,236 monkeys, Glassman estimated the median lethal dose to be 4,130 spores, and using the probit model he suggested that the LD 25 was associated with a 10-fold decrease in dose. When this principle is applied, a 10-fold increase of the ID 25 for the Manchester mill outbreak would result in an ID 50 of 1,400 to 6,900 spores < 5 µm, or 6,200–22,000 total spores. This number is similar to Glassman's estimate and to the lower range of the LD 50, 2,500–55,000, accepted by an expert panel. Since q = 1.25 x ID 50, then one quanta under these assumptions is 1,750–8,625 spores < 5 µm (7,750–27,500 total spores).

The number of persons exposed to B. anthracis spores through the mail in the fall of 2001 is unknown, so we arbitrarily expressed the probability for infection as the number infected per 10,000 population. Estimates of the numbers of persons infected can be calculated by using these estimates. For example, if approximately 5,000 persons were exposed to contaminated letters as might be suggested by the modeling data of Webb and Blaser, these risks can be divided by two. All data were entered, stored, and analyzed by using JMP-SAS software (version 4.0.4, SAS Institute, Cary, NC.)

Prediabetes — vitamin D effects on glycemia and safety are as follows: Compared with placebo, vitamin D lowered fasting blood glucose and post–oral glucose tolerance test values, with mean difference −5.3 mg/dL [95% CI, −7.9 to −2.7] and mean difference −7.6 mg/dL [95% CI, −12.6 to −2.7], respectively, and there was a trend toward HbA1c lowering (mean difference −0.05% [95% CI, −0.10 to 0.01]). Meta-analyses found no clear differences for all-cause mortality (RR 0.75 [95% CI, 0.26–2.18]; estimated absolute effect size of 1 fewer per 1000 [4 fewer to 6 more]) or cardiovascular disease events (RR 1.08 [95% CI, 0.33–3.57]; estimated absolute effect size of 1 more per 1000 [1 fewer to 31 more]). Nephrolithiasis showed no clear difference (RR 1.02 [95% CI, 0.71–2.03]; estimated absolute effect size of 3 more per 1000 [5 fewer to 17 more]), there were no cases of symptomatic hypercalcemia, and in the DPVD study there was 1 case of new-onset kidney disease in the vitamin D group and 2 cases in placebo (RR 0.50 [95% CI, 0.05–5.51]). In D2d, adverse events were overall less frequent with vitamin D 4000 IU/day [100 μg/day] cholecalciferol versus placebo (IRR 0.94 [95% CI, 0.90–0.98]). Based on these point estimates, the panel judged that anticipated desirable effects for diabetes prevention are likely moderate, while anticipated undesirable effects are likely trivial.

Each jurisdiction will need to assess the standard deviation of their local VL data and then determine the appropriate sample size needed to assess VL, and if the sample size is inadequate to meet the recommended case inclusion criterion, an alternate method may need to be used, such as combining multiple years of data. For k = 3, sample sizes across S = 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 are 75, 91, 108, 127, 147, 169, and Table 1b uses power = 90%; jurisdictions may also explore differences in means of viral loads, including categorical differences in the proportion with undetectable or very low VL.

### Disproportionate declines of formerly abundant species underlie insect loss [^715ce79f]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

The community data available to us can be divided into three types, with different processing requirements:
The study provided one species-by site-by-year matrix. We used this directly to calculate all biodiversity metrics for analysis.
Species-by-site by-year data were provided together with an account of the sampling effort (number of samples underlying each row is reported, but no raw data were provided per individual sample). Here, we subsampled the years with higher trapping effort to provide the expected community composition if the number of samples had been the same as in the year with the lowest sample size. We repeated this subsampling procedure 100 times, and calculated the means of each biodiversity metric, to be used as model input. In some cases, it was clear that subsampling to the lowest sample size would lead to a large loss of data, and in such cases, it was more economical to discard a year than lose a large amount of data. A practical example: if year 1 has 300 individuals in 6 traps and year 10 has 500 individuals in 4 traps, we subsampled 200 individuals (4/6 of 300) from year 1, so that each year has the number of individuals equivalent to 4 traps. We repeated this resampling 100 times to derive 100 hypothetical community compositions, and calculated the biodiversity metrics and population abundances for each iteration.
Exact data were provided per sampling event (number of individuals per species per trap/site per date), but the number of traps, dates or periods sampled is variable among years (owing to trap malfunctions or changes in sampling design or sampling frequency). Here, we first divided the years into monthly or bimonthly periods, and then decided whether we could maximize data use by including more months or more years (that is, whether to exclude periods that were not sampled each year, or exclude years that did not have samples in each period). The aim here was to maximize data use, so that we could attain the highest quality of data for a maximum number of years. For each period, we then subsampled the minimum number of samples observed in any year from the available samples, and added these together to form one yearly sample. This was repeated 100 times, and the biodiversity metrics were calculated each time. The mean values of these 100 iterations were used for model input. A practical example: ten pitfall traps per site were usually emptied weekly, but sometimes fortnightly, the trapping period changed from year-round at the start to May–September in later years, and sometimes samples were missing owing to flooding or trampling by livestock. Here, we first discarded all months other than May–September. Then we allocated five monthly periods and calculated the number of sampling days (sum of sampling period × number of traps) for each month. We then drew random samples (without replacement) from the available samples per month, until the total number of sampling days added up to the minimum number sampling days observed. We added the months up to form one yearly sample and calculated our metrics. This was repeated 100 times.
