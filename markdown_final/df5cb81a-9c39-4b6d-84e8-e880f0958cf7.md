## Question

What are the potential risks and side effects associated with HRT for menopausal symptoms?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the potential risks and side effects of menopausal hormone therapy (HRT/MHT) for menopausal symptoms. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why women use HRT. Then, I should verify the major risk domains and how they vary by age, time since menopause, and formulation. Next, I will examine formulation-specific nuances, including estrogen-alone versus combined therapy and route of administration. After that, I should review special populations and contraindications. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-mitigation approach and communicate absolute versus relative risks clearly, with periodic reassessment built in.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and indications. HRT is the most effective treatment for bothersome vasomotor symptoms and genitourinary syndrome of menopause, and it prevents bone loss and fractures; it is not indicated for primary prevention of chronic disease, which is a key distinction I need to keep front and center [^114fevBe] [^113hqw5o]. I should also remember that many women experience prolonged symptoms, with vasomotor symptoms often persisting beyond a decade, so duration decisions must be individualized rather than arbitrary [^115SF8aJ].

> Now, I will examine cardiovascular risks, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions because timing matters. In women who start HRT after age 60 or more than 10 years past menopause, absolute risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, and venous thromboembolism are higher, whereas in women younger than 60 or within 10 years of menopause, absolute risks are lower and the benefit–risk balance is generally favorable for symptom control [^114WrBok] [^111ioqqJ]. Wait, let me verify the route effect: oral estrogen increases VTE risk, whereas transdermal estrogen appears to have a lower thrombotic risk and may reduce stroke and coronary risk compared with oral formulations, which is important for risk mitigation [^1178U8Q1]. I should double-check the mortality signal: meta-analytic data suggest a possible mortality reduction when HRT is initiated in younger recently menopausal women, though this requires cautious interpretation and is not a reason to use HRT for prevention [^115RMpRN].

> Next, I should review breast cancer risk, and I need to ensure I distinguish estrogen-alone from combined therapy. Combined estrogen–progestogen therapy increases breast cancer risk, with risk rising with duration and appearing higher with continuous regimens; excess risk persists for years after stopping, though it declines over time, which argues for the lowest effective dose and the shortest necessary duration when EPT is used [^112KStrp]. Estrogen-alone therapy in women with a hysterectomy shows a smaller and delayed increase in breast cancer risk, and some analyses suggest risk may not rise substantially until after 10–15 years of use, though I should confirm that this remains controversial and requires individualized counseling [^111sdCaC]. Let me reconsider the progestogen choice: observational data suggest progesterone or dydrogesterone may carry lower breast cancer risk than some synthetic progestins, but I should emphasize that this is not definitive and shared decision-making is essential [^112KStrp].

> I will now examine endometrial cancer risk. Unopposed systemic estrogen increases endometrial cancer risk, so in women with a uterus, a progestogen is required for endometrial protection; micronized progesterone is often preferred over synthetic progestins when feasible due to a potentially more favorable profile, though I should confirm that the breast risk trade-off still needs discussion [^1178U8Q1]. Hold on, I should verify local therapy: low-dose vaginal estrogen for genitourinary symptoms has minimal systemic absorption and does not require routine progestogen, though any unscheduled bleeding warrants evaluation for endometrial pathology [^1157hBxF] [^115vZyd6].

> Let me consider ovarian cancer next, and I should double-check the strength of evidence. Observational meta-analyses and large cohort data suggest a small increase in ovarian cancer risk with long-term HRT, with signals for both estrogen-alone and combined therapy; the absolute risk increase is small, but it strengthens the case for using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration and avoiding therapy without a clear indication [^113H6oR3] [^117NYBbf]. But wait, what if duration is short? The magnitude of risk appears to rise with longer use, and there is uncertainty about short-term use, so I should communicate this uncertainty explicitly during counseling [^11456SfS].

> I need to check cerebrovascular and thrombotic risks carefully. Oral estrogen increases stroke and VTE risk, and this risk is higher in older women or those further from menopause; transdermal estrogen reduces but does not eliminate VTE risk and is reasonable when VTE risk is a concern, though I should confirm that individual risk factors like obesity, immobility, and thrombophilia further tilt the balance [^114WrBok] [^1178U8Q1]. Hold on, I should verify that even in younger women the absolute risks are not zero, which is why baseline risk assessment and route selection matter in shared decision-making [^114WrBok].

> Next, I should review cognitive effects and dementia, and I must be precise about age. Initiating HRT in women aged 65 or older is associated with increased dementia risk in the WHI, so starting systemic HRT after 65 for the first time is not recommended; conversely, starting around the time of menopause has not shown clear cognitive harm and may be neutral, though this is not an indication to use HRT for cognitive protection [^1123aAk6] [^114WrBok]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied a cognitive benefit — let me correct that: current evidence does not support HRT for dementia prevention, and late initiation may worsen outcomes, so timing is critical in counseling [^1123aAk6].

> I will now examine formulation-specific nuances. Estrogen-alone therapy after hysterectomy avoids breast cancer risk from progestogen but still carries VTE and stroke risks with oral dosing; transdermal estradiol mitigates VTE risk and is often preferred in women with higher thrombotic risk profiles or metabolic syndrome features [^1178U8Q1]. Combined therapy is necessary for women with a uterus, and continuous regimens may carry higher breast cancer risk than cyclic regimens; again, dose minimization and periodic reassessment are key [^112KStrp]. Let me verify local therapy once more: low-dose vaginal estrogen is highly effective for GSM with negligible systemic exposure, making it appropriate at any age when indicated, with individualized bleeding surveillance [^112bnvcu].

> But wait, what about special populations and contraindications. Women with a history of breast cancer should generally avoid systemic estrogen, and if considered off-label, it requires explicit shared decision-making acknowledging potential increases in recurrence risk; vaginal estrogen may be acceptable in selected survivors after careful counseling, though data are mixed and caution is warranted [^114gS8rC] [^1123aAk6]. Women with a history of venous thromboembolism, stroke, or high cardiovascular risk should generally avoid systemic HRT, with transdermal estrogen considered only in exceptional circumstances after specialist input; nonhormonal options should be first-line for vasomotor symptoms in high CVD risk patients [^116n48UV] [^1178U8Q1]. I should confirm that women with endometrial cancer history require individualized plans, and in BRCA carriers or those with high genetic breast cancer risk, extended systemic HRT beyond the usual menopausal age is generally discouraged, with decisions individualized after risk-reducing surgery [^113bk3sm].

> Next, I should review a practical risk-mitigation approach and verify alignment with guidelines. Use the lowest effective dose, prefer transdermal routes when VTE risk is present, limit duration to the time needed for symptom control, and reassess annually; for EPT, many guidelines advise keeping total duration under 3–5 years when possible, while recognizing that some women will require longer courses with informed consent and surveillance [^114UWJ1K] [^114YryjJ]. I need to ensure baseline risk assessments for cardiovascular disease and breast cancer are documented, and that shared decision-making explicitly weighs symptom burden, quality-of-life impact, and evolving comorbidities over time [^114dwtC8] [^114n5RkR].

> I should double-check how to communicate risk so patients understand absolute versus relative risks. For example, combined therapy in women aged 50–59 may add roughly 4–5 excess breast cancers per 1000 women over 5 years, whereas oral estrogen increases VTE by about 3–5 per 1000 per year in late postmenopause; transdermal estrogen reduces VTE risk to approximately 1–2 per 1000 per year, though individual risk modifiers apply, and I should present these numbers in context of baseline risk and symptom severity [^112KStrp]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not overstating precision — these are estimates from trials and meta-analyses and should be framed with confidence intervals and patient-specific factors [^114WrBok].

> Finally, I need to ensure ongoing monitoring and stopping rules are clear. Annual reassessment of risks, benefits, and patient preferences is recommended; any unscheduled bleeding on therapy warrants endometrial evaluation, and in women older than 65 who remain on therapy, periodic attempts to lower dose or discontinue should be considered, though routine cessation solely due to age is not mandated by evidence [^115vZyd6] [^1157hBxF]. Let me reconsider the bottom line: for healthy women younger than 60 or within 10 years of menopause with bothersome symptoms, HRT is generally safe and effective when individualized; for women older than 60 or more than 10 years past menopause, absolute risks rise and decisions require more caution, often favoring nonhormonal therapies or local estrogen for GSM [^114fevBe] [^114WrBok].

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopausal symptoms is effective but carries **individualized risks** that depend on age, time since menopause, and regimen [^114fevBe]. The main concerns are a **modest increase in breast cancer risk** with combined estrogen–progestin therapy (especially with long-term use) [^112KStrp] [^115fTnoy], a **small increase in venous thromboembolism and stroke risk** (higher with oral estrogen and older age) [^114WrBok] [^1156ZBTF], and a possible increase in ovarian cancer risk with long-term use [^113H6oR3] [^117NYBbf]. Estrogen-alone therapy increases endometrial cancer risk if used without a progestogen in women with a uterus [^1123aAk6]. Common side effects include irregular bleeding, breast tenderness, and mood changes; risks are lower with transdermal estrogen and micronized progesterone, and therapy should be individualized with the lowest effective dose and regular monitoring [^1178U8Q1] [^1157hBxF].

---

## Cardiovascular risks

- **Venous thromboembolism (VTE)**: Oral estrogen increases VTE risk, especially with combined estrogen–progestin therapy and in older women or those with higher baseline risk; transdermal estrogen has a lower VTE risk [^114WrBok] [^1178U8Q1].

- **Stroke**: Oral estrogen, particularly combined therapy, is associated with a small increase in ischemic stroke risk, especially in older women or those with cardiovascular risk factors [^114WrBok] [^1156ZBTF].

- **Coronary heart disease (CHD)**: Combined therapy may increase CHD risk when initiated in older women or more than 10 years after menopause; risk is lower when started in younger women or within 10 years of menopause [^114WrBok] [^111VeXUA].

---

## Cancer risks

- **Breast cancer**: Combined estrogen–progestin therapy increases breast cancer risk with long-term use; risk rises with duration and declines after stopping; estrogen-alone therapy has a lower and delayed risk [^112KStrp] [^115fTnoy].

- **Endometrial cancer**: Estrogen-alone therapy increases endometrial cancer risk in women with a uterus; adding a progestogen mitigates this risk [^1123aAk6].

- **Ovarian cancer**: Long-term estrogen–progestin therapy may slightly increase ovarian cancer risk, though evidence is mixed and absolute risk remains low [^113H6oR3] [^117NYBbf].

---

## Common side effects

- **Irregular vaginal bleeding**: Common with combined therapy, especially in the first months; persistent bleeding warrants evaluation [^115vZyd6].

- **Breast tenderness**: Frequently reported with systemic estrogen.

- **Mood changes**: Some women report mood alterations, including anxiety or depression.

- **Fluid retention**: Mild peripheral edema can occur.

- **Nausea**: Gastrointestinal upset may occur with oral formulations.

---

## Individualized risk assessment

Risk is shaped by **age and time since menopause**; initiating therapy under age 60 or within 10 years of menopause yields a more favorable benefit–risk profile, whereas starting later or more than 10 years after menopause increases cardiovascular and other risks [^114WrBok] [^114fevBe]. Baseline cardiovascular and breast cancer risks should be assessed and incorporated into counseling and regimen selection [^114n5RkR] [^112gaeGy]. Transdermal estrogen and micronized progesterone are preferred in women at higher VTE or cardiovascular risk [^1178U8Q1].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Lowest effective dose**: Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals [^111sdCaC].

- **Regular monitoring**: Reassess risks and benefits at least annually; adjust or discontinue therapy as needed [^114UWJ1K].

- **Shared decision-making**: Discuss individual risks, benefits, and preferences with patients [^114dwtC8].

---

HRT effectively treats menopausal symptoms but carries **individualized risks**; careful selection of regimen, dose, and duration — with regular monitoring — optimizes benefits and minimizes harms [^114fevBe].

Guideline scope and shared decision-making for menopausal symptom therapy: This guideline covers the full spectrum of therapies for relief of the most common and bothersome menopausal symptoms, while the detailed management of early menopause transition, primary ovarian insufficiency, and prevention of osteoporosis and fracture are considered beyond the current scope. Choice of therapy is ideally based on available evidence regarding safety and efficacy and is generally a shared decision including both patient and provider, and the treatment selected should be tailored to the individual patient and will vary according to each woman's symptom severity, age, medical profile, personal preference, and estimated benefit/risk ratio. An accepted philosophy is that a fully informed patient should be empowered to make a decision that best balances individual QOL benefits against potential health risks.

### Assessing benefits and harms of hormone replacement therapy: clinical applications [^113U5vbf]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

An estimated one third of postmenopausal women in the United States use hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to treat symptoms of menopause and prevent chronic conditions. In the context of this widespread use, evidence has been growing about the potential harms of HRT, particularly regarding long-term use. Physicians and patients are often confused about how to use results of studies in individual cases. This article applies the current state of evidence for the benefits and harms of HRT to management decisions in 4 clinical situations. Patient preferences, as well as evidence, are important for these decisions. Benefits and harms need to be readdressed periodically to apply newly published evidence and to reassess emerging risks, comorbidities, and needs of individuals.

Introduction

Despite recent improvements in sex and gender research in cardiovascular disease (CVD), disparities still exist. Ischemic heart disease (IHD) in particular remains a leading cause of death in women. The reasons for this are multifactorial and include biological, social, environmental, and economic factors. While men and women share many traditional risk factors for CVD, these alone do not explain the sex-specific increased risk of CVD in women. Additional female-specific risk factors, most notably menopause, contribute significantly. Menopause has been associated with an increased CVD risk in women aged ⩾55 years. The transition to menopause has shown to be associated with negative alterations in the lipid profile, increased susceptibility to weight gain and metabolic syndrome, and both epicardial and paracardial fat deposition. – It represents a vulnerable time for women and an opportunity for consideration of menopause hormone therapy (MHT).

In prior decades, MHT was thought to be effective in primary and secondary prevention of CVD. However, large trials demonstrating the risks of MHT have changed clinician and public perception of these strategies. As our understanding of MHT has evolved, so has our knowledge regarding the appropriate timing and patient characteristics for safe administration. Given the efficacy of MHT in reducing the unpleasant vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause, which can severely alter quality of life, understanding the safety and potential cardiovascular (CV) risks and benefits of MHT is important in optimizing the health of our female patients.

### Current perspectives on benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy [^1123uSfv]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Hormone replacement therapy with estrogen alone or with added progestin relieves menopausal symptoms and physical changes associated with depleted endogenous estrogen levels. Estrogen replacement has also demonstrated a clear benefit in the prevention of osteoporosis. Hormone replacement therapy with added progestin maintains spinal bone density, protects against postmenopausal hip fractures, and provides these benefits even when therapy is started after age 60. More recently, additional benefits have emerged. Current estrogen and hormone replacement therapy users have a 34% reduction in the risk of colorectal cancer and a 20% to 60% reduction in the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Until recently, the body of evidence indicated that hormone replacement therapy with estrogen only reduced cardiovascular disease risk by 40% to 50% in healthy patients; whether the findings of 3 ongoing trials will change this conclusion is pending availability of the final results. The many benefits of estrogen and hormone replacement therapy must be weighed against a slight increase in the risk of breast cancer diagnosis with use for 5 or more years, but which disappears following cessation of therapy. Overall, estrogen and hormone replacement therapy improves the quality of life and increases life expectancy for most menopausal women.

### Menopausal hormone therapy for breast cancer patients: what is the current evidence? [^114gS8rC]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

Importance and Objectives

Many breast cancer survivors struggle with menopausal symptoms due to oncological treatment-induced hormone deficiency, or because they experience menopause some years after completing treatment, but have limited menopause treatment options. Estrogen replacement therapy is the most effective treatment for menopausal symptoms, but is not recommended after breast cancer because it can﻿ increase the risk of relapse. Our objectives were to review the evidence and develop a consensus statement to define the role of menopausal hormone therapy after breast cancer, and to highlight evidence gaps to inform future research.

Methods

A 25-member multidisciplinary panel developed the consensus statements using a modified Delphi methodology. The panel consisted of 18 senior doctors who voted (5 GP menopause specialists, 5 gynecologists, 4 medical oncologists, 3 breast surgical oncologists, and 1 breast radiologist), and 7 members﻿ who did not vote ﻿(4 patient representatives, 1 medical oncologist, 1 urologist and 1 administrator). Consensus was defined as ≥ 70% agreement with low-to-moderate variation in extent of agreement (mean absolute deviation from median of ≤ 0.75). We reviewed current evidence relating to use of vaginal and systemic menopausal hormone therapy ("MHT",﻿ also known as "hormone therapy", "HT" or "hormone replacement therapy", "HRT") after breast cancer diagnosis, and adjuvant endocrine (anti-estrogen) therapy, and developed a narrative synthesis. Finally, four additional breast cancer specialists peer-reviewed the manuscript.

Discussion and Conclusions

The panel agreed that some women may choose to take MHT, (off-label use) and accept an increased risk of relapse in exchange for relief from menopausal symptoms and an improved quality of life, and that preferences may vary according to individual circumstances and the absolute risk of relapse. All respondents agreed or strongly agreed with statements supporting shared decision making and individualized menopause care (MADM 0.29). In our review of the literature, we found mainly moderate quality evidence concerning use of vaginal and systemic estrogen after breast cancer, and high quality evidence concerning the benefits of anti-estrogen therapy for estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. Based on the available data, we recommend that shared decisions are based on (1) an individual's menopausal symptoms and impact on quality of life, (2) the potential increase in an individual's risk of relapse by use of menopausal hormone therapy, and (3) patient preferences, views and treatment goals. Clinicians and patients can use our findings to make informed menopause treatment choices after breast cancer. We strongly recommend registering all patients considering MHT after breast cancer in a clinical study (eg, MENopausal hormone therapy and Outcomes After Breast Cancer, the MENO-ABC trial).

### Update on menopause hormone therapy; current indications and unanswered questions [^114pVtrs]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide clinicians involved in managing menopause with a summary of current evidence surrounding menopause hormone therapy (MHT).

Design

The authors evaluate and synthesize existing pooled evidence relating to MHT's clinical indications, efficacy, and safety and explore the limitations of existing data.

Patients

The review focuses on MHT-related outcomes in women with natural-timed menopause captured within observational studies, RCTs, and pooled data from pivotal meta-analyses and reviews.

Measurements

Available published data are scrutinized. Available evidence and notably lacking data from women not adequately represented in published MHT trials, such as those with socioeconomic adversity, significant comorbidities, and minority ethnic backgrounds, are highlighted and deliberated.

Results

The impact of MHT differs significantly between demographics. Current consensus recommendations for MHT emphasize the importance of tailoring type, route, dose, and duration of therapy to individual needs and risk/benefit ratio through shared decision-making. MHT impact can change over time. Current MHT data support its benefits for treating menopause symptoms and a potential window of opportunity in midlife to benefit skeletal health. Limitations of current evidence highlight menopause health inequalities and underscores the need for further research.

Conclusions

This review recommends tailored use of MHT for well-defined indications, recognizing its value for menopause symptom relief and skeletal benefits for many midlife women. MHT may be used as long as benefits outweigh risks, through shared decision-making. There is insufficient clinical evidence to support the long-term use of MHT in some contemporary cohorts of women accessing MHT in clinical practice.

### The 2012 hormone therapy position statement of: the North American Menopause Society [^114YryjJ]. Menopause (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

This position statement aimed to update the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in 2010 regarding recommendations for hormone therapy (HT) for postmenopausal women. This updated position statement further distinguishes the emerging differences in the therapeutic benefit-risk ratio between estrogen therapy (ET) and combined estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT) at various ages and time intervals since menopause onset.

Methods

An Advisory Panel of expert clinicians and researchers in the field of women's health was enlisted to review the 2010 NAMS position statement, evaluate new evidence, and reach consensus on recommendations. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees as an official NAMS position statement.

Results

Current evidence supports the use of HT for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women when the balance of potential benefits and risks is favorable for the individual woman. This position statement reviews the effects of ET and EPT on many aspects of women's health and recognizes the greater safety profile associated with ET.

Conclusions

Recent data support the initiation of HT around the time of menopause to treat menopause-related symptoms and to prevent osteoporosis in women at high risk of fracture. The more favorable benefit-risk ratio for ET allows more flexibility in extending the duration of use compared with EPT, where the earlier appearance of increased breast cancer risk precludes a recommendation for use beyond 3 to 5 years.

### Treatment of menopausal symptoms: what shall we do now? [^113woa1M]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

During the past few years, many women and doctors have revised their opinions of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopausal symptoms, and a substantial number of individuals have discontinued its use because of concerns about side-effects. Numerous alternatives to HRT are promoted, and assessment of the quality of evidence about the safety and effectiveness of these compounds can be difficult. In this Review, we summarise the data from studies addressing the efficacy, risks, and benefits of frequently prescribed treatments, and offer evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of menopausal symptoms. Although few comparative studies exist, oestrogen alone or combinations of oestrogen and progestagen are likely to be the most effective treatments for menopausal hot flushes and vaginal dryness. Tibolone is as effective as HRT, however, and might also improve libido. For those who wish to avoid hormonal treatments, there are few effective options. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors might be effective in the very short term (less than 12 weeks) and are well tolerated. There is not enough evidence that any of the complementary therapies available are any better than placebo for menopausal vasomotor symptoms, and few safety data exist.

### Counseling in menopausal women: how to address the benefits and risks of menopause hormone therapy. A FIGO position paper [^116yTPVn]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Menopause marks the end of menstrual cyclicity and, depending on individual vulnerability, has several consequences related to gonadal steroid deprivation, especially if it is premature. Menopause may be more burdensome for some women than for others. Individual factors, such as personal history, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and current health conditions, affect symptomatology and, thereby, the menopausal experience. In addition, some menopausal symptoms, such as severe hot flashes, sleep disorders, and depression, are markers of future health risks. Counseling is a fundamental part of health care in the peri- and postmenopause periods. It must include an assessment of the patient's symptoms, needs, desires, and risk profile to address the benefits and risks of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) on an individual basis and promote a healthy lifestyle. Indeed, healthcare practitioners can and must protect the health and lives of mid-life women by increasing awareness of menopausal symptoms and ensuring healthcare options, especially MHT. The type and duration of MHT should be tailored based on the patient's history, menopausal age, physical characteristics, and current health status so that the benefits always outweigh the risks. This FIGO position paper focuses on the benefits and risks of MHT on health domains, target organs, and systems, and on systemic and vaginal MHT regimens, to provide indications that can be used in the clinical practice for menopausal counseling. Moreover, it offers insights into what FIGO considers the mainstay for the healthcare management of women in peri- and postmenopause, worldwide.

### Benefits and harms associated with hormone replacement therapy: clinical decision analysis [^113MLo51]. BMJ (2004). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To evaluate harms and benefits associated with use of combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for five years in women with different baseline risks for breast cancer.

Design

Probabilistic clinical decision analysis.

Setting

Hypothetical population of white UK women aged 50 years with different baseline risks for breast cancer.

Main Outcome Measure

Gain or loss in quality adjusted life years (QALYs).

Results

Women free of menopausal symptoms showed a net harm from HRT use, which increased for increasing baseline risk of breast cancer. Those with a baseline risk of 1.2% would expect a loss in QALYs of 0.4 months (- 0.03 QALYs, 95% credibility interval - 0.05 to - 0.01). The main analysis showed HRT to be on average beneficial in women with symptoms, with benefit decreasing with increasing baseline risk of breast cancer. The results were sensitive to the assumed value of quality of life with menopausal symptoms, therefore a contour plot was developed to show the probability of net harm for a range of different values and baseline risks.

Conclusions

HRT for primary prevention of chronic diseases in women without menopausal symptoms is unjustified. Perceived quality of life in women with symptoms should be taken into account when deciding on HRT. Thus, a decision analysis tailored to an individual woman is more appropriate in clinical practice than a population based approach.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American college of endocrinology position statement on menopause-2017 update [^1178U8Q1]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)/American College of Endocrinology (ACE) Position Statement is designed to update the previous menopause clinical practice guidelines published in 2011 but does not replace them. The current document reviews new clinical trials published since then as well as new information regarding possible risks and benefits of therapies available for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. AACE reinforces the recommendations made in its previous guidelines and provides additional recommendations on the basis of new data. A summary regarding this position statement is listed below: New information available from randomized clinical trials and epidemiologic studies reported after 2011 was critically reviewed. No previous recommendations from the 2011 menopause clinical practice guidelines have been reversed or changed. Newer information enhances AACE's guidance for the use of hormone therapy in different subsets of women. Newer information helps to support the use of various types of estrogens, selective estrogen-receptor modulators (SERMs), and progesterone, as well as the route of delivery. Newer information supports the previous recommendation against the use of bioidentical hormones. The use of nonhormonal therapies for the symptomatic relief of menopausal symptoms is supported. Newer information enhances AACE's guidance for the use of hormone therapy in different subsets of women. Newer information helps to support the use of various types of estrogens, SERMs, and progesterone, as well as the route of delivery. Newer information supports the previous recommendation against the use of bioidentical hormones. The use of nonhormonal therapies for the symptomatic relief of menopausal symptoms is supported. New recommendations in this position statement include: 1.

Recommendation

the use of menopausal hormone therapy in symptomatic postmenopausal women should be based on consideration of all risk factors for cardiovascular disease, age, and time from menopause. 2.

Recommendation

the use of transdermal as compared with oral estrogen preparations may be considered less likely to produce thrombotic risk and perhaps the risk of stroke and coronary artery disease. 3.

Recommendation

when the use of progesterone is necessary, micronized progesterone is considered the safer alternative. 4.

Recommendation

in symptomatic menopausal women who are at significant risk from the use of hormone replacement therapy, the use of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and possibly other nonhormonal agents may offer significant symptom relief. 5.

Recommendation

AACE does not recommend use of bioidentical hormone therapy. 6.

Recommendation

AACE fully supports the recommendations of the Comité de l'Évolution des Pratiques en Oncologie regarding the management of menopause in women with breast cancer. 7.

Recommendation

HRT is not recommended for the prevention of diabetes. 8.

Recommendation

In women with previously diagnosed diabetes, the use of HRT should be individualized, taking in to account age, metabolic, and cardiovascular risk factors.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114UWJ1K]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Duration of menopausal hormone therapy — We suggest that the decision to continue MHT be revisited at least annually, targeting the shortest total duration of MHT consistent with the treatment goals and evolving risk assessment of the individual woman. Technical remarks note that current proposed limits on duration are informed by large intervention trials (5 to 7 y) with extended follow-up for 13 years, that risk rates for breast cancer and CVD increase with age and time since menopause with risks appearing less with ET than with EPT, and that ovarian cancer risk may also increase relative to duration of MHT. The guideline concludes that clinicians and patients should reassess MHT continuation yearly and discuss the risks and individual benefits beyond 5 years.

### Hormone therapy: evolving concepts [^116C75ea]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the medical literature published in 2002 regarding menopausal hormone therapy and its impact on clinical practice.

Methods

A literature search was performed using MEDLINE with the keywords of menopause, sex steroids, and hormone replacement therapy. Randomized clinical trials were reviewed. An evidence-based review is presented.

Results

Menopausal hormone therapy has undergone radical change since the publication of the Women's Health Initiative randomized prospective trial of combined estrogen plus progestin therapy for disease prevention. After a mean of 5.2 years of follow-up, the E + P versus placebo trial of 16,608 women was stopped because the health risks of taking E + P exceeded the benefits. An increase in breast cancer risk, coupled with an adverse trend in overall risk-benefit ratio, reached the preset stopping boundaries. In addition, there was an increased risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and pulmonary embolism. The decreased risks seen for osteoporotic fracture and colorectal cancer were outweighed by the above risks. The FDA has required mandatory label changes for all hormone products based on these findings. The Women's Health Initiative found that treatment with estrogen plus progestin for up to 5 years is not beneficial overall. There is early harm for coronary heart disease, continuing harm for stroke and venous thromboembolism, and increasing harm for breast cancer. This risk-benefit profile is not consistent with a viable intervention for primary prevention of chronic diseases in postmenopausal women. Menopausal hormone therapy should be reserved for women with moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms.

Conclusions

In the past 20 years, menopause has become a household word, with much better understanding of its consequences. The growing numbers of menopausal women and clinical trials have coincided to draw increasing attention to the perimenopausal and menopausal years. Better studies of older therapies and the expanded number of new choices today, with more in development and evaluation, have complicated provider and patient choices but greatly improved the potential for effective intervention.

### Role of hormone therapy in the management of menopause [^114ExMCw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

There are many options available to address the quality of life and health concerns of menopausal women. The principal indication for hormone therapy (HT) is the treatment of vasomotor symptoms, and benefits generally outweigh risks for healthy women with bothersome symptoms who elect HT at the time of menopause. Although HT increases the risk of coronary heart disease, recent analyses confirm that this increased risk occurs principally in older women and those a number of years beyond menopause. These findings do not support a role for HT in the prevention of heart disease but provide reassurance regarding the safety of use for hot flushes and night sweats in otherwise healthy women at the menopausal transition. An increased risk of breast cancer with extended use is another reason short-term treatment is advised. Hormone therapy prevents and treats osteoporosis but is rarely used solely for this indication. If only vaginal symptoms are present, low-dose local estrogen therapy is preferred. Contraindications to HT use include breast or endometrial cancer, cardiovascular disease, thromboembolic disorders, and active liver disease. Alternatives to HT should be advised for women with or at increased risk for these disorders. The lowest effective estrogen dose should be provided for the shortest duration necessary because risks increase with increasing age, time since menopause, and duration of use. Women must be informed of the potential benefits and risks of all therapeutic options, and care should be individualized, based on a woman's medical history, needs, and preferences.

### Recent concerns surrounding HRT [^112PKmfE]. Clinical Endocrinology (2003). Low credibility.

Millions of women are treated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for relief of menopausal symptoms, including vasomotor flushes and sweats for which oestrogen is uniquely and highly effective. Others may continue longer-term treatment in the hope that HRT will help to prevent chronic disease. The preservation of bone mass with continuing oestrogen therapy and reduction of subsequent risk of fracture is well established. Observational studies of the metabolic and vascular effects of oestrogens have suggested a potential benefit in reducing the risk of vascular disease, but recently published randomized controlled trials demonstrate no evidence of benefit in women with established vascular disease or in apparently healthy women. The increased risks of breast cancer and thromboembolic disease have been confirmed in these trials, with evidence of increased risk of stroke. Observational data suggest there may be a small increased risk of ovarian cancer associated with longer-term use of HRT. The premature termination of one arm of the Women's Health Initiative randomized controlled trial caused concern among patients, doctors and pharmaceutical companies. There are difficulties in extrapolating the results from trials using a specific HRT product to advise women on the wide range of other hormone products, doses, combinations and routes of administration. However, in the absence of evidence that other products are safer, the data suggest that for many women the risks associated with long-term use of HRT outweigh the benefits. There are nonhormonal strategies for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. HRT is not, and has never been, licensed in the UK for the prevention or treatment of vascular disease, and the data suggesting potential benefit should now be regarded as biased. The absolute incidence of an adverse event is low, and the risk in an individual woman in a single year is very small, but the risks are cumulative over time with long-term use. The risk-benefit balance of each woman needs regular reappraisal with continued use.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111ioqqJ]. Menopause (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

"The 2022 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society" (NAMS) updates "The 2017 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society" and identifies future research needs. An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health and menopause was recruited by NAMS to review the 2017 Position Statement, evaluate new literature, assess the evidence, and reach consensus on recommendations, using the level of evidence to identify the strength of recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The Advisory Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. Hormone therapy remains the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and the genitourinary syndrome of menopause and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture. The risks of hormone therapy differ depending on type, dose, duration of use, route of administration, timing of initiation, and whether a progestogen is used. Treatment should be individualized using the best available evidence to maximize benefits and minimize risks, with periodic reevaluation of the benefits and risks of continuing therapy. For women aged younger than 60 years or who are within 10 years of menopause onset and have no contraindications, the benefit-risk ratio is favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS and prevention of bone loss. For women who initiate hormone therapy more than 10 years from menopause onset or who are aged older than 60 years, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable because of the greater absolute risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and dementia. Longer durations of therapy should be for documented indications such as persistent VMS, with shared decision-making and periodic reevaluation. For bothersome genitourinary syndrome of menopause symptoms not relieved with over-the-counter therapies in women without indications for use of systemic hormone therapy, low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy or other therapies (eg, vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone or oral ospemifene) are recommended.

### Rethinking menopausal hormone therapy: for whom, what, when, and how long? [^116rfD6e]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (HT) was widely used in the past, but with the publication of seminal primary and secondary prevention trials that reported an excess cardiovascular risk with combined estrogen-progestin, HT use declined significantly. However, over the past 20 years, much has been learned about the relationship between the timing of HT use with respect to age and time since menopause, HT route of administration, and cardiovascular disease risk. Four leading medical societies recommend HT for the treatment of menopausal women with bothersome menopausal symptoms. In this context, this review, led by the American College of Cardiology Cardiolovascular Disease in Women Committee, along with leading gynecologists, women's health internists, and endocrinologists, aims to provide guidance on HT use, including the selection of patients and HT formulation with a focus on caring for symptomatic women with cardiovascular disease risk.

### Cardiovascular risk in menopausal women and our evolving understanding of menopausal hormone therapy: risks, benefits, and current guidelines for use [^116DhHJr]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Women are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with men. While traditional risk factors for CVD seem to disproportionately affect women and contribute to this disparity, increased prevalence of CVD at midlife calls into question the contribution of menopause. Given the potential role that declining hormone levels play in this transition, menopause hormone therapies (MHT) have been proposed as a strategy for risk factor reduction. Unfortunately, trials have not consistently shown cardiovascular benefit with use, and several describe significant risks. Notably, the timing of hormone administration seems to play a role in its relative risks and benefits. At present, MHT is not recommended for primary or secondary prevention of CVD. For women who may benefit from the associated vasomotor, genitourinary, and/or bone health properties of MHT, CVD risks should be taken into account prior to administration. Further research is needed to assess routes, dosing, and formulations of MHT in order to elucidate appropriate timing for administration. Here, we aim to review both traditional and sex-specific risk factors contributing to increased CVD risk in women with a focus on menopause, understand cardiovascular effects of MHT through a review of several landmark clinical trials, summarize guidelines for appropriate MHT use, and discuss a comprehensive strategy for reducing CV risk in women.

### Hormone therapy in menopause: concepts, controversies, and approach to treatment [^111VeXUA]. Endocrine Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Hormone therapy (HT) is an effective treatment for menopausal symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms and genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Randomized trials also demonstrate positive effects on bone health, and age-stratified analyses indicate more favorable effects on coronary heart disease and all-cause mortality in younger women (close proximity to menopause) than in women more than a decade past menopause. In the absence of contraindications or other major comorbidities, recently menopausal women with moderate or severe symptoms are appropriate candidates for HT. The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) hormone therapy trials-estrogen and progestin trial and the estrogen-alone trial-clarified the benefits and risks of HT, including how the results differed by age. A key lesson from the WHI trials, which was unfortunately lost in the posttrial cacophony, was that the risk:benefit ratio and safety profile of HT differed markedly by clinical characteristics of the participants, especially age, time since menopause, and comorbidity status. In the present review of the WHI and other recent HT trials, we aim to provide readers with an improved understanding of the importance of the timing of HT initiation, type and route of administration, and of patient-specific considerations that should be weighed when prescribing HT.

### Estrogen and progestogen use in postmenopausal women: 2010 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^116zFqH3]. Menopause (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To update for both clinicians and the lay public the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in July 2008 regarding its recommendations for menopausal hormone therapy (HT) for postmenopausal women, with consideration for the therapeutic benefit-risk ratio at various times through menopause and beyond.

Methods

An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health was enlisted to review the July 2008 NAMS position statement, evaluate new evidence through an evidence-based analysis, and reach consensus on recommendations. The Panel' s recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees as an official NAMS position statement. Also participating in the review process were other interested organizations who then endorsed the document.

Results

Current evidence supports a consensus regarding the role of HT in postmenopausal women, when potential therapeutic benefits and risks around the time of menopause are considered. This paper lists all these areas along with explanatory comments. Areas that vary from the 2008 position statement are noted. A suggested reading list of key references published since the last statement is also provided.

Conclusions

Recent data support the initiation of HT around the time of menopause to treat menopause-related symptoms; to treat or reduce the risk of certain disorders, such as osteoporosis or fractures in select postmenopausal women; or both. The benefit-risk ratio for menopausal HT is favorable for women who initiate HT close to menopause but decreases in older women and with time since menopause in previously untreated women.

### The 2017 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111yvUiD]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

The 2017 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) updates the 2012 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society and identifies future research needs. An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health and menopause was recruited by NAMS to review the 2012 Position Statement, evaluate new literature, assess the evidence, and reach consensus on recommendations, using the level of evidence to identify the strength of recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. Hormone therapy (HT) remains the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture. The risks of HT differ depending on type, dose, duration of use, route of administration, timing of initiation, and whether a progestogen is used. Treatment should be individualized to identify the most appropriate HT type, dose, formulation, route of administration, and duration of use, using the best available evidence to maximize benefits and minimize risks, with periodic reevaluation of the benefits and risks of continuing or discontinuing HT. For women aged younger than 60 years or who are within 10 years of menopause onset and have no contraindications, the benefit-risk ratio is most favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS and for those at elevated risk for bone loss or fracture. For women who initiate HT more than 10 or 20 years from menopause onset or are aged 60 years or older, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable because of the greater absolute risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and dementia. Longer durations of therapy should be for documented indications such as persistent VMS or bone loss, with shared decision making and periodic reevaluation. For bothersome GSM symptoms not relieved with over-the-counter therapies and without indications for use of systemic HT, low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy or other therapies are recommended.

### What the women's health initiative has taught us about menopausal hormone therapy [^111pvX15]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the complex relationship between menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk has been informed by detailed analyses in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), the largest randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating MHT in postmenopausal women. Although the WHI demonstrated increased risk of CVD events with MHT in the overall cohort, subsequent secondary analyses demonstrated that these risks were influenced by the woman's age and time since menopause, with lower absolute risks and hazard ratios for younger than older women. As MHT is the most effective treatment for the vasomotor symptoms of menopause, it is important to understand its risks and how to conduct risk stratification for symptomatic women. In addition to reviewing the WHI findings, studies pre- and post-WHI are reviewed to describe the relationship between MHT and CVD risk in menopausal women. The absolute risks of adverse cardiovascular events for MHT initiated in women close to menopause are low, and all-cause mortality effects are neutral or even favorable for younger menopausal women. The WHI has advanced and refined our understanding of the relationship between MHT and CVD risk. Although MHT should not be used for CVD prevention, absolute risks of CVD are low when MHT is started close to menopause in healthy women and hazard ratios tend to be lower for younger than older women. For women in early menopause and without contraindications to treatment, the benefits of MHT are likely to outweigh the risks when used for menopausal symptom management.

### Estrogen and progestogen use in postmenopausal women: July 2008 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^112H6TEs]. Menopause (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To update for both clinicians and the lay public the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in March 2007 regarding its recommendations for menopausal hormone therapy (HT) for postmenopausal women, with consideration for the therapeutic benefit-risk ratio at various times through menopause and beyond.

Design

An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health was enlisted to review the March 2007 NAMS position statement, evaluate new evidence through an evidence-based analysis, and reach consensus on recommendations. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees as an official NAMS position statement. The document was provided to other interested organizations to seek their endorsement.

Results

Current evidence supports a consensus regarding the role of HT in postmenopausal women, when potential therapeutic benefits and risks around the time of menopause are considered. This paper lists all these areas along with explanatory comments. Conclusions that vary from the 2007 position statement are highlighted. Addenda include a discussion of risk concepts, a new component not included in the 2007 paper, and a recommended list of areas for future HT research. A suggested reading list of key references is also provided.

Conclusions

Recent data support the initiation of HT around the time of menopause to treat menopause-related symptoms; to treat or reduce the risk of certain disorders, such as osteoporosis or fractures in select postmenopausal women; or both. The benefit-risk ratio for menopausal HT is favorable close to menopause but decreases with aging and with time since menopause in previously untreated women.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115TEqN9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — treatment of menopausal symptoms states that menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms and other symptoms of the climacteric, and that benefits clearly exceed risks for the majority of symptomatic postmenopausal women who are under age 60 or under 10 years since the onset of menopause. Health care professionals should individualize therapy based on clinical factors and patient preference, and they should screen women before initiating MHT for cardiovascular and breast cancer risk and recommend the most appropriate therapy depending on risk/benefit considerations. Current evidence does not justify the use of MHT to prevent coronary heart disease, breast cancer, or dementia. For those with vasomotor symptoms who prefer not to use MHT or who have contraindications — because these patients should not use MHT — other options are available; for the genitourinary syndrome of menopause, low-dose vaginal estrogen and ospemifene provide effective therapy, and vaginal moisturizers and lubricants are available for those not choosing hormonal therapy. All postmenopausal women should embrace appropriate lifestyle measures.

### Update in hormone therapy use in menopause [^116EhNVU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

The original report from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) changed our understanding of the benefits and risks of hormone therapy. Since that time, reanalysis of the WHI and additional data from other studies have further refined these concepts. Here we provide an update on recent advances in the field. Menopausal hormone therapy continues to have a clinical role in the management of vasomotor symptoms. However, our understanding of the role of hormones in cardiovascular disease and breast cancer continues to evolve. Further analyses of the effect of age and proximity to menopause at the time of initiation of therapy, duration of treatment, dose, route of administration, and the persistence of risks and benefits after stopping hormone therapy are described. In addition, recent data have emerged suggesting that there may be a link between hormone therapy and cancers of the lung and ovary. Finally, we discuss new advances in hormone therapy that will likely lead to a more favorable benefit-to-risk ratio, enabling safer effective menopausal symptom relief.

### Hormone replacement therapy: current controversies [^113XrSU9]. Clinical Endocrinology (2003). Low credibility.

Postmenopausal hormonal therapy is used to manage the climacteric symptoms that impair the quality of life of a substantial number of women. The difficulty is achieving the desired effects with minimal side-effects and no adverse health risks. Fundamental to this is understanding the physiology of oestrogen in women and the metabolism of the therapeutic compounds. Although the effects of oral oestrogen therapy have been studied extensively, there is insufficient evidence to assess adequately the independent effects of progestin use, other oestrogen compounds, differing doses and duration of treatment. We have reviewed some basic concepts of oestrogen physiology and how these relate to exogenous oestrogen administration, the risks of greatest concern, and the role of androgens and newer treatment alternatives.

Menopausal hormone therapy — key points: The safety profile of hormone therapy is most favorable when initiated in healthy women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, so initiation of hormone therapy by menopausal women aged older than 60 years requires careful consideration of individual benefits and risks. [Level I] Long-term use of hormone therapy, including for women aged older than 60 years, may be considered in healthy women at low risk of CVD and breast cancer with persistent VMS or at elevated risk of fracture for whom other therapies are not appropriate. (Level III) Factors that should be considered include severity of symptoms, effectiveness of alternative nonhormone interventions, and underlying risk for osteoporosis, CHD, cerebrovascular accident, VTE, and breast cancer. (Level III) Hormone therapy does not need to be routinely discontinued in women aged older than 60 or 65 years. (Level III)

### Hormone replacement therapy and the risk of breast cancer [^115fTnoy]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2011). Medium credibility.

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is given to relieve the climacteric symptoms of menopause. Use of HRT reduced after a report from the Women's Health Initiative linked it to an increased risk of breast cancer. This association has been confirmed in several other studies, including the Million Women Study. The risk of breast cancer is greater for formulations that contain both estrogen and progesterone, compared with estrogen alone. The breast cancer risk associated with HRT is higher for estrogen receptor-positive cancers than for estrogen receptor-negative cancers, and for low-grade cancers compared with high-grade cancers. After cessation of HRT the increased risk of breast cancer dissipates within 2 years. The rapidity of the decline suggests that a proportion of breast cancers that are hormone dependent will regress if the hormonal stimulation is removed. In evaluating a woman who is considering HRT, factors that have been associated with an increased risk include the initiation of hormone use immediately after menopause, a lean body mass and high mammographic breast density.

### Approach to the patient with menopausal symptoms [^112bnvcu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Many women experience menopausal symptoms during the menopausal transition and postmenopausal years. Hot flashes, the most common symptom, typically resolve after several years, but for 15–20% of women, they interfere with quality of life. For these women, estrogen therapy, the most effective treatment for hot flashes, should be considered. The decision to use hormone therapy involves balancing the potential benefits of hormone therapy against its potential risks. Accumulating data suggest that initiation of estrogen many years after menopause is associated with excess coronary risk, whereas initiation soon after menopause is not. Therefore, most now agree that short-term estrogen therapy, using the lowest effective estrogen dose, is a reasonable option for recently menopausal women with moderate to severe symptoms who are in good cardiovascular health. Short-term therapy is considered to be not more than 4–5 yr because symptoms diminish after several years, whereas the risk of breast cancer increases with longer duration of hormone therapy. A minority of women may need long-term therapy for severe, persistent vasomotor symptoms after stopping hormone therapy. However, these women should first undergo trials of nonhormonal options such as gabapentin, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, returning to estrogen only if these alternatives are ineffective or cause significant side effects. Low-dose vaginal estrogens are highly effective for genitourinary atrophy symptoms, with minimal systemic absorption and endometrial effects.

### Menopausal hormone therapy: current considerations [^114KkBWo]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the most effective treatment for vasomotor and vaginal symptoms. Today, symptomatic women younger than 60 years of age or less than 10 years since onset of menopause yield the greatest benefit of MHT with the lowest risks when compared with older women remote from menopause. Careful assessment before initiating therapy includes severity of bothersome symptoms, treatment preferences, medical history, presence of contraindications to MHT, and personal risk of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer. Considerations of type of MHT, dosing, and route of administration, and recommendations regarding duration of therapy are discussed.

### Oestrogen replacement in postmenopausal women [^1116A9rU]. Age and Ageing (2015). Low credibility.

Menopausal symptoms can disrupt a woman's personal and social life. Vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes and night sweats) are the most common symptoms and can be treated very effectively with oestrogen-based hormone therapy. The decision to use oestrogen (often simply termed hormone therapy or hormone replacement therapy or HT) therapy involves balancing the potential benefits against the potential risks. Most agree that short-term oestrogen therapy, using the lowest effective dose, is a reasonable option for recently menopausal women with moderate-to-severe symptoms who are in good cardiovascular health (Martin and Manson. 2008. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 93, 4567–75). Whilst effective and safe in most instances, HT is not suitable for all women or for all menopause-related symptoms when alternatives are available. The role of HRT in chronic disease prevention is also discussed.

### A contemporary view of menopausal hormone therapy [^114rkKyM]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Enthusiasm for the use of hormones to ameliorate symptoms of perimenopause and menopause has waxed and waned over the years. Both treatment for symptoms and training of women's health care practitioners in the management of menopause have sharply declined since publication of the Women's Health Initiative initial results in 2002. Findings from that trial, which treated a population of older, asymptomatic patients, have been extrapolated over the past 21 years to all estrogen products, all menopausal women, and all delivery mechanisms. Our patients deserve a more nuanced, individualized approach. Conjugated equine estrogens and medroxyprogesterone acetate are no longer the predominant medications or medications of choice available for management of menopausal symptoms. All hormones are not equivalent any more than all antiseizure medications or all antihypertensives are equivalent; they have different pharmacodynamics, duration of action, and affinity for receptors, among other things, all of which translate to different risks and benefits. Consideration of treatment with the right formulation, at the right dose and time, and for the right patient will allow us to recommend safe, effective, and appropriate treatment for people with menopausal symptoms.

### A comparative review of the risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy regimens [^112rh8Ne]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

The Women's Health Initiative (a large, randomized, placebo-controlled trial) investigated the effect of conjugated equine estrogens combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate on specific potential long-term benefits and risks. A review of the clinical studies that have investigated different types and regimens of estrogens combined with progestins was conducted to assess how applicable the results of the Women's Health Initiative are to hormone replacement therapy regimens in general. The studies that were reviewed were limited to randomized clinical trials and observational studies that have been published over the last 15 years (1987–2002) and to meta-analyses and reviews that may have included the literature before 1987. The increased risks for venous thromboembolism, stroke, coronary heart disease, and breast cancer that were identified in the Women's Health Initiative trial have also been reported with postmenopausal hormone therapies that contain a variety of estrogen and progestin products. The beneficial effects that were noted in the Women's Health Initiative, with respect to reductions in fractures and colorectal cancer, have not been evaluated in large, randomized controlled trials that use different estrogen/progestin combinations; however, observational trials that used a variety of estrogen or hormone replacement therapy products and randomized clinical studies that evaluated bone mineral density (an excellent predictor of fracture risk) with different estrogen/hormone replacement therapy regimens would suggest that results would be similar to those found in the Women's Health Initiative. Although the relief of menopausal symptoms, the primary reason women seek treatment, was not included in the overall benefit/risk analysis of the Women's Health Initiative, numerous trials suggest that all therapies are effective. Overall, these data indicate that the benefit/risk analysis that was reported in the Women's Health Initiative can be generalized to all postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy products.

### A decade after the women's health initiative – the experts do agree [^1146ThMd]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Menopause hormone therapy — overview and symptom relief benefits emphasize that systemic hormone therapy is an acceptable option for relatively young (up to age 59 or within 10 years of menopause) and healthy women who are bothered by moderate to severe menopausal symptoms, and that individualization is key with consideration of quality-of-life priorities and risk factors including age, time since menopause, and risks of blood clots, heart disease, stroke, and breast cancer. Systemic hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for most menopausal symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms and vaginal atrophy; estrogen therapy as a single agent is sufficient in women who have undergone hysterectomy, whereas progestogen therapy is required to prevent endometrial cancer when estrogen is used systemically in women with a uterus. For symptoms limited to vaginal dryness or discomfort with intercourse, local estrogen therapy is effective and preferred, and low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy is recommended in this setting.

Menopause, vasomotor symptoms, and hormone therapy — stroke and cardiovascular disease risk are outlined as follows: Premature menopause (onset before 40 years of age) and early menopause (before 45 years of age) are described, and reproductive life span if < 30 years has been identified as a potential risk factor for stroke. More than 50% of women experience frequent vasomotor symptoms during the menopausal period, and severe and frequent symptoms are associated with an increased risk of CVD, although whether vasomotor symptoms are independently associated with the risk of stroke is uncertain. Estrogen-based therapies are the most effective treatments for moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms; however, HT, particularly oral HT, has been associated with risk of CVD in multiple RCTs and meta-analyses, and topical estrogen treatments are not associated with stroke risk. Approximately 5% of women experience a natural menopause before 45 years of age.

Benefits of MHT and current guidelines

MHT is effective in reducing vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause, promoting bone health, and, in many cases, improving quality of life. A Cochrane review including 24 randomized controlled trials studying MHT administration for vasomotor symptoms demonstrated a reduction in weekly hot flashes by 75% and an 87% decrease in severity of hot flashes, demonstrating it to be an effective therapy for this difficult-to-manage symptom of menopause, which on its own is associated with increased risk of CVD. MHT is currently approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms, prevention of osteoporosis, and as estrogen replacement in the setting of surgical menopause, hypogonadism, or premature ovarian insufficiency. Options for MHT include conjugated equine or synthetic estrogens, micronized 17β-estradiol, or ethinyl estradiol. Progestogens are indicated for endometrial protection in patients with a uterus, and include MPA, norethindrone acetate, and progesterone. Additionally, bazedoxifene, a SERM, can be combined with CE to form a tissue-selective estrogen complex, providing endometrial protection without the use of a progestogen.

### ACOG committee opinion. risk of breast cancer with estrogen-progestin replacement therapy [^114km4ep]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2002). Low credibility.

Recent articles have examined the association between the use of combination estrogen-progestin regimens for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and the risk of breast cancer. The objective of this Committee Opinion is to evaluate critically the presented evidence. Although epidemiologic studies suggest that the addition of progestins to estrogens may increase the risk of breast cancer, this increased risk has not been proved. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists continues to recommend that HRT be considered as a treatment to relieve vasomotor symptoms and genitourinary tract atrophy and to reduce the risk of osteoporosis and, potentially, cardiovascular disease. Postmenopausal women should be apprised of the current understanding of the risks and benefits of HRT. When considering the use of HRT for longer than 5 years, the clinician and individual patient should weigh the benefits versus the potential side effects and risks for that particular patient.

Menopausal hormone therapy and cardiovascular disease — key points: For healthy symptomatic women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, the favorable effects of hormone therapy on coronary heart disease (CHD) and all-cause mortality should be considered against potential rare increases in risks of breast cancer, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and stroke (Level I), and hormone therapy is not government approved for primary or secondary cardioprotection (Level I). Personal and familial risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, VTE, and breast cancer should be considered when initiating hormone therapy (Level III). The effects of hormone therapy on CHD may vary depending on when hormone therapy is initiated in relation to a woman's age or time since menopause onset (Level I). Women who initiate hormone therapy aged older than 60 years or more than 10 or 20 years from menopause onset are at higher absolute risks of CHD, VTE, and stroke than women initiating hormone therapy in early menopause (Level I).

### Is it time to revisit the recommendations for initiation of menopausal hormone therapy? [^113Vxb4F]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Findings from the Women's Health Initiative studies led to menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) guidelines generally recommending the initiation of MHT be limited to women within 10 years of their menopause or before the age of 60 years. This recommendation has led to women who experience troublesome menopausal symptoms and who have not commenced MHT within these limits often being denied this type of therapy. Similarly, the majority of women who might benefit from the protective effects of MHT against bone loss and fracture are not offered this treatment option if they do not fit with these criteria. Based on review of the evidence that led to the conditional initiation of MHT, and subsequent studies, we propose that the recommendations regarding the initiation of MHT need to change to be more inclusive of women outside these chronological limits.

### NAMS 3rd utian translational science symposium, October 2016, Orlando, Florida A conversation about hormone therapy: is there an appropriate dose, route, and duration of use? [^115cYaqB]. Menopause (2017). Low credibility.

The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) held the 3rd Utian Translational Symposium on October 4, 2016, in Orlando, Florida, to answer questions about the benefits and risks of hormone therapy (HT) for postmenopausal women. This report is a record of the proceedings of that symposium. The maxim about HT for the past 15 years since the publication of the initial results of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) has been to prescribe the "lowest dose for the shortest period of time". With new clinical trials, observational data, and further analysis of the WHI and the cumulative 13 years' follow-up, it was time to hold a conversation about the state of the evidence and recommendations for HT dose, route, and duration of use. The symposium brought together experts in the field of HT to speak on these topics, organized by session, after which working groups gathered to synthesize the presentations into areas of what still needs to be known and how to proceed with areas of needed research. After the presentations, there was consensus that postmenopausal women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset without contraindications and who desire to take HT for relief of vasomotor symptoms or prevention of bone loss if at elevated risk can safely do so. The working groups raised the possibility that the use of "Big Data" (pharmacy and cancer databases) would allow answers that cannot be found in clinical trials. This could lead to more appropriate FDA labeling and patient package inserts reflecting the true risks associated with various types and formulations of HT, with differences among estrogen alone, estrogen with a progestogen, and estrogen plus a selective estrogen-receptor modulator for the younger women most likely to initiate these therapies for symptom relief. Differences were found for potential risk among estrogen alone, estrogen with synthetic progestins contrasted to progesterone, lower doses, nonoral doses, and low-dose vaginal estrogen. With all of the available routes and dosages, including vaginal estrogen alone for genitourinary symptoms, there are many options when considering the most appropriate type, dose, formulation, route of administration, and duration of use, taking into account the age of the woman at initiation of HT and the time from menopause.

### Decision analysis of hormone replacement therapy after the women's health initiative [^113Y9yVg]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to estimate the quality-adjusted life expectancy with and without hormone replacement therapy.

Study Design

We compared the quality-adjusted life expectancy with and without combination hormone replacement therapy in three cohorts of women with menopausal symptoms over a 20-year period using a Markov decision-analysis model. Women were either at high or low risk for breast cancer and coronary heart disease or at high risk for osteoporosis.

Results

Hormone replacement therapy decreases life expectancy slightly compared with no hormone replacement therapy if menopausal symptoms are not considered. However, if relief from menopausal symptoms is considered and the usefulness of life with symptoms is worth < 0.996 compared with life without symptoms, then 5 years of hormone replacement therapy provides equivalent quality-adjusted life-years.

Conclusion

Combination hormone replacement therapy decreases life expectancy if quality of life with menopausal symptoms is not considered. However, the benefit of hormone replacement therapy can exceed the risk for women with menopausal symptoms.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^114fevBe]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

North American Menopause Society (NAMS) 2022 hormone therapy position statement — Hormone therapy remains the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and the genitourinary syndrome of menopause and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture; risks differ by type, dose, duration of use, route of administration, timing of initiation, and whether a progestogen is used, and treatment should be individualized with periodic reevaluation. For women aged younger than 60 years or who are within 10 years of menopause onset and have no contraindications, the benefit-risk ratio is favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS and prevention of bone loss, whereas for women who initiate hormone therapy more than 10 years from menopause onset or who are aged older than 60 years, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable because of greater absolute risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and dementia; longer duration of therapy should be for documented indications such as persistent VMS, with shared decision-making and periodic reevaluation. For bothersome genitourinary syndrome of menopause symptoms not relieved with over-the-counter therapies in women without indications for use of systemic hormone therapy, low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy or other therapies (eg, vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone or oral ospemifene) are recommended.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^1157hBxF]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

NAMS position statement — risk mitigation, monitoring, and continuation of hormone therapy in older women emphasizes that mitigation of risk through use of the lowest effective dose and potentially with a nonoral route of administration becomes increasingly important as women age and with longer duration of therapy, and that longer durations or extended use beyond age 65 should include periodic reevaluation of comorbidities with consideration of periodic trials of lowering or discontinuing hormone therapy. In the absence of contraindications, a woman should determine her preferred hormone therapy formulation, dose, and duration of use, with ongoing assessment and shared decision-making with her healthcare professional, and it remains an individual decision in select, well-counseled women aged older than 60 or 65 years to continue therapy, with no data to support routine discontinuation in women aged 65 years. For women with GSM, low-dose vaginal ET may be considered for use at any age and for extended duration, if needed.

### Menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: a population-based cohort study of 1.3 million women in Norway [^111B5N6i]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

There is convincing evidence that use of menopausal hormone therapy (HT) — both combined oestrogen-progestin therapy (EPT) and unopposed oestrogen therapy (ET) — increases the risk of breast cancer (BC) with increased risk of BC observed even 10 years after cessation. In the wake of this evidence, in 2020 the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee of the European Medicines Agency updated its recommendations for product characteristics with a reinforced warning that the use of both ET and EPT increase the risk of BC.

When reaching menopause, most women experience menopausal symptoms, which may impair their quality of life. In a study with participants from US, Canada, and Europe, 72% reported hot flushes, 41% fatigue, 10% pain during urination, and 30% reported that the impact of menopause was worse than expected. Other studies have shown that ~12% of women will continue to experience vasomotor symptoms 11–12 years after the last menstrual period. Despite these figures, due to the accumulating knowledge on the health risks associated with the use of HT, prescribing it has become more restrictive.

The risk of BC associated with the use of ET and EPT is well documented, but it is also associated with other adverse health outcomes, such as blood clots and stroke. Still, menopausal HT remains an important medication for mitigating menopausal symptoms, with the added benefit of improving bone health. There have been substantial efforts to develop new preparations with lower risk. With a high number of women in need of treatment for severe menopausal symptoms, detailed contemporary studies are needed to help women and clinicians to choose the best treatment strategy.

In this large population-based cohort study, we provide a detailed picture of the risk of BC according to type of HT, route of administration and individual drugs used. We present results by molecular subtypes, detection mode (i.e. screen-detected and symptomatic cancer), stage at diagnosis, and body mass index (BMI). We also report dose–response analyses for the duration of use and time since the last use.

### Management of menopausal symptoms in patients with breast cancer: an evidence-based approach [^116x2sb9]. The Lancet: Oncology (2005). Medium credibility.

Increasing numbers of women have menopausal symptoms after treatment for breast cancer. These symptoms can result directly from cancer treatments (such as oophorectomy, ovarian suppression, chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure, and antioestrogens), as a spontaneous event, or after discontinuation of hormone-replacement therapy. The onset of menopausal symptoms after treatment for breast cancer can have a long-lasting effect on quality of life, body image, sexual function, and self esteem. Hormone-replacement therapy that contains oestrogen is the most effective treatment for menopausal symptoms in healthy women. However, evidence from one randomised controlled trial suggests that use of hormone replacement therapy after breast cancer raises the risk of recurrence and of new primary breast cancer. As the incidence of breast cancer increases and survival continues to improve, the number of women with menopausal symptoms will probably rise. Safe and effective non-hormonal treatments for severe menopausal symptoms after breast cancer are urgently needed. Few studies have addressed the management of menopausal symptoms after breast cancer, and the quality of studies is generally poor. Progestagens, and selective inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake seem to offer reasonable symptom palliation, but the long-term effectiveness and safety of these preparations is not known. We propose that the management of menopausal symptoms in patients with a history of cancer requires a patient-centred, but multidisciplinary, approach.

### Menopausal hormone therapy use among postmenopausal women [^116aiXXj]. JAMA Health Forum (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Annually, more than 1.3 million women in the US transition into menopause. Menopausal transition is associated with profound hormonal changes, which can be symptomatic in 80% of women, and these symptoms, including vasomotor, genitourinary, sleep difficulties, and cognition, can be severe in about 30% of women. Vasomotor symptoms, which are episodes of profuse heat accompanied by sweating and flushing, cause anxiety and sleep disruption and tend to be the most lifestyle-limiting symptom in many women.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the treatment of choice for menopausal symptoms and is the most effective treatment for vasomotor and genitourinary syndrome of menopause. During peak use in the late 1990s, prescriptions for MHT rose rapidly in the US, fueled by observational studies showing a protective effect on coronary heart diseases and cardiovascular deaths. MHT use, however, declined rapidly in 2002 after the Women's Health Initiative trial showed that the health risks associated with MHT outweighed the benefits. Recent studies highlighting nuances in the risks of MHT with suggestions that the absolute risks of adverse events depend on several factors, including age at initiation and timing in relation to menopause, MHT type, dosage, duration, and route of administration, have led to several national societies putting out guidelines on MHT prescribing.

In 2022, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended against the use of MHT for primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women, while the North American Menopause Society recommended tailoring MHT in treating menopausal symptoms to each individual need. The US Preventive Services Task Force also highlighted research gaps, including the need to understand the comparative benefits and harms of different MHT formulations and age at initiation. A gap in the current conversation on MHT use is an understanding of recent trends in, and prevalence of, MHT use. To our knowledge, the most recent study on MHT prevalence using a nationally representative sample was based on self-reported data up to 2010; hence, there are no recent MHT use data captured by prescriptions to understand contemporary patterns in the US.

The goal of this cross-sectional study is to comprehensively describe the most recent trends in, and current prevalence and correlates of, MHT use, taking into consideration MHT formulations, among postmenopausal women in the US. Study findings will provide data that can help guide national discussions and policy on MHT use.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112DM7K1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) — evidence on age and timing and use of risk tools: Results showing fewer excess CHD and stroke events when MHT was initiated in younger rather than older study participants in the WHI provide the foundation for the widely accepted consensus that MHT should be initiated primarily in younger women (age < 60 y) close in time (< 10 y) to menopause onset. We feel that methods to integrate these factors to categorize individual risk as minimal, moderate, and high are useful and can be accomplished qualitatively by clinical judgment or quantitatively by risk assessment tools, and country- and population-specific CVD risk calculators are available to quantify individual risk per local guidelines; however, specific cutoffs for the safe use of MHT have not been formally validated, and practice differs from country to country.

### Lessons learned from the women's health initiative trials of menopausal hormone therapy [^111kJRoE]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

We re-evaluate the Women's Health Initiative findings and their implications for clinical practice. Menopausal hormone therapy (HT) was effective for relief of vasomotor symptoms, and the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) tended to be reduced in women close to menopause compared with the increased risk in women more distant from menopause. In recently menopausal women, short-term absolute risks of stroke and venous thromboembolism were small. Estrogen plus progestin therapy, but not estrogen therapy, increased the risk of breast cancer with a suggestion of greater risk when initiated close to the menopause. Menopausal HT increased the risk of CHD in women more than 20 years distant from menopause, particularly in women with vasomotor symptoms. It remains unknown whether the suggestive benefit for CHD in younger women will translate into benefits or harms if menopausal HT is continued into older ages. Based on Women's Health Initiative data, the use of menopausal HT for fewer than 5 years is a reasonable option for the relief of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms. The risks seen with estrogen plus progestin therapy suggest careful periodic reassessment of the ongoing therapy needs for women taking estrogen plus progestin therapy. The more favorable profile of estrogen therapy allows for individualized management with respect to duration of use when symptoms persist. For both estrogen therapy and estrogen plus progestin therapy, the baseline risk profile of the individual woman needs to be taken into account. Menopausal HT is not suitable for long-term prevention of CHD given risks of stroke, venous thromboembolism, and breast cancer (for estrogen plus progestin therapy) found in both clinical trials and in observational studies.

Hormone therapy duration — dose and time — emphasizes that the lowest dose of hormone therapy should be used for the shortest amount of time to manage menopausal symptoms; although fewer than 5 years is recommended for estrogen with progestogen therapy, duration should be individualized; for estrogen therapy alone, more flexibility in duration of therapy may be possible, but there are reports of increased risk of breast cancer after 10 to 15 years of use in large observational studies with estrogen alone.

A meta-analysis of 52 observational studies showed an increase of 0.52 cases/1000 in women starting MHT at age 50 and continuing therapy for 5 years, with risk persisting 5 years after stopping MHT at 0.37 cases/1000 when ages 55 to 59. Overall WHI estimates for EPT showed HR, 1.41 and in cumulative follow-up HR, 1.24, and adequately powered RCTs are needed to ascertain risk.

### Estrogens and breast cancer [^111zbUzT]. Annals of Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Estrogen and progesterone are principal hormones in a woman's life. Before menopause, women are exposed to regularly varying levels of endogenous estrogens and progesterone released during repeated menstrual cycles and potentially to more sustained levels of these hormones during pregnancy. Reproductive-age women may be further exposed to these hormones via oral contraceptives, composed of a progestin with or without an estrogen, and other forms of hormonal contraception. Near or after menopause, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) — estrogen alone or combined with a progestin — may be offered to mitigate menopausal symptoms arising from precipitous declines in endogenous estrogen production and to reduce the risk of bone fractures. – Women with prior use of oral contraceptive pills show a significantly reduced risk of ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer. Despite the intended medical effects and additional health benefits, these hormonal agents, especially estrogens, remain a lingering concern for breast cancer risk. –

In this review, we have aimed to comprehensively evaluate the association between estrogens and breast cancer. Given the expansive scope of scientific investigations pertaining to this topic, we focus on findings from randomized clinical trials (RCTs), prospective cohort studies, and meta-analyses with rigor and a large sample size, as well as preclinical mechanistic studies. To be inclusive on the topic with depth, we examined vast evidence, via extensive search on PubMed, from clinical and basic experimental studies, which include hormonal contraceptives, HRT, estrogen-elevating fertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), reproductive factors, steroid hormone synthesis and metabolism, breast cancer therapies, basic experimental studies, and animal research. Ultimately, we have sought to connect the dots by critically assessing and cohesively integrating wide-ranging, oft-incongruent findings into the conclusions based on the totality of current evidence.

### Estrogens and breast cancer [^11751s9S]. Annals of Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

There is a long-held notion that estrogen exposure will increase the risk for breast cancer. Conversely, a body of emerging clinical and basic research evidence suggests that progestogens (synthetic or endogenous progesterone) are most likely the primary hormonal factor underlying seemingly estrogen-associated breast cancer risk. Progestogens appear to be the principal hormone driving the development and recurrence of breast cancer, while estrogens may contribute to breast cancer risk by amplifying progesterone signaling.

It has been well recognized that HRT provides an array of health benefits — including alleviation of menopausal symptoms, mood improvement, weight control, and prevention of bone fractures. There are, however, risks that need to be weighed for HRT use. Estrogen-alone HRT may increase endometrial cancer risk in postmenopausal women with an intact uterus, while estrogen-plus-progestin therapy could increase breast cancer risk in these women. Therefore, the risks and benefits of HRT should be carefully assessed for individual women. If a woman with an average risk for breast cancer and an intact uterus, for instance, experiences significant menopausal symptoms, she may opt for estrogen, combined with minimal use of micronized progesterone or progestin–IUD to counter potential endometrial hyperplasia. If she is more concerned about breast cancer risk than endometrial cancer risk, she may choose estrogen alone at a lower dose and regularly monitor endometrial growth. In postmenopausal women seeking HRT after a hysterectomy alone or in combination with an oophorectomy, estrogen alone would relieve menopausal symptoms with minimal cancer risks.

Overall, current scientific evidence suggests that estrogen therapy, coupled with minimal use of a progestogen, is likely to offer net health benefits in women in need of HRT.

North American Menopause Society 2022 hormone therapy — primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) defines permanent menopause as menopause before age 40 years and early menopause as menopause between the ages of 40 and 45 years; POI describes loss of ovarian function before age 40 years with potential intermittent, transient return of hormone production and menstrual cycles. Women with early or premature loss of ovarian function are at increased risk for adverse events related to ovarian hormone deficiency, and evidence links early loss to decreased quality of life and increased risks of fracture, CVD, dementia, diabetes mellitus, and overall mortality, with additional issues including persistent VMS, loss of fertility, bone loss, genitourinary symptoms, sexual dysfunction, cognitive and mood changes, ophthalmic conditions, and depression; some risks may reflect premature aging, as evidenced by shortened telomere length in some studies.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^114dh9sV]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy — extended use after age 65 years: There is no general rule for stopping systemic hormone therapy in a woman aged 65 years, and although the Beers criteria warns against hormone therapy in women aged older than 65 years, the recommendation to routinely discontinue systemic hormone therapy in women aged 65 years and older is neither cited or supported by evidence nor is it recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists or The North American Menopause Society. For otherwise healthy women with persistent vasomotor symptoms (VMS), continuing hormone therapy beyond age 65 years is a reasonable option with appropriate counseling, regular assessment of risks and benefits, and shared decision-making, and hormone therapy also may be considered for prevention of fracture in healthy older women at elevated fracture risk when bothersome VMS persist or when hormone therapy remains the best choice because of lack of efficacy or intolerance of other fracture-prevention therapies; however, long-duration hormone therapy use and use in older women is not appropriate for reduction in the risk of CHD or dementia, and mitigation strategies include switching from oral to transdermal hormone therapy, choice of progestogen, and lowering of dose.

Clinical management during menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) — For women with persistent unscheduled bleeding while taking MHT, we recommend evaluation to rule out pelvic pathology, most importantly, endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, and we recommend informing women about the possible increased risk of breast cancer during and after discontinuing EPT while emphasizing adherence to age-appropriate breast cancer screening. Regular clinical follow-up, initially, within 1 to 3 months after starting MHT, and then every 6 to 12 months, allows monitoring of efficacy and side effects and treatment adjustments as needed.

### Ovarian cancer and menopausal hormone therapy in the NIH-AARP diet and health study [^11456SfS]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy is the most effective treatment available for vasomotor symptoms associated with oestrogen deficiency during the menopausal transition. Current guidelines recommend use of the lowest effective dose of menopausal hormone therapy for the shortest possible duration. Chronic disease associations with short duration, low dose use have not been thoroughly evaluated. When risks are resolved they will need to be weighed in relation to a number of benefits.

In conclusion, our results suggest that long duration use of both unopposed estrogens and oestrogen plus progestins are associated with increased risks of ovarian cancer, and that risk associated with oestrogen plus progestin use does not vary by regimen (sequential or continuous). Although there has been previous uncertainty regarding whether oestrogen plus progestin hormone therapy has a substantial impact on ovarian cancer risk, there appears to be growing evidence that long-term oestrogen plus progestin confers increased risk. Larger studies are still needed to evaluate ovarian cancer risk with short-duration oestrogen plus progestin use according to different regimens, as well as evaluate effect modification with known risk factors of ovarian cancer (e.g. oral contraception use, smoking, BMI, parity, etc.).

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^115SF8aJ]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Duration of use, initiation after age 60 years, and discontinuation — benefits of hormone therapy generally outweigh risks for healthy women with bothersome symptoms who are aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, but because increasing risk is observed with advancing age and extended duration of use, women are advised to use the appropriate dose for the time needed to manage symptoms. Because many women will experience bothersome vasomotor symptoms (VMS) for many years, long-duration hormone therapy may be needed and an arbitrary age-based stopping rule is not clinically appropriate; frequent VMS persist on average 7.4 years and for many more than 10 years. In a study of Swedish women aged older than 85 years, 16% reported hot flashes at least several times per week, and up to 8% of women continue to have hot flashes for 20 years or longer after menopause.

### Estradiol and progesterone [^113H6oR3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

A meta-analysis of 17 prospective and 35 retrospective epidemiology studies found that women who used hormonal therapy for menopausal symptoms had an increased risk for ovarian cancer. The primary analysis, using case-control comparisons, included 12,110 cancer cases from the 17 prospective studies. The relative risks associated with current use of hormonal therapy was 1.41 (95% CI, 1.32 to 1.50); there was no difference in the risk estimates by duration of the exposure (less than 5 years [median of 3 years] vs. greater than 5 years [median of 10 years] of use before the cancer diagnosis). The relative risk associated with combined current and recent use (discontinued use within 5 years before cancer diagnosis) was 1.37 (95% CI, 1.27 to 1.48), and the elevated risk was significant for both estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin products. The exact duration of hormone therapy use associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, however, is unknown.

### Counseling patients about hormone therapy and alternatives for menopausal symptoms [^113oFmpR]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

The results of recent large clinical trials have led physicians and patients to question the safety of menopausal hormone therapy. In the past, physicians prescribed hormone therapy in an attempt to improve overall health and prevent cardiac disease. Hormone therapy appears to increase the risk of breast cancer when used for more than three to five years; therefore, regulatory agencies now advise that physicians prescribe it only to treat menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal atrophy, with the smallest effective dosage and for the shortest possible duration. Although estrogen is the most effective treatment for hot flashes, alternatives such as venlafaxine and gabapentin are effective for some patients. Herbal formulations such as dong quai, ginseng, kava, and dietary soy, among others, do not appear to benefit patients more than placebo. In contrast to systemic estrogen therapy, topical estrogen therapy for vulvovaginal atrophy is more appealing for certain patients because it does not require the addition of a progestogen for endometrial protection. Some have advocated selective estrogen reuptake modulators as alternatives to hormone therapy for the prevention of menopausal osteoporosis. The decision to use either therapy depends on clinical presentation and a thorough evaluation of the risks and benefits, because both have potential detrimental health effects and both are linked to an increased risk of venous thromboembolism.

### Committee opinion: number 262, December 2001. risk of breast cancer with estrogen-progestin replacement therapy [^113GuvNb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Recent articles have examined the association between the use of combination estrogen-progestin regimens for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and the risk of breast cancer. The objective of this Committee Opinion is to evaluate critically the presented evidence. Although epidemiologic studies suggest that the addition of progestin to estrogens may increase the risk of breast cancer, this increased risk has not been proved. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists continues to recommend that HRT be considered as a treatment to relieve vasomotor symptoms and genitourinary tract atrophy and to reduce the risks and benefits of HRT. When considering the use of HRT for longer than 5 years, the clinician and individual patient should weigh the benefits versus the potential side effects and risks for that particular patient.

### Hormone-replacement therapy: current thinking [^111ZZbUb]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2017). Medium credibility.

For several decades, the role of hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) has been debated. Early observational data on HRT showed many benefits, including a reduction in coronary heart disease (CHD) and mortality. More recently, randomized trials, including the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), studying mostly women many years after the the onset of menopause, showed no such benefit and, indeed, an increased risk of CHD and breast cancer, which led to an abrupt decrease in the use of HRT. Subsequent reanalyzes of data from the WHI with age stratification, newer randomized and observational data and several meta-analyses now consistently show reductions in CHD and mortality when HRT is initiated soon after menopause. HRT also significantly decreases the incidence of various symptoms of menopause and the risk of osteoporotic fractures, and improves quality of life. In younger healthy women (aged 50–60 years), the risk-benefit balance is positive for using HRT, with risks considered rare. As no validated primary prevention strategies are available for younger women (< 60 years of age), other than lifestyle management, some consideration might be given to HRT as a prevention strategy as treatment can reduce CHD and all-cause mortality. Although HRT should be primarily oestrogen-based, no particular HRT regimen can be advocated.

### Estrogen and progestogen use in peri-and postmenopausal women: March 2007 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^114i3Dza]. Menopause (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in 2004 regarding recommendations for estrogen and progestogen use in peri- and postmenopausal women.

Design

NAMS followed the general principles established for evidence-based guidelines to create this updated document. An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health was enlisted to review the 2004 NAMS position statement, compile supporting statements, and reach consensus on recommendations. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. The position statements published by NAMS do not represent "practice standards" that would be codified and held up as standards by regulating bodies and insurance agencies. Rather, they are prevailing opinion pieces in a best effort attempt to incorporate current evidence into practical clinical recommendations.

Results

With the primary goal being to evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of peri- and postmenopausal estrogen therapy (ET) and estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT) for both disease prevention and treatment of menopause-related symptoms, current evidence allowed for a clear distinction between areas of consensus and areas for which the Panel determined that there was inadequate evidence for any conclusion to be reached. The document lists all of these areas along with clear explanatory comments. A comprehensive list of key references is provided. The absence of evidence is also recognized in the list of needs for further research recommended by the Panel.

Conclusions

Current evidence supports the use of ET or EPT for menopause-related symptoms and disease prevention in appropriate populations of peri- and postmenopausal women.

### A practical guide to the management of menopausal symptoms in breast cancer patients [^112XW6T4]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in Canadian women. As a result of increased screening and improved treatment, more women are becoming long-term breast cancer survivors. However, due to either their treatment or prolonged survival, many of these women now have to face the consequences of premature menopause and prolonged estrogen deprivation. Hormone replacement therapy/estrogen replacement therapy (HRT/ERT) has, in the past, been recommended to healthy women at menopause not only for relief of short-term menopausal changes, particularly hot flashes, but also for its benefits on bone density, fracture reduction, and genitourinary symptoms. Recent studies have demonstrated that not only is HRT associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer, but it also has been shown to increase the risk of recurrence in those with a breast cancer history. Until the safety of HRT/ERT in breast cancer patients can be more fully clarified, it would be wise to develop alternative strategies for the management of menopausal symptoms in these patients. This paper will discuss nonestrogen-based therapies for hot flashes, osteoporosis, and genitourinary symptoms, with emphasis on efficacy and safety in breast cancer survivors.

### Menopausal hormone therapy and cancer-NCI… [^1123aAk6]. NCI (2023). Medium credibility.

Findings of follow-up studies of WHI participants and other studies have shown that MHT is associated with both potential benefits and potential harms. Potential benefits of MHT include: relief of hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, and painful intercoursewith systemic and local estrogen or systemic estrogen plus progestin for as long as MHT is taken lower risk of hip and vertebral fractureswith systemic estrogen or estrogen plus progestin for as long as MHT is taken lower risk of breast cancerwith systemic estrogen lower risk of death from breast cancerwith systemic estrogen. Potential harms of systemic MHT include: increased risk of vaginal bleedingwith estrogen plus progestin that may require assessment by endometrial biopsy increased risk of urinary incontinencewith both estrogen alone and estrogen plus progestin.

increased risk of dementiawith both estrogen alone and estrogen plus progestin when taken by those 65 years or older increased risk of stroke, blood clots, and heart attackwith estrogen alone and estrogen plus progestin for as long as MHT is taken increased risk of endometrial cancer in people with an intact uteruswith estrogen alone increased risk of breast cancerwith prior use of estrogen plus progestin for at least a decade after use is discontinued increased breast densitywith estrogen plus progestin, making mammography less effective and also increasing breast cancer risk increased risk of death from lung cancerwith estrogen plus progestin. Importantly, MHT is not associated with an increased risk of death from all causes. Who should not take menopausal hormone therapy.

Women who have had breast cancer in the past are often advised to avoid MHT because some studies suggest that it may increase the risk of breast cancer recurrence. However, other studies have not shown an increased risk. For example, a Danish cohort study of postmenopausal women treated for early-stage breast cancer showed no increased risk of recurrence or mortality associated with the use of vaginal or systemic MHT.

### Understanding the risks and benefits of hormone therapy… [^1118bKyz]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Multiple physician groups and the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force recommend that physicians counsel postmenopausal patients about the individual risks and benefits of using hormone therapy. Currently, information about the risks and benefits of hormone therapy is incomplete. In addition, no current studies assess the attitudes, perceptions, and motivations of women faced with the choice of using hormone therapy. Women usually start hormone therapy to relieve menopausal symptoms. They continue or discontinue hormone therapy based on concerns about breast cancer, uterine and endometrial cancer, menstrual bleeding, and other side effects. Few nonusers understand that they have an increased risk of developing osteoporosis based on their estrogen deficiency. Scheid and colleagues examined the relationship between the use of hormone therapy and women's perceptions of the risks and benefits.

The participants were asked to estimate their lifetime probability of developing breast cancer, uterine cancer, or osteoporosis. They also were asked the same question concerning lifetime probability of myocardial infarction when taking or not taking hormone therapy. The questionnaire had a final section that collected information on the women's quality of life at their current health status and what it would be if they developed breast cancer, uterine cancer, osteoporosis, or myocardial infarction. The attitudes of women who used or did not use hormone therapy did not differ with regard to preventing menopausal symptoms, general health, body orientation, and locus of control. Women who were using hormone therapy perceived a greater reduction in the risk of developing osteoporosis and myocardial infarction than women who did not use hormone therapy.

Both groups estimated their lifetime probability of developing breast cancer, uterine cancer, osteoporosis, and myocardial infarction at inflated levels when compared with established probabilities. Women who did not use hormone therapy perceived a greater increase in the risk of developing breast or uterine cancer if they started hormone therapy, compared with the perceived risk among women who were already using hormone therapy. Women who used hormone therapy believed that they had a lower risk of developing osteoporosis and myocardial infarction because they were using hormone therapy. Quality-of-life measurements were similar in both groups except in regard to osteoporosis. The authors conclude that women overestimate the risk of the four diseases studied regardless of their current hormone therapy status.

Women who use hormone therapy believe these medications convey a greater reduction in risks for osteoporosis and myocardial infarction, with a smaller increase in the risk of developing breast and uterine cancers. Continuing efforts to assist women in understanding the risks and benefits of hormone therapy would be helpful.

### USPSTF: No HRT after menopause for chronic conditions… [^114JMJKB]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Nov. 10, 2022, 4: 14 p. m. News Staff — The U. S. Preventive Services Task Force is advising family physicians and other health care professionals to avoid administering hormone replacement therapy to patients for the primary prevention of chronic conditions after menopause. The task force's final recommendation statement, issued Nov. 1 and accompanied by a final evidence review and evidence summary, recommended against the use of combined estrogen and progestin to prevent chronic conditions in postmenopausal people and against the use of estrogen alone to prevent chronic conditions in postmenopausal people who have had a hysterectomy. Both recommendations received "D" grades, meaning that the task force concluded with moderate certainty that these treatments had no net benefit. Overall, the recommendation statement is consistent with the task force's 2017 recommendation on the topic.

"For people who have already gone through menopause, using hormone therapy is not an effective way to prevent chronic conditions because the potential harms cancel out any potential benefit, " said Carol Mangione, M. D. M. S. P. H., the task force's chair, in a USPSTF Bulletin. "Fortunately, the task force has many other evidence-based recommendations on ways people can stay healthy as they age". The recommendation statement does not apply to people who are considering HRT to manage perimenopausal symptoms such as vaginal dryness or hot flashes. It also does not apply to people who have had primary ovarian insufficiency or surgical menopause. Story Highlights "Importantly, this recommendation is.

The task force, after reviewing the available evidence, found that while taking HRT to prevent chronic conditions may result in some modest benefits such as reduced risk of fractures and diabetes, it may also lead to increased risk of severe harms such as stroke or thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, especially among women older than 60. The task force also emphasized that the findings pertained to people who use HRT specifically to prevent chronic conditions and not to those who use HRT for the management of menopausal symptoms, which requires different consideration and weighing of benefits and harms.
